Bleeding

Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine

Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave

Live, life

Dead for years, now alive
The dead came to life

Dead creatures out for blood
After death we will awaken
Unhuman beings from beyond
Rotting zombies out for blood

Bleed, bleed

Bleeding through my pores
Clotted pus, crusts my skin
My body cold
But I live on
Bleeding

The dead awaken, living rotten
Rotten living dead

Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine

Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave

Live, life - dead
