Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home, me home again

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

You saw life back in the countryside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, my soul rise up and go beyond, beyond
To what you know
