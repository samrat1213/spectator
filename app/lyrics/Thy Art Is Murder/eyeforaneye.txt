A mighty flame erupts to the sky
Raining down in ashes
An arctic surge swells to the sand
We mourn as heaven crashes
The child weeps now for the loss
Of his only brother
Entombed in a shell of ancient stone
Cold and smothered

Mother earth
Invoke the bones of all below
Return to the surface anew
To begin again

Drain the oceans, swallow the shores
Burn the forests to the floor
The ruin of man the earth endures
There will be nothing more

The rabid beast stalks the land, stole the body from the tomb
Raped the sin into the lamb, taste the fruit of thy womb
Now all is forsaken, all is undone
Consumed in the fire of the setting sun
The day shall come to pass as the dark of night falls
The light slips from our grasp, the plight of rapture calls
There's no escape from what we've done
The mother's redemption reclaim your sons

Drain the oceans, swallow the shores
Burn the forests to the floor
The ruin of man the earth endures
There will be nothing more

And so the beast was turned on by the stock
No longer the shepherd now hunted by the flock
Our blood shall nourish the fields in crimson
And rust Eden to dust

As we destroy ourselves in endless cycles
A patient killer awaits reprisal

Eye for an eye
Reprisal
Eye for an eye
Reprisal

Drain the oceans, swallow the shores
Burn the forests to the floor
The ruin of man the earth endures
There will be nothing more

Mother earth
Invoke the bones of all below
Return to the surface anew
To begin again

In the wind we fade away
In the tides sink and decay
All we were shall be replaced
All we've done shall be erased
Set free the fire in your heart
Mother earth, take us back to the start
