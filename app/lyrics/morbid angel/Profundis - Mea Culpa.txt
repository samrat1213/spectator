Profundis -- Mea Culpa Lyrics
Crimen Profundis
I will lead the way
Divinum formidilosus impetus
I will accept all of the blame

Mea culpa, mea mea culpa
Black will cover all and smother all
Black will never fail to bring terror for all
No traces of illumination sight without light
Under cruel reign of shadows
We will only have night
Eternal night

Illud divinum insane

Mea, mea, mea culpa for the terrors brought
We're the monsters caedo caedo
And our sounds are overwrought

Grieve right, live in fright, fright
Grieve right, live in fright, fright
Illud divinum insane

Mea, mea, mea culpa
For the terrors brought
We're the monsters caedo caedo
And our sounds are overwrought
Mea, mea, mea culpa for insanity
Twist the minds of all who hear
Our deadly sounds ever mode it be

Crimen profundis
I will lead the way
Novus lex legis profano
My sickness will lay claim

Mea culpa, mea, mea culpa
Terror's ease, unease and disease
We make the mass of charlatans
Fall down to their knees
They worship but can't follow us
What stars we must be!!!
Majesty
