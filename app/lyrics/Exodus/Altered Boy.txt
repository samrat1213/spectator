Unholy paedophile
Preying on the innocent
Protected by the papacy
So-called men of enlightenment
Children fingered by the hand of God
Raped in the name of Christ
They took a vow of chastity
Yet have torn asunder so many a life

Chickenhawks of the Catholic church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy

Men so benevolent
In a position of trust
Molesting children by the score
Rendering young life straight to the dust
They're curch is their Golgotha
Crucified by the priest
Child becomes the victim
Holy Father becomes the beast

Chickenhawks of the Catholic church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the preist of burden
And he's become an altered boy
Multi-million dollar payouts
Restitution for their crimes
This vile sickness
Cut so many down in their prime
All the bishops and the cardinals
Tried to hide it away
In the parish and cathedrals
The predators come to prey

Chickenhawks of the Catholic church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the preist of burden
And he's become an altered boy

Chickenhawks of the Catholic church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the preist of burden
And he's become an altered boyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
