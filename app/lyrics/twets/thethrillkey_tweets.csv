dutch oven heart
*goes swimming in the holes of your logic*
dream until you are senseless and then dream some more
some days i’m not sure if i’m living in your eyes or if earth is really that dynamic and green
forests are covens of tranquility and so we wander spellbound and bewitched
good morning; and other wishing well soliloquies
when the sky falls we can catch it together
"in lieu of flowers, send stardust"
a silk slip to taunt my naked body when you are not here
he pacifies me; like a verdent recollection like the music of rain like an aromatic daydream like a sacrament like a lavender bath like a page of poetry like an oath of soft infinity
"somewhere between the roar of a quasar and a tiny glass girl, i found myself"
careful with hearts because meat is tender
we bled dreams into galaxies and then twist and open our own
we can drink from waterfalls that taste of immortality
"it’s true most people are fucking awful, but you don’t have to be like them. you can be"
"a balcony, a blush toned satin slip, a caress as sunshine dusts my back and your shoulders, some short time after breakfast, we were lost to the outside world"
it’s morning — try to grab the sun before it’s too high
sunday worship; fucking like we need to define sin
no way outta here baby except the road no one walks (candor and authenticity)
carve a panic room inside your heart
searching for darkened interruption
"for 2022, ima be that bitch"
the baby blue sky and its chemtrails send out a message to you. not alone though. the soft air and the birds help translate.
loves and lovers; souls and soulmates
i’ve got thoughts and feelings and ideas just like any other wildflower
introduce me to your shrines
good morning; tell me about the birds that sit in your window
longing is a ballet that leaps into your heart and makes it beat deeper
mood: tumultuous and dreamy
RESOLUTIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR • love yourself • let yourself be loved • love others • judge no one
the people of this town recognize i am no longer one of them
we haven’t talked about late afternoon light in awhile; come here and i will braid your rib cage with some
plans: unlock a secret dimension by putting on my one-piece bathing suit
plans: repave the yellow brick road with cinder
plans: change my name and spoon feed the ocean winds to you
humans usually think yer crazy if something makes u incandescently happy and maybe what drives u and yer reason for all this is crazy but it is yours
"i’m your heart, spinning, mumbling about how sweet the air is"
so far but so close
how the sun finds you each morning
"a dream, a whisper, a backroad, a campfire, a shoreline"
he bit whole night sky onto my lunar pale skin
"coupe glass, sea glass, the tender glow of a quiet morning"
dawn dusted and arched like a solar flare
this patchwork daydream
he; gently rearranged my neural circuitry
he; calls me his goddess — his languid apocalypse
let’s travel around the sun together
"this quasar of ours, paralyzed in shades of green and blue"
"our love is a solstice, an endless song"
andromeda is calling
waiting for my oblivion
about to pluck a god from the sky
soft hibiscus search like an ibis exquisite bliss pretty pink lips
hot coffee for a hot thought
good morning; with a sun to preach about forever to
"between the world and the sky, we exist"
love will take you to insanity and cities
thoughts of golden hour and how we’ll stare
take your pulse with my tongue
time measured as the space between our heartbeats
such specialness and soon
i want to live on the edge of a branch
a woozy sway of stars to the rhythmic pulse of our hearts as they are flung and align and coalesce
crescendo of night and the gravity of chance
[ something incandescent ] [ him ]
"stars, sparkling and broken — we couldn’t see them in the skies over our homes so we twisted our love into its own constellation"
quasars stopped expanding to make room for the love i have to give to you
"we wander, hand in hand, through poems and poetry"
gentle kaleidoscopes of eternity
i keep you in boxes and in wishes
to leap profanely and boundlessly
commune with birds and unexpected moments
all i want for christmas is to disappear
love means coming face to face with parts of yourself you never thought would have futures
eyes of those of an intense dreamer
there is light inside my palms and a flock of song inside my head
a future of technicolor birds
drifting upon warm eddies of hope
a snow globe with a little doe in it
turn around and watch you supernova
and afterwards nothing is ever really the same again
falling in love is an unfolding of landscapes
and afterwards nothing is ever really the same again
falling in love is a cello song
and afterwards nothing is ever really the same again
falling in love is a calamitous warmth
and afterwards nothing is ever really the same again
falling in love is sweet obliteration
slow turning of morning
bathe me in the fragrant water of language then dress me in prose and adorn me with poetry
* offers you a cup of tea * the world burns so brightly
"* offers you a cup of tea * hearts rarely wake, but never sleep"
"* offers you a cup of tea * the trick is to dissolve, but gently"
can’t wait to take off your clothes and also the reasons you called yourself hard to love
i’m gonna knit you a blanket out of colors from a vespertine spiral okay
so we were created and we create — that’s our nature
inherent crookedness
evocative of place
good morning; i love the way you dream
dreams and reality converged and that’s why and how we met
howl everyday
THINGS I FOUND IN 2021 • houses are not homes • the voice of my heart • how tenderness can set ablaze a thousand flowers in a single moment • breath accumulates as does loss but both bring together a mosaic and myriad of new things
hope is a chrysalis that will not melt in afternoon sun
every piece of wood needs a companion to keep the fire burning
sonorous sunday morning with rays of sun strewn and slipping across the living room like the movements of silk sheets with lovers beneath
it’s midnight and there’s soft belonging on a lambent beach and salt’s warmth that cloaks our skin and serendipities like footprints on the shoreline behind us
used the past as kindling and let the quiet fire sing
good morning; i am grateful today for feeling deeply
the storm was fierce but they haven’t seen his goddess
every moment more exquisite than any last other
how evening jazz bewilders and how you kissed me the way candles melt
i am the most adorable waste of space
where the sun goes to warm us
we swore to love forever (if not longer)
bicycle wheels speak in circles like repeated truths
shredded cardiac nonsense
he is my deity and i will serve him faithfully
belief is my breath
these strange things happening around us
tell the ocean i’m sorry; i’ll be home soon
falling asleep picking strawberries and other sweet and long farewells
he; tore my chest open and emptied my dreams out and now i exist in an incandescent reality
"if you can work on your posture, you can work on anything (stop squishing your organs)"
i am the master of my own fate i am the captain of my own soul and i make up my own rules when it comes to commas
i have been through the dark celestial and i have heard the murmur of the universe tell me yes and i have howled with many galaxies and i can tell you anything is possible with love
happiness hangs over me like stars
i love this man —
wearing the sun on a chain around my delicate neck
good morning; some days the light seeps just that much deeper and reveals the limitless nature of every blessed moment
i fell in love with you the way you fall in love with clear night skies
everything happens all the time and never stops
dreams stored in bell jars
open windows &amp; the sky is a crypt for all my secrets
a swan song that became prologue
gardening in nothing but your old t-shirt
new slants for old stories
old items for new lovers
watched planes land in the fields of your thoughts
list of holy objects: • an infinite night in your arms • tears of farewell on our my soft cheek • the breath we shared in all our sacred places • a dream’s evolution to reality
his fingers traced my opal skin like a soft and living hymn
"myth, magic, magnolia"
rub your eyes until their color stains your skin and then you finger paint my portrait
we laugh often and we find beauty in the whisper of each morning
do you want to
please lodge your lens flare into my throat
that little bit of sorcery in the way you make my heart move
"yeah, sex is cool but"
how strange this carnival of being
he; the watermark on my soul
good morning; some doors don’t close so easily once they’re opened
sorry you watched me twist around happiness like a trumpet vine
sorry that’s turned my spinal cord into an exquisite river
sorry that everything i touch melts into me
sorry; your hot air balloon or mine?
"sorry it wasn’t like falling, but like flying"
sorry you don’t have much else to think about except your own loneliness
sorry about the terror and the ecstasy
sorry i hold these dreams to my chest like the warm porcelain of my coffee mug
our crazy love; a tautology
a gentle and late afternoon breeze that stirs the curtains to dance to the piano jazz that’s playing
a wildfire turns three today
what color of light streams out from your wounds
meet you among boulders and traffic lights and salt flats and wildflowers
love to log out of my primary reality and meet you in the secondaries
good morning; and how we dream in the same color scheme
embrace the whirlpool of your deepest desire
when the words are as beautiful as the reality of them
to nestle like a small bird in a palm of sky
a prey to all the passions which rule the hearts of men
you should see the futures i dream
you used spit to dampen the pigment of watercolor paints and that’s why i ask you to pacify me with your lips and not the words they make
how to condense your dreams into a single book then into a single page then into a single word
though each day i pray for a lambent return
i once found a place where beauty was real and the world was suffused with magic and i’m glad to have been there even if i couldn’t stay
"i’ve always been that little, gentle glow of a darkened cloud"
let all your senses have their say
sometimes wonder whether to start with one or the other
smoke from a campfire dream dancing across the caloosahatchee
so many rivers flow through the channels of my heart
i don’t know much about fishing but i know much about the sea
to build cocoons from the cushioned fog and hide forever
the new year comes with a bright light
f o l d
"such power is given to small things — wildflowers, raindrops, pebbles and stones, words inked on linen paper"
she; a prophet of spring
remember when i held a teal flame between my thumb and forefinger
do you cup a seashell to your ear with hope that the sound of distant ocean drowns sibilant sighs that echo with every gust of cold winter wind
and that is the order of operation
quasar — punctured — his
you make me happy when skies are grey or green or blue or anything
and a hymn that was the counterpoint of our wind chimes
lead me to where stones grow stories
cradle crescendos
seek melody
"hold hands, write fervently and love everything"
an amber lit room and piano that needs to be tuned
love is an action
the strange course of events of my life led me to live
quite suddenly the sun has cured everything
"what bewildered, carefree, laughing bliss"
"grains, growth, poems and pearls"
using rooftops to steady herself on her walk towards the sky
"marigold tea, a window, earth, moon and sun align for a partial eclipse, the soft glow of candlelight, steamy little earth, not a hint of chill yet, but the chill will come soon"
and will you forgive the moon
but will the moon forgive you
sawdust and citrus
falling in love with every possibility
my soul was cleansed (or filled?)
"a sky to send you to me, to no longer be contained by horizons or screens"
an autumn sunshine dripping from her hair
a cup of hot coffee and a tendency to leave at the quietest time of the day
foramina; and the wildflowers that take the place of veins
and so i cut these stems at an angle
it was fanciful and it was fate
"he broke into my body and left poems in the empty places. now, i must begin to read"
cashmere socks and you to keep me warm against midnight’s frost
like a book stitched shut i have forgotten so many words
more chaotic than forest wilderness
the small space between your clasped hands from a confessional
sometimes doing nothing is quite enough for one day
to plant a rose bush beneath an old gatepost and a kiss on your neck
how we scratched our names in sand and amongst the grains and shell
dance wild
and so i am lost again in a reverie of moonlit being
reminder: there is magic
he matches his poetry to my every mood
wanna lay in grass until my skin is an autumn leaf ready to be taken by the earth
gun smoke blues
"i want winter, but not inside the house"
today
sunbeams are soft scaffolding for future poetry
good morning; these nights — a bruise to the tongue
"reality on the dresser, studying and staring while we sleep"
something about the way you sigh in your sleep keeps the dawn from peeking over this or any horizon
downhill; maybe towards the sea
color so bright like the day sky
something only the morning would understand
"our private joke, retold over our private sunset"
you cupped your patient hands and held my soul
somewhere between a flawless and fond dream and tender little nightmare
the violent gravity of love
labyrinths are not catacombs
the soul glow of us
snow-spun roses and revelations
kiss me whilst the moon calls heavy soul enchantment to the waning fire
your hat; and five bottles you found in a forest
hyacinth grew outside the window; we held “i love you”s in our mouths
good morning; how are you?
little dream catcher of barbed wire
sea mist that clears with the tide
my mind flickers with polaroids and pictures
an ancient and fossilized heart song and the silence
there is an ache
curling up in a black hole
wear this storm cloud like a shawl
you forgot or you were afraid or was it just a dream and how do i know which was true
beneath a grassy knoll we buried a kaleidoscope of broken promises
"weather vane, storm drain, all the things that fall and fade"
"sharp knife, sharper mind"
lounging inside the bottle of your favorite poison
"while monsters are unique, i wouldn’t recommend playing against them"
fragile; and so the breeze carried me
tell me again how you knew me before we met
hurtling with hope and that’s what makes us more comets than moondust
incantations and indentations and all of them are love
when the weather shifts when the cicadas trill when the lake is lit by an autumn afternoon and when you quietly relent and welcome this eternity
hum and howl
good morning; the waiting is where we find rainbows
what drives your tides
seducing neon out of sunsets
time stretches and compresses in strange ways and the answers are but a plume of smoke in a wine-dark sky
kiss the late afternoon like you mean it
sonnets in the shape of the wind
good morning; hold me like you want me
tuck a wave over my head
the sun to my wildflowers on gravestones
good morning; too much rain outside and i’m not in it
what nature creates and how it collaborates
does anything howl on that side of the expanse
the holy embers of our own enigmatic fire
"when the wind feels like late july and reverent to the holiness of each sacred breath, sigh and whisper"
stumbling through day and night like they’re one in the same
"when’s the last time you touched some dirt, real dirt from the earth?"
need different m  a  p  s to draw the line                      over a pulse
an eternal and ethereal unfolding of your mountain range heart
when i close my eyes all i see is washed up blue sea glass on a beach no mortal has ever strolled
beauty is a pathology and so is loneliness
a forger of sunsets and frost bitten creeping juniper
to put words onto paper is one thing but to scratch them into my skin is another
everything is aglow in this wild dance of being
tragically in love with a color i’ve not laid eyes on before
of all the dune daisies in the world
last call for dreamers
felt something deep within me breaking free as my emotions flowed through every cell in my body
i want to write a million poems about this person
a rain that rolls down this window pane like a road or route which steers to you as significantly as my arteries
the creek runs deep beneath our feet through all corners of this land and it makes us proud of how far we’ve come
the words were almost so close they touched upon something beyond themselves
"morning rain, bite marks on rib cages and how we live in this meadow within each eternal moment"
out of order and disorderly
the smell of a wood fire on a rainy day
he planted every forest. a scientist-god plucked out his eyeball and the colors bled from his iris and got everywhere and he planted every forest.
as a chill formed small clouds of knowing on our lips and suddenly we were not cold
poems on a picnic bench
the tall ones leave their garbage as earthwork mosaics
"beetles do what they do in a state of constant bulge, all carapace and striving"
reminder that you can feel vulnerable but remain open
good morning; make me breakfast like we make love
our arms aloft like antlers beneath the moon
when your muse won’t stay in the museum
unravel me into an october sunset
i consume wind with inhales inbetween hurried whispers
lay in the grass and chat with the wind kinda afternoon
good morning; and other messages you pull from my marrow and sinew
the god who names the mountains
hold me tightly like a grenade with the pin knocked loose
"shhhh as lightly as bloom, as lightly as the dusk, as lightly as waking from a dream"
soft things are savage
landlocked heart
or as labyrinth as you turn my mind
and maybe a rose is a symbol of love because it is the only natural thing as labyrinth as you
when afternoon turns to dusk when rose gold light hits you at your best angle when you remember to pause and look at your shadow; you have come a long way
"a trope, but birds just fly into my poems unbidden"
stars like stepping stones
nothing yet to come from soil except those things that come from it
he; plants eternity in my chest and watches it grow
good morning; i wanna be cleaved like a glacier
maybe the world is an illusion and maybe only love is real
pummeled by the left hand of the weather
a meadow of you
good morning; tell me a story
flight patterns scribed on skin while we sleep
"the accumulation of hours, pixels, phone calls, daydreams, routines and rituals, distant train horns around 11:30 p.m, your gilded and gripping wants, cups of coffee, each day without you — hardens into something we might call your life, my life?"
things to slit my throat about
hope everywhere — serendipitous and golden
dreamt of midnights and of how love gently unravels me
is it the sky is it the salt is it the trees is it the smog is it the faint memory of when you were a song
how many stars there are and a reason to love for each
he is my event horizon
where can i redeem twitter likes for kisses
melt me like a glacier
write down words on sheets of paper without thinking anything through and we’ll talk of them over dinner
because eden and euphoria are free
because the friction of anticipation versus the physical manifestation
it’s a big world out here with lots of little things
a delicate breeze trying to fit through the cracks of a shattered window
the chemicals that hold us together and claw us apart
and where are all the things i thought i understood
dreamt of surprise and of how love gently unravels me
when the sun sets like a shrug
transcribing air and evading sleep
the wind swept every wildflower seed to grow quietly in my relentless beating heart
hold tight july
good morning; let’s live a lifetime of daydreams
you didn’t start as an addiction but i guess they never do
aviation in your aura
let’s sabotage the andromeda galaxy
dreamt of your hands and of how love gently unravels me
to fly into a solar moment
put down roots and start working towards something bigger: art
do you wash your hands before you write
wanna be the muse you hold
there is another side to this tale too; a part of my own soul (and perhaps yours as well)
my initial vote is doom btw
pour [   ] in a wine glass and make it swirl like the aurora borealis
today i drank the daily nectar of the sun and now i am going to drink wine and get slick and starry
the earth is insecure about the places we wrote our poems — these are the targets of natural disasters
at least five thousand other solar systems and people still think our moon is in love with our sun
a breath of rose-red air
good morning; change is the gospel of the world and life is renewal
the past is a tapestry of autumn leaves and without this there can be no spring
measure how deeply you have loved and lived by the intensity of your longing
did the sea swallow the ocean did a blue sun fall out of the sky to provide pigment to it
the fog clears and you see what will not be lost in this or any flood
never have i ever felt softer grasses
"when there are fountains, when there is chrysalis, when we are cradled by the change"
i am my own future poetry
we will remember these delicacies and intricacies
we will remember this air
homes as unofficial graveyards
vocabulary of color
the scent of sassafras and i am spinning us up in a silky cocoon
"the future: a beautiful, creeping ivy"
reaching for that ineffable meadow
good morning; pressed and blooming
hurricanes of blessed particles
"and in this arbour, i give to you every star"
our hearts like eager edelweiss
the freshwater feelings that traveled all over my spine and i swim searching
good morning; bruise me bellflower blue and remember the shape of my mouth when you do
"we are siren poetry, a song of the ocean, a sea spray kiss, a destined lighthouse, a singular catch"
bat your lashes at bureaucracy
good morning; and other fathomless secrets
is it a maelstrom of color or love
how you melt my ecosystem
now my life is an endless hour
now my life is comprised of soft fire and quasars and wildflowers
i remember when i told you i was going to wear star jasmine in my hair and you said it was something you’d love to see and that was the beginning of the end of everything
from their flowerbeds behind fence posts
good morning; and other unlockings
distill these dreams and we are drunk on possibility
and we rise with a broken sun prayer and we touch the breath of every autumn wish
i read your poetry to see if i would view my name
one-way ticket to purgatory
to speak of rain as it falls upon you
i bet you say that to all the skies
how chance is suboceanic earthquakes
you be the moon and i’ll be the illuminated shoreline
thought i buried my heart but it won’t stop beating
he is a galaxy enrapt and unfolding; a soft infinity
you never could decide whether to hold me or to hold my story against me
that one day we might have something to say about everything but our own lives
our cosmic chronology
move me the way tree roots lift sidewalks
the world cannot be understood without seeing it with one’s whole being
to commiserate with coffee and other morning intoxicants
lover to every silhouette that can be seen in its purest form
levers and labyrinths
this is a love poem to those who never knew themselves
3 wick candle of cognition
we bring together these remnants as a unique voice for peace in all things
he opens me like a knife
a story too big for this small place
"instead of skipping pebbles, i’ll just keep them in my pocket"
choose your fighter
ask me how i believe in love
"a fragment withdrawn, a fragment regained and a fragment undiscovered"
sugar-spun and emerging from
music as compass and we navigate these starlit memories
she walks into the bookstore where we were all waiting
a path once paved with tears now replaced by memories
"the sun rises and sets, your chest rises and falls and i slip shamelessly in love with both"
stand at the cusp of the quietest time of the day
twisting together tapestries from the torn cloth of our tale and remembering anything tattered like this was worth it
as soft as stardust
can’t have heels on the forest floor so i’ll hold them in my hand and run barefoot to you
tell me about the petals you rest your promises on
he could break my bones and i’d still thank him for touching me
maybe i was trying to leave myself somewhere i never thought i’d look again
believe in paths and destinations
good morning; every love story is a ghost story
do you melt like plastic or break like glass
with her / winter
sometimes i think about how many people i’ve written about and how that means someone’s probably written about me and i wanna read it
a lost and found for thoughts and thinking
how do you know the sky doesn’t paint the sun blazing neon out of panic
good morning; we are exploding oceans
dusk howls and a song aloft in the falling light
"love me, love me not petals tossed into quasars"
a mood ring with droplets of your irises
harness the tendrils of stars
some dust i don’t mind breathing in
warm me like a solar blessing like a lavender bath like a spiced tea like a lightning bolt like a quiet fire your heart sings
fuck me up like some new algorithm
good morning; let me weave you a cloud from dappled sunlight
hold on a minute my reality is still loading
[#] [f]ollow him anywhere [f]riday
what is louder than shrieking ocean wind
distortions and hums
i think yer hands are stiff and calloused because you’ve made love to hearts of stubborn stone but mine is soft like moss and eager to mesh with yers specifically
forgot to give you a prompt on wednesday
beginnings and endings have origin in desire
self portrait; something changed
messages as sad as her eyes traveling to opposite shores in bottles as blue as the skies
i am nothing but a wild wind’s shadow flung through the sun-shot poinciana tree
heartbeat the soft vibration of butterfly wings hitting folds of air in flight
pin me to a cork board with my past and its collection
a kind of grief that shatters earth’s crust open
there is an ache
a nearly unendurable joy
was it the start of the sea or the end of the ocean
grind my bones to make a stew
wonder if we could have been the architects of broken things
good morning; r u mad at me
i would like to cuddle under blankets with you but i’m anxious you might set them on fire
o h m y g o d b e c k y look at her pain it is s o o o o o o t e m p o r a r y
and hearts — much like bark or fingernails — grow back stronger than before
hearts don’t break; they bust
how we unknowingly became avalanches as if by instinct
DON’T FORGET TO CAPITALIZE YER HEARTBEAT
double dutch with a power line
a calcified heart and uncorked champagne
"good morning; just let the forest grow around you, it’ll be okay"
when i find you there; there in the space that lies between us
wanna lay bare in the grass and count every blade i can feel on my skin and share an intimacy and intricacy for each one
"stirring a concoction of flowers, fog, fiasco and forgetting"
good morning; when there’s no sun in the sky and you occupy the distance of every fever dream and things get tangled in power lines
remembering queen anne’s lace and every heartbeat in the pulse of a star
"the world can crush you with its pain, but also with its beauty"
"for you, i’d dismantle a planet’s orbit"
good morning; it’s difficult to stay composed when my cells keep splitting apart
something about how you filter moonlight and give it form
"at the shrine of memory, we light candles and lament that these ghosts are more alive than we were"
i find that unethical at worst and boring at best
"the operative logic of things like cottage core and dark academia is that your life is reducible to an aesthetic — not beauty, but an aesthetic"
when we remember the feel of soil beneath our feet and when the light is inexhaustible and when everything glows
painting roses on our skin in glimmering watercolors
beneath the paint and beyond the gaze
autumnal flames and laughter; the deep forgetting and remembering
good morning; and other little lies
unfurled in the velvet morning like a promise of soft infinity
from lightning bolts to forest fires
"no dents nor scars, just seeds buried deep like wildflowers"
tell me a story
"put summer in a cigar box, only to remember the memories made; open it up and enjoy the smell"
eyes on the road but her legs are paved and your car is swerving
home is where you reinvent yourself without having to set yourself on fire
built an ark of memory
the rhythm of remaining raindrops released from the tips of tree branches before a tender silence
i knew my bones were made of sidewalk chalk but i didn’t know i was so serious about getting back to my childhood
the mausoleum and how its marble cracked in the exact manner of her veins
it’s just that i know the thunder would sound different with you here
the rain has come to make the day more interesting
near or not so far
"in my dream, you were soft and kind to me. now that i’m awake, i will endeavor to be soft and kind to myself"
i fall but as a petal falls my fall like a dance soft ebb
a scene you have seen
what makes you feel happy
what makes you feel safe
"yeah, i pine better than the tree"
the world is an invitation
want to be so close to you i can sequence your genome with my eyes
head to heart to gut
good morning; between a murmur of the sky and the soul
of this and the next transient breath
"little girl, we decide always only we can decide"
maybe the stars have an answer
the truth-drenched spittle has stopped flowing since they kissed that day
good morning; tell me about peonies and about peace
ask and i’ll show you how he wrapped around me like honeysuckle vines and took away my every breath
hold my skull against your skull; hold my heart over a campfire; hold my hand; hold our promises
it becomes the glowing aura in the skies
your soul sees the aurora for the first time and decides to leave you for it
if poetry can’t save us if music can't save us if god can’t save us if love can’t save us if winds can’t save us then all that’s left is the long walk home
is it manipulative to text you “i wish i died when you were choking me”
this impossible dream
break me with the names of flowers
good morning; break me like a geode
counting pulsing stars and charting a roadmap of our souls
maybe one day i will follow these rivers to the forest
maybe one day i will follow these rivers to the sea
everyone i ever met was a green river silted with coincidence
now i’ll show myself
where is left to show me? i’ve tried oceans and books and lovers and hospitals and mountains and long drives and music and alcohol and the internet
here we walk along frozen beaches hand in hand and in search of lost time
hold still the night
there’s always next time and another hemisphere
what if the spiraling love that consumes us in wildflower ecstasy is the answer to all of our unspoken questions
love is the revelation that everything matters
flip the forest upside down and watch the tree branches drip like candle wax
nourish or whittle
time is a thread looped around our satin throats
tying knots in my veins is the least you could do
but this moment may end up being one more reminder than anything else about how rich our life can be when lived honestly
drifting aloft upon warm eddies of hope; telling secrets that make the sea blush and fold into itself
walking twilit shores alone let’s make believe in destinations
sacred and stained and an island we named
break my heart and bones to understand the way that waves break
to break freely with hot abandon
my darkest hours under the brightest sun
how we hide from the world and each other
good morning; all the bite marks on my body are from my own teeth
she uses everyone’s keys
the point of contact between reality and language
we are graveyards and laugh at the walking dead as if they are mirrors of our own enchanted dreams
good morning; what if time won’t tell
a forest that grows big enough to contain everything she wishes it could store inside
more questions than answers and questions i can’t answer
love crying because it’s like purging the formless self into the material self
"from the fragments of shattered hearts we build our pagodas and write new maps of solitude, soul and solace"
the hum of traffic as a lullaby; a blinking smoke detector like heat lightning; your touch on the here and there of my body; your touch on the this and that of my soul; the glow of us; and a quiet fire that sings
good morning; change is the gospel of the world
&amp; maybe this is all just a beautiful dream
*wipes away your tears* the oceans have enough of that
still not understanding the difference between falling and landing; becoming and unraveling
"thinking about pouring concrete in my brain, then sighing and crying out the dust"
let’s run out of excuses together
good morning; waste time until the leaves and the things fall together
show me a moss-spun promise and a dream of wildflower rapture
with a want that would level a skyline
"and you, the last flicker of perceivable space before the end"
time gets everywhere and gets caught inside everything and spills and swaddles and binds. someone come clean all this time out.
"in the pages of bark and sea, i color you completely"
good morning; float until you reach infinity
"i’m in yer heart, spinning, mumbling about all the things i wish i had done differently"
cocoon or nest or spiral galaxy or whisper of smoke or a city of fog at 2 a.m. or coals or reveries or reality
daydreams like a labyrinth of all the twilights
pin me against a mausoleum and kiss me until life bruises off from my lips
let’s move slowly but deeply to the pulse of thunder
i was once so smug about all i had built until the wind blew it down and i realized the happiness of walking naked in the storm
we braid ourselves to driftwood and float back to the simplicity and beauty of where we came from
that hot hollow of forgetting and how i disappeared
good morning; fists can bloom if you touch them in the right way
beating our great wings whilst a golden sun sings
"any place you touch on my body, a sea surges"
scar tissue calligraphy
hours; the cheap sorrow of waiting
tie these logs and limbs together to hold them into place
in how many conversations were we only rearranging our fictions
airports and graveyards
good morning; pound me into pigment and paint the sky
how it will rise like mist that swallows mountains and obscures the sun
in the heat of summer evening
my sighs spun the first hurricane and ever since the third planet from the sun has never been the same
honesty starts fires we can’t put out
fading into you and fading back into myself as a form of time travel
binary stars and a throat split lullaby
good morning; new love makes new colors
we are story arcs amidst a landscape of dreams
tucking myself into yer cerebral cortex
cypress domes erupting on my skin from where you touched me
perhaps if i could unclench my jaw my tongue would find the words
unstoppable force (clarity of thought) meets immovable object (my poverty of language)
the stories and secrets in the cartilage of bones that i will save for stew
"daises, desires and disasters"
like rouge electrons we spin orbits around the shimmering nucleus of this impossible love
holding it down but losing ground
good morning; fill your heart with woodland birds and listen to them quietly sing
gently coaxing pastels from the sunset
"keep unraveling the winding road ahead of me, just like that"
sneaking into your room at night to replace your shoulders with mount vesuvius
pulling my own hair so i can remember what you felt like
building a nest with the sticks and stones you used to break my bones
in hearts and in whispers
in sounds in winds in suns in broken glass in daydreams in nightmares in bottles in wishes in flowerbeds in blue in treetops in ink in oceans
good morning; life is made only of memory and anticipation
i am fortunate to know beautiful and great people and unfortunate to have disappointed every last one them
want to pull you over me like an ocean wave
condensation on my sternum so you can’t see my heart
these paths my feet walk and trace like deft calligraphy
memories like wildflowers pressed between the poems we lived
one day we must stand tall and shout our reply
good morning; how do i save my entire life up to this point as a draft
when words spoken tear roots of the earth and fracture galaxies into shards of stars
my heartbeat; a dancing mist that flows to you
we pull apart a wishbone. the larger half breaks into your hand. you make a wish. something cracks inside of me.
good morning; you can exist in your heart and in the world at the same time
bury my ghosts in loamy prose and rivers
"there is an indentation in my chest and it is filling with rainwater, come dip your toes in it"
good morning; how can i be your favorite form of thunder today
let us dive into the open hollow of night
"i ache in neon shades so bright, who could look away — who could fall so deeply in a heat — who could be consumed by this sun-blissed catharsis"
let me paint it and hang it on an oak tree
which surface of your identity do you gaze at when you are deep in introspection
i ask the soil if i belong
a large circle drawn in a pool of wildflowers and i am the circle and i vanish instantaneously in a moon-swim of slow gasps and hot arcs that you hear sing
"if he doesn’t make the box of bullets in your lower back turn into petals then yer not in love, sorry"
when did smoke realize it could fly
something about being so close to you fills me with hope
good morning; lovers
drunk spires and spines
barefoot through the clover; over and over
"carve my name into: a tree, a bedpost, your skin and your bones"
you told me to talk about real things but nothing is real so we sat in silence for awhile
i love you you’re my breathing castle gentle so gentle we’ll live forever
make my throat bleed love and bliss
good glamorous and gripping morning;
i wanna be a moonspun howl i wanna be a prismatic purgatory i wanna be the sky surrounding your skin i wanna be gentle and forgiven
watch me dream an entire spiral galaxy into existence
"oops, now it’s in my heart"
forgive our hearts though never forgive any man’s folly
"we told tales into the night and each one of them was a song of hope, an incantation and a list of reasons"
did you know that the ocean is just a vast bowl of silence
make every breath hum like a hymn and pur like a prayer
an ibis picking at my unraveling
follow our wishes even when it takes us into a darker place
"where i am holding my liquid heart out to you, where it is dripping between my fingers, where i am asking what is this cardiac nonsense"
*brushes the stardust out of yer eyes*
"when we live like this, we live forever"
there is nothing but air between us
pls be real
"the mind is a forest, an arc in the sky-swum dawn, a rain drenched amulet"
good morning; scream like the metallic orb that birthed you
i am wearing a halo of stars and you are wearing a halo of leaves and we are the only wild things in love
that’s for me to know and you to make up
like a dark ocean and like thick water that threatens to rip you apart
primordial soup of bliss and of chaos
"tell me — say love, say fuck, say incandescent enigma"
just once more into a warm fire without regrets
good morning; let’s do something romantic like watch planes drop out of the sky
like a landscape painting but all the trees are my intricacies
and other poems
"if you love me hard enough, i’ll bleed"
good morning; be delicate like caterpillar tread marks
feel it pulsing through yer heart like a lightning bolt before disappearing in an instant
looking on the bright side but only because everything around me is on fire
i’m not thankful for anything expect for the wine glass you threw at me
the scent of his summer cigar pours out the driver’s window of his cherry red car (no one is as bad as you are)
how can i trick myself into loving me the way i tricked you into loving me
good morning; show me a world that’s not imaginary
"i can’t afford jewelry, so i made you this cuff out of my veins"
you’re speaking to a part of me i didn’t know i had
"my life is coiled around willingly and unwilling exploring ideas of rage, eroticism, myth, memory, what the actual fuck it may mean to be a woman, romance, having each other’s backs, that kicking insight in your stomach, nights that fade into mornings that fade back into nights"
making love and sense to each other
can’t wait to see which shade of light the moon chooses to reflect across my delusions
crack open my skull to find a beach hazard statement
the mouthfeel of a poem aged 33 years in the barrel of your spinal fluid
with eyes the color of let’s fuck in the forest
seedpods in my shoes and sun-scattered songs in my head and i only daydream of him these days
good morning; my dreams spill inside balloons and pop once they hit the stratosphere
two words and one is heavy and one is light
thinking about everything i have become over the last three hours
and then see how this little girl feels about anything
fuck you harder than reality
lips warm to your mouth like some sort of crêpe in brown sugar
poetry is nothing more than a form of self-defense
fall in love like a 21 gun salute or like a 21 jewel watch?
good morning; have your knees met the soil recently
moon-swim of slow gasps and hot arcs and beating hearts
burrowing in a grotto of your love and weather
"“what did you do today?” “told 2,202 people on the internet i am crazy”"
“what did you do today?” “added all his towns to my weather app and toggled on notifications”
seams of the ether
"your heart is a saturated forest and other reasons i study survival training, fables and folklore"
good morning; hold my skull against yours
every crescent path leads to him
keep feeding me details about yer murmurs and yer glow
a blurring of snow and flowers and soft grasses that i will find you in and then lay with you
so deliciously pure
don't forget to speak sweet nonsense to your cup of coffee
good morning; shout my name from the rooftops like you chant my name under the covers
can’t wait to see which shade of light the moon chooses to reflect across your face
as if this was some magical dream state where when one sees someone their own hearts are melted together
running into an earthquake
#ff you to your favorite architecture
good morning; remember our knowledge of the universe consists only of theories
sorry about the thoughts that fill my head but i hope i made it up to you by brushing handfuls of tiny petals through my hair and tying it up with a vine
unbreakable human beings who truly exist without any formality
do you have any epochs you don’t show anyone
headspace like a short-circuited planetarium
pick at my scabbed and feral heart like you peel apart the petals of unidentifiable flowers
can anybody explain how many stars there are in the universe or something like that if we have planets and galaxies and suns inside of us which have never been seen before until we fall in love
if only there was some kind of instant empathy built into a game of narratives
"love is uncontained to and by any metric but i believe i measure how much i love any given thing, human or idea based on how clearly i can remember the person i was before it"
i want to kiss you on a train and write you poems on the back of our tickets
the difference between a quasar and an exclusive relationship is:
i kiss not where she would kiss but in every place that ever should have been kissed
a rumoured topography beyond where maps end
sitting on god’s lap and sharing a prose-prayer
redecorating my sternum and putting a treehouse where my heart used to be
each breath you speak sweeps a new color into this world
etch our language into my retina
i close my eyes tight as if i am afraid someone will bite through them again
i must remember to be more slow washing glacial river and less last remaining hummingbird beating its wings at rapid speeds to make up for every lost heart
several times you saw lava when there wasn’t any
good morning; putting these dreams in bell jars for when you leave me
"with just a glance and whisper, we birthed galaxies"
"home is a place where i screamed for several years straight and still every time i go back, the oak tree covers its ears"
how to write letters in soil how to carve sonnets into stone
help me get all of these thoughts out of my thoughts
all dressed up in galactic soil
the type of poem you can splash in
good morning; mail me to a mountain
gonna hide my heart someplace dark like the dirt or the ocean or the cosmos or my mind
further dissonance
then i sleep on yer brain waves
not gallant or good
climbing the ivy that grows up yer spine
wax wings and the shape of things
good morning; your voice and words are a box of spells
conceal nothing and throw yourself into the exploding wind
you’ll have to forgive me for i was not myself that one time or any time
putting my lips to a cup of storm for a sip
rain in reverse pulling itself out of the ground to get all cozy in a cloud
"no matter how many times my phone or your ears ring, i’d really just like to believe in everything"
gonna bottle the sound of your sighs and pour them into my morning coffee
good morning; i wish i was feeling your fingers trace crop circles onto my skin
"destroy me with your skin, sternum, nails and teeth"
"counting sheep, counting stars, counting you, counting quasars"
"when you get right down deep inside these holes, your soul starts to bleed ash and memories"
the unfolding of landscapes
we stole our prayers from the echos of phantoms that haunt this town
good morning; do you happen to have a spare lobotomy
when the ermine night becomes a ghost whisper
there has been an endless war for every woman with a heart so full her own body can’t support it
earth has an open wound where you slept on its ground
the two of the most exciting days of anyone’s life are when they meet me and when they leave me forever
good morning; my dreams print out on printers that are running out of ink
heartbeat like a heat map of a rolling ocean wave
my life is sweet like strawberries and fantasy
good morning; i am the most adorable waste of space
i’ve been holding onto myself because i have no idea how long this can last
and the ones i haven’t
a lilac dress embroidered with a silver thread as tribute to the lovers i’ve met
good morning; as the skies unblue
also i value and am particular about thread count
i am 5’3 and have a very good credit score
dream catcher turned fucked-reality catcher
just know i am hiding my secrets away when i delicately tuck my hair behind my ear
"abracadabra, my life in hell began this time last week and will do it again friday by 7 p.m."
the latter being ventured to the most because i like the quiet
[[[]]]
why seek a sunset when you can torch the horizon with fire
play only with fire
"as a tender girl of petite stature who possess divinely inspired rage, which mountain do you suggest i move and then pound to ground again"
"before i rest tonight, i will weave a safety net from the blue yarn of my veins"
you were in my dream and now i feel taunted by the morning sun and sleep
"good morning; forwards, backwards and voidwards"
the only truth is buried in this very moment
people say you only live once but we live a thousand times and are reborn when the moonlight is our only ornament
it is obscene to me how the absence of one person can and does empty the rest of the world
my spine curves to match the direction of the shoreline
from nothing to everything in a matter of seconds
archipelago of feeling
"oops, i knew something"
intimate acts like slamming my skull into snow
intimate acts like digging my intuition out with your fingertips
intimate acts like fastening the clasp of my necklace for me
what is your heart today
good morning; the condensation on my window is really just a sigh i could no longer contain
it’s actually quite amazing how you learn a new language each time you meet a new person
soft rain that falls in rhythm with every reason you ever did that
i shed my skin until all that remains is a plateau of petals and butterfly wings that resonate with light blue sound in some collective harmonic
seas and skies darkened like a calligraphy of sighs
fuck me up forever but please do not touch my herb garden
there is nothing; we are at their mercy
things you could slice open my throat about
"what do we have to appease the great forces of storms, chaos, fates and deities?"
scars and secrets with an extra sparkle like a dying star which grows white when its last breath comes
i haven’t felt safe since before i was 13
i’m on this empty beach and i’m in this tropical storm and i’m not leaving until i’m convinced this world is safe
myself included
quite frankly thinking about the horrifying things people do and to which they willingly subject themselves to for just the tiniest bit of tenderness
to run at full speed with no restraint whatsoever towards everything ever
for i am so caught up in seeing myself as something to be loved rather than raw flesh
hymns unfolding in all of my quiet corners
good morning; my heart is a grenade i will hold close to my chest
i left my dreams outside in a thunderstorm and now the colors are kind of messed up
"you’re not afraid no matter how little we know about oceans, space and time?"
with a gale blasting through her chest
"i’ve always been that tiny, fragile tornado in a glass of water"
would and will barter my solar plexus for the solar system
i want to sit beneath a willow tree until my fingers become branches and sap spills through my veins
the sky on a day when an earthquake has just begun
how he took my beating heart and how he replaced it with a galaxy and how now gravity does not exist
good morning; each day draws us closer
goddess of the gas station
not some random dream or figment
pain is a heart ablaze with thirty three thousand wildfires
good morning; i’m ready to become something more than ethereal
i’m going to sleep and when i wake up i better be a wildflower
stealthily she drew near
he took me with him
just enough poison to make my lips tingle
this terrain of reverie he unfolded within me
nocturnal epiphany
when we meet in a space more intimate than the cathedral of my rib cage
the crescendo still ringing in your ears
words are all we have so may all yours be vulnerable and dripping
vanished under stormy moonlight or gone down with another rising sun
remembering the small and little things like your atoms
"and somewhere in that skyline is you, quietly leading me home"
a vortex of epilogues
good morning; what will you use for a heart today
dreamscape like a planetarium
good night; don’t get used
"it’s not that, it’s just the relentless impermanence of everything, is all"
guns and zip ties and i want you to be mine and i like the way the sun on your wedding ring makes it shine
shredded by hands or by gods
good morning; touch me like a gathering storm
i let the waves wash away every line in the sand ever drawn
you are the storm that ricochets across roofs and floods my mind
your resonance and other luminaries
because somewhere within all of us is a wildflower meadow where butterflies have learned your name
good morning; look at how i get us killed
whitecap waves and tic tac clatter and static hiss and sneaky patterns and shifted weather and tapestry tatters
people looking for words say more
swan song or prologue
lead me to patches of berries in spring and mushrooms in summer and my deepest thoughts in autumn and my death come winter
somewhere there is a skyline that drowns the horizon's promise
we haunt different stone castles
good morning; we slept in an ocean of windswept ashes
swords and thorns
a world drenched in green ferns and foliage because i like the color of your eyes too much to bare the thought of any other color
i’ll be the obituary on a shattered window pane and you be the ivy growing over me
"when the lights fall out and no longer spark, let’s shade each other glow-in-the-dark"
every secret is a gust of gardenias
caramelized consciousness
i'm going to caramelize these onions and pretend they're my feelings
gravity is going to leave me for someone else
"only a prison of unrecognizable stars, babe"
bash a hole in this fucking galaxy
is anyone interested in helping with plot inspiration or providing edits to my life
good morning; invite jupiter’s clouds cover up what’s left
the secret light of a new continent
"if you want it, it’s free and it’s yours"
we are all in one big aquarium with glass walls and no fish
slip paint fumes into my lungs while i’m sleeping
a thousand miles measured by the wingbeat of butterflies
"and in my stomach, satellites and insights"
why crush on humans when you can crush on mythologies
good morning; come here so you can destroy me
etch-a-sketch our souls
an invisible hand moves over me
"your scent of sawdust, earth and soil and mine of bright blue florals"
might fuck around and become a song within static
the last drop from this little sun’s radiance
"mischievous, delicate, alluring, sensuous"
nocturne silhouettes and shadows and all of them are me
good morning; come plant a forest in my chest and then crush it with the weight of your entire body
call it what you want to
"in the deepest trench in the world, you created the tallest mountain"
teacup or chalice brimming with my wildest dreams?
making a peace offering out of storm clouds
GOOD MORNING; LET’S LEAVE EACH OTHER CLUTCHING OUR TEMPLES WONDERING WHAT JUST HAPPENED
once upon a time you promised me strawberry wine
i bet he could turn spinal columns into lightning bolts and make the sky explode at his command
why do your teeth glimmer so brightly when they’re lapping at my heart
bruises like vespertine shadows
our soil-lined skin is a pact with the earth that we will never surrender
a universe hanging like a mobile and waiting to be broken down into its components
pictures within pictures
colonize in my lungs like whispering wind
good morning; how will i come to ruin today
i bet your kisses are a seething ember from the fire that introduced heat to this universe
take my dress off at the roadside stop this memory like a souvenir from the gift shop
take me far away razor wire bouquet keep desires at bay
american dream and flag tattered like a rag you like it when i’m bad and say i’m prettiest when i’m sad
at the diner i talk you drink bourbon on the rocks then play our song on the jukebox
ride for miles to escape our demons already know all the reasons fall asleep dreaming
bring me to the pawnshop get me an antique ring and a soda pop fuck me on the countertop
drive quick your side chick your sidekick heavy metal bait and switch
kiss me moonstruck in your truck i was fated with bad luck
road trips hardships your eyes on me as i bite my lip
wise guy war cry his stuttered stanzas like one long goodbye
my dreams of you eat holes in fabrics
"between pulses of hot blood, a heart steamy like summer"
you can’t see the stars in your city so you make me your constellation
let’s lock ourselves in a hotel room and make sense to each other
i have followed my heart and that’s why there are tiny violets growing from the burnt and cracked parts of my skin
hold me like the first pear of the harvest
dismantle my vertebrae and use it as chess pieces
drown in her eyes or float on her wings
"treat me like iron sweet babe, heat me up and twist me into the shape of your fantasies"
such a hot darkness to be infested with a quasar
my favorite color is white hot
who am i to be the heat haze on the highway
both a prison and an escape route
paint me in a color you can’t explain
analogies and anthurium
i can feel the blaze on my skin
i am the kindling and you are the flame
"*throws sheets off bed, pulls clothes from drawers, tilts and shatters mirror* where the fuck did i leave my sanity"
hypnotic and fey a melody i could play
bourbon and apricots
your name on my vocal folds like an electric storm and the landscape now holds lightning deep in the veins of the earth
your name a howling phantom in the electric graveyard of my mouth
"i’m just a languid apocalypse babe, that’s all"
the wildflowers that grow in the whispered gardens of my solar plexus
cherry blossom ice cream and the daydreams in between
"from behind us, sirens wail"
stitch me a quilt made of your desires
i am the song in your head and the ringing in your ears
i want a god as my conspirator and a comet as my abettor
trace the overcast perimeter
a heart is a big dumb avalanche
carve a river into my bedpost because it looks like the calligraphy of your name
there are forests and there are forest fires and i think i may be both
my atomic structure is a herb garden
foxes eating frivolous thoughts
"all rings, no circles"
keeping hopes in bell jars wishing on a rosary and a star
sculpted by an echo and chiseled air
"you notice a door labeled “her;” when you enter it, a tree splits in half as lightning strikes it"
the discs in my head are biting one another
"the reds and blues of you, a lilac solar flare"
your eyes are made of scattered fragments of this neon universe
dopamine; i like it when you treat me mean
accidental eye contact with my feelings
serving my secrets in a coupe glass
variations slightly extended
babydoll dress i’m a mess light a candle within my chest
gonna live so fiercely even fires fear to take me
asphyxiate me with your daisy chain
now i have spiral staircases where my organs use to be
peel back my skin to reveal reservoirs of blush colored petals
breathe with me under this incandescent sea
i might not know much but i do know all there is to know about emptiness
"tell me your dream with a mouthful of blood, babe"
can’t tell if you’re thinking about climbing me or the mountains
a game of operation except i am the one on the table and you are digging strange things out of me
"cover me in fog or dirt, velvet or your hands"
"baby, we burn like beach houses"
all of our impossible futures
"flowers, floods, falling stars, fables and all the other fucking glory i’ve birthed"
in the deep violet cracks of my spine
this strangled sunrise
the taste of blood and polished metal
maybe they’ll float out and reassemble into a mirror. maybe then.
waiting for you to see yourself in the shards of glass lodged in my skin
look how i bleed ghost songs and gentle longing
listen: there is beauty and horror in all things and we are hymnal
iridescent in a swirl of black dust
atoms like a humming mantra of her
a poet or a parasite
break me like a geode
dark diaries for you to create your own connect-the-dot constellations with illuminated stories and characters
who left you alone in the rain
where can i redeem twitter followers for kisses
wonder what color my skin will turn when you press your hands into me
do mountains tire of being composed and stoic
*vomits heart-shaped glitter*
"if you’re nervous, you could bite my lip"
i like how you can wrap your hands around my neck from the other side of the room
cut open my stomach and watch the origami hummingbirds fly out
crush on me
every night i sleep in the hollow of a forgotten willow tree; every night i breathe in the name of trees
clocks tick and vultures circle
i like myself more than you would think but not as much as you could like me
faces and places and spaces
from this secret plateau i gaze at my life
things i’m not allowed to touch
not knowing the different between stars and rain
a voice like winter sunlight
butterflies in the backseat
the way rays of light puncture this ocean we built
let you down like an anchor
my reflection said i am bruised and breached but is willing to compromise
scatter the soil
dedicated to @dogwoodheart
brighten up your heart by setting it on fire
the entire sea lapping at my bare thigh; waves of sunlight stinging my bare throat
i have seen oblivion and it looked like you felt
when i twist my lips to god
the summer of ceaseless house fires
when i grow up i want to be a mythology
unhinge my atoms with your switchblade
everyone knows it’s a small world humming with static
cross my heart and watch you lie
why throw stones when you can burn cities
everything is green and made of soft ferns — even you
watched yer heart combust into a bird
crush my sternum like parched peony petals
it all turned to dust so i filled this urn and named it after the memory of tartarus
forbidden fruit flavored popsicles
choking on your wish-prayer
what poems and tropes caused you to lie to me so beautifully and so blatantly
wanna be a butterfly suspended from the filament of a pale blue dream
rub your closed eyes until the stars stain your fingers and you can map constellations in thin air
a game of hide and seek where i forget to tell anyone to look for me
i miss you except you are an uncanny book of short stories that i read in a place and time that i will never experience again
becoming the topography of your sunflower spine
leaping off the edges of jet streams
"i like the way your name echos, dancing ballet in your marrow"
florida keys pick the lock or slam the vault keep a lock of my hair in this sun-bleached amulet
i could feed u ambrosia like the god u are and then u could murder me nicely
"ring around the willow tree; a pocket full of honeybees; flashes, flashes; lightning to the ground"
let’s fuck and then i’ll fall asleep in the soft crook of your neck until there’s nothing left but constellations that only represent abstract shapes
touch me senseless like an avalanche
there are forests somewhere and there is you somewhere
"strawberry tea, take a polaroid of me under the tabebuia tree"
ruin me like the first storm of summer
is it the breeze or your sighs; my collarbones can’t tell
a standing ovation for this incandescent detonation
strike me down in the grass like cloud-to-ground lightning
your eyes
am i myth or a magnolia
bubblegum; son of a shotgun
euphoria and her little black dress
i put my thumb over the sun for eight whole minutes just to finish a dream
tuck me in with a lullaby but don’t let me sleep
your spinal column looks just like a flame on the ocean floor
each night i die in my sleep
shoot up my veins with daisies and disasters
you have a heart betray it
"barb wire of gold is still barb wire, babe"
dust me with thyme and ash
digging little holes in your thoughts and hopes and dreams
the ruin and the wreck
open the cathedral of your rib cage and let me pray
"hush now baby, the nighttime gets dangerous"
this you can keep
chase your whitecap waves and dreams
walk the shoreline from noon to midnight
catch my teardrops in the pail you used at the beach as a child and toss them back into the sea
grind down my bones and thoughts to sand for your artificial beaches
i pray that i may get this shipwrecked soul out of the bay
turning over an old leaf
encounter and uncover
call me oleander because i’m far from good
guns and hit and runs
velvet physics
duke it out with lips and teeth
"swarms of butterflies, storm clouds, floods and fury"
"grab me by the wrist, give me a kiss, if it doesn’t hurt me then i’ll have to insist"
saturate me like a summer storm
palms around smooth stones
"rosary; baby, tell me"
"if you want the sun on your face or a knife in your back, i can do that for you"
how many clouds can i find within you
planting an herb garden in the hollow where my secrets used to be
rain and library whispers are what you hear
"pillow talk, you’re the boss, keep me in your silver-plated jewelry box"
our alter egos would make a cute couple
"jukebox, frilly socks, drinking whiskey on the rocks"
"hopscotch, late talks, braid me a crown of daisies and spanish moss"
are you comprised of atoms or strawberry seeds
touch me like the wind does when i wear a sundress
all the ways she wields like a sword
your favorite thorn
kiss me in a body language you created
nothing to choose and nothing to lose
ecliptic and eminent
countless chemtrails and pretty ponytails
"the bandage i bleed through, baby"
knee high socks and lollipops
lipgloss and ice cream shops
the moonflower vine that binds my spine and holds me upright
who am i to use the electricity of your desire to scorch your bones and earth
"goddess and dweller of forest and fog, how lovely it is to be small"
hot pavement for rain hot water for tea hot creeks for veins hot thoughts for daydreams
replace my spinal cord with a lightning bolt and my pisiforms with full moons and my atoms with seeds of lotus flowers and my irises with the weddell sea
myths and allegories
may the underbrush and briers tear my lunar pale skin and tinge the white roses a faint pink with blood
shy from the mind and distract it with wine
planting royal poincianas in the gaps between your thoughts
etch your secrets on the salt flat
scream out loud at the bottom of the ocean so all the sunken ships can hear
on your summer bucket list:
pummel me like a geode; break me to find me
might fuck around and rearrange the continents
playgrounds and power lines
"crush me, indigo hue"
"ophelia can whimper all she wants, my riverbanks have more flowers than that"
even in the dark i float high enough to see the entire pacific ocean staring back at me
wrap around me like morning glory
ramblings of an artist’s dilemma
everything crossed over like lattice
embrace me like a hydrothermal vent and flourish around my sighs and exhales
plant a flower for each time you meant to ask me a question but kissed me instead
your words are flailing on my floor. can you come pick them up please. they’re shouting and withering and oh god they have teeth please come quick
increasing in mass and in density and growing teeth
"monstrous words, darling"
"*warming the hearts of a thousand bioluminescent creatures* “oh the places you’ll glow,”"
"ok, so i’ll cozy up in time and a bottle"
"if the moon really is honey, it’s an island in the heavens sinking in slow motion"
i have found myself in constellations and hospital cabinets
i will make the wind my mother
"sweet green dreams and a voltaic stream, separated in places where there are no seams"
"the softest place on earth is when people are alone with their glimpses of self in darkness, silence and gaps of memory"
death and resurrection
"and honestly, same"
pershone is both queen of the underworld and goddess of spring
wash the color out of these lights for me
spin my mind like a casino prize wheel
cut me at an angle and place me in your favorite vase
"on the count of three, we jump into infinity"
i’d like to see your dusk tumble down from the sky in the form of half-developed polaroids
"my hair is longer, my heart is softer but i say fuck more than ever before"
don’t talk to strangers because all they want to do is fuck or love you from a distance until they are close
tendrils and celestial strands
the libraries have no words
"reasoning, intimacy and your sleeping body next to me"
all hail the violet and violent folds
spin my mind like an antique globe
poems and porn hook-up to a heartbeat
my love and rage burn white hot
the searching has become the settled
are you content with your content
widely worshiped in temples on mountains after her name
lavender and eucalyptus sting my soul with a kiss
black pepper and pine put your lips to mine
penny for your thoughts but a dollar for your secrets
to his half-delirious fancy
emblem of the sun
this was very orpheus of me
slit the lullabies out of my throat
i gave him my heart he gave me hydrangeas
and the rest is blank for filling
the weapon is sweet
let me be the delicate fold in your bedsheets
where’s a sometime when you need one
"my favorite colors are fresh bruises, peony petals and smashed strawberries"
climb up the sky just to escape oxygen
your words are a surging ocean that crashes to shore with every wave
wander at your own sweet will
let’s find the eighth deadly sin
delusion is my favorite stimulant
yer heartbreak is polluting the earth
search for the source
when we kiss every one of my atoms twists into a planet
no one wants to read my story because it’s in cursive
"you infected me your river goddess, baby impaired those azure colors black and you never looked back"
all alone in my mouth
fuck your flaws and remember me in the way they scream
"the rust, though cruel, is wise"
thoughts that break like fevers
you’ve got your gun and i’ve got my tongue
you pray for spring because i am a half frozen stream
lilac skies and strange little lies
unravel me like tree roots and silk ribbon
ash are my memories and my friends
touch me like your switchblade
may the rain stick to my face like freckles
"tie our bad decisions tightly together, babe"
midnight in the hour of dreamers and goddesses
bite off my intricacies and spit them to the wind
butterflies in an hourglass
mix into the vibrant colors around you
take me into your dreams and do not map the way back out
feel me like a scarlet ember; flood me like a rain barrel
we are made of soil but built for euphoria
"we made love, mistakes and promises"
thunderous stillness
silken lips and sinking ships
desire like the first storm of summer
teach yourself to keep dreaming in the mornings
wash your face with the poetry of a thunderstorm
i am a peony blossom and will litter your path with petals for free
"counting blades of grass, counting sheep, counting how many seconds it takes to crawl completely inside of you"
a hale and hearty hologram of what could have been
come here so i can detonate you with soft glances
porcelain doll stare and a polaroid smirk
i want to capture you like a rogue wave
"*kissing the palm of yer hand* i hope you always remember my poetry and other pretty lies,"
our gazes touch and unfold within us
all i could think about was how sweet this would be when everything went completely wrong
the intervening space between heaven and earth
where the embers end
a baby blue hush
lips like paradise but eyes that forecast electrical storms
let me make your lungs accelerate like a hummingbird’s wings
life is slowing down so it’s easy to see things move
death and resurrection
at and in shades of sapphire intervals
"hold me like lightning, deep in the veins of your earth"
origin unknown but i can tell you how it ends
good morning and hello to my sweet fingertips abolishing your planet’s soil
"too many u-turns, not enough you"
kettle heavy like my conscious
vines on power lines
setting fire to history because you like the flame
i want dirt and i want estuaries and i want skies to hold me like they do the earth
touch me like acalypha
one thing about being autobiographical is there aren't references somewhere else
illuminated dust specs like stepping stones
a chorus of soliloquies in the temples we once built
how to write love letters on ocean floors
"why don’t you pull out the indigo from my irises like an endless, blue, coiled satin ribbon"
move me like wind chimes in a rainstorm
like light passing around a lamp on fire
slew the dragon and plucked the apples
may no storms or wintry winds ever rob the fields of springlike beauty
"#ff in actuality, the moon phases are the shape of @GhostOfKalliope’s words forming and hanging in a cerulean evening sky"
"#ff before @dogwoodheart, land, sea and air were fused together; so that the earth was not solid, the sea was not fluid nor the air transparent"
"#ff @SageStassi, the goodness of sandstone beaches and complexity and elegance and wildflower kisses who i want to hold delicately like a diamond champagne flute"
"#ff the god of ceaseless shores and celestials, captain and commander of space and ocean, the flare of sun in the sea that shines for miles under the surface @wzrdrgn"
make up the soul soil of this garden
a cloud once told me it feels empty
were you looking for god in the hidden coils of my spine
sentiments and cinnamon
send me bouquets and assassins
these words are silent crickets
and i will sculpt boulders and drink sunshine and shape clouds and use rivers as ink in my pen and write poems in the shape of butterfly wings and
tongues; and that hazardous language
provocative and powerful
there isn’t so much room anymore though just enough left on shelves if you want something different from someone else
the knife between my ribs slid like a love letter under my bedroom door
perseverance like the moon who ceased to reflect herself onto the water’s surface
how a thousand flowers turned into a thousand daydreams
i shout poetry in-between my screams
lost in that golden hour
"gleam and glow, the burn is slow"
what was the prompt and what was the point
get lost in me like a celestial forest
today tomorrow yesterday and the day after and the day before and whenever and never
the comets of your thoughts are responsible for shaping everything from stars to planets to human behavior and even existence itself
"my role, motif and tale"
"if the ocean never sleeps, why should i"
thankful for the scent and hue of every blue floral
half-developed polaroids lodged in my throat
kiss me into ten thousand fractured pieces and scatter me all over this broken earth
adorned with pearls and peonies
she; a delicate detonation of prayers
hold my heart over an open blaze
walking barefoot through a dimly lit corridor
and she just pointed to the white lilies
can’t save a damsel who worships her distress
your epoch etched
a knife that wrote the story of summer
kick drum in my cranium
"i want to serve tea to all 1,800 of you"
fuck it/this/that/me
he recalled a somber mood:
memory is a wave and a pattern and rock and ice like saturn
circles of the world and rain on the roof
frail alphabets
"no one will like what i have to say, particularly the part where i tell you i’ve done this before and to keep your wishes and wants in bell jars"
who am i to climb through contrails
"anyway, tell me your secrets in the form of lightning"
there is dirt on my hands and my head sways with the spring and my lungs are full of citrus and petals and my pisiforms are full moons stuck in my wrists and my eyes can see clearly now
i am the shattered glass in your kaleidoscope
venus sky trap
september sunsets and eyes full of midnight
surges and streams of absolution
here on the moors and there in your heart
"swarming, but enjoyed for eternity"
surpassed the limits that disturbed
it’s kind of hard to focus on what you’re saying when there are so many fallacies stuck in your teeth
your heart is an organ but your hands are a piano
to ooze and drink the marrow of the celestial
and i am a delicate sand dollar looking to rest
your shoulders like a continental shelf
painting ranunculus over the portrait of your delusion
pluck and play my tendons like harp strings
dousing flames in honey
touch me like ivy touches stone walls and castles
to be torn and tattered like linen paper
watching life burn in reverse
dress me in prose and poetry
bathe me in a pastel pool of language
brightening up my world by setting your gaslights on fire
made of dreams and fire
you fuck me up faster than a swig of bourbon
melodic meandering
you spoke to me in prisms and i was blinded by the colors
every atom in me is a cinnamon flavored planet
books and boxes
sun flare braided in my hair
and i wear this spanish moss like a crown
to trust a thief
be the sunshine filtering through my rib cage
the pollen of your personality brought to me by honey bees
time and timekeepers
hide and seek; find something in me
the nature of both
"high tide, low life"
i want to dye my spinal fluid your favorite color
will my bones be found
the sun bleached pages of your diary on some forgotten shoreline
i want to lay on a moss covered boulder beneath a waterfall and let the mist drown me until i disappear
collected and uncollected
certainly in control of language
cosmos in your heart and in my lungs and in our dreams and against your lips and in my stomach and buried in the soul
shooting stars are really just the galaxy’s dripping tears
are you made of petals and promises my dear
"gentle, calmly detached"
burn down the light of the morn
onyx lodged in your heart
get your hands dirty and help me dig my grave
of the green god
unrepairable plummets
carnations and consciousness
tempting doves to land and dine in my living room
studying the sexual undertones of how you take your coffee
to watch over peace and war
[note: this does not mean anything else though]
sweeping wishes into a teacup
i never asked to be here but i did ask for a pink cloud to lounge on while i write poems
i can’t hear my head over the sound of your sweet nothings
fighting it out with a blade of grass
daydreams like a solar flare
tangled in your summer sky
"goddamnit, i say prayerfully"
enticing electricity out of power lines
abandon me like some capsized warship
catharsis is my favorite color
my vernal soul
we’re drawing maps of rivers in our sleep
the layers of living
tears into amber
breathing and beating in the shadow of some being
some day all this madness would never happened
the point is the pattern
rose gold circles i can’t escape
i hope you always remember the beat of my heels on the pavement
objects in mirror are more broken than they appear
drowning in the beer that fell from your mouth with your apology
delicately tempting fevers out of stars
gently luring words off the pages of your favorite book
tie me up with the strings of all forgotten birthday balloons
laying in lavender and lounging in linen
propagating moonlight and sapphire tides in all the corners of my mind
"mind like a birthday candle, always wishing"
i flourish in rhythm with every peony on this planet
it’s my birthday. do you wish to attend my battle or my party?
two flaming arrows and a spilt inkwell should be enough
preserve me in resin like your most treasured rose
magnolias and melancholy
confessing and confronting
you don’t seem surprised when i tell this story
twist and twine
cut me at an angle like a flower stem
ripped off its orbit and thrown into an inferno
i could write you a letter or better yet i could dig out my heart and mail it to you
an incoherent volley of questions and answers
i’ll be the shattered window pane and you be the ivy growing over me
detrimental digits
holding it down but losing ground
i want to stand in the rain until my memories are washed clean
head like a civil war; heart like a 21 gun salute
a steady hand and mind
to haunt rocks and solitary spaces
fragile peace
sighs like soft rain
a shade of darkness and the shadow that you bathe in
my life is hot like quiet fire
the consequences of cupid
i'm holding a full moon between my forefinger and thumb
kiss me in a dimly lit forest
i love my sleep mask not just for the sensory deprivation but also because it keeps my identity hidden from smooth talking dream bandits
you can and should forgive yourself
earnest oak trees and a springtime breeze
don’t look at me as if i hold what the fires have left
don’t look at me as if i am just an echo
sunlight swoons to touch your delicate haloed shape
by having these colors you can create
at the bottom of this barrel and bellflower patch
calloused hands yet a touch as soft as silk
tiny moons for teeth
no sound comes out except silence at nightfall
everything forever
pick apart the pieces of me like you pluck apples from trees in the orchard
to sit most beautifully in a field of wildflowers
the girl who tried to be good
siege-like atmosphere
camouflaging the quiet corners of us
sipping silently a cup of storm
a sequence of gentle detonation
"a bottle, and the knights all want to break out but can't"
today is the day we dredge your soul
hearing it sing even louder through these beautiful shadows
i don’t have much gold
does the memory move you toward the sun
your favorite flower fell into my hand and so I felt the petals delicately before vanishing
morning metaphors
scheming in green
did you graffiti your name on my spinal column
a wave is always breaking on the shore
jumped right into it but then realized how far the universe had grown
flower crown medal for sad girl tweeting
dented bones and broken thrones
steamy little spring
throat fucked the dirt until you were the only sun around here
tended to the soil with tears
pushing the wind off a cliff
this is the story of september
tryst and twist
i bet you coax pastels out of deep sea corals
temples in flames at the bottom of the sea
an aching pain that amounts to every kiss i’ve missed and never received by you
pull my veins apart like you stretch your bubblegum with your hands
how many butterflies can i fit in my mouth
good morning; please don’t tell me how to feel
diced up delusions
peacock blue tides circulate and roll through you
your poetry like sea salt and rosemary
answers or process
spilt ink like tiny rivers
sorry; and i hope you never understand
wistfully from behind glass covers
architecture of the cloud your daydream fell off of
just enough for some faint galaxies to show themselves at night
losing all form and dripping like paint
the next step to reach the dream is uncertain
lollipops and lip gloss
whispering my memoir into the hallows of trees
i want flowers in my mouth and dirt in my lungs
the transition from shoreline to sea and the rescue of me
an introduction of a third color
stare at the sky until a canopy of trees covers over us
emotion without reality
color without outline
movement without restraint
unjuried thoughts
"my defenses, curled up under the floorboards"
turning the pages of your favorite book and straightening the frames on your wall
a fallacy for years
what type of wound are you today
that lightning bolt looked just like the scribble of your name in my notebook
from seed to weed to flower
what makes something special at such a young age
sweet river of disposition
i remember november and the smirk on your face
"my mind is a galaxy, my skull housing planets that argue who can sustain life better"
words that hang like wind chimes
suddenly the sea
rob my soul of all its beauty
so many answers exist
a fading forest
palm trees and promises
a cradle song as you cradle me
praise for the sun and moon is written
wavelengths and wandering
soft movement like morning light
my spine is a mountain range
don’t speak with that voice because it’s not yours anymore
to see how far the dream is coming true
to map a bird’s flight pattern across my skin with your fingertips
with a vision to tell stories across three worlds
dragonflies and lullabies
the taste of sugar on my tongue still has that sourness
throw me to the sky for the sun to heat my heart
"hand on a cypress knee, telling the swamp my story"
from florida’s oaks to new york’s sidewalks
woke up with butterflies on every bone of my body
when young lovers dream dreams only after their lives have ended
before someone writes another poem like yours
i’ve never had an epiphany though i remember the first time i felt small
a sudden change of color
admire me like i am the last rosemary sprig on earth
amid fog and the daytime moon
unravel me like typewriter ribbon
what pool of water did you come from
untangle me like spanish moss
what kind of cloud are you
dusk and its stillness
spoon feed me the wishes at the bottom of the wishing well
spoon feed me infinity
spoon feed wind-barren meadows to me
spoon feed me the route you use to escape
spoon feed me the place where winter begins
spoon feed abandoned cocoons to me
spoon feed your old memories to me
spoon feed the sunlight to me
spoon feed the electricity of the power lines we played under to me
spoon feed the apricot desert to me
the rush of memory on the beaufort scale
october; and the glow of our embers
all that is beautiful is passing
"my cot is a small boat where i float upon my thoughts, letting them lap"
carved my name onto the floorboards of a treehouse
"puncture wounds, black and blue"
riverbanks and cat eye marbles
the difference between two narratives
"white clouds, dark islands"
an assortment of old books and the taste of cinnamon
strange daffodils until the sun goes out
rings in and out of water
"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, but it was a time nonetheless"
pinned down my heart with a rusty nail
"you choose, you loose"
i want to draw a tomato and write you a poem
a vine and its game of dew
conclusions and beliefs
to tango with tomorrow
fire glows a false sunrise
midnight; and the rose petals that fell from your mouth
ash blue and the memory of you
i promise one day i will tell you the whole story
personification of wind
early spring and a burrow in the cosmos
hot spots become lukewarm
the crawl space in the heart that is your home
the most flavorful light of day
moon myths
riotous imagination
"but one morning,"
this champagne tastes like i’ll be calling you later
bubble and burst
memories lit by late afternoon
the skies turned to a pool of lavender while she gathered flowers
waiting for you in a small treasure chest at the bottom of this lake
anatomy of the hand
"like a hawk, like a hunter"
studied our chronology like a map
an ocean twists around my body to pull me in
caged and lost in the labyrinth of a white rose
your frame and your frankness faced me
my psalm persists
my palms persist
hold me with the same delicacy your hands hold your most faded and fragile books
in the barrel of words and song
to keep the moonlight from dancing around in my mouth
seed time harvest
hero to the wind
mr. storyteller
daydream on a vine
each day i wake up and put on my little dresses and write my little poems and continue to be very delicate but not very gentle
failed bandwidth on a dandelion wish
your marrow tastes like a mix of rosemary and ash
i am such a delicate hue
searching for signs and only finding symbols
books that read us
i miss you most on tuesdays
"the satin lining of my heart, soft to the touch"
this welded world
can anyone recommend a makeup concealer that will hide my delusions
long corridor of wasteland
are you
keep your epoch
nostalgic for that time you put a strawberry in my mouth to soothe my nightmares
fractured hearts learn to ignore the fine lines
sunsets and sentiments
can we            could be
using the scientific method to discern every memory i’ve ever had from every story i’ve ever read
vision and eyes as well as prophecy and truth
i want to sit beneath a willow tree until my fingers become branches and sap spills through my veins
drag me on the pavement for 27 miles
do you think of me when the planets pair elusively
many things and nothing at all
restrain me with my halo
when a heart combusts into a butterfly
deconstructed daydream
late night tear stain
climatic cloudburst
we will drink nectar and trade secrets in the garden
with or without psychosis and an ocean spilling in my skull
"good morning, i am an oleander hedge loosely formed into a person"
"a swarm of darkness, like the midnight blue in the cracks of my spine"
pierce the clouds with a kiss
more clout than zeus
"a dream, but so sweet a dream under the tabebuia tree"
wondering what your hands are up to: writing or fighting
butterflies and fireflies
time traveled to oblivion
your lucky number burnt onto my tongue
looking around with morning eyes
drooling paint in every shade of blue
a dream you tried to forget but often remember
coaxing the chemicals out of a darkroom
an ache for spring
like some monochromatic and melancholy film
stirred the soil
tawny hills of flesh
weeds and wildflowers
rules changed and so did you
a radiant likeness
your eyes are a swelling sea and my body is your life raft
sunstruck in green and what these things do mean
the sense of space
used the clouds as a duvet and pressed a cyanometer against my dreams
it’s hard to focus on what you’re saying when you have mount pelion stuck in your teeth
seducing the haze out of ghosts
eons wide and evergreen
meld with the frequency
memories drifted away like dandelion seeds
eyes that sing songs softly
temples and forums
you and me and the dawn
false figuration
might fuck around and become a fossil so it’s easier to wait for you
burnt and burning
if you wish to share
a glimpse of your pretty wrist
the discipline of exactness
the pattern of incisions
dreams like geodes
the tremor of gardenias blooming under some abandoned planet
handsome god of war
dashing god of peace
"the commencement of every new year, month and day held sacred"
in the midst of plenty
a modest maiden
a soft kiss on unconscious lips
to breathe the intoxicating perfume of distant flowers
once climbed mount olympus to barter with gods
backward and below
shifting shades of sage
take forever in my hand
jazz and jasmine
rhododendron and bourbon
my favorite ghost story is the delusion of you
scratched open my throat
planted hydrangeas on my pisiform
replaced my spinal fluid with fog
blood orange and beacon
follow me nowhere
tenderly walking into a field of lavender in white linen
follow me nowhere
this liquid heart
sneaky simpatico
it is real or represents real
a persistent pattern of gashes and cuts on planets
who am i to build an empire in a banyan tree
good morning to me and my blue rain barrel eyes
dragonfly wings and the symbolism of spring
cook my intricacies over an open fire
a flower for every thought
medieval identity
under your breath and under my sundress
glossary of echos
an ibis pecks at your liver
tears satin like my pillowcase
arms and armor
asphyxiate me with spanish moss
the breath of blue
a beautiful pool of light
breaking and broken
every frosted sprig
trying has turned me into a mattress fire
you are the most gentle bouquet i’ve ever held
inhale the particles out of me
line of ancient fire
the light which clings to the the lamppost
all birds are lost
does anyone want to swim through sunken warships with me
I am lemon on your lips a luminary citrus a burn you can't miss
some days I am a siren
warm amity and lines of desire
raindrops so heavy they play the piano as they fall
anchored at the epicenter
"glances, gleams and the fragments of things"
clouds where our organs used to be
it could be a cage
enticed and enchanted
breath; and the perfume of your fantasizes
you and every sound
we walk pause remember
work and soul
when this is over and this ends what will you write about me with your blue pen
"until you caught a glimpse of it, never before did it exist"
the new religion in your throat
shape the vision
birds fleeing from your heart
soft snow and delirium
"he is bourbon, blended smoothly with oak, amber and spice I am bubbles, sparking, with a hint of sweet citrus to guide you through the night"
one of those roses are blue
each time and all the time
the gentle breeze you left behind
lungs thick with wings and ferns
"love won’t find a way, love is lost in the swamp"
morning shame and shadow games
remember how we all turned into flowers eventually
"rosemary, pain and paper airplanes"
picking the color of sheets for an abandoned room
the breath you held
she was frosted sage and lavender
she was a secret notebook
she was the flavor blue
blowing kisses into wells
a windowless paradise
let us sing with february
blistered in beat with the stars
crashed in cadence of the waves
melted in tempo with the snow
tying bows in my veins
words like an ablation shield
you moved through me like a sad winter sky
the tonality you’ve arrived at
encounters with nature and emotion
keep drilling down
the woe that won’t let go
a shade of blue the sea couldn’t even achieve
sliced the sky open and polaroids of the nights we spent together rained down
waves ceaselessly break on the shore
what a dazzling inner glow you have
diamonds and titans
the stars within me making lists of lovers
slip your secrets under the door
the maudlin pollution of our ocean
"striking the set, a letter to the director"
but who will tend to and trim the poison ivy grown around my heart
tattered towers
the sky struggles from the sea not so delicately
back from it; hit the ground running
fade like we do
clouds formed like omens
the most representative sample
with thoughts chaotic like endangered nests
I have wilted in rhythm with every flower you’ve given me
something that can’t be changed
an agora of yes
close to time
buried images
clarity of composition
skies; and the words I write
cause and causality
corrode what is true
"according to the pain, I am embayed"
getaway car to oblivion
I love you in all the colors
literary and imaginative
"and you, gathered like books in my living room"
slept on a star just to keep warm
gently walking into a field of unidentifiable herbs
your lilac labyrinth
you rolled in like an early fog but I am lightning in the evening sky
how to deal with juxtaposition
questions that rose like masts
tempting depth out of the sea
enticing radiance out of the moon
coaxing pastels out of the sunset
vagabond ritual
how the clouds fade
blunders on loop
I want to be remembered as the kiss that turned your spinal column into a solar system
words of doubt with pages ripped out
and your pattern etched
"hello again, city of thought"
captured and coiled
as the constellations echo
devoid of daffodils
could build a battleship with the time passed
you are a shoreline that calls to me
emissions and remissions
what do you need
"and the wind, whispering names I forgot I had"
evocative of empyrean
keys kept and keys lost
an arguably healthy fantasy
imperial bones and breath
fruit and flowers for sacrifice
for what the sky knows
ebb and glow
the knots of me
the open window fortified comparison
seeds linger in the maple trees
into imagery
truth wears bare feet
a circular stairwell at a stranger’s christmas party
he calls it serendipitous
just enough to save the world with
tried to stop the waves; tried to douse the flames
lifting secrets to the sky
"it is early, yet time"
put me in your poetry
full of narrative and intrigue
a mountain of trash that turned into a park in which I play
checking in with the instances
your resonance like sea spray and fog
you may see mountains
postcards stamped with honey
"every twist, every time"
sculpted dichotomy
"at my feet, branches of winter"
making a nest out of the evening
the flavor of stardust hot when touched
"real, remembered and imagined"
the wind and a wish
the harsh light of the next day
can’t unsee the color
I give you this ghost:
a domestic exercise of longing
her face flushes with knives and silk dreams
she opens her fist to unleash a stream of sage and repository of roses
slow spiral of sometimes
her mouth was so beautiful
holding up horizons with her hands
agonoy and ecstasy
aboriginal soothsayer
beyond all reason and nature
"but you, the antidote"
"love’s scent, shades and softness"
with thick blood and thick love
keeping my soul on for you
myths and mountains
arcades and antique gardens
stirring synchronicities
the problem with poets
a coin toss for every thought
sticky and stuck
lunar pale
poignantly pink
water me well
yes and no techniques
looking through you by way of the chorus of a song
the space between heavy rains and sunshine
"sick, sad and stained"
flowers for the fragments
what a charming illusion
waiting for spring
variabilities within them
"colors, lines and words"
sent and seen
lurking landscapes
cold sparks
between the lines of illusion
kiss the ring and run
where pages were burnt and tattered
a monument of imagination
bruised lips and pirate ships
you’re such a fucking ocean
real and reeling
blame it on the twilight
flares of a hundred colors
gonna write you a love letter in the desert sands
I am real or so I think
cracked the moon open
as the treasure chest suggests
exits and ends
only time for part of the story
in a perfect world I would live on a pastel-colored cloud and write poems all day
confided and complex
all purpose patterns
bluer than an inkwell
"moonlight, sunshine and spoonfuls of honey"
"the birds know what you keep hidden, but not where"
this romantic fable
a metropolis of dents and bruises
spoon feed me stars
reclaim the angle
rebuilding with rugged rocks
speaking in silence
more ample than the sky
piano ballad blunder
could not escape the sound
put my love for you in a bottle but the enchantment’s compulsion surely shattered it
sleeping pills for my secrets
cinnamon and sentiments
elements of duality
mornings of silence and steel
the movement that confronts you
late afternoons followed me to the ocean
you are rather handsome for a terrible decision
the source and its impact
daily tour of words and meaning
wishes or weeds
it may puzzle you to discover
splintered jewels for the end of times
chains made of stones borders made of bones
introduce me to your atoms
maybe the circuitry of your heart electrocuted and erased me
"why, circles?"
my dear mountaineer
"good for some, evil for others"
come have dinner with my secrets
might fuck around and move to an abandoned lighthouse
the landscape of your love coiled in lace
"stress, strain, stillness and satisfaction"
to die like the soles of old shoes
as the future sharpens its claws
lose him with just a whisper
could have kept the dream from exploding
a map secreted inside
"you and us and me real, raw, relentlessly"
star-crossed spirals
walking property lines in my mind like tightropes
writing things and wondering
cut my throat open and hibiscus after hibiscus unfolded
trapped in a simmering bath of words
the love a welder has for torch and metal
setting the scene and the order of things
to notice and to know
if you don’t think i’m insane by now then you are definitely insane
to put me on me infinitely
"the soft light, it beats"
slow echos again
flush my cheeks and heart
"finding the bandaids, stitching the slits up in braids"
"scorched earth policy, but on the limitlessness of your language"
16 silver moons hang in our sky
mystery of infamy
the reign of incidental lyrics
patches of the past; plow what you must to make a stew
places and spaces
a recollection of sensation
I bleed phosphorescence
wine drunk can be really bad but I’ve written some cool stuff so
intimate and intricate
flowers dried out with time and so did your alibi
thank you for the rags I will use to clean the cuts of my psyche
"more open than closed, more often than not"
planting wildflowers in the cracks between piano keys
a place a feeling time is reeling but also seems to stand still
the parallel lines that don’t mind being bent
"funny how you would be chased, shot at and forced to hide for hours then be most distressed by a few dead flowers"
as the weathervane twists
didn’t want to show me his hand but now he’s shown me his whole heart
your memories have a secret admirer
words that bruise your lips
silent stars and closemouthed comets
"circling, recoiling, searching"
analogies and puzzles
up and out
"we certainly keep trying, don’t we?"
fateful and fatal fights and forces
"venom: spit, spewed, spilt and steeped"
survive the impact
how the moonlit clouds come about
"like wires, we went on forever"
a ghost on a swing sifting through the memory of things
power lines guide my heart
coalition of tragedy
get a spark in that head of yours and don’t let anyone blow it out
the pull route
the clock and the craftsman
how many names
lullaby from the sky delicate yet dignified
trees and dreams
smoke signal sonata
the blue fume of memory
ready to breathe in the rotor blade
"the other, a ship at sea"
portraying faces
always and never
plucked petals and lucky pennies
like a character in a cuckoo clock
return to warmer forms
no wings to hold
the shapeless smoke of your words
new wonder of tomorrow
neither here nor there but a place in between
a steel train with cargo of a million thoughts
how many synonyms are within you
struggling to understand but endeavoring to know
sunbathe in the sentiment
in the wake of conquest
a garden of delicate petals
that light which leaks through the window
"frayed threads, split and shred binding me to all the dead ends"
an eviction notice for all your expectations
charisma and capacity
"another human, as I am for many others"
dragging my fingers across the maze of you
gazes twist you into dirt
holding in my mouth everyone that got away
in the night or in the heart
fashioned sunset into a scarf
their sepia worlds
seeds and harvest
"gathering armfuls of rocks, wishing they were clouds"
in the spaces we sat
the oceans need the moon
show me the symbols and suffocate me with the signs
"stop, revise and analyze"
statice and suggestions
"ash and broken glass, baby"
like a ballroom without the late night
a softer wave
strange december
polaroids of vanishing moments
black holes and back aches
paint to the edges
wore the seas on your shoulders
each room in her heart a basement
feverish orbit
"awakened, we rumble"
mind over (nothing and everything) matters
hunger as deep as rain
starboard of no significance
you create a big puzzle for me
by beaches and the repetitious
contradictions and chapbooks
longing; and the moments under lock and key
cities built on mountains and ghosts
love leaves a crater
crumbled corridors
familiar aches seized the words stuck in my throat
soft tempo of light
melted dew and you
seeking a story
some things we use and some things we don’t
a personal stonehenge
so real you feel it on your skin
put the shadows down
mist on the memories
"same sun, different rays"
you be the explosion I’ll be the smoke
the peak and the plunge
ask me why it still hurts
into a story I once read
woke up in a meadow where flowers grew in the spaces of your forgotten dreams
whose split is slight then all of a sudden
temperature as sound
fusion of fable and fact
cosmic hiccups
no griping war to wage
the way your fortress crumbles
"symbols, signs and you in my mind"
four letters
ripped the past from the present
questions that rise like oceans
little petals between
such an object fits in no box
the moonlight we once knew
terrain of frenzy
watercolor and our hands
borrowing voices
the sound of a problem that is not a problem
carrying winter to the river
how do I know I’m not imaginary
caught your gaze and held it in the palm of my hand
homes to hold the screams
swells made false islands against the horizon
kitsch or commonplace
particularly amusing
which daydream best brings out the color of my eyes
the fog and the feeling
get off the internet and get into my heart
tattered edges of paper moons
lined the railroad tracks with pennies
building galaxies by way of  inconsequential realities
knives; and the definitions you rest your head on
remembering all the hues you held in your hands
fading into my poetry as time travel
hiders and seekers
reflections on rust
to keep your glimpses from sinking
floods my heart with flavor
downcast on a field of white roses
crimson; and her heart wrapped in black lace
think I would have known by now maybe I already do
turned to open or close it
the touch of wild winds
used the ocean floor as a duvet and sunk into all my dreams
gloomy and glamorous
dusk to dawn to cicatrix
veins full of icy constellations
caramelized my feelings like onions
to see it all whiten with heat
unmoored and reassembled
brazen haven and brazen refuge
toilsome tightropes and the balance of being
"what if the only place I belong is in a decaying garden, what then?"
when a scene is set
burning bridges just to keep warm
the delicacy of mark making
installed by the moon and the mind
oddities and odysseys
concept and object
as a library or lullaby
found her throat and filled it with warm benzoin
each fall and spring we see the same colors
past and future in tow
destined diversions
ruts and rancor
an autumn wind breezes through your heart
moments melt to memories
disobedient deja vu
connect the do/t(hought)s
she is an uncut drug
the very storm of you
candor’s conclusion
burnt edges of misconception
the mystic slip
nighttime and the house empty
skipping rocks and skipping heartbeats
muddled to a puddle
midnight coiled around me
the outer banks of time
ask questions of the audience
afternoon thieves
trying to sunbathe but growing moss instead
secrets looped around her lips
a day full of rivers
not forever but for now
your words on my tastebuds
windswept and wandering
circling frozen seas
"page one, page nothing"
sailor of the dreamscapes
from lightning bolts to forest fires
hard to find and that’s what makes it treasure
sirens; and the broken bottles beneath our feet
twisted my heart into a greenhouse
these submerged ships
set down before a palace
cinnamon; and our worlds turning in reverse
a smattering of trials and tribulations
at your flustered fingertips
because pictures lack words
determined dial
slept in a lake of indecision
peeling apart petals of flowers and picking at my scabs
the hands that held you captive
make me a star so that I may burst into dust
"disasters and the cruelty of your love, darling"
brilliant little blunders
what remains of statues
gather all that you can to make sense of it
from the page to the spine
sometimes wonder whether to start with one or the other
lights that turn you wordless
the play between texture
"not for now, but for later maybe"
power of what or of whom
heart still steamy from the heat of july
"on her lips, sage and clover"
demolished by delirium
it helps the intention
like a galaxy except he’s a person
a causality of poetry
whose source looks like it’s coming from the west
sunset or something
climbing forgotten fortresses just to kiss you
she is the golden glow the town presented when illuminated at night
she is the sea salt winds of the shore
she is a linen letter soaked in the black ink of ornate quill pens
she is a fairytale that fell off the page
she is death in the winter
she is a kingdom of petals
"in her throat, some province"
demote the timekeeper
two on the porch
mountain of metal
his whispers hold my wrists
geometry would be pure
daggers and the fragrance of night and all its stars
but will the moon forgive you
a mouthful of poems
definitions and daydreams
black and blue and you
get out of my lungs
from everywhere
perforate the want
biography of bourbon
nights that broke us worse than death
who has more fun?
when devoured by the sun
building forts in the distance between us
shadows to convey depth
storybook central
me: drifting through time him: drifting through space
tiny towers
plagiarize my passion
relinquished roulette tables
love resembles the scribbles you make on the back of an envelope with a pen that is running out of ink
what's a wound without the scab?
life and all its occurrences
corollary and consequence
move! so you don’t block the sun
to bite my tongue or shout so loud my teeth fall out
couldn’t wake up by your side because we never went to sleep
complexities spilled in sand
the greatest depths and distances
the scurrying possession of deception
"as it turns out, I’m just a story written for a stranger"
cakes and layers
there was dancing and delusion
enmeshed in vines and drifting
write me a dream that’s 11 hours and 6 minutes long
an entirely different perspective the longer I gaze
slept with your letter
"carve me into pieces, your mosaic"
crawling down courses of cobblestone
rude of you to dream without me
make a peace offering out of stone-colored skies
"cloud nine, nothing but fallacy vapor"
"the mvp, the most valuable pipe dream"
connect outside the chaos
it’s easy to find things
a poet’s correspondence
glass skies and rumors
chasing whitecap waves and dreams
mornings and seductive suns
you should never believe anything you read on the internet expect for what I’m saying right now
sext: date me for content
sext: please stop subtweeting me
the most in the most sense of most
absolve your curiosities
baseball and bubblegum
your only chance to know
when the hero surrenders
wash the shades of sage out of me
propagating dandelions between the pillars
the chill or the burn
a note on the binding design
banished to be broken glass
empty stories
let’s investigate the first line of luck
who wishes to witness lust and love battle in the ring that is my sternum
shipwreck for a different ocean
sabotage the storm drain
strategy is up to you
something about a bishop and a pawn
forgot about the second gate
got mixed up in your edges
while you weren’t sleeping
double the destiny
I would like to be stardust when I grow up
the light keeps me on
all obstructed avenues
my little metronome
bundle my body in vanilla and sage
swallowed it to save it
how do you even hold this
seen the town
a lot of people just want to talk about themselves and I just want to listen
multitude of pleasant things
drawn tight against his teeth
give the arc
filtered grit makes a pearl
a smile conspiring against you
"everyone, brush the hair off my lunar face and kiss my bruised lips"
with tides that twist
spun out of the spiral
the fourth wall can’t hold me back
many moments
let the feeling overflow
lobotomized words for your delicate linguist
take what you need from me
the consequence of battle
truth or dare
a place in between
follow the path to where separate realms meet
a planet bites your lip and cuts your tongue
stalking shadows
stream of consciousness like a pistol shot
sugar on my wounds
who is this under my knife?
pull it and braid it together with charming betrayal
a touch of novelty
planting irises in the spaces between your words
nature got me first
fresh faced and floral
an eviction notice for all your insecurities
improve the intent
and what it feels like to swim in it under a big floating moon
with eyes the color of the nighttime ocean
the sun is replaced by a dusty cocoon
it doesn’t matter that it doesn’t matter
more intimate and soft than the moss between stepping stones
the beckoning crest of waves
shibari on a flower mound
all programs expire
past my bedtime and past my senses
dress it up to make it yours
spun to tender ashes without ever having been aflame
pine and palms and pearls and prescient
to see what is possible
is your back against the night?
river of subject matter
you’ll find it in the poetry
in a lavender field with all my secrets
throat fucked the light and it turned my voice into a pearl
can’t tell me never
tempt the direction
venus rules everything around me
various twists of light
playing with your point of view
soft clouds and tranquility
unknot the hours
destiny and its detour
holding hands and promises
maybe this will be the day a cloud collapses on me
no one can fall from a star better than you can
offer not available anywhere
drive your teeth into my complexities
choke my mind
an enigma in her restfulness
oblivion for breakfast
temporary desires and future consequences
let’s hear all those voices
things that seem to be off but fit
he wants to murder ulysses
the keeper of the pixels
lay me down on a knoll of blue florals and frosted citrus
vilify my assumptions
cull my intricacies with the edge of a haunted dagger
slam my skull into the snow
dig my intuition out with your fingertips
use the steam from my words to draw yourself a bath
crush my sternum like parched burgundy petals
soak my skin in blue ink and watch me camouflage with your love letters and myths
destroy us!! eat my wires. wrap the electricity around you like a noble robe and walk into a lavender sea to sink in shock. let them say we died from unnatural causes
unhinge my atoms with some serrated knife
continued variations on the ocean floor
it’s a small world (war)
but is there enough soup
narrator’s trap
two weeks like two years like two days
edges of electrons
your words melted onto my skin like honey
with the certainty of tides
crimson is the format
near or not so far
yet not above redemption
to win against thunderstorms
"the beautiful, rich and rare"
I will deal with your aperture later
mystery loves company
to have on (or in) hand
our paddle
relentless reverence
spilt and said
it’d be cool if you’d place a straw in my heart and absorb it out of my body
next breath
the seagrape you speak of
the archer and the yes
swerve appeal
who was in my room last night?
pouring your sighs into my morning coffee
"dig it, captain"
high hopes plummet to the ground
under blows of fate
any words before I snatch your soul?
she is the edge of space
she is an art heist
she is amber and lemon
wicked little rubik’s cube eyes
an honest feel and fragrance
lady luck will rescue you in time
lust to trust to dust
causes and circuses
inflatable guidance
snow globes in the summer
some side effects to spacing
*hides tnt in lingerie drawer*
if she’s looking up
curled up in a mint leaf
you will receive her as part of the setting sun
a memory travels towards you
the sphere you must flatten
popular passages
two texts engraved
not in the notion
shredded by hands or by gods
there is a thing that happens
given the obligation of the rain
secrets within secrets
gratitude as the default response to everything that ever happens
back to autumn’s intention
only possible in having left
"in the dark, everyone sees the auroral light between us"
no circles nor skies
what are you doing in my queue
gladiolus field of dreams
pearl earrings everywhere
puddle of words
no such sailor
melts in your mouth or in the sun
laying down with your old revolver
stained with various shades and stories
united with both
chasing ghosts
the button system
parallel lines as logs for the campfire
hot when dark
like a canary out of hell
the same as the sand
going crazier than the moon
more doors
subtract my bones
about to crush and swallow your mythology whole
defined by the daylight
"felt cute, might shoot up reality later"
I am the stardust on your collarbone
to insanity and cities
breathing in gravity’s smoke
wishbone theory
flugurant fantasy
thoughts that wake with you in the morning
can of heartworms
a basin of diluted thought
the puzzle of personality
used the last light of the sun to keep you warm at night
explain the switch
messenger and mindset
forfeited eunoia
"ready, willing and most days able"
ambiguous interval
spaces soaked in electric shock
andromeda without perseus
responses to both
rome wasn’t built in a day but what an impact a day can have
north star of no dimension
what did loyalty ever get the dog
either he is or I am
when nightfall extinguishes
pernicious promises
everyone knows the world is small and humming with static
the power of being reminded
silently and vastly
"all rings, no circles"
all that’s in my stomach are vitamins and nostalgia
or was the essence red wine and rosemary
the lunar gloss on your skin stays silver
what becomes the middle
let bygones relentlessly burn it all down and be bygones
the abrupt color of your oceans
put on a pretty face for the internet city
she is frosted sage and lavender
she is a secret notebook
she is the flavor blue
"no distortion, just destiny"
exposed to fourteen questions
glow after dreaming
I just want to eat words and galaxies
original but in poor condition
part two includes me sitting up
bruise it this way
the sun has an excellent memory
profane and poetic
blasphemy pursued
wounded by the remedy
new feelings for old souls
an avenue of questions
blushing bones
inherent in the process of sharing
echoes esurient epistemology
under delicate rivers and under her sundress
you are putting my eye exactly where you want it
as in a lord or ruler
asked when but forgot why
enchanting errors
length and longing
under the moon or in the shade
a certain point to a better point
her radioactive midnights
the boundary where artistic reality ends
tell them when to sing
sweeping up forgotten petals
they look up and showdown
her spirit lingers in the corals
equal parts everything
the rotten middle
art or arcana
vanquish or redeem
these guided days
head in the rainclouds
reality bends
herbaceous overtones
tried to speak but all that fell from my mouth were mint leaves and lemons
generating bridges
giggle moon
acquired color
more remembered than recreated
wind chimes and white lies
funny little ferns
playing cat and mouse with the sun
"their piquancy, a welcome addition"
it’s all hunt and peck but never the thrill key
ambient noise bundles into a full moon
skimming the surface for answers
sorrow and stimulation
tasting toxic nectar
3 planes and where they land
wield the moments of
through the lens of your story
"more color, more outrage"
found forgiveness in a foxhole
making the night more velvet than indigo
assumed the character of orthodoxy
rainstorms weary of battle
and here we have the garden you crumpled with your tired hands
thoughts untrapped
repeated stance
the formulation of self
release and repeat
varying journeys
vague forms refuse to give away any specific origin
the light is coming
morning begins to bloom
the parts are written
for the purpose of poetry
and a matchbox lodged in her heart
elements of empathy
rose gold remembrance
non-negotiable daybreak
"stop, drop and earthshine"
7 medley sins
often with reference
colored with secrets told at midnight
hijinx abound
ashes of enchantment
there is a thing that happens
green plants and trees to roses and rich fabrics
exotic birds and car crashes
surges of conclusions
meander in the corners of my mind
critiques that have gone before
things said/words read
the focus is one of depth
this configuration
who is troubled by the inclusion of the street sign?
a unifying element
the variety of shapes
visual activity
more questions than answers
farewells echo gently in the valley
words and time amok
as a storyline or as a puzzle
what else is encoded here?
light; and a silver quality to it
kick the hearts into the water or bend over to pick them up
a definite sense of rising
feet and concrete
from a different part
coil out the data
"the gentle, the dreamy and the gravitas"
an oasis of alternatives
honest-to-goodness
"the antidote, sublingually"
quixotic alibis
just a little crosshatching
freytag’s pyramid of mud and sticks
purple: the pulse of her heart
september’s breath on your neck
burnt my tongue on my own desire
"why, circles?"
"evocative of champagne and the nighttime sea, you are"
"the summer pushes you away, but not before giving you a secret kiss on the cheek"
rhythm and reason
a sigh of mist and moss
calculating the percentage of the shorelines never walked
consciousness and consequences
he grew into his neon electricity
a bubble and a burst
the forest's circuitry consumes you
trowels that dig newborn stars out of the sky
my life is hot and full of hustle
still asking
dynamic spaces
the notes left in margins of my heart and mind
galaxies we only dream of
clamor of cognition
portals and mirrors for irises
distinct and unexpected
mambo with the past and all its flavors
light blue sounds
a globe filled with change and challenge
she is an enticing thorn set against a gentle sky
she is a lung of rosemary and a deep breath
she is cinnamon infused honey
ravenous realizations
drinking tea with sirens
the danger of doing this
urged by the weather
the slope of shattered pieces
a complicated embellishment
the spellbinding space between sky and sea
a forgotten flower fragrantly blooms
wood for the fire of the bright side
kaledoscopic nostalgia
slightly unconventional
a narrative sense
"eyes, look to you"
does romanticizing everything count as exercise
to do with desire
an algothrim in your avenue
all the time — and then — none
a lighthouse flickers inside your chest
storms that bruise the sky
waves breaking in a floral teacup
the result is refreshing
hollow skyscrapers
guidance is the format
a violent fruition
"wonderful poems, playful mood"
is it a beat or a philosophy?
holding hands and holding promises
in this reformation
a rose gold revelation
politely potted perspective
intuition is a gleaming garden
within the deep horns and drumbeat
ok so everyone loves the twitter you but what about the real you
this town is dry of booze and love
never borrowed; so old and then so new
serving tea in the lounge inside you
hot summer concrete
imaginative bouquets of blended word petals
infinite loop sabotage
plus a third dimension — depth
shade each other glow in the dark
like hammers commanded to never stop
struck to soil when the metropolis crumbled
conversations between ideas
a variety of possible responses
"my turn to sing, cricket"
indigo was the evening
happy anticipation
gravity of the moon and memory
load the mission statement
as happy as we are ancient
alter what you already know
rooted and recalculated
found myself in opal
genuine and unnatural — simultaneously
"another day, another kale chip"
immediate language
for being enigmatic
mass derailment
as we know this
rhythmic reminders
sacrificing blunder for bedtime
is the morning
discern what is the truth
never raised for combat
holding court in your dominant hand
she is all of these things that she is
memorials for every time you died metaphorically
toothless and a little agitated
my back is bad but my heart is good
I can see our past from here
a little mischief and a lot of play
pitfalls to avoid
storm-struck the soul
"are you going to fill your throat with fog, fruit and flowers or what"
connections and concepts
precision owns the night
squaring up with Saturn
that isn’t what I mint
finding corners
time fills me with time
remember when you anticipated rain but it never came?
wide open windows
memories faded to folklore
the power of unpopular words
tweets in the twinight
a lover’s lexicon
alternating awakenings
"flypaper, baby"
an exceptional pulse
muse seekers and beekeepers
such an object fits in no box
brass-bound abjuration
an arrow for her heart
monumental colors
spoon feed the secrets of the stars to me
the space between
pruned and pure
warm evening raspberry sky
sounds of contentment penetrate the almost night
feel like I need to live in an enchanted garden asap
fantasies not forbidden
where do the paths lead now
therein lies the theme and the undertaking
at some happy point
subtle honors
an interesting room
in the interest of time
a misty reminder
follow the sirens and follow the stars
required catharsis
dead men and their deeds
greet dawn for what
breathing and being in the shadow of what I am
a trite transition
imperative wires
life shifts swiftly
fell in love and left a crater
priceless pipedream
gesture to the edges
back to where were we?
dream bandits
intentionally blank
phantomed friends
this is that
intricacy of memory
leaking light and transience
resolved not to
as rushed as the train
it was real
refuse to recoil
I’ll be the moon
[old timey music echos in the gallery]
hearts that break like fevers
damn for a minute I thought I finally figured out how to unfollow myself
rings on the table where a coaster should be
a revolution in your teapot
deep in the debris of dreams
are you made out of lightning dear
rain of no significance
twinkle of time
obstruction like this
maybe this will be the day a palm tree falls on me
communicating audibly
sincere values
understanding petals
thought bubbles like clouds
tea and flowers line my heart
composed of chaotic cognition
the foundation of forward motion
read it and leap
dancing in the space that’s between us
reluctant radio waves
"vanished moments, regained"
inherent in each of us
water the empathy lily
good night and dream fragrantly
the drum of light
a lively performance or deep cry
relentlessly rebounded
peace and a purpose
colliding with a shadow
excursions that keep on
overrun by the morning
in voids we trust
preaching to what's new and what's next
chaotic ecosystems where flowers still grow
one word for ten
ten words for one
dismiss the details
longing for the cheap wine drunk of gallery openings
drained by those unfilled
lights flickering in rhythm with your heart beat
to kiss the whiskey off your lips
"like real life, but prettier"
to the key and where it fits
life(in)style
recently familiar
intermission to the dream
to carefully uncork bottled messages
miles and hours between us
themed of you
letters of love and crime
girl of a hundred names
everything is intertwined and floral
clues to connection
somewhere between scientific observation and romantic idealism
a mere moment
untrustable to strike a match on
to both eyes and soul
battered bandwidth
the folds of a fever
steeping secrets
connected to disconnection
engineered purely
botany of desire
generative principle
time to adjust
habitual numbers
floral morals
circling mysteries
of life and living
melted and muddled
they will be what they are
captivated by whims
sedated sparkle
twirling with the summer breeze
sunlight; fair and fresh
tethered compass
"varied, but powerful"
between clay and the desert
urgency and a real desire
changing tales
sound + glow
sweeping fallen petals into delicate hands
the way the thunder screams your name
crossing off the clout
many paths to poetry
drizzled with stardust
songs and stories
think of the things I’ve had for years
self care is revolutionary
harmony interruptus
through the windows of these thoughts
wheel of fortitude
the woe that won’t let go
set free from clouds and rain
cracked like ceramics
rhythmic words and tides
all I see is pearling rain
medicinal horns
and so we’ll touch the sun
flavorful and fearless
proud new world
perfumed with affection
indigo skies flatter you
bright ideas in dim rooms
"a shared, concious lullaby"
heat on the heart
finer daydreams
laying in lavender fields in May
synthetic spaces
resolve the function
unkept city
"do not tether, but do disturb"
echoing reminders
disjointed spirits
edge of reason
and on her soul: fossilized war paint
at the mercy of hurried weather
"grand, grey and storm-struck"
as the oracle hums with morning
ok so I’ll cozy up in time and a bottle
the root of it
stray petals
a world that’s not imaginary
bathed in definition
how venus paints her canvas
confines of conversation
a honeyed moon
the universe in your rear-view mirror
shedding the antlers of daybreak
these hands that hold the future
love letters addressed to forgotten galaxies
caring and curly
there’s nothing to eat but your heart
intertwined edges of bliss
encounters with modern-day nomads
silent saboteur
the fuck up factor
the cracked maw of feelings
mambo through the nightmare
surrender to the scars
sending out feelings
bedtime babbles
the marble vs. the uneven table
new reminder
i have to say weird stuff or I’ll die
the brooding middle
multilayered symphonies
among other nowheres
"i wish i could have my summer and eat it, too"
empty bridges
castles are better than people
deviant arrangement
lingering alibi
summer soul or solace
the weapon is sweet
for those who are wistful and visionary
all alone in my mouth
the purpose of periwinkle
somewhere between the moon and the mountain
like a poem except he’s a person
bad art for bad people
a number we know well
surfing in pools of adoration
don't forget about the hog plum
screaming tea kettle of love
dainty morning of blue
new names but the same appetite
a sculpture within
collaborate with nature
politicizing an echo
the preferred mood
"slow down, tidewater eyes, we’ve got all day"
how anxious are you on a scale from one to me
a playful sort of darkness
citrus soul
a shade of gold I don’t understand
bond together by delusion
"undressing and mincing fresh, sticky garlic is a form of therapy"
are you strategically placed?
candlelit iniuition
"said to be eloquent, and was"
"moody, yet innocent"
an undeniable silhouette
make the cut
eureka moment
palm and pine
follow the overheard power lines
like a three ring circus of illusion and glamour
that may never enervate
noir-shaded minutes
all the perfect things and plots
an agreeable shade of gray
"bring it, play it, appreciate it"
fill the abandoned spaces with strawberries and lemongrass
an electrical storm in your heart
you only live and die multiple times
use to drink wine but now I drink flower petals and dust from the pages of old books
jungle flowers
mostly abundant
off the rails and the beaten path
degree in signs
from electronics to emotion
a necessary introspection
rambling reflection
impressively hushed
"translucent times, baby"
roses and proses
curious daffodils
in love with a column of sunlight
scaled buildings
ink diet
clasping the cupboard
does anyone in Florida want to move into the sky with me
revised wisdom
the mission overtakes the mantra
and now: anew
unanswerable iota
sounds of a salient summer
recommended for removal
"no one has ever looked at a sunset and said, “I wish it was more beige”"
reincarnated and right
synced up and symbolic
tiny universe
gently drifting in the tide
sewing the strange ripples together
align with the waters
and again
out of the screens and into the stars
a thin but dutiful comfort
revisit the words
use existing data
the nature of configuration
to the beat of everything you've ever known
"a new name, a different shade"
in the cove of wandering light
satin remedies
this is not the floral forest in which you once slept
unfinished fantasies
pumpkins and peacock feathers
an eviction notice for all your fears
sprawling city of intuition
true but not fact
fabricated and false
wake up and smell the routine
modern mind mosaic
the duality that unknowingly operates
i read it in a book
when dusk hits like this
"breathing, questioning and logic"
the dream sellers
playing truth or dare with a rain cloud
threw your letters in the lake
and in rhythm: heartbeats
tango with the turbulence
new divisions
motives matter
decorum and decisions
above average excellence
grapefruit and gratitude
a response generated
dial tone mouth
bubble and burst
"is there anything more perfect than sticky, fresh garlic? she sighed"
pages of digital diraries that cannot be found
"we keep trying, don’t we?"
wrestle gently in the basin
miles away from a shining light
a skein of memories tugged together to deliver a new one
soak in the wings
a pulsing past
down the boulevard of smoke and mirrors
wires and coils
nostalgic for sirens
bouquet of impulse
once again dancing on piano keys
ambushed by a soul search
rearranging the glance and the gleam
erupting into all the notes a piano can play
a temporal atmosphere
lemons and electric switches
"steamy, unjuried galaxy"
beyond the conveyance of facts
infinite formations
"climb on the words, crash on the meaning"
too many plots
ghosts that won’t stay dead
this message is brought to you by the setting moon
how many synonyms are within you
hey good morning - you all are dearly loved
there are endless boulevards of phosphorescent moonlight inside of you
digging a hole in you
delicately sipping raindrops
gravity and its consequences
time is fleeting but also seems to stand still
mind under new management
a shower and a soft kiss
are you swimming in twisted jasmine again?
conclusions and conversations
words that sing and words that sear
marvel of language and insights
french doors opening to the sky
watercolors bleeding with you
tell me about the strangers you remember
birds gently chirping the truth
don’t be rude to my carrots
buried in my lavender past
sweeping daybreak into a teacup
bidder pattern
facts and figures or friendly fiction?
your new neon
some people want all the rain
a love so elevated it makes the skies jealous
love or above
inexplicable nostalgia
folding up tessellations
abandoned batches
forevers that glow in the dark
a flame in your pocket
"very delicate, but not very gentle"
from air and light
no sip nor glow
cage the wind
the window is small but it is ours
the loot and its associated data
new visuals
out of the shadows and into the theme
room with a bloom
exclamations and a floating daffodil
pierce the clouds with a kiss
raindrops for safekeeping
thunderstorms outside and in
lonely philosopher
painting portraits over delusions
morning thoughts are fractional
an equinoctial elixir
betwixted and bewildered
imminent pieces into gemstones
crawl free from the riddle
a transfixed formula
🥬

more tomatoes than god
big dichotomy energy

a satin footpath to the stars
hot tea for a hot thought
garlic rules everything around me
weave the words
secrets between your skin and the sea
eyes heavy like the first storm of summer
a garden's blind eye turns to you
dainty tuberose pep talk
what it takes and what it took
adorned with library dust
dare i depart?
synthetic years
the sun does not forgive
my life is hot and sweet
"stop, drop and morning"
life in reverse
wrapped up in a petal
activities for the idle
there are other lives within you that will carry on their own

(s)word(s)
somewhere between letting you in and padlocking each and every inch of me
alternative guise
endure the hour of a thousand answers
a delicate sanctuary
contact in the most ordinary ways
let the breeze go rogue
an apricot entrance
rose quartz crater
words that hang like wind chimes
21 summers and it’s still a myth
like vines braided around my earthly heart
finicky flowers
back in the saddle of a janky high horse
"hurry, before they download us all"
narrative transportation
to warn us of gravity and epiphanies
a duel against the clock
wired to a match
avoid the land mines
"refuse to hide the beautiful, uncaring night"
we will drink peach nectar and trade secrets in a garden
creating is what keeps me going and that is a spiritual thing
more resolute than destiny
talk to me about what you know
along comes tomorrow
growing roots and growing closer
fluent in fennel
communicating complexities
sweltering oasis of lucid dreams
science of what
herbal brain freeze
moonlit mouth
sleepy planet
under the marquee and moment
the world is such a big circle
slightly incessantly
bottled reveries
bottomless sphere
the rules of spaghetti
wrapped up in mahogany
the quaint and the curious
copy and taste
lipstick in the arsenal
clerodendrums blooming on the staghorn
show me your staghorn
astral plane safari
varnish on the table that will last longer than us all
open your mind like a window leading to the moon
open your heart like french doors leading to a garden
absorbed by narratives and the light
fresh brewed feelings
fractal melancholy
cherry red nail polish to hold hands with traitors
share stories and philosophies
vines and glory
failed bandwidth on a dandelion wish
kiss my face to taste the stardust
learn the names of strangers
late night hand grenade
citrus rules everything around me
flipping through forgotten pages
the chapel of childlike instincts
working from the moon. hustling a nebula.
unsubscribe to the fog and the feeling
please only talk lowercase to me
and here we have the seas you never drank
don’t you want to face the sun?
parsley and promise
envy the inexplicable foliage
my favorite inevitability
dispelled by drums and disguise
a shipwreck for an outlawed ocean
i keep you in a red velvet box and in a wish
an archive of every word ever spoken

dirty hoards
early morning feelings crew
happy birthday audrey hepburn
mountains may be removed with words
"charred, emerging from your amorous fire"

"Hear that? It's Monday, it's coming at us from all corners."
Good morning from bae's
Dates a personal banker... Counts on fingers to conclude total with tip
"I want to crawl into every nook of your cranium, and cuddle and read the books of your intuition"
Sometimes I drink myself sane
"I put my love for you in a bottle, but the enchantment's compulsion surely shattered it"
I needed you to destroy me once more
How robotic of you
"We may not select our feelings, but we select our behaviors"
"Is there anything better than Ikura popping in your mouth, she sighed"
Puffy Paint is so forgiving
Chronic Tweet-Deleter
His Waking Words
"In the moment of last night or reflect this morning, bae suffers yet boasts his lady will always be the most enticing &amp; seductive at the bar"
God vs Football
"When your darling kisses your forehead and heart before leaving for work in the mornings, is truly an inspired moment"
"Impressions are impressions, judgements come after"
You are blindly optimistic
Yes
I'm going to kiss your face as hard as assault
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
The only D I thirst are diamonds
"Tell me stars, who will give you love?"
I just feel the thoughts that wake with you in the morning are the most significant of the day
"I look forward to the cold, so I can snuggle in sweaters the way I do under the duvet"
You must be who you are today
"And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit"
"Listening to the best station driving home, windows down, the wind, the cars, the bugs. The music of life's blood and sounds."

All I Want For Christmas is Silence
I hope you weren't expecting me to be capable of reutrning any of the feelings I've been encouraging in you
self-proclaimed greatest
"I love penny loafers, I don't care"
Most ghosts thrive inside us
Dreamt dreams that parallel Audrey Hepburn film plots
I'd love to know what I'm thinking
"I keep running into you, within words and ideas"
ANALYZE EVERYTHING IN CAPS LOCK
Yuengling and YSL
I consume him
"this is the size, i believe, of the empire state"
de . vote . ed
It's like you play tight end on my heart
The best part is we paint the future more than we discuss the past
"Yes, like Mary Shelley"
"Falling, by its nature, involves letting go of all control"
"Words are not random, words are everything, especially ammunition."
Cuddling makes me uncomfortable #unpopularopinion
I wish football season would end so your heart would work for me again
I can tell something's wrong by the fact I just drank vodka
"Do as I say, not as I do"
Low self-esteem does not exist when lace leotards do
Savings
I guess what I'm asking is if you can tell the difference between the absence of my voice and silence
*hides tnt in lingerie drawer*
words = ammunition
I show myself out way before I'm invited in
I like to be on top. In every sense.
Text me a dirty picture of your intelligence.
Each Time a Piece of Fabric is Touched
Can of (heart) worms
