[Hook]
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless

[Sample]
"Look, most of us are on the dole
We can't even afford, mate, to pay for bands
There's good bands in there, you know?"

Just jumped offstage, half dazed, half hyped
Late Saturday night, let's not be here for the ugly lights
Something might be bumpin' down at the local jive
I'm open to it man, as long as I can socialise
With some exotic types, let's spit this drunken lingo
I got more penny pinchin' than a session at Kinko's
I'm kinda skint though, where's the cab splitters?
Grab the last of the rider to bribe the fence sitters
Stepsisters as it turns out, lecherous things
The kinda late night venue exodus brings
She wear a g-string well, like an inch above her belt
And if the lights are on at home, man, you really couldn't tell
And she fell down shouting, friends all pouting
'cause the bartender cut them off at ten (but who's counting?)
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here
Yeah, it's time to bail
And so I'm flailing for a cab seven cats and Dale's base amp
Can you fit five, and two in the boot?
It's not far (come on son, fuckin' get in the car)
'cause a fight had just erupted over Fords and Holdens
Get pissed, punch on, take it back to what's golden
Wallet and the phone, keys, check, yeah, got 'em
Shirt still sweaty and wet, but no problem
The taxi almost hit a punter as we run the red
Overdrunk, underfed, ready for anything
[Chorus]
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless

"I'm really digging this ??
I'm really into it! You like the sound of ??"

So what you reckon fellas, after-party at the warehouse
Yeah, nah, fuck that, what was it called?
You know the joint we were supposed to have our names on the door
My guts are spinning', progcrumb, it'll be chockers for sure!
That's bullshit! Man, what you knockin' it for?
Nah, cuz, I can't wait to see you rockin' the floor
A little shockin' and awe, kitty cat to get your paws on
The clientele here are bound to drop your drawers for sure, son
Watch the bartender as he carefully pours
1, 2, 3, hey, next round's on me
4, 5, 6, 7, hey, hang on, cunts!
(But I saw you on the Hottest 100 once!)
Woaoh! the dizzying heights of fame
And though we met, and you said it before, I've forgot your name
It really doesn't matter, maggots look the same when it's late
And, yo, I'm gonna take these mackin knees and give 'em a shake
And so I move across the room like an octopus
A spectacle of chaos, checking out the view through the binoculars
Opposite the bar side door, trying to sneak in
Some trashed cunts we lost at the start of the weekend..
[Sample]
(game over dude! That's it, Goose, you're out!)
(Ha ha, "goose")

[Chorus]
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless

"So, do you like to do stuff and stuff? You know, I like to do to do stuff.."
"Uhh, I guess, I don't know, I like some stuff, you know, um, shit I don't know"

Degenerated into a free-for-all, sleazes ball
The people all writhing, dudes in leather tights high-fiving
Making requests, DJ, behind the decks, man he's shaking his head
He says, "you're breaking my balls." Baby, fuck your Nutbush!
Took a wild swing at him, it didn't do much good
And you can bash the DJ while we're smashing it
The bouncer said, "You pissed kid?", I said, "Nah, I'm passionate!"
But the dregs didn't notice, they were deep in conversation
Trying all their best lines, for a night's accommodation
And when the house lights come on, it's just me and you
And maybe a friend, and maybe this is not the end
And still I'm making a dent, in a kick-kick-en kebab
The best late night minced meat you ever had
[Sample]
"Um, yeah, nah, nah dude, I gotta go, there's my ride!"
"Everyone else seems to be having a good time"

[Chorus]
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless
And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless
