Curse the Flesh LyricsBeing has overwhelmed the space between the silence of eternity
Vision has intruded upon the light that pours through me, my energy
Substance has veiled, the pleasures long lost, the beauty of emptiness
This very flesh confines, and spoils this demon's seed
Waiting to light, A dead sky aflame
To suffocate, to rejoice in your misery
This waiting it seems, for so long I've yearned to see
The burning flesh of your humanity
Your withering flesh, I've longed to see
May you fall to never again arise
May you cease to ever again be
May your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
Pleading, churning, drowning
Pleading, dying, burning
The Treachery Returns to the Betraying Eyes
Your Betrayers cries, fall to unyielding ears
And oh how it came to be, That you would pray to me
That you would beg to me, that this curse not come to be
That you would plead. That this curse not be released
May you fall to never again arise
May you cease to ever again be
May your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
Pleading, churning, drowning
Pleading, dying, burningEmbed
