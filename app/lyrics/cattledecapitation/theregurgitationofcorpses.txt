One day, the earth must vomit as sewers and cemeteries intertwine into one
The spitting up of the dead--regurgitated!
The fumes of the rot--exhumated!
The unsettling nature of decomposition
Flesh is flesh
The ground is wet with death
A plague of undead disease

Jellified organic mannequin
Cold and green muscle striations
What once was life--rebirth through death
The ground opens up at your feet
The fetid smell of sinew-vomiting the rot
Carriers of violent disease
Acids in your stomach expelled-dissolving the dead
Tracheal, purulent release
Upchuck on the maggot-lined trunk
The beautiful act of blowing the chunk

From the earth, they'll arise
Regurgitation of corpses
Vomit...decay
The regurgitation of corpses
