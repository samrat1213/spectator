Experimental pathogens, a devils design
The dark side of science breeds a weapon of war
Contagious killing and internal distress
Homicide or suicide will be the cause of death
Internal organs altered by the disease
Your brain disabled by the constant pain
Erratic actions lead my thoughts to the blade
I've lost control, I've lost control

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Stabbing compulsion overwhelms my mind
Terrorized screaming follows the thrust of my knife
I wrench the blade from the chest to the crotch
Organs and entrails fall to the ground

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague

Unable to be seen but with the visible effect
Virulent disease causing outbreaks of violence
They tear themselves apart, offal covers the ground
Viscera torn forcefully from the abdomen
Intestines slick with blood cannot escape my grip
Surgical incisions give way to frenzied carving
Delirium has taken hold, disembowelment is complete
Horror grips my mind, my entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands...
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Disease will spread and cover the world
Mass insanity, the end of our time
Scavengers will eat the remains of man
Our extinction was by our design

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague
