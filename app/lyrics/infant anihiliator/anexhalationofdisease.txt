All the Blood from the bodies collects then irrigates through the
soil. It flows through the cracks of the earth then drips to the
demons below, just waiting to be unleashed by the blood of the chosen
Christ. His blood shall set them free. Beneath this sacred ground lies
the gate to their dimension, amidst the molten bowls of the earth.
Once the chosen blood touches to their lips the gates open; our
dimensions amalgamate, transporting them to earth to rule with me
forever. Without the chains of their translucency my flesh burns away
to reveal my true form as God. I am Belial; the serpent has shed his
skin. I have deceived the world as a servant of God. With the church I
have prepared my own thrown. It was easy to fool them all with my
disguise. As they looked into my eyes they never saw the serpent
beneath the surface, waiting for his moment to strike. I have brought
forth hell to earth just to show God what itâ€™s worth. His kingdom
shall rot forever. I have no sympathy for God.
