There is no afterlife
We all just decompose
No Heaven's pearly gates
Just tags upon our toes

A slow putrescence
From the time the life is shorn
Feast of the maggots
Reborn

Wet and adipocerous
Our flesh turns into wax
Enter hypostasis
Pale skin discolored black

Regeneration
When life has adjourned
Insect infestation
Our favors are returned

When from this world we are unbound
We're food for the worms
When they plant me in the ground I'm
Food for the worms

The reaper beats at the gate of every man
Lies fill the Bible, Tanakh and Quran
It matters not which dogma you believe
Our bodies are left to rot like fallen leaves
The circle of life, it marches on
We fertilize the ground we walk upon
Feast for the vultures' all that's left
While hope spring eternal for the bereft

The throes of rigor mortis
Forensic certainty
Heaven, Olam Ha-Ba
Fairy tales of lunacy

We're vessels for the larvae
Not vessels for the soul
Transform to liquefaction
Make all nature whole
