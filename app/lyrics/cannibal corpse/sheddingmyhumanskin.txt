Up from the depths of creation
To dwell among a world for the weak
Confined to this creature of foreign flesh substance
Reformed from within
A savage conclusion impending
Demonic invasion of a dominant hierarchy

Alternate paths of temptation
In tongues an evil purity will speak
Symbolic redemption through an imminent transformation

Human in form but not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn
Human in form, a vicious rebirth from not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn

Slow slicing
Mutating through the blood
Self carving
Erupting from within

Shedding my human skin
Shedding my human skin
Shedding my human skin
Shedding my human skin
Skin
My human skin

Human in form but not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn
Human in form, a vicious rebirth from not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn

Savage conclusion impending
In tongues an evil purity will speak
Demonic invasion of a dominant hierarchy
