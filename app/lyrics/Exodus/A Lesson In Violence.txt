[Verse 1]
If you got something to say
Then come my way
I'm guarded by Satan
I'm riding on Baphomet
I'll teach you a lesson in violence
You won't soon forget
The pleasure of watching you die
Is what I will get

[Chorus]
Fight - for what you believe to be right
Crushing with all your might
I laugh at their pitiful cries
They run from the fire in my eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing can save them now
You've learned a lesson in violence
Get on your knees and bow
Or learn a lesson in violence

[Verse 2]
I love to stab my victims
Until they're dead
A knife to the throat
Or a smashing blow to the head
I'm judge and jury
My sentence has just been passed
Step into the circle of hell
If you think you can last
[Chorus]
Fight - for what you believe to be right
Crushing with all your might
I laugh at their pitiful cries
They run from the fire in my eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing can save them now
You've learned a lesson in violence
Get on your knees and bow
Or learn a lesson in violenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
