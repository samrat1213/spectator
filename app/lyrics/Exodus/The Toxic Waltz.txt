[Instrumental Intro]

Here's a new dance craze that's sweepin' the nation
It's called the Toxic Waltz and it's causin' devastation
You're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slammin' with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
Then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
Give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
Used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
Don't start to cry if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance no matter your endurance

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
[Instrumental Break]

Get up on your feet
Don't look so obsolete
And thrash like an athlete!
Don't sit there on your ass
Don't look like you got too much class
You'll be harassed!
You know we guarantee
This is the key
So rage or get the third degree!
You begin frontal assaults
And start your somersaults
And do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!
Do the toxic waltz!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
