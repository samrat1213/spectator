Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
He starts with the draining of liquid mass
His victims lie helpless and wide awake
Bodies are shriveled to skeletal form
To decompose
Victims die helpless while siphoned wake
Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
Bone matter is now removed from the skin
Collection of femurs used to impale
Scattered skulls with oozing brains left unfound
To decompose
Splitting the spines like he's done it before
Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Morbid fascination with the dead bones blood brutally dissolved
Constant threat of killing all he sees
Revenge always gets involved
Morbid inclination warps his mind
Terror saturates his eyes
Foreseen decimation feeds his mind
Starving for the next attack
Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
Lefts to be one with the dirt again
It all will end in the dirt again
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot
