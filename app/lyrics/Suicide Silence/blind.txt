This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind

Another place I find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be a lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner self-esteem is low
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can't see, I can't see, I'm going blind

I'm blind
