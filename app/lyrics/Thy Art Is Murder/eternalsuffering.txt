Look at the mess we've made
Our house is merely a vessel
For the rust and decay
We tear down the walls
We dig up the dirt
We've orphaned our dreams
But we still can't bury the hurt

In the center of the earth
In the warmth of the fire
Hurl the scraps on the embers
Fanning the flame of desire
Igniting the pains of our memories
Yet we're still ashamed
Was it too late or was it not enough
Did we fail or did we just give up

We are the broken, we are the cursed
We are the stain on a dying earth
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering

Grind down
Upon the bones of what was perfect
We've had our fill
Now we're left to wonder was it worth it
Tortured souls
Ever haunted by tortured minds
How on earth will we survive
How in hell can we reverse it

How on earth will we survive
How in hell can we reverse it

Was it too late or not enough
Did we fail or just give up

Submit
Our fate is a grave
In which we dig

Grind down
Upon the bones of what was perfect
We've had our fill
Now we're left to wonder was it worth it
Tortured souls
Ever haunted by tortured minds
How on earth will we survive
How in hell can we reverse it

We are the broken, we are the cursed
We are the stain on a dying earth
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering
We are the broken and the flawed
We are the sickness in the fall
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering

In the center of the earth
In the warmth of the fire
We throw what's left on the embers
Fanning the flame of desire
We buried the pain, we buried the flesh
The memories, the feel of regret
Oh the graves we dig just to live in sin
We don't give up we just give in

Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering

We are the broken, we are the cursed
We are the stain on a dying earth

Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering
Chained to each other in misery
Our eternal suffering
