Adhere to a new prophecy
Fear this dying earth
The bleeding out of humanity
Too long have you let your faith damn you to burn
While the world crumbles deep under
And your faces still drown in the scriptures
How long till you look past the sky?
How long till you deny?
How long till you live more than sacrifice?
It can't begin until the sleeper awakens
Denounce the falsehoods of salvation
An unforgivable sin, no matter how you repent
It's your fault your home planet is fucked
It's your fault earth is fucked
It's your fault
And as they look down
Our ascendants in disgrace
Something becomes clearer now
Earth is diseased and humans are the plague
