Your purpose is to intake every load.
Tarnish your name, admit you're filthy.
A disgrace upon your own self,
A simple but useful whore.
For in the world everyone plays a role.
Dripping in anticipation to ingest ejaculates.
All willing penetrate your tender orifice
Leaving you numb and gaping,
Awaiting the next to fornicate flesh.
Filling every hole,
You fit this role so well.
Unshamed, you've finally earned your worth.
Why do you yearn for respect?
Dripping in anticipation to ingest ejaculates.
You ignore all morals to be seen and fucked at will.
You're filthy!
You're merely a wounded lamb amongst starven wolves.
Forever cursed with the burden of escaping their hold.
Simple, useful whore,
You fit this role so well.
Exploit yourself and sell your soul to me.
