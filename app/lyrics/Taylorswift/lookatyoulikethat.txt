There you are
Standing there looking like you don't know what to say
But I know that face
And here I am
Bracing myself for what I know is coming my way
What a waste

For all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself?
Letting it go and loving you so
Don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that

I'm gonna look at you like that
I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
I'm gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Don't you say
That we can still be friends, it doesn't work that way
The end is the end
And don't you dare think
That I'll pack up all my tears and take them home
And cry them out when I'm alone

I'll do it right here, I'm crying right now
You come and you can watch me crumble down
That's for breaking my heart, so, baby, don't start
Thinking you can ask me not to look at you like that

I'm gonna look at you like that
I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
I'm gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Don't you tell me to be strong
Or make it harder than it has to be
After you are gone
You'll remember what you've done to me

'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that
Gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
After what you put me through
I'm gonna have to let you know
How much it hurts to let you go

Oh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you, look at you, look at you
Like that
