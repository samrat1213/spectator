Accelerated and elevated.
Spared from imminent destruction.
Crossing through the umbra of a deceased planet.

Passing of many suns, towards the nearest location where the portals open.
A celestial bridge of transport grants preservation.
A new era encroaches.
Still there's much to accomplish.

Dropped in a strange unknown.
Nothing but hope is promised.

The challenge,
To unlearn what they once knew,
To not repeat the past with the same outcome.

Soon the tribulations of few shall return to haunt the many.
Inherent lust for chaos and depravity.

Returning is the lust for chaos and depravity.
The tribulations of few return to haunt the many.
Those chosen by the ascendants,
They have lost their way.

Relapsing back to deconstruction.
Rebuilding constraints which kept their minds in suppression.

Segregation between the species turns aggressive.
Man develops currency.
Implementing law enforcement, outbreaks of violence escalate.
Those chosen by the ascendants they have lost their way.

What will become of their colony?

Humanity has lost its way.
