Mangled arms and legs are tied and bound
Ritual execution for the ages
Bodies ripped open while forced to stay alive
From the backbone down to the loins

Father of the furious legion of gods
I offer my sacrifice upon you
As fearsome as you are divine
God of war I honor thee

Ribs, lungs, intestines now pulled out
Carved into the shape of bloody wings
Savagely tortured with a gruesome horrid fate
Yet even uttered, meant the sound of death

The method of torture wielding terrifying pain
Ghastly act of ceremonial torment
Methodically separated and extracted broken ribs
Leaving your organs on full display

Father of the furious legion of gods
I offer my sacrifice upon you
As fearsome as you are divine
God of death I honor thee

With sheer ferocity
With blood on my hands
I bestow upon you this offering
Seeking vengeance, I commit such hideous acts

Stabbing the heels of the helpless victims
Threading the rope through the gaping holes
Forcing the bodies to be hung upside down
As the blood runs down past their hearts

Abdomen sliced open
Viscera then torn out
Feverishly wrapped around the tree
The lacerations of the flesh
Bound to pain eternally
As the wounds now bleed forevermore

Arise arise arise arise
Arise in honor of our ancestors

Arise arise
Arise in ode to our gods
