RhinoGiant vs. LeFanous  Lyrics
Don't step to me nigga, I knock cut your balls off
Then I pop up the trunk and grab my sawed off
Yeah I'm a dirty dog, can't keep my paws off
Your bae watching like I'm Hasselhoff
Now let me light my spliff so I can take off
The illest rapper in this rap game
Killing tracks and niggas all that shits the same
Ain't a punchline rapper but I got style
And I show up for work at the punch line(redigeret)
I show up late but I'm on time

You seem kinda distracted, but we ain't even started
You grew up fine, still seem kinda retarted
Yeah i might not be black, but i still spit bars
You ain't a fight, just another one of my chores
You say you the illest, and by that i agree
You ill in your mind, luckily healthcare is free
Can't keep your paws off, i put your rap career on pause dog
You are a dirty dog, but i will tame you like a bitch
When you rap you stutter, when you play you glitch
I might be white, but rap is my niche

Gotta admit you got balls. Like two peas in a pod
Now I gotta break you in like a bull in a china shop
So while you come up with your baby rhymes
I gotta break shit down like an enzyme
I did this shit for fun times for a long time, halftime, pasttime
Now I Rock this primetime full-time showtime
Knock you out cold like a bedtime
Work 9 till 5 while I spit rhyme
Don't rush me on the hour mother fucker
Or u get knocked the fuck out like Chris Tucker
Gotta hide from my boss while writing u shit lol
I thought you were worthy of my time
But i didn't realize you had to re-edit your line
Real eyes, realize, real lies
You eyes gotta be fake, cuz you dont realize
That my first round was me being nice
You dont break down shit, you clit
You didn't even break off with your bitch
You work 9 till 5, reallocate your hours
Maybe on better lines, and slow down with the golden showers
I am the jackie chan of rap, you just jaden smith
Tryna learn to rap, but it is hard when you are you boss' bitch
You maybe be an engineer, but there is one the you can't crack
That me bitch, now get of my track
I kill you, post mortum, Wrapped in flannel
Do you want @Wok this way to kick, or are you leaving this channel?

How cute the white boy thinks he is the next Eminem
But he got more bark than bite in him
Your shits so bland you use flour for spice
Your like an even more vanilla vanilla ice
"I'm the rap game Jackie Chan"
Nigga the only action scene you in is when jacking with your hand
It's true I work hard to put food on the table
While you plot in jealousy like we Caine and able
And while he got the better of him in the end
I got a future while you stay a passing trend
So just turn around and wave goodbye with your girlfriend
Your performance dipped, like an episode of arrow
Works to keep yourself of the street, you homeless, looks like a black jack sparrow
You can't even recognize how wrong you are, like the eqyptian pharoah
The future you think you had, ended last round you dirty dog
I killed, dropped you in the field, only to be seen by the fog
I must admit i was nervous, that ppl was gonna ask for your ass
But i didn't recognize, that an ass like you, only be recognized as trash
Pop my Glock in your face,  your see your past before you, in a flash
Now the crows be eating of your head, but you couldn't interpret
A science guy turns scarecrow, an engineer too, now work it

You call me Green arrow. But people see me and marvel
Cause I speak for the people call me George Orwell
You can pull your Glock I'm luke cage while you look cagey
Scared to speak up cause you can't gauge me
No wait. I'm Superman
Beat you to a pulp watch me soup a man
You a side kick who gets his side kicked while screaming supes the man
And I know you a fan. You look up to me
Holding your hand out hoping for a handout like I'm Oprah Winfrey
I don't even have to try I got bigger fish to fry I ain't got time for you
So sit down to lie while you moan and cry while tweeting #metoo
Here. Take a blanket and some pillows to use down south
And some toothpaste to get my taste out yo mouth
You say you are superman, i can keep going all night
I fuck you up, you are scared, bitch i ain't even kryptonite
The only thing that is super, is your dick, its super-small despite
You being black, you let your people down
Think you are a hero, your from "IT", you fucking clown
Step in to my hood, we pop you, i own the whole town
The only things i be tweeting, is to answer your chick
Last time we talked, she complained about your herpes dick
She told me i finish good, but she didn't swallow, we left it for you to lick
Ain't got time for this shit, you look like bald dwarf with a fake ass wig
Your name is RhinoGiant, but there isnt much giant about this pussy
You compare you self to luke, clark and oprah, but i see you as wussy
Im the biggest fish in this sea, but you can't see, that frying me, ain't gonna be easy
When she talked about your sexlife, she told me that you ressemble Peter from Leasy
When you hook up, you never go back home, because you dont leave without the finish
Btw even without pulling my Glock, i can pop your eye, thank you mom, for the delicious spinnach
You spit rimes, while i go deeper
The only nickname in town for you, is the sexless inkeeperEmbed
