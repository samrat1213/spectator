Ravenous waves attack,
drawn by the scent of life
Fever for our blood

Instinct rules this mass, ruthless living sea
Devouring

Countless vermin gnashing at my face
Tear meat from my skull
Swarming, rabid, features are erased
Unrecognizable
Body covered, rat filled innards
Shred internal organs
Heart and lungs consumed from inside but my
pain doesn't end
I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

Resistance now gives way,
the rodents freely feed
Tearing at my skin
Muscles are exposed, shining red with blood
Meat that they seek

Crawling rodents gorging on me
Repulsive starving droves
Shredding, stripping, consuming all I was
Tissue pulled from bones
Dying slowly, feeling every fang
Shock has yet to come
Scavengers tear out my eyes
My pain won't end, I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

Ruthless gnawing vermin - feed
Cleaning off my bones while I breathe
Stenching greasy rodents - swarm
My body is losing its form

<i>[Lead - Owen]</i>

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin
