Day after day
Rape after rape
A serpent slithering deep in the world's womb agape

From mountains to rivers
Valleys to lakes
I slaughtered and maimed
Rituals of phallic mutilation
Piteous virgins soaked in menstruation
Decades of despair
Decades of damnation
Divine obliteration
My sins of molestation
Rewarded with thine raw creations

I only relieved them of their guilt to sin

I speak the true rule of heavens gates
Pure horror awaits those denying my faith

Denying my faith

Drowning the innocent in their own placenta
Denying passage to repent
I only relieved them of their guilt to sin
With deprived desires to fondle and skin

For God, they obeyed, and slayed
The willful servants with an excuse to rape
Glutinous, greedy creations instructed to bludgeon till the end of days
Devoid of pity and sympathy
Embracing their need for grief
Atrocities beyond the gaze of man
Cruelty beyond belief

They are the Sin-Eaters
Cleansing the Earth
They are the Doom-Bringers
Loyal since birth

'Twas the act of befouling offspring
Which led to my son rising
Defiled into divinity
The infant to lead all of humanity

The infant to lead all of humanity

Only the second coming could save this world from crumbling into the void
Filled with lost souls wandering

They are the Sin-Eaters
Cleansing the Earth
They are the Doom-Bringers
Loyal since birth

And they ravage
And they rape
Soiling the land
Soiling the stillborns

In the centuries that followed, the weak grew numb to the pain and the anguish that we had begun
Decade by decade and rape after rape, their resilience morphed into a familiar state The Corrupted accepted corruption and became their own destruction

We grew bored of the horde and the way they endured
Then left the vermin to find their own Lord
For any calls to us would be ignored

Where are thy captives, thy trophies, thy spoils?
The meed of thy vigils, thy conflicts, thy toils?
The proofs that the world was overmastered and left?
Its pursuits and opinions of potency reft; that the flesh was subdued, its affections and pride; that Hell's fiery demons have moved from thy side?

Where is thine Lord?
