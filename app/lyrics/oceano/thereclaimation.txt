We are the uprising,
Revivers of a dying scene.
We are the uprising of a dying scene.
The architects to rebuild
What once was standing,
We must purge the filth of our generation.
Infiltrate, reclaim and rebuild!
Reigning holocaust upon antagonists
And the elite immersed
In dissatisfaction and negativity.
Failing to surrender you won't succeed.
Your weaponized words are not so threatening.
Attacking from safe distance,
Only cowards throw shit and run.
We retaliate stronger!
We retaliate stronger,
Face to face stabbing straight to the front!
Predictable the routine has become,
Why are you trying to act tough?
Reveal your face from the flickering screen,
You're the next target.
No more arguments,
Let's cut straight to the chase,
We're calling you out to slit your throat!
A beheading of hypocrisy,
Choke on every final word you speak.
We are eternal
And your're the last of a dying breed.
We are eternal.
