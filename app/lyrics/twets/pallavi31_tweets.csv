Love thatjust wants to be loved

"just like the cooling kohl  adorns her eyes and she knows her eyes and her,  bloom because of it  YOU adorn me with YOU  I cannot see you,  but like the kohl,  I know you make  me bloom quietly from within"
false knowledge     fixed attitude firm hold on desires forever a catalyst to        suffering
kisses on the nape forever a catalyst to whispers of ecstasy
"whiff of eucalyptus  scented zephyr  attacks my senses,  whisper-teasing me, ever a natural catalyst  taking me back to the  warmth of womb I am from blanketing me with a sense of peace, serenity and security"
my expectations and me no longer share the same zipcode
D   R     O        W            N   ...................... I want to drown in  your laughter your conversations your embrace your kisses your essence all of you

"your head on my lap  hands threading softly  through your hair  our eyes clinging everything seems quiet everything, but the  gentle summer breeze making love to us"
this soul looks forward to and rejoices in the radiant points of convergence  with all of you at some point of time and space through our words and thoughts
diverging minds.......converging hearts
"threads of random thoughts yours and mine, converge  to find a home in poetry"
"you and me,  walking parallel paths  maybe we converge  where infinity starts maybe we don’t  it is enough that  I have you in my sight as you have me in yours as we continue to walk  our chosen paths"
talking to You..will never get old
"sharing your heart with someone  is like placing a butterfly in their hands  be still, do stuff right, the butterfly stays, flinch and the butterfly flies away"

"we entwine our  words together quietly unveiling,  unfurling the unsaid  Tag #PenYourTen"
"when I am tired of being,  I give birth to  a peaceful dark allowing it to overshadow my weary, angry, burning, consuming light, letting myself  sink, settle, soak in the coolness of my inviting dark   like greeting clouds  overshadowing the  blazing sun on a  hot summer day"
even when I deliberately let  doubt overshadow my wild impulses in the hope it reins me in impulse always wins hands down
"letting silence  overshadow, override,  overcome feelings  to keep them  locked well within"
entombed with your words enkindled by your touch
dispersing thoughts..before they fire away in random glory
Alumni of forgotten giggles
"You are NOT the prefixes and endings that relate to this ""I""    You are - thoughts, emotions, interests, feelings, plans, wishes, arguments, beliefs, doubts, hunger, thirst, passion and so on  this is worth more than the measurable prefixes and endings of what you think you are"
how we perceive truth is limited to the extent of our knowledge   everyone's truth is true contextual  to the experiences and what one knows

need me........... like I need you
"to run away, or to sink in your arms and stay"
we started out as jaded hearts.
Stop.wondering if you will ever be enough.   Startto have more faith in yourself than in the validation of yourself from others.
Stop.living in the illusion that your love and attention will “fix” the ones who do not want to be fixed.   You are doing nothing but enabling him or her to feed off on you.   #notetoself
Stopliving in spaces where you are not valued.

if you have the power to bring me down to my knees  I am confident in my power to spark longing in your sighs
"my purpose and power to serve exists in spaces where my service is needed not in spaces offering me validation, adulation or confirmation of the same"
just like the lighthouse shines  it’s beacon brightest at midnight my power of light shines its brightest when I am walking my darkest dark
"with you my wants spark, unbidden, firing off like a rocket within my chest"
You.make me taste hope.
Pushing thoughts of you down Trapping them in my Pandora’s box Wrapping a thick chain around them Tossing them into a dark closet
"Learn to assert yourself without ego.   Respect follows.   you WILL repel the ones who do not respect this  You WILL also have like minded souls walking with you, rediscovering their quiet strength of self from you."
"You may notice that when your sense of “self” is intact  - you will not need to  - prove anything to anyone, - feel the need to overpower, aggravate, bully anyone   Self = NOT self pride or having an inflated ego   Self = acceptance of who you are with your strengths and weakness"

"my senses involuntarily swirl  in an ambrosial high, every time I feel you near me, around me"
sometimes I like to  bliss myself out in  ambrosial ignorance knowing the known just waiting for the  words to be said or maybe words  to be acknowledged
"I listened to the rain lulling me into a ambrosial trance, I breathe, remembering, treasuring  every moment with you, rolling them over and over  in my heart like tiny pearls"
I remember the exact when of the day when your words touched me

"it will remain my fault if,  I choose to give in to you  I choose to love more of you  I choose to wear all of you in me I choose to sing your song I choose to dance to your touch  It will remain your fault,   If you choose me"
"hearts find absolutely no fault  in finding each other randomly,  in loving each other wantonly,  in seeking each other out deliberately who are we to find fault with hearts"
You..are my forbidden fantasy
forbidden thoughts  of you fighting the senses  daring me to take a leap coaxing me to give in  tempting me to unleash my wild transforming forbidden to all ways legal
"Today’s bloom - some ageing, some in full bloom, some yet to bloom - just like life   #roses from my tiny balcony #garden"
"Youare one, I love keep coming back to, no matter how lost I am."
remembering is the only way I can remind myself that we were real   (thinking about family and friends that have passed on)
love stemming from a space of personal freedom and not from conditional interactions   (Maybe look for that)
Tea to surf my thoughts    Vodka to swim thru my feels

"no words needed   when the sky embraces me when rains sing with me when storms exhilarate me  when the moon seduces me when the sun nourishes me  when the wind caresses me when the trees listen to me when the rivers guide me so much said, so much heard  no words needed"
"as a spark, as a thought,  as a prayer, as a desire,  unformed and formed  from hitched inhale  to the end of a pent up sigh it is and always will be ..............YOU.............."
"when words make me write  I make words writhe  words win, I win"
"when words do not make sense,  hold hands and breathe in sync your breath will connect you  quietly to the other"
I find my freedom  in the corners of a square box and in the spirals of a circle
shake shake shake  shake the rusted layers  of what you no longer are
"stripped of the sheen and varnish,  the “me” rests in naked realization"
Know the difference of dreaming your own dream and not someone else’s version of a dream (which could very well be a nightmare)   (that includes dreams of well meaning parents as well)
More than self help and inspirational quotes   - look at your own story  - how far you have come  - how you have strengthened you   You are your best story for you  (only if you are willing to read you)
Stop the flight from fight Start to fight that flight  (Maybe)

"as long as there is hunger in us, we will have a satisfaction to chase"
retaining a certain amount of hunger for life and living makes me feel alive
hungry but not necessarily needy.
"when the hunger for what is not yours surpasses all logic, it is high time you find something that is yours to be hungry for   - there is always enough around you if you wish to see"
let your breathteach you about your emotions.
"Question.your conditioning and re-calibrate if it is not helping.   (your beliefs about yourself, pattern of behaviour adopted unconsciously because of the environment and social pressure around you)"

"I love your swift  but all-consuming,  'never wanting to let go' hugs  I revel in your slow,  top to bottom long spine caresses and 'melting me into you' hugs"
"quick endings sometimes result in pain, we carry for seemingly never-ending time"
"go ahead - Bite Me !! but get ready for my claws, they dig deeper than you can imagine"
"I often bathe with the essence of my dark to replenish, rejuvenate, rediscover my light"
my light is born of my dark
biting down impulses  swallowing darkened suppression
"what was left in the past,  often bites my present"
Anger.does not necessarily mean you hate or are in conflict with someone.  (most times it is an expression of love as well - because you care too much)
Indifference.. does not necessarily mean insensitivity.   ( sometimes it means you are desperately trying to protect yourself)
Speechdoes not necessarily mean communication.

you and me atrophying flesh and bones but composed of same celestial tone
star-skiing through mundane time  knowingly and unknowingly in sync with celestial harmony of her soul rhythm
"A fair chance, yes, but like everything else it comes with it’s own expiry date."
Stop talking “about”..Start doing “for”

"sometimes all I need is to walk quietly up to you wrap my arms around you from behind my chest resting softly on your back my nose tucked in the ridge of your spine breathing you in, centering myself and  letting everything but you and me, go"
a surprising nip on your ear a little kiss on the nape of your neck I take pleasure watching  instant goosebumps  blooming on your skin
playing tic tac toe on your chest  and watching  you squirm
"living between rainbows she searches for storms the weird out of the blue unplanned, unseen ones racing to reach there first  she chases wild waterfalls patiently waiting for her chance to shimmer along the hued arc diffusing colored moments of happy happenstance  #FromOneLine 64"
"you are the sun I am the moon  you shine like stars I lose myself in the sky  you love mornings I love evenings  you are of the valley I am of the hills  you are of undefined depth I am of immeasurable width  weird as it seems, our opposites interweave together making us whole"
you............infuse my soul with divine intoxication
"I love drinking in the language of your eyes, but your fingers drive me to another level of drunk"
I drink in the rain hoping it will saturate my tears
Idiot Compassion = being an IDIOT while thinking you are being compassionate.
Remember to be kind who has been kind to you   BUT  Please note - it does NOT mean - you will allow that human to   - take your trip - call you names - take credit for your work - expect you to be at their beck and call - expect much more than kindness from you

swimming through chapters  I have yet to write in a book which could very well end up  as a blank page of invisible words
some words create unintentional wide cracks of emptiness which never really gets filled

sometimes you get it  sometimes you get got

"the mystery of who I crave to be, who I have always longed to be,  diluted,                  dissolved,                                     demystified                 disarmed, defined,   the moment I discover our very own burgeoning universe in your arms  #mystery"
uncommon understandings common misunderstandings uncommon connection common connect uncommon yet common Me.You  #Poetryin13 434 #uncommon
"there is no sun today clouds rumbled and rambled showing off its might false power of shadowing light, right when it seemed all doom and gloom, the moon peeped out bright, full and clear making the clouds disappear I looked at the sky, glad there was no sun today  #FromOneLine 62"
"वो नहीं मेरा मगर उससे मुहब्बत है तो है ये अगर रस्मों, रिवाज़ों से बग़ावत है तो है  सच को मैंने सच कहा, जब कह दिया तो कह दिया अब ज़माने की नज़र में ये हिमाकत है तो है  कब कहा मैंने कि वो मिल जाये मुझको, मैं उसे गर न हो जाये वो बस इतनी हसरत है तो है  - दीप्ति मिश्र"

"when I think of you  I think of exotic silk, deep and rich with  colors of gold and navy gliding through my hands"
wonder what color comes to your mind when you do think of me
"it does not matter where I am, but who I am with  (even includes, when I am with myself)"
"silent, strong, solemn vows we make our glances when no one is looking our little fingers tied to each other our echoing heartbeats beating as one our leaning into each other quietly our grip on each other, when braving the brambles silent, strong, solemn vows we make"
every loss experienced distilled into solemn sighs of remembrance
"began with  turbulent defiance  settled into solemn  azures of acceptance  #solemn, #10wordjournal 68 #began"
actions after  solemn deliberation become conscious  focused fires and possibly calculated misfires
"Being a father is tough - when you want your child to grow into someone strong and capable   Watching them stumble and fail  - they blame themselves, hold themselves responsible and so on - it is natural   - fathers need to cut themselves some slack as well"
Took me a while to convince him NOT to blame himself  once he got it - he was more patient and silently supportive of my right and also helped me through the wrong ones  when he watched me fly my own “plane” without backseat dialogue - faith in figuring out no matter what - PHEW
"First he looked at me as if I was talking alien (if you know or are an Indian dad, you will identify)  Took a while to explain to him that he was in NO way responsible for my failures  His lesson and him = my root walking was my journey - he was my anchor, not the journey"
"Remembering Papa looking at me worryingly and stressing after a couple of really bad choices I made  - where was I going  - what was I doing - where did he go wrong with me   I sat and told him since I was 19, ALL my choices have been solely mine and I owned all my fuckups"
A bit late for India time but what the heck - it is still Father’s Day somewhere 😁  taken a few years back - he is 87 now - and with the grace of Divine - still rocking it  Right now - he is my only umbrella left in a human form - I more of his parent now and I love that
Bravery is also sometimes about waiting it out in stoic and maybe painful silence for the right moment to act
You will always call to you what you create with your actions   - whether you deserve it or not depends on your actions   Keyword = create

"love,  marriage of  lyrics and music  creating a perfect song   #10wordjournal #prompt 71------&gt; #marriage"
carry me to places that we can make ours carry me to where we can scream carry me where happiness and pain both are desirable carry me where enough is bliss carry me where we can create all with a thought's kiss  thank you for the inspiration @BullsBabe005
"focussed, feathery, airy caresses,  deliberate, decadent rhythmic kisses, building, bubbling, expanding, an unrestrained, unorchestrated ache  makes me whirl and lose myself in this  reckless universe that is me"
"when his hands tangle in her hair tugging till her scalp tingles, she thrills at the welcome  bolt of lightning sent  straight to her core"
everything about you makes me wired
"You are not a machine !!!.maybe pause before you ALLOW others to grind your mind, controlling you to behave like a robot, a slave or turning you into a machine   - just because of your predictability of response from ego or stubbornness"
"If you wish to free yourself from your predictable buttons,   have faith in your own decision making capabilities start responding to the spontaneity in you  it takes time   maybe think about it how many people are you giving the power to control you, your actions, your decisions"
"Your obstinacy or stubbornness resulting in predictable reactions can make others push your buttons very easily, thus taking advantage of you very easily as well.   (Be aware of this in yourself)  = working with the mind"
"Morning wishes all 🙏🏻🙏🏻😊😊  Being obstinate about anything forces a reaction from you making you very predictable.  . .  📸 by me - we had to take an unplanned pitstop here, surprised by this sudden wild space of tranquility - on our way to Kannur, Kerala, India   #sundaymorning"
Winding down 💜💜💜💜 by Lumira
I know when to bend I know how much to bend I know why I would bend  I know for what I will bend   my choice to bend  or NOT to bend  is another  story in motion  altogether
unconditional love gentle acceptance  pure intentions  conscious effort  bends and consciously  breaks the wall of ego allowing only the purest  of connection between  me and you
"I can bend my body  I can bend my mind  I can bend my expectations I can bend my attitude I can bend my emotions  I can bend my thoughts  I can bend my choices  I can bend my desires   my WILL however,  does not have  “Bend” in its  dictionary"
Fingers.that make dark promises
"one little peck,  a tiny taste of YOU is all my words crave to be able to keep it alive in the form of poetry   it is the one I would love to remember and smile  in my twilight years"
sinking into you  letting go of all  my misgivings
Responsible choice = being aware of the consequence of each of your choice   ask yourself   - what will this choice lead to ? - do I want to create that outcome ? - am I ready to accept the outcome ?   maybe it will help - it does help me even when I choose wrong
"Despite having a choice and choosing NOT to choose,   remaining unconscious and careless                           or  letting someone else choose for you   = irresponsible use of the power of choice within you"
ability to choose “consciously” being aware of where and how you will focus your energy - will help shape your reality
Morning wishes all 🙏🏻🙏🏻😊😊  Choice..is the engine of your evolution . .  📸 not by me - but of me - this is one of my fav moments - I take great strength when I dream myself back here   “Ain't no mountain high   Ain't no valley low”  #saturdaymorning #traveldiaries

"while we were apart the wind blowing from east sighed songs of you, teased me with your scent of smoke, pine and leather cajoled me, nudged me, made me bend like the supple bamboo making love to the wind whistling my song back in waves,  to carry it back to you  #FromOneLine 59"

the reverence in his voice  when he calls her name  makes her come undone  like scattered petals of a rose
when he colors her with his words she loves being his art
"I roam wild, I roam free anchored firmly  to my purpose"
"roaming the corners of my mind, not colored with any experiences coloring my wishes in the hope  it becomes alive and real"
"stretching my hands out,  reaching out to grasp  the last vestiges of  a dream so real"
you cannot learn to love  by loving someone else  it all starts with you
your intentions will also bring forth experiences that will always give you clear choice to   learn through wisdom               or  learn through doubt and fear   you will evolve anyway - it all matters how you choose to do it   (consciously choose wisdom)
Your intentionscreate the reality that you experience

"when his baritone trembles around the edges, it gives her a secret thrill knowing how she affects him"
"Youa bandage to my turmoil, quieting all the chaos in my head"
whatever decisions you make moves you towards what you want to learn subconsciously in this body  how to learn about love how to learn self empowerment  how to surpass doubt and fear   and so on
life throws big curveballs to prove that nothing is written in stone
"Morning wishes all 🙏🏻🙏🏻😁😁  Every situation, every event is purposed to teach us something.   It depends on us how long we take to learn it, use it or misuse it.   📸 by me - Bokapuram, Tamil Nadu, India with my Whitefeather  #Thursdaymorning #traveldiaries"

"even as I dream, I breathe into the rhythm of love that fills me as I reach for the turquoise mile to the eternal, tangible, visible memories infusing fire of life, to keep me going everyday and I wait  for the time when I can eagerly sink back  into my welcoming familiar dream"
"I sink into a familiar dream blue skies and pine forest, early evening drizzle soaking my skin tattooing me with echoes of teardrops, scent of fresh eucalyptus breeze melding with my inbreath entwining with my whispered heartbeats, singing a lullaby of a home I carry in me"
"her eyes speak to him clearly and concisely where and how she wanted  to have him if she chose to play  he closes his eyes briefly  feeling the force of her focus,  an unexpected hurricane blowing straight in his face"

keep it a secret how your velvety cadence touches my core rendering it highly volatile how your laugh makes my heart skip a beat before it sighs in joy how your fingers rev me up from zero to thousand in a beat  shhhhhhh.....  keep it a secret  #fromoneline 58 Art - Fabian Perez
I seek you in the hues  of the purple velvet dawn right where I left you with all of mine
my core reduced to soft crushed velvet every time  you finally deign to release me  from your fervent embrace
sometimes fire  sometimes ice  it is in between  we make ‘nice’
you make me feel strong and weak at the same time
erasing the forgiven and the forgotten
game of assumptions = loss loss   (for both sides)
travel unknown destinations but with enough preparations and lessons learnt from your journey to known destinations
"Askdon’t assume   - strangers do help when you ask   - people you love need to hear you ask so that they can give you what you need, maybe   - even the universe wants you to ask for yourself  (If you don’t ask, you will never know - if it is yes, no, maybe)"
If you are praying   - don’t ask for fixes or escapes or cry “why me”  - ask for the strength and the resources to tide through your circumstance as smoothly as possible   (Ask and you will receive it)

"you cannot satisfy anyone with anything unless you learn the art  of being satisfied yourself, from within"

"Of course you will never be enough, you are too much, too deep, too cool, too WOW - you rock you"

"she crushes all that which  harms her without a blink  the only space she willingly allows herself to be crushed into oblivion is in the arms of her beloved   breaths breathed in and out as one,  sighs billowing out as one  two halves of a poem rhyming as one"
she likes to crush and transform doubts into certainty fear into courage chaos into stillness insecurity into confidence hate into indifference humiliation into tolerance misunderstanding into acceptance failure into lessons pain into perseverance she likes to crush and transform
"her innocence, faith, trust crushed to dust beyond repair  only way was to rise up anew, crushed stardust,  her impenetrable armor, she is set to crush all  that plans to crush her"

"simple distractions I love a butterfly resting on my face inhaling the breeze heralding rain the smell of freshly dug earth sips of masala tea, engrossed with a book warm hugs from my friends neck kisses, finger flirting midnight feasting of you and me simple distractions I love"
hence I live purposefully hence I love unconditionally hence I laugh loudly hence I bleed words profusely hence I hope softly hence I pray deeply hence I live willingly
when you make it all about you it is fucking easy for me to be  distracted away from you
"the only way I will allow myself to be distracted enough to willingly drown in your tempting sea of lust, love, life, when you completely claim my heart, my body, my soul when you willingly offer me your heart, your body, your soul no holds barred, all strings attached  #distract"
"I know you committed all of me  in your memory every moment of the days you lived without me, that fills me with  bittersweet inspiration eases the pain of  missing in me as I keep living on  as I must live on"
"I listen to our favorite songs one song bleeding into the other some fast, some slow it reminds me of how  you did not let go of me you are still speaking to me through our songs yes......you......are"
"you should be kissed,  and often, by someone  who knows how"

attempting to belong  she finally understood  her place is not inside  the sphere of control  she is made of ‘outside’  where rules conform to her  where nature guides her  where chaos teaches her where silence comforts her  where she finds her fit just  as she was purposed to be
you may be outside  driving from work through  the old familiar roads I may be soaking it in from within my concrete walls and windows I always smile and say to myself ‘we saw the same sunset’ and that isenough

we are..sweet and dark mixed together
hot awareness zips  down my spine when your eyes  lock with mine
"when you circle my thoughts tiny shards of emotions  claw at me consistently  soft yet terrifying, tiptoeing  firmly inside my chest"

a strong intention or “sankalpa” can override any doubt or misgivings when you are walking the path of change
all the victories that will ever matter are the ones you win over yourself
Follow your heart  Follow your gut  Follow your intuition   and maybe people who resonate with all of the above with you   otherwise you are just sheep - LOL

"when I broke bent, cracked, shattered,  I sustained bruises, imperfect patches of healing here and there, inside and out, raw, ugly, uneven, cavities of fears faced battles won, a self healed with permanent sense of appreciation of all things that make my heart beat when I broke"
do I make your heart beat to mine?  - she longs to ask him

your presence makes  all my carefully built filters  go up in smoke
am skating a razor’s edge  every time his fingers  “accidentally” brush mine
the river does not ask  where it came from  it just flows and just like that I am flowing with my moments  knowing I will get there  when I get there
"we are made of... a web of dreaming dreams a hesitant step forward chasing that, a firm belief in our actions after that, a framework of wins and losses a map of our choices  we are made of... moments bleeding  into more moments finally  sighing into soft slumber of tired sleep"
sometimespeople surprise you even after you have given up on them   sometimes they don’t and it is ok
Sending smoke signals to love - bring me your fire
"visit the past..........to understand your present   [don’t get stuck there romanticizing the shit out of it   - things happened for a reason,  - you made your choices for a reason - you are here today, for a reason  acknowledge that and keep moving]"

it does not take much  first rays of the morning sun sudden drizzle of rain whistling monsoon winds a pause in my paced breath a sip of my morning tea a break in my written word a sigh after my evening read  to walk constantly with your thoughts  it does not take much
"when I am silence when I am noise  you slip and slide into my thoughts  unannounced, unabashed, unapologetic  no place to hide, no place to run demanding my surrender to that  wave, which claims me as yours until,  you become my silence you become my noise"
sometimes you are an unspoken thought sometimes you are my untamed need sometimes you are my unnamed choice sometimes you are my under the skin sin sometimes you are my glorious salvation ........................................................ other times you are my everything
truth loves to dance out of my reach sometimes
you cannot lie to the stars  #notetoself

"सुबह से शाम हो गयी  तेरी आवाज़ का इंतज़ार करते,  बस हाथ लगा सिर्फ़ शोर सन्नाटे का,  .................और मैं................... और यह कसक कसर की  चलो शुक्रिया"
I can breathe with you but not for you
If you have the chance   to.............love to.............work to.............play to.............look up at the stars   - you can quietly be glad that you are alive
if you are the only one doing the talking in a relationship   - it is not a relationship but a sinking ship
needs have to match without words - at least for the important moments of your life   If you have to keep asking for what you need when it is important to you - think again   it could mean - you are nowhere and no one in their sphere of existence   #NoteToSelf
Have the courage to let go   what does not belong to you  who does not value you who does not get you   you are better off on your own   #NoteToSelf

"how you and your heart have always pulled through   whisper my name,  urges time, know that you will be   just fine  just fine just fine  #FromOneLine 50  #notetoself :)"
"how you learnt to survive the heck  out of the good, bad and the ugly  how you learnt the art of  being you, without apologies  how you learnt to live well and fine  without the ones who didn't care,  how you with all your imperfections and scars will always be enough"
"whisper my name,  urges time, when you need reminding  how you started as a prayer before you were born,  how you were nurtured as a hope once you entered this tiny human body  how you stumbled many times  and got up that many and more times"
forced to revolve  back and forth back and forth  back and forth to finally evolve
revolving the self  anticlockwise back to square one starting from nothing
"simple actions,  leading to heavy expectations a call, a connect, a response  me to me - you damn fool, it was all you"
"an eerie calm outside belying the revolving, spinning roller coaster of thoughts inside #revolve"
distract me with your lack of attention
Thank you so much - much love to you 💜💜💜💜  Dil khushhhhhh kar diya 😁😁😁😝😝🤗🤗🤗

"lost in her thoughts the fading horn sounds reminds her, he forgot, again  #Poetryin13 410 #horn art by Fabian Perez"
sometimes it only takes a shared sunset  sometimes it only takes shared lyrics  sometimes it only takes to go under together and come up sometimes it only takes getting lost in the wild together  sometimes it only takes a offbeat road trip together   ...........to know someone
untwining and intertwining your fingers and mine  sparks cannot help but sizzle up my veins
I know you are a mirage projected by my brain  but it still makes for an interesting journey  when I am walking alone
a fragile thread tethers my soul to yours
you are.........my words in motion
"even when it is the end-of-the-world moment,  nowhere else I would rather be than right here with you"
thunderstorm in his eyes  molten lava in his veins   undulating waves in his heart  wild forest   in his soul
"my heart carries a balloon  full of unshed tears of the unsaid, unheard and unfelt,  forever waiting for the suppressed weight to miscarry  #balloon"
a willing captive  balloon of emotions tied to you   #balloon
"when chaos surrounds me pulling me in, I desperately  hold on to the balloon of calm, slowly                             g, relieved, resting above it                           n                         i                      s                    i steadily  r    #balloon"
"balloon my way, your thoughts of me,  I will tie them together, watch it sway in the breeze,  absorbing all the sighs and smiles of me from you  #balloons"
मेरी सासें है हमेशा तुझ से जुड़ी .........
“कुछ नहीं हाथ आएगा यहाँ फिर भी ऐ ज़िंदगी तेरा शुक्रिया”
“ज़िंदगी चल तेरा शुक्रिया शयाद मिले ना तू कल की सुबह जो दीया हम ने हंस के लिया ऐ ज़िन्दगी तेरा चल शुक्रिया”
“हर साँस का हर ख्वाब का उम्मीद के सैलाब का तुझसे जुडी हर बात का शुक्रिया”
you and me.........waiting for college time to end so that we could be “adult” and “free”
"You and me ........ bunking classes, flirting with girls/boys and having tapri wala tea"
you and me..........getting high on rum cola and Hema Malini + Dharmender Paaji
you and me........singing Bollywood songs running around a tree
you and me.............cannot be you and me without you and me
you and me.............resting best in silences that free
you and me...........fulfilling our purpose to BE
"be kind as you bury me,  remember my favorite corner of your heart  be kind as you drown me, remember I like a quick death   be kind as you kill me, remember I like it swift and soft   remember to be kind or maybe not"
the heart never ever listens to the mind - it is like trying to tame a wild horse
Today’s bloom - the fragrant Mallige  from my tiny balcony garden
unconditional ......... not unintelligent
A hug to myself - just like that coz I needed it
Trust also means   not hurting your loved ones  keeping yourself safe for your loved ones  protecting what matters to you and your loved ones not humiliating your loved ones  being there for your loved ones  being sensitive to your loved ones   and it goes BOTH ways   #NoteToSelf
how you react to pain tells a lot about yourself.   - Listen to yourself.

"𝓟erfect but random 𝓢udden winds of  𝓨ore giving her uncomfortable 𝓒hills down her spine, remnants of a 𝓗ellish, nightmare she left behind, that time  𝓞stracised, renounced, eliminated, buried forever  #psycho"
you and me...........in harmony with our soliloquy
"easing up the pain,       again filling up the self,           again locking up my layers,    again stocking up my love,     again closing up my heart,     again healing up my spirit,      again climbing up the hill,       again"
my words always find me and tempt me to be lost
when I look at you I see.............. happiness
"when his tongue curls around mine,  it is hard to resist the perfect invitation to  come out, play and dance"
or rather.... do I want to do it ??
you and me...............finding the excuse to hug each other because of a horror movie 😈😝😝
you and me..............creating many incredible memories
you and me................trapped in a forgotten movie
you and me.......... watching a sunset by the sea
you and me............and the intimacy of raw honesty
the sky..............is for now  the ground however.......
Plan A - hack my way through  Plan B - quickly come up with a plan C   😈😝
some closures do not need goodbyes
"sudden pangs of someone  enfolding me his fragrance of  pine, wood and male richness   all that remains is the  fragrance of his spirit now, no flesh, no bones"
feelings trying to untangle itself from one another have resulted in creating a fine art of abstract mess while I look on in dumbfounded awe
asking my lonely questions to the sky - hoping I will see an answer in the form of a cloud sailing by   - maybe
"TRUST, FRIENDSHIP, LOVE  have different meanings to different people   make sure the people you hang out with have the same understanding and definition of the labels thrown around   language is a great way to cover up for  blame, ego and all the shit at other’s convenience"
it is ok to step on the gas once in a while  - maybe   #note_to_self
being stupid is the first step to being smart  - maybe   (reflecting on a stupid perspective)   #asking_self

Love........ as nourishing as the wet earth after the first bout of rains
"straining all the impurities of the mind,  collecting all the purity of the heart blending a few soulful sighs, salty tears  peppery anger, cinnamon flavoured laughter a dash of whiskey laced whispers I brew a perfect blend for me to be  #cup #metaphor"
slowly...........sipping blissfully..........blending gladly..............overpouring

"rust dust, dead leaves billowing around me a typical Assam  summer evening  I smell thunder,  I smell the rain,  and you"
mistakes make me.............it does not break me
you and me............like moon and the sea
you and me........... a glitch in destiny
Words............stuck like crushed glass in my throat
endure sadness and let it shape you for the better opening your soul and enlarging your heart space to hold more of you and more of others to love
Celebrate......... every happy moment you have lived since your birth  happiness = NOT necessary achievement or material success

"courage to bare it all, face it all  courage to burn and transform courage to change from within courage to rest in truth sans any guilt courage to believe, not blame"
a love that is side by side  a love that holds me tight
the one that you see in your dreams  the one that you want to share your true self with  the one you want to find  the one you want to be happy with   is not.............me
"I started as  a tiny raindrop,  gurgled as a stream, raged as a waterfall, meandered as a river, merged with the ocean only to start as  a tiny raindrop, yet again"
this soul is waiting for the moment  it can shed this shell of flesh and bones   and rise to merge with the sky
hope  is dangerous It merges and tickles my latent desires  merrily clouding my judgement
the past wants to  merge with the present influencing the version of now but she knows that her past  is best left in the past she only takes what is  pertinent to her birth  SHE and not her past  merges with NOW
I merge all of me in you  when you merge all you in me
"the ebb and flow of tides  within me, undulating and trapped forever longing to merge with you   Photo - SciTechDaily"
I have finally fleeted  and I am kinda addicted   buhahahaha  😈😈😈  (Me to Me - save me 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️)

you and me.............laughing to the stories of you and me
you and me ................swimming with dolphins in the deep blue sea

you and me ...... just...... you and me
you and me.......loving each other to the rhythm of moon's melody
"You and me....... holding each other and dancing in the rain, free"
you and me.......... and the things we will never be able to see
you and me....... and gentle waves of the sea
words falling in love in words words making love to words words finding their soulmate in words words die to remain alive in words  nothing to do with you or me
"his magic is in throwing words  without care, waiting for  anyone to get drunk, on a whim Beware !!"
you and me..... and a canopy of trees
her magic is in mixing words  in a way that can get anyone  drunk on a dream beware !!
"she has been drinking words and emotions  meant for someone else getting willingly and uselessly  drunk on it, till the damage  and the destruction started  taking its toll on her  killing her slowly and surely next life, maybe she will  learn to make her own drink"
"drinking him in from afar while he looks on, lost in her memory"
she drinks in the nature and nature loves to drink her back
"he drank whatever was left of her  in the name of loving  all that was left behind was an  emptied cracked glass of her and yet he asked uncaring, why did you stop pouring ?"
he used her to feel good  until there was nothing left  in her to be used
cutting her heart out to share the final  remnants of kindness
"when I am lost, I just dream  that I am holding your little finger  and I find myself again"
Do we need to know where the river bends ?
"Lies that we like to hold on to, as truth"

identify what you want to water today   seeds of life and love   or   a seed of dead past
Any constructive change you choose to make to reinforce your space of being at peace with yourself will help you grow faster towards being sorted with life.

"you are that necessary hue, that makes my color palette sparkle with life"
he was my personal devil  in a dapper suit wielding  his smile as a weapon
"you, me and maybe some late afternoon tea....... ????"
dissolving in your arms my favorite way of being
somedays I am the haunting somedays I am the haunted
"I would love you haunting me everyday  just to feel your presence, your faint fragrance your loving memories and our fiery quarrels you making sure I had eaten, keeping my cool,  pushing me not to give up on my dreams  MA,  I would love you haunting me everyday"
in the mood to pick wildflowers and seashells and sit and listen to the music of the ocean
Truth............resides somewhere in the greys
"silence       is,  was and always will be  my most trusted     companion"
there is a peace that settles in  accepting what can never be yours
life as is...............is enough
"when your love is not enough,  you will never be enough"
If you keep looking back nothing and no one  will be ever enough
somethings gotta give.......to get me somewhere peaceful
haunted by fantasies  exorcised by realities
Waves of THEN come and go  but I dig my heels in the NOW
you can only do so much  you can only be so much
the past loves to haunt I have learnt how to haunt it back   BOO 👻
"Yes, the road is lonely  but the smiling sky,  the warm earth, changing seasons,  emoting with the moon, chasing the sun, the storms, the gentle rain never allow me to feel alone"
Figure out what you DON’T want - rest will fall into place
learn + adapt + sort (over time) (repeat) = Living

love happens love surprises love sneaks  love strikes fast love also kills slowly  love also makes  you savour life surely if you allow all forms of it  to discover you gently

"“we all need justice,  we all need mercy,  we all need some unmerited grace”  - No Mercy   (loved this movie - of a true story and what a story - the last line hit me strongly)"
be mindful to live with quiet joy with the process of living/being/action as an outcome   rather than   chasing that elusive success at the end of a process   this is what = living in the now = touching contentment   gross success  and achievement will be a fat bonus then 😁
"when you can enjoy every moment of  living,   eating, breathing, sleeping, laughing, loving, working  you just might taste the feeling success  and fulfilment  to pursue happiness without enjoying every moment of your life is kinda stupid - you are never going to get there"

rooting in the belief that makes us.......us
"this wolf is holding her howl  in her throat, pining for the moon"
"his gaze holding hers  penetrating the thin line of determination,  his hands clawing into the tender side of her neck,  her belly clenches deliciously approving his touch,   he slowly unbuttons her inhibitions with intent  dark and sinful  he was impossible not to yield to"
"when she allows him to  push her obvious buttons, he better be prepared for her  to undo his hidden buttons when he least expects it"
"you.............are my temple without boundaries, where I willingly lose to find myself"
we have become ashes of dead stars grated from the sky
I can sit with you and breathe with you if nothing else
"If you are honest with yourself..........maybe, just maybe you can find it easier to be honest with others   (honest = not hurting people with your honesty but being clear about your stand on things keeping the other’s perspective in mind too )"
success comes to you faster when you are invested and focused on the outcome not on the profits of the outcome   #focus

Laugh at yourself instead of others - you just might end up having more fun

only the moon purges  my confessions of being  a terribly flawed human
"confessions do not help  unless acceptance, purging  and change occur from within"
confessions do purge but  sometimes make space for  more willful acts resulting  in an unending cycle of  action and confession
I only confess to myself I am my harshest judge  my own condemning jury  and my worst punisher
"she has cautioning whispers  of the known, unknown to me   she urges me to be wary but I have to free this  confession to myself,   his come hither glances luring me, tunes me out to everything but him rendering her warnings to white noise   #confession #picprompt"
my being calls you her..........own
drifting somewhere between weightlessness and gravity
to be at the same level of sensitivity with each other - that
when calm becomes a well rehearsed habit
No regrets............to loving and being loved

the flash of her silhouette echoes his restlessness rapidly fading city starlights and midnight quiet grating on his frayed nerves the dragon moon throwing its flame of impatience his longing attempts to distill time in a teardrop that disappears with his idly burning cigar smoke
"Yes, the crackling of the  old and dead me grates,  but in the satisfaction of shedding   unstoppable flames continues forging  the ever evolving me, urging me to   rise in quiet power  rise in soft strength  rise in unwavering wisdom rise in roaring renewal"
"Only when our broken pieces  of pain lived and buried, grate together in tearful  recognition against each other,  the alchemy of healing  dissolves the past and  starts transforming us"
a mix of all that makes us human      the highs and the lows        the dark and the light       the heavy and the soft         the ebb and the flow     the real and the imaginary       grated in the right dosage to compose the ongoing song of love  #grate

you.......will always remain my inbuilt compass

Jerusalema - I love this song - this made me smile - the vibe of this song always touches me at my core   Winding down 💜💜💜
"I watch, this child of a thought demanding my attention  I watch, it plays with me I play with it too it is not always fun and games  I watch, it cheats it reveals it triggers  I watch, I bend the rules till the thought finally plays by my rules   I watch, I release that thought"
bits of me yet to be...............undone
like a tree on fire burning  the dead bark of redundancy and innocence of life and living  forged through fragile flames
innocence can be cruel when it hurts because  of the unknowing
you make me feel  as innocent as the first drizzle of  an Indian summer afternoon
"the fine line running through insensitivity, unintentional  and innocence"
I still contain within me drops of residual innocent curiosity of unexplored treasures within
One second is what it takes to.........smile
"practice sitting in silence, solitude and stay with your breath, letting it flow thru you - like the wind not caught by any net  maybe you will open to things you never thought possible  maybe you will learn the easy way to let go of what does not serve you without much effort"
A few breaths - relaxed long and deep before you start anything can make a lot of difference to the state of your mind.

Infinity........lives inside my heart
the lights behind the scenes - that is who I feel like today
the hunger to be  cocooned in your arms like a pearl in an oyster
yearning to be one with you  like the river hungers  to meet the sea
his glance grazes her with voracious hunger  leaving her breathless
I hunger for you like the wolf in me  hungers for the moon
reality often kills  hunger for dreams over time
"when anyone says something, it usually means that they want to be heard"
"when you love right, you will always be filled with more love to give"
words rendered meaningless or meaningful with actions
Morale is directly related to productivity  (at work as well as in life)

"Live your life as you wish but you don’t have to force others to share it, if they do not want to."

I feel a little lost without you  I wait for the way to find me
tell me where you keep your heart tell me where it stays.......
the skies are getting rough  but I am still looking up
you will always find me if you know where to look for me
"in silence.......   in silence, you will know me in silence, you will feel me  in silence, you will own me  in silence, I will love you in silence, I will miss you in silence, I will hold you  in silence, forever and always  in silence........."
silence is the purest form of love I can leave you with
time is jealous of  forever and always  trapping us in it's  web of trickery that is reality
"I am jealous of the moon, who gets to caress you  tenderly as you sleep while sleep evades me  the moon assures me she is just me loving him I still cannot help being jealous of the moon"
promises are jealous  of lovers making  them to each other
experiencing experience with  strength........softness........fluidity
"the price of love   could be ..............more love  could be ..............lessons  could be ..............loss   well if you have experienced all the three, I guess you have lived a little   #note_to_self"
the familiar peace of existing in harmony with my heart
"the less you know, the more you will talk and vice versa   #observation"
maybe focus on actions that do not lead to distress in others  maybe pause to tend to the ones calling out for you instead of focusing on your own needs first

I like counting stars with you.
the warm feel of being loved I like to carry that within me
part of me will always need you
खुद ही क़त्ल करते हो  फिर दफ़ना भी देते हो  और फिर खुद ही  रो रो के पुकारते हो

Evening blooming melodies #nofilter  From my tiny balcony garden
when our gazes...........cling
my chaos wants to dissolve  in the warmth of your calm
there aren't enough minutes in the day for how long  I want to hide myself in you
broken bits of moonlight  strung into a luminous thread  in an attempt to darn the damaged portion of the heart
without much thought blindly pushed off the edge to the point of no return  .........still falling.........
when all the blanks  are filled in quickly and  everything falls into place
"emotions tugging at me needles pricking my throat eyes burning a savage burn  looking up at the dark grey sky, drawing my attention to a deep inhale  pushing the prickling  down....down....down  exhaling blissful void tears cleansing the debris resting in sighs of soothing solace"
I smile to myself  when your thoughts  attend to me like dove feathers touching the sky
"warm hugs,  butterfly kisses  cozy cuddles and  losing ourselves in  whispered giggles   kinda mood"

silence prickles like  spiders crawling  up my spine  silence soothes when my blooming flowers vie with  each other to make me smile
birds’ cacophony...........soothing me   #lockdown_joys
swallowing down jagged bitterness to rest in the familiar blanket of the emptiness
Sometimes all you can do is.........say nothing.
life...........always ends up finding its way
"when hopes are dashed, keep the faith that you will get through no matter what  #note_to_self"
Advice is not always needed. A quiet presence with a heart that understands is enough.
Let.............things unfold naturally in its own time.   (Keep doing what you are doing without rushing what cannot be rushed)

You and Me...............nothing but a span of time.
Surviving is not pertinent.........living IS
To die.............you have to LIVE

"I started my journey  with the cardinal north  as my guide, lost myself and  found my True North instead"
this heart can be as  soft as a dandelion’s pappus  or a metal armored protective cage taking care of me time and again
"the metallic taste  of copper and blood, as I bit my tongue  and silenced myself  so often...  a visceral reminder  to myself to become  my own priority and  fight a good game  this time, by my rules"

I can always alter  the way I respond to stuff around me  before the stuff  alters me

living............softly
refusing to be squelched..........by broken promises
"I don’t own anything or anyone, but   you...........own me unconditionally"
"I am always here, always reflecting you - do you have the time to pause and reflect me back ???"

Happiness is NOT derived from your possessions but from the actions of compassion with the ones around you.

Life........lives on.

"hearts love, hearts break hearts love again and again,   as if it was the only thing it knows to do"
I know it is you sliding into my musings when that space beneath my belly button throbs
You are............ destruction wrapped in a toe-curling moment
this tiny heart of mine beats loud enough  to leave breadcrumbs  of echoes for you  to find me through time
"when I close my eyes,  and feel your thumb,  gently caressing  the centre of my palm,  I feel my fears slipping away"
"We all want to burn in passion, in love, in lust.  It is addictively dangerous, ergo, we want it."
no more negotiations no more bargains no more heartaches
some truths chain me to painful moments instead of setting me free
"amidst the debris  of the conditioned self,  I search and find my  lost and hidden parts, standing in familiar relief  in reuniting with what I truly AM"
love needs to be caressed with more love
whispered enhancements to activate.......stillborn dreams
I can never live up to your version of me  -  I choose to exist only and only as my version of me
you can get lost even when you think you know where you are

Perplexion. Vulnerability. Hilarity. Sexiness. Sense of Freedom.   you are all of it and more  but your SERENITY is what melts me from within
"how do you manage to reach deep inside me and yank out all these emotions, I never knew existed ?"
"No matter how many walls I put up, you end up scrambling my brain."
Shhhhh........... heed my heartbeat it only knows how to  sing your song
Shhhhh........... I am eavesdropping  in the hope of hearing you on the other side of time
madly wholly  obsessively  yours
"his purpose filled tongue,  like crushed velvet, leaving shivers in its wake setting all her nerve  endings on fire"
"holding me close he strums his hands  through my hair  like I was his violin, my head tucked  into his neck"
intimate moments of my hands threading  through your hair in gentle strokes while I watch you go under surrendering to  sweet slumber
"looking up at the sky, silently loving you  with every scarred  piece of my heart ............................... and a little bit more"
searching for sunshine  that ushers in certain  death of despair
"singing to myself, the lullaby of the brave"
TIME - the invisible ingredient in the alchemy of transforming this chaotic present into a safe future  #patience #endurance
"If the ending is unhappy, let it go and move forward   (destroy patterns of thoughts or routine or interactions that are are never going to work for you)"

I keep singing as if  my songs will hear you

You...........anchor me.

"her and him  soulful, consuming  and meant to last"
"I teeter on the edge, emotions whipping at me,  coasting through my veins,  finally twisting around my heart"
"come midnight,  the hunger for you ratchets up,  to feel all of you, to consume all of you"
"the moment I met you,  something shifted  in my heart - and never left"
"words soaked in poison,  travel deep coating the  arrow of triggers ready  to be launched from  it’s quivering quiver"
"releasing you, knowing you do not care for being held - has been liberating"
I can never compete with a memory.
what I did yesterday got me today
letting the storm outside lull the edges of the storm within
"if you do not want a life of compromises, work on your self-reliance and self-confidence"
mutual trust is the strongest tie in human relationships
"the power of action does not lie in the process of execution, but in the crucial moments before you start, inside your headspace  #action"

Loneliness sometimes seeps so deep that I forget what I was lonely for anymore.
I don’t know what the future holds for me but it definitely has you in it.
"calm settles over me,  sinking into my bones, when I think of you"
I keep waiting for you to  come around  the corner and  surprise me
"the thrill of laughter the release of tears the surrender via pain and loss the fire in standing my ground, the water of knowledge within,  quenching my deep thirst my quest ending,  with as many breaths as I have left,  to stay fluid in the  simple sensation of being alive"
leftover sensations of our time together keep following me  like a dark cloud  pregnant with rain
my sense of humor is better than my sense of direction  #reminder_to_self

"thoughts of you  as is inevitable, always go where  paths are not paved with good intentions"
holding on to that faint  luminescence of a memory  of being safe in your arms
the luminescence of  one impactful thought enough to light many purposeful actions
"You,  looking at me  with eyes blazing  like diamonds  I bask, I soak, I bathe in the luminescence letting it chase the  lurking melancholy away"
moments of pause when nothing needs to be said and everything is said just like that
"recognizing the chaos,  knowing, I am in this chaos ploughing straight through it to find my tunnel out of it"
searching for............that fearless faith of innocence
with you......... my lines are a constant blur
"People come and go.   Focus on the one(s) who stays, instead of focusing on who left."

"when I think of you I see everything in a different light not better, not worse, just ""more"" more colors, more texture, more depth, more Me, more You, more Us"
"when I imagine you  holding me in your arms,  sitting together in silence  It is like I did not just step inside  from the freezing and bitter cold,   I was inside with a fire crackling, and I am handed hot chocolate  and marshmallows"
hearing someone say that they care about you actually believing someone cares about you   - a long journey for me
"it is only in your arms,  my heart pressed to yours,  our breaths swirling, and deep,  my spirit loves to dance  in wild abandon to the  aeons old rhythm of  our coupled heartbeats"
"the moment I learnt  to abandon everything  that I thought I was, to YOU  the abyss became my valley of flowers the dark became my light the chaos became my order  nothing transformed to everything"
"after the fear gets tired of fearing,  courage cajoles my surrender  anchors me to the column of faith  urging me to live in soft abandon  staying in this moment, this hour,  this minute, this second"
"shedding skins of different  colours, orientation,  thoughts and time,  we travel and pause to be loved and yet  again to be lost  does it matter, when I know  you are the same as me  I am the same as you  finally sparks of One Flame is how we are meant to shine"

everytime we connect my heart stems the tide  of the latent impulse to  hold on to everything  that is you for  just a min longer
"an ocean rumbling  with tidal waves of stories, of victories,  of losses, of sadness, of joy,  I journey from shore to shore"
watching the rising tide  of restlessness  I wait for the half moon to ebb that flow  gently placing me  on the shores of calm
adjusting my sails through tides of time sometimes hustling sometimes bustling
sometimes guilt hangs  over me with the secrets I have to be cremated with

skating on thin ice with a convincing  masquerade of words bundling worries and  distress tight inside
"ripping off the mask  of helplessness suffocating me donning the attitude of ""This is Sparta""  for all my demons of distrust"
fear of uncertainty        masked by     strength of focus  on what serves us now
"The only way to prove that you can be of help is to BE of help.   (don't need to keep flashing a project report in SM or around you, keep serving quietly and let go )"
"if something works, share  if something is useful to others (relevant imp information), share   if you have recovered or know a recovery story, share it with the ones going through this   if nothing, listen and support the best way you can  Repeat  #covid #support"
"My point of thought: how do we motivate people around us without underlining this gratefulness aloud, which could serve as a demotivating factor for the ones going through a bad time  gratitude and service need to be expressed silently"
"Student 3- I am grateful my brother recovered from of COVID ( we all murmur a group  of relief)   Student 4 - (in tears) I have lost a colleague, and colleague's parents - I am so scared - ...and so on..(the fear escalates)  Student 5 - my relative is struggling in the hospital"
Real-Life Example in my class:  Student 1: I lost my job and I am ok with it and I will get through it. I am grateful to be here  Student 2: I have to share I am grateful that I got a promotion - feeling happy   I see a shadow of pain on the other's face (I take care of it later)
"Gratitude or being grateful is a very important aspect in our life.   But showcasing it in SM or in a group, where you know others could be suffering, loss or lack of that resource is kind of cruel I thought.   This thought is bothering me  Can we be grateful in silence?"

love becomes easy  after you have  nothing more  left to lose
poetry is easy after you have  been ravaged  by reality
I like who I am around you
a familiar silhouette  haunts her dreams  influencing her reality
"the thirst for you pursues, through the mist of time"
"people leave, memories don’t"
I found this informative in terms of being aware of what needs to be kept in mind
"find your silver lining, no matter how tough today is and anchor yourself to that - and then baby steps"
right knowledge is to be gained from trusted sources along with using the power of correct perception  when sources are themselves in conflict and when there is not enough knowledge   wait and watch while taking the necessary precautions  avoid speculation and assumptions

"she is an enigma,  but only to those  that only see her shell she is an open book  to those who do  care enough to  know her from  deep within"

बेधड़क दिलों के तारो से जुड़ते गए हम।
बेमतलब उन हसीन ख़्वाबों में खोते गए हम ।

बेवजह उन आंसुओं में डूबते गए हम ।

"I like it when you lose  your precious control,  that you value so much when you are with me"
the beauty of a lone cloud sailing across a perfect blue sky feels like you are watching over me
"I promise   to be true to my truth black, white or grey to make peace with my past,  present and future  because of the choices I made to choose my battles smartly to love ME warts and all to Rock and Roll, shakin' my tail feathers no matter what, no matter how  #promise_to_self"

"seeking love  swimming through flash floods of uncertainty, grasping a floating log of love here and there bruised, out of breath, slipping, drowning, floating,  the #valor was no longer  about seeking love but living every breath with love she already had within herself  #vss365"

"Your love is the lost piece, needed to complete the puzzle, that is my heart."
sometimes I am  content just  having you  in my thoughts
"carrying within me all that I have gained all that I have lost all that, which still  serves a purpose"
your thoughts are my quiet company   in the stillness of  the purple dawn
imperfectly.........unpredictable
we all have our own stuff to overcome    [be kind to one another]
denying anything good coming your way is a great way of NOT loving yourself
"you can feel love in so many ways  - the joy of just being healthy  - beauty around you  - nature and pets - the tiny miracles of life  look around, embrace whatever uplifts you....."

you make me want  the promises the chances the future
I try to draw you with my words and yet......
time humming your songs in me
you left behind a storm-shaped masterpiece within me
P.S. I need you
sometimes you drown me in your tenderness
this fast-paced world is more than a hive of vice and debauchery.
when you are loved so much that your heart bursts and overflows.   [ love your loved ones like that ]
Be willing...............to change.
The perfect path never appears. Make yours perfect by walking your path.

Too many GoodbyesToo little Hellos
You are the rhythm that my heart beats to.

My worst has got NOTHING to do with you and ALL to do with me.

You are my most vulnerable silence.
Fill your mind with stories that will keep inspiring you.

You cannot control the happening. You may be able to expand or contract your imagination and thought to give depth and width to the happening.

when everything is urgent but agonizingly slow
Do good ..........not to feel good or look good.

You are.... You always will be....  it is enough for me I will rest in this truth
You are..........that mirror that holds everything of this imperfect me.

hurt does not want logic hurt does not want to be nice   hurt wants to hurt back hurt............just.........hurts

Pain sometimes overpowers Love
Love easily overpowers all thoughts

“you are not the only one who has suffered.  Who wants more.  Who wants them back.  Who doesn’t want to be afraid anymore.  Or alone.  Or frightened.  Or powerless.  ‘cause you’re not the only one who imagined a world where everything was different.  Better.”  #ww84
“You can only have the truth. And the truth is enough. The truth is beautiful”  #ww84
“This world was a beautiful place just as it was and you cannot have it all”  #ww84
"“And everything has a price, one I’m not willing to pay”  #ww84"
“I have never wanted anything more..But he is gone..and thats the truth”  #ww84
Be kind when it is needed to share what you have with love.  (Being kind when YOU want to be kind versus being kind when the situation needs your kindness)
Draw boundaries when it is necessary to protect yourself from hurt.

Let my soul be that mirror  which eternally reflects     the love I have for      ...........YOU.........
You are the sun within my sun
You make my poems come alive.
You unfurled that gift in me which I deemed as lost and forgotten.
Everytime I hear your voice I add that memory to the jukebox of my soul.
Scatter me in you so that I can always live in you.
Everyone of us has inside us some amount of “crazy” that makes us act in ways that help us cope during our downtime and also hopefully help us grow if we choose to let it.   ( don’t judge 😊😊 - you might have something hidden which could be even weirder 😝)
"Getting stuck in the quagmire of how much you have done for others will never free you from arrogance and cycle of expectation and suffering.   Serve and let go, keep moving, keep serving your purpose."
The point of good behavior is not to feel amazing about ourselves but to communicate our respect for others.

Realize that your REACTION and not the obstacle is the actual enemy.
allowing external forces to influence our feelings is surrendering CONTROL to that force   (it can be someone or something)

Watching your thoughts without judging or reasoning is one of the  first steps to understanding yourself.

Afraid......... because it has come to mean everything
"Feeling well loved, like a cat thoroughly stroked  - that 😈"
All I know is   here was where  I had to be  and   you are who  I had to be with
The difference between success over failure and who you are rests in the power of your belief.
Strategic retreat is not to be confused with escape or surrender   Skilful retreat is a sign of intelligence and strength
All worthy goals meet some resistance

"There are NO missed opportunities.   It just means there are better possibilities waiting to be achieved by you.   (Stop looking back on who or what  you think, you might have missed - you are right where you need to be)"
"Right action is one of the easiest way to self-acceptance.   (Right action = knowing when to act, retreat, wait, allow, give, receive and so on)"
Your nature may have limitations to what you cannot be or do   but   it also is specified and gifted by what you can.   (Focus on operating from the skills you have instead of what you don’t)

"lost in US, I found joy"
"Lost in YOU, I unravelled the true me."
"Lost in YOU, I found the beginning, in-between and end of this ""me""."
"lost in your arms, I found my home"
somedays I am a seed s somedays I am in full bloom
"Lost in your poetry, I found the words to write YOU."
Somedays I am the body somedays I am the mind
somedays I am a sloth somedays I am lightning fast
somedays I am long island ice tea somedays I am fireball at work
Do not confuse my silence with stupidity.
somedays I am the source of dawn. somedays I am the harbinger of a relentless night.
I taught my demons to get drunk with me on bliss.
somedays I am a kindling somedays I am ashes
somedays I am brandy somedays I am shandy
somedays I am hailstorm somedays I am drizzle
sometimes I am a sandcastle sometimes I am but a grain of sand
Do not confuse my self-respect with pride.
somedays I am the dare somedays I am the fear
Some days I am the weeping willow some days I weep under the weeping willow
somedays I find me in you somedays I am lost in you
Somedays I am the thought somedays thoughts become me
some days I am the dreamer some days I am the dream
Desire............. is also the beginning of fight
some days I am the earth some days I am the sky
somedays I am the freeze somedays I am fire
Somedays I am the eye of the storm Somedays I whip up a storm
Desire...............is the beginning of manifestation
somedays I am the chaos somedays I am the silence
Desire............ is the essence of living.
Somedays I am Vodka Somedays I am Lemon Soda
somedays I am love somedays I am loved.
Desire............... is the cause of action.
Silently........... I yearn for YOU.
somedays I am an overflowing bubbling brook somedays I am the last drop of a dead river
Somedays I am hope Somedays I am hopeless
Silently............ I feel for YOU
Desire..........is the root of attachments
somedays I am the hunter somedays I am the hunted
Somedays I am the cage somedays I cage
Silently............ I read YOU
Somedays I am the dessert Somedays I am an oasis
Desire......... is the beginning of restlessness.
Some days I am the sun Some days I am a speck  circling around the sun.
Desire.............is the beginning of conflict.
Some days I am the storm Some days I am the calm
Desire............ is the beginning of discontent
We are..............the lovers and the loved
washing........... wounds with my blood
Silently........... reaching out to YOU.
"drunk on your   rippled reflection    on a moonlit lake,  still lost in the ecstasy of being in love with     being drunk on    ...........YOU.........."

...........YOU.......... are what holds me         between             here ............and..........             there
That which YOU are............I am.   (Conversations with my Divine)
Desire.............is the birth of all creation.

"lets meet, where we can get salty with each other, without inhibitions"
swimming in my  saturnine funk
Laughter subsides.. Watching the moon rise
Yayayay surprise tackle - joyful laughter
Let’s meet where rivers merge into the sea
Running to play hide and seek - fingers on lips - shhhhhh (giggle)
"Sometimes I miss, the kisses I could have stolen, nuzzles I could have sighed into and him that I will never be able to hug ever again....."
Tickles and tumbles - Running my fingers lovingly through his hair
Let’s meet where we just ARE
Lets meet where we never have to say hello or goodbye
Music and slow dance - sighs into his chest
Lets meet where goodbyes lead to quick “hellos”
Vodka and campfire - nestled in the mountains
Done - let’s meet 😁😁😁😝😝🤪
Let’s meet where there are no tears
"Lets meet where tears are never shed, unless it expresses pure joy."
Lets meet where horizon bends
Lets met where tears help shed all our inhibitions
Let’s meet where tears washes away our pain
Let’s meet where tears turn to joyful laughter

"We may never meet.......but I know we will have love, laughter and conversations when we do get to meet in a different time and space"
"You are not there in form..........but I live with you in me, knowing I will meet you soon."
That moment made me believe........in life after death
The deja vu moment..........proved to me that there was a me beyond me....

In the end.........my reality was better than my dream
In silence.........love is me
In silence.........I am that seed of unsaid thoughts
In silence....... my angels and demons are partners in crime
In silence..........time bends
In silence..........wisdom teaches me lessons with love
"In silence........... I rejoice, living inside a dewdrop"
In silence..........romance learns from me
"In silence.........I am no longer this body, only soul"
In silence............we are one
In silence........you are in my heart
In silence...........time is not linear
In silence..........I feel you in me
In silence..........I wish to live in your sighs forever
In silence..........infinity becomes a tiny spark in me
In silence............ I always feel your presence
In silence.........I cut through all my illusions
In silence.........I surrender
In silence........I hold you deep within.
In silence.......... I know myself
Sunday cajoles me  to play with its  myriads of shadows
In silence.......I dance with eternity
In silence.......... there is nothing but the truth
In silence.........I am divine

Methinks this traffic cop is spending more money to come to collect LOL. #weird #Bangalore-traffic-cops
So I called the cop at work and he actually said he will come anywhere to collect 100 bucks #amazed all for just 100 bucks
And when I said my dad will pay him he refused to come further than the public place. Rocks says maybe he thought he will get beaten up haha
The traffic cop who took my number on 31May actually called today and came by somewhere near my house just to get 100 rupees
