[Verse 1: Sergio]
I hear my name a lot, and apparently y'all got a lot to say/
But only behind my back, their lips button up when they in my face/
They look me in my eyes, dap me up like everything's OK/
Sneak dissing, playing both sides, that's that shit I don't like/
Talk about a nigga all day, you must be gay/
But I'm not homophobic, if you're gay just admit! Don't lie on no ho shit/
Be proud nigga! Keep it G, maybe one day you can be like Frank Ocean/
Its obvious you niggas like me, that's why you keep saying my name/
Final warning, snatch the controller out your hand. This is not a game!
I'm a shark in the water, sense blood far away and I ain't feast in a while/
Vampire tooth, no bark. Just a mean ass bite, make a mean ass smile/
Spill all your blood on the floor, oh no I won't need a mop won't need a towel/
Just sweep it all up in my Styrofoam cup, that's how we get poured up in Halloween Town/
Drown you in Camp Crystal Lake/
Tried to catch the Loch Ness monster, use you dicks as my masturbate/
Pause, Neezy telling me don't shoot them, but I wanna be the camera man/
Look in the mirror, say my name in vain if you can/
I beez in the trap, Candyman/
Oh my God, Oh my God, where is Nicki Minaj/
Massive Attack, Ski mask all black, grill gold and my condom is camouflage/
They never saw me coming, just surrender, it's too late to start running/
Dog hoes try to flea. Just fall to your knees, plead for forgiveness and I might let you breathe/
Try to hang on to your pride, your neck hang from a noose and that hang from a tree/
I got the profit in my pocket, helicopters in my closet bitch you can't hang with me/
Fly like I just left the hanger, G5 in my closet man you can't hang with me/
Gasoline, Kerosene, Propane, Butane. Waka Flock not flame compared to a nigga like me/
Fire in my mouth, glow behind my teeth; Jack-o-lantern style, Halloween Town/
This that murder flow, that's all the bitch wrote. #SecretSTEWdio, don't make me kill these niggas, SERGIO!
So dope, a verse cost a kilo. Raw uncut, wretch around in a speed boat/
Literally got the chainsaw on deck. My crooked eye nickel nine, I bring that Slaughterhouse to your neck/
Leather Face on the Guillotine Swords remix/
Halloween Town Day Massacre, record and release it on Netflix/
Trick-or-treat, tell that freak "Let's make a movie"/
Red Rum when she cum, blood bath in a Jacuzzi/
Hit man for hire, contract killer. Whats Louie/
Whats Gucci? Whats drugs? I'm dope, turn you to Pookie/
And that's ALL NIGGA! I've been waiting all year for this Fall nigga/
Piss in a bottle of Cristal nigga and take a shot of the sweat from my balls nigga/
And that's all nigga, I've been waiting all year for this fall nigga/
Blood from the windows to the wall nigga/
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, KILL THEM ALL NIGGA!!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
