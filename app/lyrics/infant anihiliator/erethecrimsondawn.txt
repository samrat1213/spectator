All over the world
Their banners unfurled
O mighty War Lords!
Gal√®ria restored!

They've watched that darkest hour of night
Whose gloom precedes the dawn of light

That solemn hour when silence, deep
Seals not the eyes of those that weep
The light will die at the end of days
Like shadows have the mighty passed away

Around the world
Their banners unfurl

Soon to hear the shouts of war
Like the waves of the tumultuous sea
That break upon the shattered earth
And quake the ground eternally

Tides
A swarm of the helpless enthralled
Will falter, then die and litter the soil
Tides
A swarm of the helpless enthralled
Will falter, then die and litter the soil

They've watched that darkest hour of night
Whose gloom precedes the light

The ill-fated souls lie down in the crepuscular dusk
And with none to make afraid
Leaning calmly towards the river
Dimly gleaming through the shade
Death shall seem but summer darkness
For they underestimate the void, unknown
There they shall merge into the fire that is breaking from below

Mountains eclipse the sky

The Kingdom is lost to the night
