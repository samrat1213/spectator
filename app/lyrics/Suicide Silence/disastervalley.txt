Fuck a resolve
It means nothing to me
Fuck a resolve
It means nothing to me

Take notes my friend I'll show you how I climb that mountain
I walk downhill while everyone takes the beaten path
A picture for later? I'm seeing the clouds right now
Nothing is bringing me down
Didn't I tell you I cannot be stopped?
I cannot be stopped
Stop

Fuck a resolve
I see right through the weakness
Fuck a resolve
It means nothing to me

Let the disaster in
Let the disaster win
Tearing down the walls that keep me struggling
Let the disaster in
Let the disaster win
Nothing to stop me from rebuilding again

Inspiring death gave us all we asked for
A fall from nothing into our own demise
I am lucky to still be alive
I am lucky I still want to drive
I turned the wheel
And watched...
The anarchy prevail

(I let the monsters see)
(That they are my tail)
(Cut it off and let me grow again)
(And let me grow one again)

I set them free
And all they did was cry
I set them free
And all they did was hide

I took the bullet

I took the bullet
So I could live
So I could give

I took the bullet
So I could live
So I could give
