Sever the tongues of the wretched 
Eradicate the filth of the divine

Ancient pariah cursed by the weak 
Encased in the flames
Vengeance I now seek 
Vengeance I seek

Immortality awaits me for what I've become 
My insanity my darkness within 
The skies will burn
In the shadows of eternal sin

You all will suffer 
You will all rot the same 
You all will suffer
You will all rot the same

Despise humanity 
Slaughter relentlessly 
Despise humanity 
Slaughter relentlessly 

False prophecies etched in bone 
Lost souls they enthrall 
Man and serpent entwined 
Now rise to conquer all

Fallen figures born marked 
Their endless misery grows 
The procurer of their darkened faith thrives 
Bear witness to their endless torment 
The agony of the deprived

Sever the tongues of the wretched 
Eradicate the filth of the divine

Ancient pariah cursed by the weak 
Encased in flames 
Vengeance I now seek
Vengeance I seek

Let the blood of all humanity spill 
Erase this pathetic failure
