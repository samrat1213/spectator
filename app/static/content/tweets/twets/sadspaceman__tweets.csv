Bridges and ashes  bridges and ashes
Hiding in my coffin
The only horror is the continual breath
"Cross my heart and hope to die, she said"
The great burning
Oh but death overlooked me
I dropped the nails I broke the coffin
This little ending of mine
The mud the dirt the great big hurt
I am the war
It’s a fucking slow burn
"Splinters, darling"
Playing dead in a field hoping the sunflowers will reclaim my body
Seeking end to the endless
Quiet is the sadness
"This is my burial, darling"
Wanna be dead like flowers in that broken fucking vase
I whispered to the jackal  we are the same
I dare you to convince me to live
"It’s only us and all our lies, darling"
Whose blood is on your hands
I am the pieces they carved out of you
"This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it die"
I am the coffin
There is only time and what seeks to end it
Regret as sharp as the butchers knife baby
"I am the rot in your bones, lover"
Dropping stones in your ocean
No peace for the estranged
You could have fixed this
Choose the life that terrifies you
I remember the pain in your eyes  and I told you it was okay to die
I told my father I’d be back  but when I returned  his body was cold
"No remorse for me, brother"
We break in new ways
A dozen broken butterflies
It’s just me and my sunflowers I keep in this box full of crazy
Tell me about the cage
Rotten empire
An open wound that always hurts
Yet we still mourn for the irrecoverable past
The shadow of what you wanted
"It’s not about what you chase, but what chases you he said"
"No remorse for the dead man, dear"
What are you running from?
"Estranged, darling"
Learn to live without me
The ending is where I began
Which world did you get lost in
Which side are you standing on
The fire is too shy to let me watch my dear
Making new words to fill in the blanks
If you’re lucky it will kill you
Who’s blood is on your hands
Built on broken
And I will burn alone
Whether we align or not
Collecting emptiness
"Tell me what broke you, child"
Built on nothing
This is the way love ends
Dead ends for my darling
We are the bridge burners my dear
Consumers of the snake
It’s all gone
This empty dying thing
Circling my insides  The vultures in my intestines
I’m nothing but rot and decay
Truth and defiance my dear
You are the bridge  I am what burns you
The emptiness gets emptier
The time eater the sea serpent the endless tunneling in my heart
And we all go our separate ways
"It’s the empty mans land, no one else’s my dear"
"It’s nothing but rot here, brother"
To keep on wondering
Tomorrow is already hungry
"Devouring myself tonight, tomorrow the grave"
Do you want someone that will keep you from drowning or someone who will explore the waters depth with you?
Am I looking at a stranger?
Well we’re empty again aren’t we
It’s nothing but empty here
Welcome to the land below the ground
And if you can’t wipe the slate clean pray you break it
My wounds will drown us both
She believed us to be infinite
What does the empty space mean to you
Bridges and ashes  bridges and ashes
Hiding in my coffin
The only horror is the continual breath
"Cross my heart and hope to die, she said"
The great burning
Oh but death overlooked me
I dropped the nails I broke the coffin
This little ending of mine
The mud the dirt the great big hurt
I am the war
It’s a fucking slow burn

It’s nothing but empty here
Welcome to the land below the ground
And if you can’t wipe the slate clean pray you break it
My wounds will drown us both
She believed us to be infinite
What does the empty space mean to you
It’s all running low mama
We are tomorrow’s failures
Where the dead flee the scene
"You don’t gotta worry when you’re dead, darling"
"I’ve been here before, said the snake to his tail"
"Tell me, how many dreams have you killed?"
Devouring myself and the grave with it too
Success only as strong as the willingness to flee the scene
Worship the soil where everything dies
"Here, there, we all gotta die somewhere"
This is where dreamers die  (Will you stay here tonight?)
"Bullet holes, broken wings, butterflies and battered things"
Leaving scraps for death on my doorstep hoping he will pay me a visit
I came here to break the slate not wipe it clean
She put his god in chains and he worshipped her instead
"There are holes in this ship, lover"
Reaching a hand out to death like the stray cat he is
Sometimes we feel more alone when we are surrounded
"And they’re raging war, endless war baby"
Different day same horrible fucking reality brother
Darling will you sink or swim
"I’ll eat when I’m ready, said the snake to his tail"
A chance to leave my bones behind
Here in the land where it all ends
I don’t know how it begins but the end looks a lot like this
"Quietly now, or you will wake the dead among us"
A new bullet to bite every day
This is the end of every beginning
When did the haunting stop
Gone but where did it go
Burials and broken hearts
And if love come finds you I pray you run for your life
Were we made for destruction
But I won’t play your game
Bullets for broken men
Living to die
The end is near but not near enough mama
Suffering willed by god
A new kind of nothing
This is the broken adventure
Created to be destroyed
"The dead do not look peaceful, I’ve seen them brother"
Every bridge will burn child
I’ll be the nail if you’ll be the coffin
Can’t navigate space with blood on your helmet
Tonight I want to be a ghost
You don’t really know someone until you can admit that you never knew them at all
A vulture a parrot laughing and laughing and laughing
Denial and other fun pastimes
"He’s dead, remember?"
That shadow won’t ever leave me be
"Lose the one you love the most, that’s the commandment"
I’ll never be able to hold your hand again
Here we go round and round  we all fail we all fall down
Trying to find god coming up short
Today we rip the stitches again
The dead make a home inside my head
Patrolling space looking happiness and coming up short
This is where the dreamers die
And this is how it dies
I cursed at the sun for lighting up the dark and now I regret every word
Is your body a temple or a prison
What remains in the remains  to live is death to die is gain
The great undoing
You don’t know the first thing about me
"Crush my bones into fine sand and make me into a castle, baby"
Together we will be alone
All of the blood in my body and it still won’t be enough
A cosmic disaster
What’s the difference between gardens and graveyards anyways?
"Walking cane in hand to the coffin, my grandfather stares at my father’s cold body"
The cruelty of child’s play
"Save me from me, that is the plea"
"This is deaths true form, remember it"
Duality and desperate measures my dear
"Follow me, I’ll show you the way to empty space"
You spoke to me like life gave you another chance but the truth is you are just as gone as you’ve always been
How do you wake the dead
I don’t have much of anything left
Forever but in some alternate fucked up universe
Place me inside this box of rot mama
To live together in exile
"Deforestation, it’s the rotting of the empty mans heart for me"
Queen of the rot
We break our teeth on the bones of our friends
Put my dreams in an electric chair
"This is the family death sentence, remember it baby"
It’s never going to get better child
King of the damned
"Old bones, new graves"
To sit and watch us crumble
"Barrel of a gun, oh what fun"
Lost friends and dead ends
"Something other than this, that’s the wish"
Tell me about the horseman who found his head
Every cell will burn in hell
"She found god, said he wasn’t enough"
These mornings are breaking me mama
I dreamt you were still alive
Dancing in the grey
"Poetry and dead ends for me, baby"
The hollow ribcage is where god hides
Put your best foot forward and break it
"The horseman found his head, said I don’t want that vile thing no more"
Death drives me in circles
We all make our way back to the ocean
But our bones will be alone
I’ll drag this ship over a goddamn mountain range
The great big what if
God gave me this third eye and gouged it out
"Welcome to this damned dimension, the exit is on the left"
Welcome to the black hole
Impossible mornings
"Young or wise, we all dance the chalk outline"
Death aspirations
Some days are heavier than others
I didn’t consent to life
It ends in silence
Here’s the one you love the most: now watch them slip through your fingers
Where is your passion
Death is the daydream
How many ghosts do you haunt?
"A different life, that’s the dream"
Why grow old when you can die sooner
Dead gardens  dead gardens
Far away from the birds nest mama
Why do we continue to wake up
"I have denied the sun, you are no longer"
Silence severed a friendship
I’d rather be dead
My head is a fishbowl swimming with creatures
Those days will never return
Welcome to the coffin room
And passion became a prisoner
Inside my head the galaxy is dead
The terrible continual tick of the clock
The great big empty
Ghosts come in twos
How quickly we run out
Flowers for fools
Eating lies
Take me deeper than the dirt
Let’s get buried alive together
When the ghosts come running
Crushed the daydreamers skull
"Sunflowers in my ribcage, there is no more space"
Down the drain we go
"I will rip the feathers from the eagle, I will fly and I will die"
Being dead is easy
Bones and burials
You are here but you are the farthest away you’ve ever been
You can’t bring back the dead mama
"The sunflowers are singing, it’s time for me to go"
Hiding in the ribcage of a rotting fucking tree
I dream of death but I can never reach him
Every thought is a kick in the teeth
Someday you will flip the switch
"Beware of the sharp edges, darling"
Birdcage brain
Drowning  patiently
"Want to be dead, dead as can be"
"Two bodies eclipsing one another, but our minds never meet"
Ghosts come in pairs
"The reaper sits on his throne of bones, I’ll worship if you take me with you"
We only grow thorns here
What a web I’ve spun
"The grass is never greener, everything is on fire"
Wanna be dead when I grow up mama
Take time for granted and watch it spite you
I wake up and I suffocate
The daisies are dead and I envy them
"Fuck being the bigger person, make me as small as a goddamn ant"
When the dead talk back
The family tree is poisonous
"Life will always take the ones closest, death does not discriminate"
"I have all the strangers I’ll need, don’t worry about me"
Everything here is made of paper
When silence eats silence
I’ll never make enough art to bring you back
Here in the empty man’s land
"Blue fingers, cold body, what do we do when we’re dead"
If you let them become your home don’t be surprised when it collapses
"He, only holds you in your dreams"
"Sunflowers, daisies, a dead garden in your mouth"
A life robbed
Sometimes I miss the grave
"Darling, the dreams I have of you are criminal"
Someday I wish to be thin air
A meadow for the arsonist
When your answers question themselves
"Grudges and gravestones, what else do you need"
Sometimes it doesn’t feel real
It’ll be over soon
"Open your mouth and speak, speak while you still have the breath to say"
Therapy for ghosts
That’s the last I’ll ever see of you
I’ll sink this ship before it ever sails again
I’ll deny my feelings for you and live a lie so you won’t have to
I am not a stop on the way to finding yourself
Inside my ribcage there is a graveyard
"I have seen this before, I will not be fooled"
Together but alone
Grace for the graceless
Buried death a little deeper
"The inevitable will hunt you down, stop you in your tracks"
We long to escape
Here the dead lay awake
"I am the destination, she said"
"I’ve made my peace with the devil, you can have god"
And when it rains it fucking pours
A grave that ate itself
And death was all that remained
And just like that  it was over
Shallow enough to shatter your soul
The closer you are the farther you get
"We, and all the inevitable forces against us"
And they whispered  let go
Your name burned my throat going down
Your god is made out of paper
And when you disappear
Some days are more impossible than others
This is where the dead sleep  (now come and lay with me)
"Ribs, sternum, clavicle, we break and we break and we break"
What causes the devil to shake
I wake up and I shatter
We drew a line in the sand but everyone knows that sand shifts
"We don’t swim here, we only sink"
Overthought it to death
Got in a fight with Father Time and lost
Tried to make a stone bleed
But even the foxhole looks like a safe place to hide
Swimming and swimming and fucking drowning too
But all I see is rot
"Tell me, what is hungrier than the grave"
He’s here but he’s the farthest away he’s ever been
"Snakes, dancing and dancing and dancing"
We will never belong to each other
She was dreaming he was sleepwalking  they were not built the same
But are you prepared to watch him die?
Said I sounded like my mother
When we eclipse each other
I planted the fire in my mouth
"The snake, the eater of dreams"
But who would celebrate this
We will never relate
And when you see it you feel the twisting in your guts
"Lost my grave, time to dig a new one"
What we love we inevitably lose
In love with a sinking ship
The grave dancer has come again
"The end, the end, the end is near"
A natural disaster named after the one you love
The sky wept for me today
Let our mistakes write themselves
Listen to the grave
I said to the stranger hello and opened a book where I wrote a thousand chapters
"To pull away, pull apart completely"
"We will never make it out alive, darling"
"Run blindly, headfirst and watch it destroy you"
The anniversary of something unimportant
There is nothing as destructive as love  (not even war)
Your hand on my neck is the only poetry I need
"The captain of this upturned ship, mumbles drunk about his lost lover"
Forever has an expiration date
We crave destruction
Set the throne on fire
Is there too much water under the bridge?
Together but so far apart
"I am made of dim lights and moth wings, all the dying things"
"Sadness, homeostasis (what’s the difference?)"
I will show you the hand of release
If you keep holding onto the anchor it’s gonna drag you down with it
Alone in every way a person can be
The thoughts that eat you alive at night
"Existence, you non consensual bitch   (I didn’t want this)"
"Love - If it tries to kill you and you survive, make sure that it dies"
Let’s dance on our own graves
It haunts me and I sit here quietly and let it
"I am no lamb, the wolves were my teachers"
"Your reign is over darling, there’s a new king"
You don’t want to see them with anyone else but you won’t try to make them yours either
What if is what killed me
If we were someone else
What we lose what we gain another year down the drain
Waiting for it to implode
In this next year I wish to disappear
Maybe I will always wonder
Dreams and dreams and dreams again
Don’t look away from the tragedy
"Choke the pain out of my body, set my mind free"
"My organs setting the stage for rebellion, trying to cheat death"
"Wake up and it will all be over, darling"
They all bowed so she chose the one who defied her
Being alone is safest but the heart loves to put itself in danger
Find what’s keeping you alive and fucking bury it
A most beautiful demise
You are no longer my ghost
Did we invent god or did god invent us
Some sadness is meant to stay
"Set me on fire, dance in the ashes"
"Fever dreams, abandoned things"
The shadow man has come to steal your dreams again
"We dug this grave, we didn’t know  we were just so blind"
This will destroy you but you’re gonna fucking let it
I wake up and I think of you
"Children making sandcastles from our crushed bones, baby"
I don’t know when I stopped loving you but I guess that means I’m finally free
Just pretend to be happy
"The match, the flame, the lovers half insane"
The king of carnage
I see ghosts in December
Tell me what the songbird said before she was silenced
Someone stoked the flames and now I’m sitting here burning  (for you)
A sorrowful sky and the scorch of the sun
My heart is rebelling against me
"Ruin, ruin, ruin"
The only thing you can rely on is how unreliable everything is
To say goodbye to the thing that makes you feel alive
The vulture circles me as though I’m already dead
My heart is filled with gasoline
We both knew  (that this would end)
The wounded idiot half asleep
We are the chapters they will set on fire
Every possible ending you could imagine
Pressed my thumbs into your universe just to see how it feels
The problem with time is there’s never enough and there’s always too much
Prayers for prey animals
"Evolve with or without,  the choice is yours"
Thousand day siege of the heart
Pain recognizes itself
"We feast on rot, celebrate decay"
"Two hands on gods neck, squeezing, looking for something more"
"I want to know death like the flies do, the maggots the mushrooms the decomposers"
"Tomorrow is frozen, half asleep"
"Idiots circling the drain, vultures in my brain"
I will write the ending and claim I’ve just begun
Breaking myself to be set free
Don’t let them become your universe
Love letters like bullets
Forever is as dry as the desert
The maggots told me about you
This deceitful heart
Every night the grave calls a little louder
Break the heart chamber by chamber
"The words boil out of your mouth, scalding your throat and you choke"
Been dead and gone but now I’ve raised up like a damn ghost
Who spilled this light and left it to dry
"But if they are the air you breathe, you’ll drown when they leave"
Wild animal gnawing at my rib cage
"Don’t worry, death is just around the corner"
"The further we fall away from each other, the further we fall away"
Sunflowers and arson
Tomorrow and all it’s incompatibilities
Waiting patiently for destruction
"Heart on autopilot, head in the storm clouds"
Never let what hurts you define you
"We will never  (now fill in the blank, darling)"
"You and I, the story to never be told"
I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore
A grave that eats itself
I don’t believe in love because it hasn’t been proven
"She, a disaster none of us prepared for"
We are all haunting ourselves
Watch me drown then dive in too
"Executioner dreams, baby"
Hell and back just for vacation
The maggot eats the brain but he doesn’t get any wiser
Natural disaster of the heart
My dreams are just corpses now
"I can’t outrun my ghosts, darling"
Time to disappear completely
"The earth is calling me to the grave, so I dig"
You don’t really know someone until you can admit that you know nothing about them
We are the death of someday
God stammered
Flay me to the bone and smile
We are destined to end
Watch him plunge to his death
The danger of loving a friend
"Brains spilling out of my temple, head spinning"
"We, our inevitable ending"
"What we lose when we love  (all of it, all)"
"The rabbit in love with the fox,  ignoring instinct to survive  (he will devour you)"
Old ghosts make way for new ghosts
And if time takes sides I know she wasn’t on mine
I will kill the sky and call it love
I’ll cradle this sadness until it gets bigger
Sunflowers and gasoline
And if forever comes knocking I’ll be sure to stay asleep
"I can see you in the dying lights, darling"
Tell the sparrow all your sorrows
Oh the rot we have birthed
"Oh darling, it could’ve been us"
"I am the things, the unwritten things"
"I can’t hide from the shadow above me, the vulture flying in circles"
"The drum gets tired of beating, too"
A blood baptismal
A night capable of eating itself
"I have read all the chapters, the ending is nigh"
Found my mind when I lost it
Cheers to the lost years
Everyday I wake up and I’m eaten alive again
"In circles, in circles, we will never be free"
Oblivion and beyond
"First #ff goes to these beautiful poets, thank you for all you share. @OldandToothless @msbtx @alex_fiscadoro @knowyourdevil @maybechaos @lithiumdrop @kitesandanchors @LovelyFilters @deadpoet______ @afloodofblood @goth_pen @babybadwolf @Moonsecrets4 @rosebleed2 @HJamesPoet"
I will kill what keeps me alive
The what if’s we send to the grave
The weight of words unsaid
"Do you see this incredible mess we’ve made, darling?"
"Hand in hand, we decay"
You fed me lies and I choked
"Life and death, their eternal love affair"
"All around me there is sickness, darling"
It shouldn’t be like this
I am the hollow shell and you are what’s living inside me
Looked at your god and he stuttered
Love will find me kneeling
"We are each other’s apocalypse, darling"
Tell me which tomorrow scares you most
I’ll make my bed in a pit of snakes (you can sleep on your own tonight)
Forever is leaking through your fingertips
Dance with me in all this disease
"I can feel you in all the parts of me that whither, darling"
Take what you want and be on your way (nobody comes to stay)
You’re my favorite sunflower
You and your pretty mistakes
"She, the eater of gods"
"It’s time for the reckoning, darling"
I’ll break my ribcage and you can have whatever you find inside
To be killed by what makes us feel alive
Some days you are the flowers  some days you are the grave
Let the gods kill each other
We are the cracks in each other’s tomorrows
Head in the clouds so I can’t see you clearly
I don’t expect her to
Sweeping up stardust
"The earth wants me back, so I dig my grave"
I’ll write the ending so you won’t have to
"Same haunt, just a different day"
"I dance with the daggers, impale my soul"
I am the king of the wreckage
"My ghosts will learn your name, Darling"
We are the somedays that will never happen
Choked god and she smiled
When I die bury me in the sunflowers
You can’t keep forever on a leash
"We are the things, the forgotten things"
Release the bird with broken wings
"We played with matches, started a fire in a house we didn’t build"
We will find a new beginning and ruin that one too
The poetry between us is dying
God cried when we locked eyes
The blind man sees more than most
"Your gods and mine, choking on the truth"
Your stone cold grip on my heart
Lost my mind when I found it
Sitting at the throne of the wreckage
Baptized in white lies
I’ve seen the conditions of unconditional love
"I have stepped on the snake, whispered to the adder"
When friends turn to lovers turn to strangers again
Tell them you love them and leave them to die
And when we come together we fall apart
Dance in the rot with me
You love them and then you lose them
The eons of want and ruin
Eventually when death comes
Overdosed on you
You were a drug I didn’t ask for
A death I designed
My fucking garden and all the weeds that choke it out
What highlights the differences between us
Here comes another ending
Dead outside my doorstep
The apocalypse we create
Burnt my tongue when I spoke your name
Twisted drunken stargazer
The beckoning of the tomb
How quickly things implode
Distance is the name of the game
The ones that want to rip their own seams are always the ones to sow everyone else’s back together
Hide and seek with death
Love taken from moonstones
Wanting you is killing me
Stare into the sun until you find your answers
Little tiny earthling bursting at the seams
Tell me about the tomb that birthed you
The grievances of the flies
"Vultures, screaming and circling my brain"
Tell me about the emptiness
"The anger in my chest, the roses, the thorns"
"Death, inevitable and beautiful"
Tell me your favorite lie
The secrets of the snakes
"You cut the cord instead of walking the rope, you cut the noose cause you couldn’t cope"
A thousand different endings but not one will suffice
An empty tomb where we used to spin our secrets
The night tucks me in bed and swallows me whole
Bound by the flame
Lies for the listeners
"Bear with me through this dry season, I’ll make my way out eventually"
"You called it a disaster, I called it a masterpiece"
My past forgot me
"When you leave don’t rip out my heart, smother me so I can go out peacefully"
My nightmares feed on feeble dreams
Stepped on the foot of the tiger again
A world for every word I swallowed
What do you do when you outgrow your ghosts
Let’s rock the boat your gods are sleeping on
I love you and I’m afraid
We will never come up for air
My fucking garden is on fire
Decay and assumption
Shattered dreams and broken things
A thousand things I’ll never say
Find the beginning and I’ll find the end
"Don’t be alarmed by the nothingness inside my chest, it used to be a garden"
Make way for a new disaster
Let’s be ready for each other
The nail in the coffin was stolen from the framework of the house that we were supposed to spend our days in
"Some place safer, some place far away from the forbidden"
"Together, we crumble"
"Tie your noose and walk the rope, cut the chord and pretend to cope"
"All the things I couldn’t save, all the things that couldn’t save me"
Healing in the form of friendship and other unexpected love stories
The ticking time bomb that separates us
Bullets in my bones
I’m not sure if we will ever find out what we could be together
He filled my ribcage with daisies where dead things used to be
Lose myself in your shattered glass
Just to sit in the rubble beneath
To run after you or run away that is the question
Forget about the permanent marks they left when they mishandled your heart
I sit and I wait and I shatter
We want to love what we can’t love and that’s why we are breaking
Your disaster is a masterpiece to me
Let’s suffocate under the mess we’ve made
Everything that used to grow here is now a graveyard
"I knew if we got too close the collision would be catastrophic, now I’m sweeping up stardust"
I looked at you  and felt nothing for the first time  I am finally free
Found you at the end of a frayed rope
I had a dream that I saw two snakes kiss and I chastised them because the world wasn’t ready for their love
Dance with me in that forbidden dimension
Insides twisting and turning like snakes every time I hear your name
Woke up at a funeral
The darkness and it’s futile masquerade
A god that regrets
The slow rebirth of infinite pain
The impermanence of permanence
Eternity’s slow march towards the black hole
All my secrets under your tongue
Forbidden feelings and the rot beneath the roots beneath the trees
Take me far away from these thoughts
How inconvenient it is to have these feelings
There is only death and what lives inside it
When you leave make sure the piece of me you take is vital so I don’t survive
In love with the storm
Set myself on fire to keep you warm
"This dying dream in my palm, a tiny nothing"
"It really is the end, isn’t it?"
Revisiting graves
Something I always knew
Came home late last night smelling of someone else’s dreams
The best part of today was the part where it ended
I would rather destroy myself completely than walk through those walls again
There is only death and what defies it
And for my next magic trick I will drown in the space you left behind
I’m sorry for compromising you
I will learn to breathe again
"Break me in creative ways, darling"
Once upon a time we were a funeral I guess some things never change
Eventually everything ends
I would rather set my bones ablaze in our memories than live to tell the tale
Came home late last night reeking of dead memories
"Nothing that comes around stays, darling"
I thrive when I die
Take apart the earth
What do I do about the infestation in my brain
But what if history was just that
The fire was snuffed out long ago
The one before the one
"I’m not creative, I’m just broken"
Love and sanity do not mix
What do you do with a solar system heart
Learn to unlove
Saints don’t come around here
Bones and all the things that break them
I want you to learn my rules so you can break them I want you to leave and never come back
"I want to release you, tear you from my flesh"
"We drown in lies, but the truth buries us"
"It was always me, you fucking liar"
The biggest threats you face are the ones you create
Devices of human destruction
You are the missing piece
"Break the ribcage, free what’s inside"
When you die of thirst you curse and think you would rather drown
It only took a thousand deaths before the summer had no more tomorrows
This is for the ones we lost along the way
You’re the ghost that lives
I shine a little brighter every time you break me
We all come from the same dirt
Something beyond the disease
Death is a luxury
In surges and resurgence
I’m not here by choice
I will retrace my path and lay down in the same dirt we came from
And then it swallowed itself whole
Inevitably dead
Something about time and space
A minefield of memories
Bones sinew and stardust
Welcome to the bottom
Bringing up the dead
I made that pedestal for you but now it’s time to knock it down
Afraid to be reckoned with
So full of everything but life
Darling there is nothing left
Watched that nightmare eat itself alive
Life only gives when there is more in the end it can take
He’s in the grave; rotting
I could go for the end of the world right now
A darkness that lives and breathes
But is it really love if it doesn’t end in some form of tragedy?
An eternal dance with the forgotten
This nothingness inside my chest used to be a garden
My brain is a minefield and I play roulette everytime I tiptoe around your memory
Kneel to my usurper
Rather tie my own fucking noose than let go of the rope that burns me
"Holding funerals for shooting stars, sitting vigil for their death"
Invisible ties are the hardest to break
"Together, we are a funeral"
How long will you lay seige to my heart
Do you hear the graves singing at night?
Father Time is a filthy liar
I am dripping all my sins on your porcelain floor
An emptiness that lives and breathes
"Let’s build on my broken foundation darling, let’s pour cement and stand in it"
"Drink the night in, the dreams will leave you by daybreak"
Your love is a cracked bottle of whiskey spilling over my body dripping your sins into my flesh
There is only nature and what kills it
Progress is when the pain hurts a little less
"I want to sink into the mud beneath, I want the earth to swallow me whole"
Give yourself back to the ocean
"He’s sleeping amongst the wolves, picking wool from his teeth"
"A sunflower with a broken neck, stem snapping"
Death and daydreams
Hell and back is an understatement
Started digging my grave the day I met you because I knew I wouldn’t survive
I am a sum of all the things I’ve lost
We remember everything we were supposed to forget
My dreams are starving to death
"We are together, nuclear"
Set a flame to the bouquet
A lot of dead ends but nowhere to start
The only thing I fantasize about is death
"The memory crawls into bed with me every night, rests its heavy body on my lungs and suffocates me with thoughts of you"
"We are a funeral, darling"
"How arbitrary, to claim that blood ties us together"
What feeds the flames and what snuffs them out
"Those who soar to the highest heights also plunge to the deepest depths, it is the price we pay to feel"
"If you knew your greatest love would end in tragedy, would you still jump in?"
"Found you nestled in my mind again, what an unsafe place for you to be"
Feeling is starting to feel very inconvenient
Consistently inconsistent
What a luxury it is to disappear completely
"You are a storm, darling And I, hate the rain"
You are something thick and vile and I cannot stop drowning in you
This was never a matter of choice
"You are a tempest, darling"
Sick with memory
The humor of loving the unavailable; the irony
Love is never predictable
Think I’ll run away and hide till the feelings go away
"But why am I feeling this, for you?"
The smell is medicinal; death
Where do the stars go when they die?
And then your house becomes a prison
The art of self destruction takes a lifetime to master
I dream of sinking into the earth
What right do you have to trespass into my dreams
Fill my cup to the brim then throw it in my face
"Your match burned out long ago but my flames still fucking burning, gonna suffocate under all this smoke"
What if your blessing in disguise is actually a curse
Count on nothing and nothing more
What a waste
Heavy lungs filled to the brim with death
Breathing is a nightmare
"They say he’s dying, his body a river"
"Give me some time to fall out of love, darling"
Quicksand lungs and a heart served raw at a candlelit dinner
You’ll find me when the world collapses
I am nowhere
A slow escape
"Come sit with me in my sadness, please"
The best part of the day is the part where it ends
A shallow reckoning
Oh how different it should have been.
Show me the beginning and I’ll show you the end
"A behedded rose, all thorns"
I’d rather drown in all my words
Nourish the illusion
Emptying myself to feed the abyss
"In the end, we all become the things we swore we never would"
It’s over it’s over it’s over it’s over
"Not with a whimper, but with a snarl"
Beware of the dry season or it will swallow you whole
Drowning in the drought
A whole lot of nothing left
A silent poet is just suffocating behind the words they don’t know how to say
Inhale insomnia exhale sanity
To the alternate selves who actually got to keep the ones they loved - fuck you  (you better know how lucky you are)
The world is asleep
Absence makes my heart grow tired
Where do we go when we run out of poetry
Breadcrumb trails back to you
And every day I leave a piece of you behind
Please don’t disrupt my peace
By the time you checked  it was too late
"Love is a web, a net, an animal trap set right on humanity and we all fall in"
You disappeared into the fog years ago but I swear I can still see is the last few steps you took away from me
And you’ll start to care about the little things when you don’t have the privilege to care anymore
"One sad, strange little spaceman"
The day never comes
The ghost of you stayed behind to haunt me after you left
I want to know you but you are so far away and I’m in outer space
"The sunflowers in my ribcage are dying, please help"
Amazing what the heart can endure when it doesn’t want to
Everything I shouldn’t have gazed upon and I dove into its flesh
"I stood on my own two feet in disaster, I will never need your crutches"
"Remain whole and if they choke, let them"
Do not cut yourself into bite sized pieces
"Scaling the mountain not to see the other side, but to leap off of it"
"You said you hate the space you created between us, I’ll show you just how much space I can make   (there will be goddamn solar systems)"
The price you’ll pay.
A tangle of blood vessels and an excuse to bleed
Everything I should have ran from and I made a home inside its chest
Dig your hand inside my chest cavity to see if you can find anything worth salvaging
"My mind is a bomb shelter, you are the bombing. I was made for this"
My brain is the Center for Disease Control and nothing can come in or out unless I say
I am made of bulletproof glass
Time to channel my fight towards something that will fight back
I want them back
I’ve never loved something more
Letting go would be more humane but I’ve never been very kind to myself
I can’t handle it
Surviving the trauma instead of succumbing might have been my worst decision yet
Holding on for the right moment to let go
This one is for the tormented
"When I grow up, I want to let you go"
How do we know when it’s over
He ripped the flesh from my heart and I lived to tell the tale
The forgotten never forget
Keeping secrets for my sins
When dying feels like coming home
Come suffer in my silence
I envy them
We are finished.
Where do we go when we are running from ourselves
Everyone dies but only some live
Let me suffer in your silence
Someday we won’t have to tiptoe anymore
On the other side of this hell you’ll find God
Disappear all you want just make sure this time it’s for good
"You can have this victory, I prefer the defeat anyways"
"It’s morning and the birds outside are mocking me, I haven’t slept for days and they know it"
"Put me on pause, put me on a shelf, place me in a box, let me collect dust"
I am sorry but I think I’ve run out
Can’t save me from me
"There’s enough darkness to go around, darling"
Been running on empty for so long
Nothing beyond the nothingness
I am ready to emerge
Existing without one another
Believe me when I say I want to let you go
Papercuts on my heart instead of my fingers
A violin that cries violently
There’s too much water under the bridge  It’s starting to flood
I am tired of being tormented
I would have dismantled the universe for you if that’s what it took
Feeding a ghost
In a different life it is us and I know it
I dreamt of you last night. I won’t ever sleep soundly again
I’ve worked too hard for my peace I’ll be damned if you take it from me
Maybe I have so much love to give because I have nobody to give it to
That is the last time I’ll let you destroy me
There is nothing left for me here
Don’t want you to live in his shadow whoever you may be
I think I will go on missing you forever
If you don’t know how it feels to be haunted by someone still alive then count yourself lucky
Honing in on honesty and honestly there’s nothing left of me
What if the truth doesn’t set you free?
Left to my own devices devising what vices I’ll use for my demise
"Under the weather, beneath the world"
You were the mountain that casted a shadow nobody could amount to
"Vacate my mind, the rent is too high"
Achieve peace through nothingness
Sitting in the pile of dying embers
"Heard your voice in my head so I had to leave, now I’m just out of my mind"
"Hurry up, it’s time to die"
Think I saw the light and then  I snuffed it out
"My silent friend, why do you clench your jaw so tightly?"
Thank you for joining me during such a dark journey
"The more I find, the less I wish I had"
Escape myself
Our relationship was terminal and we thought we could cheat death
"200+ thank you, everyone."
Severely alone
Take my final bow and leave with grace
Nothing sets me on fire anymore
Watering a dead garden
Kill silence with silence
"Sorry for being distant, my chronic depression is contagious"
Saw my mind last night dead in a ditch and now I don’t wonder
Words like opening wounds
Break me better so I can look more creative
Do you think God stays in heaven because He is ashamed of what we’ve become?
Pre-dispositioned to self destruct
It’s going to kill you and you’re gonna have to live with it
Make peace with your demons before they wage war
The vulture in my head keeps flying me in circles
Your ghost wants nothing to do with mine
You will learn to hate every inch of space between us
Love is a mental disorder
A new way to end it all
In memory of the person I loved the most
I want to know what it meant to you even if it meant nothing at all
Sometimes the collision is catastrophic
How am I supposed to press delete on all these memories?
Your words rattle endlessly through my head
Returning to my funeral as though I never left
Take all the pieces of me you broke and give each one a name
I need a new distraction
Renew my subscription to old pain this year
I’ve been worse and that is how I know I will be better
Nothing left but to ponder
People are bad for themselves
I never died in my nightmares  because that's something I've only ever dreamed of doing
"In the end, we all become the things we swore we never would."
The sadness can’t take over if it was always in control
It would be nice to forget a few things
If seeing is believing does hearing not fucking matter
"And boy, you will never truly know how much I wrote about you when I was dying"
"Of bare feet on cracked sidewalks,  night dew on midnight grass, and dancing, dancing to remember and dancing to forget"
It will take everything I’ve got to survive this  but it is the only way I can survive
I want to know about the things that set you on fire
Maybe I was just in love with an illusion
"Summer denial, winter repercussions"
I have given too much  and I can’t go back
Sadness could not describe it enough
"Thank you all for my first 100+ followers! Here is a taste of some of my longer work/poetry. I was going to pull out a classic old piece I love however, this was written recently in regards to current personal events. Enjoy 🖤"
12/22/19
If it exists in my head it is not nonexistent
Revisiting old wounds is my favorite pastime
Leaving feels like a funeral
Break the delete key trying to erase this
I don’t like the way this makes me feel
Darling let’s get lost in my  pink labrynth of brain matter  as we wade through the rot  of what we were I’ll find  seven sunken exoskeletons in your closet ravishing your name
Love is bad for my health
Let’s die on this hill choking on the “what if” while we watch what would have been get slaughtered down the road
Should I submit a full length poem for you all after I reach my first 100 followers?
Use my bones as kindling to set my heart on fire
There are strangers walking around carrying pieces of me that I’ll never get back
"I think, therefore I die"
Remembering will be the death of me
My skin knew your name before I did
They told me happiness is an inside job so I’ll just stay out here where I belong
Look me in the eyes and tell me why you left me burning
Just because you left doesn’t mean you are gone
I remember death like it was yesterday
And we grow in different directions
Drowning in the space you left behind
Existence is exhausting
Loved you enough to let you love someone better for you
Siphon the ink from my pen  and spill it all over my heart
I wish I could write something that was worthy of how you make me feel but there is no human translation for what the soul knows
Meet me in the corner of my dream
Fuck you for making it so damn hard to love anyone like I loved you
I promise I’ll never be alive again
I didn’t lose my mind; I found it and that is much worse
"You’re damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t, but really you’re just fucked either way"
The truth doesn’t set you free  it binds you in chains that you have to learn to carry with you
A promise is just a lie in disguise
There is no hell and back there is only hell
Throwing myself for a loop hanging myself by your noose
History repeats itself and so will we
"Ruin the ending for me, please"
The nail in the coffin was stolen from the framework of the house that we were supposed to spend our days in
"I’m not creative, I’m just broken"
If we’re all just being used  then what’s the use?
"My poetry knows how bad it hurts, my friends just think I’m fine"
There’s emptiness  and there’s emptiness  and there’s emptiness  and there’s you
Pour me out all over your garden and watch the flowers die
I tried to live in the moment but she evicted me
"I am measured in what I’ve done, not what I can do"
There are bird nests in my brain
I am my own ending
The violin cry is all there is left
Death is easier than remembering your past
