Stab the knife into the face and then wrench the blade inside
Murder this piece of shit
Scraps of flesh and severed bone are on the floor, these I must hide
Pounding the teeth
Commute bones
They never will know
Chop up the corpse
Congealing my crime
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
Secret cremation
You fucked with me and now any trace of you is completely gone
Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know
Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
You cease to exist
Investigations fail to find a single useful clue
Their search is futile
Proof is destroyed in the searing heat, you melt away
No body case
There is no trace
Smoldering coals that once were your bones turn to ash
Your life is erased
There is no trace
You cease to exist but the search will go on, they cannot find
Their closure denied
Dead or alive
You're not the first and you won't be the last
To burn in my fires
Corpses will burn
Burn in my fires
Your corpse will burn

<i>[Solo: Rob Barrett]</i>

Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know
Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
