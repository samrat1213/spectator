The will to survive is fueled by simple primal instincts
The mind self implicating you consciousness to view the core structure of a so called reality

Inability to explore certain dimensional planes
A topological abyss
By observing you can all create
You all create

Loathsome creatures
You are worthless

The will to survive is fueled by simple primal instincts
The mind self implicating you consciousness to view the core structure of a so called reality

Inability to explore certain dimensional planes
A topological abyss
By observing you can all create
You all create

Complexity so metaphysically distant from humanity
Those to witness all hallucinate and proceed to collapse
A mental prolapse
There is too much preexisting damage
No more time to wait
