Bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts
Exploding cadavers bring forth
A bloodbath to torment all life

The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts

Detonate, polluted, pandemic
Unburied decedents that no longer die
Dispelled amok amongst sickness
The dead and living are one
When dormant bodies are bursting

The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts

Infernal, disaster, revulsion

Dormant bodies bursting

Bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts
Exploding cadavers bring forth
A bloodbath to torment all life

The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts

Detonate, polluted, pandemic
