Infancy Sheds the warning
an evolution of ignoring the imminent
undetermined future of wrongdoing
our fruits withering, their luster lost to the aether

Surround us with your ignorance
Smother us in environmental dissonance
Take what's yours and leave the rest to rot
be the bastard decency forgot
Never think
Never look back

No immediate gain nothing to lose, no one to blame
seven billion other idiots thinking the same
exponential is the loss, the future's not a game
The prophecy was true and every threat has been retained

O, the prophets speak of calamity through their corpses
predetermining the fates of future generations
Heed their warnings now, all humans bear the cost
The clergy of doom, the prophets of loss

...Ave Delphinus
...Selachimorpha
...Dinoflagellata
...Chelinoidea
...Cetacea

Certain doom - assured destruction of finite ecosystems

You may not know it now, but your children are fucked
and their children's futures are ruined, they'll take part in the ultimate do in of earth, resources, the grand "undoing"

Sustainability unobtainable

Heed this warning now, as you carry the cross
From the clergy of doom, the prophets of loss

We fucking die tonight and that's perfectly alright with me
