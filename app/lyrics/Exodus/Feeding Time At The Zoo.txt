Can you hear the roar? I sounds like a war
It's feeding time at the zoo
When their stomachs start growlin' the wolves start to howl
For a bite of what's on our menu
As they pick up the scent they grow violent
And they stampede to the feast
No matter where you're at, you're in their habitat
And they're bound to be disturbing your peace

Your last meal left you dissatisfied
Now the zookeepers have arrived
First come, first served, you better get in line
'Cause it's super time

Yeah, it's feeding time at the zoo
If you get too close you'll lose a finger or two
Soothing the savage beast in you
Is the last thing we wanna do
Yeah, it's feeding time at the zoo
All the stories you've heard, every one is true
The time has come for our rendezvous
It's feeding time for me and you

See them sweat as the tables are set
And the frenzy's about to begin
Eagerly they await the chance to swallow the bait
And their patience is wearing thin
When they no longer bare to delay this affair
We serve it up, thick and raw
We only cater our way, thrash fuckin' fillets
A banquet if you're hungry to brawlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
