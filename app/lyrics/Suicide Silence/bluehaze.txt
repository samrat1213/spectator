Empty eyes staring helpless at the earth

Steal our lives away
That is this hype
Face the wall, do not hide
You'd better cry 'fore it takes your life

Leave your damn meal spread
We think we know everything

So quick to tumble and shake (you're also afraid)
You seek lives made of lies behind the blue hazed eyes
Our nations are gaining back visible attention
You can say I give a fuck, you can say I give a fuck

Leave your damn meal spread
We think we know everything
Death to our blue hazed world
Death to a planet with inhumane sound
Death to this fucking blue hazed world
Death to the reason why it looks out of control
And the eyes stare at you placidly

Steal our lives away
That is this hype
Face the wall, do not hide
You'd better cry 'fore it takes your life

Leave your damn meal spread

Anger, bring ashes to your anger
Anger, put all your things away
Turning, turning, turn, turn!

Leave your damn meal spread
We think we know everything
