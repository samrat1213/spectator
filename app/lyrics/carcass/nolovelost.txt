Sensual awakening
Numbing feeling's dead
Conception's romanticised
Synthesized broken heart's to bled

Without emotion you heartstring's played
Strummed and severed to the tune of a tragic serenade

<i>[A tragic chorus:]</i>
Without emotion, your heartstrings break
Snapped and severed to the tune of a tragic, sad cliche

No love lost
When all is said and done
There's no love lost

The low cost of loving
Amorous travesty
Human frailties and weakness are easy prey
How your poor heart will bleed
