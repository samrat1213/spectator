As the atmos... atmosphere gradually continues to dissipate, an invisible pressure increases in irregular strength.
Soon this world shall crumble beneath its own foundation.
A neglected stronghold of protection has been penetrated.
Who shall we place the blame?
You're held responsible for your own end.
Implemented by ignorance, provoked by your arrogance.
Do not attempt to kneel or repent.
You've earned this punishment.
Slowly oxygen escapes from your diaphragm.
You had your chance and you did not listen.
Upon the population, gravity unleashes its overbearing weight.
Your fragile spines instantaneously crushed.
Crowds reduced to fractured frames, scattered flesh.
