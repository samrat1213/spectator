Devil: You're not supposed to enjoy this. Me: But they're such cute little demons!
The hot tin roof of every day.
How can you love if you can't hate?
Don't suck up to life.
A vortex is more interesting than a void.
Normalize smashing mirrors.
Borrow a corpse to resurrect the soul.
Loot a burning house.
Kill with a borrowed knife.
Decorate the tree with false blossoms.
Replace the beams with rotten timbers.
"A shepherd brings a child to look upon the wolf and its prey. When the animal is completely on display, the shepherd recites in the ancient language of faith: “No man shall be too great to become a lamb.” The child looks up at the wolf and he sees the lamb in its eyes."
Home is where the hate is.
Everything can and should become a crisis (i.e. life).
Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?  —Romans 7:24
"In the beginning, there was the worst."
"Only when we are thoroughly sick of societies are we able to see them in their true perspective and not as domineering, dutiful little umbrellas that shelter us from the hazards of the self."
"""If you don't take the antidote, you will become the rest of the world. You know what the world is, don't you?"""
Tendrils of cosmic debris paint a psychedelic sky.
Call me Failure.
It's a fault only if you don't embrace it.
The simple truth is a complex lie.
Worms in the velvet depth.
Bide your time by stopping your clock.
"Could my wish be fulfilled, I would want to be the balm for a sore, Dissolved By your saliva.  —Shikatsube No Magao"
How many skins to shed until my skeleton is free?
"It stands to reason, it falls to heart."
"The Misantrophe's Prayer Book: Psalms for pessimists, hymns for haters. Oh Azathoth, deliver us!"
Death might put an end to this rot.
The void aspires to chaos.
Never touch a running nightmare.
Don't be impressed.
Life: Stockholm Syndrome for one.
This world ain't big enough for the world and myself.
"“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.""   — C. S. Lewis"
"As hope stems from fear, so death stems from life."
It's the end every day.
The past is an ugly thing to stick to.
An abyss for two.
Why would anyone want to date carbon?
"It’s possible to manipulate the Law, not by breaking it or tampering with it, but by expressing it through another object."
"Everyone's running in circles. Some run quicker, some circles are wider. Nobody knows why."
“In all cases without exception we are absolutely indifferent to another’s pain until his sufferings make us uncomfortable.”  Mark Twain
What you fear will wreck you. What you hope for will kill you.
Not dying is not an option.
Strive to be a hole.
Slaves wail when slaves croak.
"""In the Kamigata area, they have a sort of tiered lunchbox they use for a single day when flower viewing. Upon returning, they throw them away, trampling them underfoot. The end is important in all things.""   -- Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Hagakure"
"Yes, you deserve to be loved. But do you actually want it?"
"“When nothing in society deserves respect, we should fashion for ourselves in solitude new silent loyalties.”  -- Nicolás Gómez Dávila"
Fear is a poor advisor.
Not proud to be a mammal.
"""Have no fear of perfection. You'll never reach it.""  -- Salvadore Dali"
"""Follow your dreams!""  -- Freddy Krueger"
"Some insights hit you like a brick, while others tickle you like a feather."
Sucking each other's blood - as delicious as it is - will weaken us both.
"“I’m now asking an idle question of my own: which is better – cheap happiness, or lofty suffering ? Well, which is better?”  -Fyodor Dostoevsky , from “Notes from Underground” (1864)."
A book which tells the truth about every reader.
Sometimes you have to let go. Sometimes you have to go.
He dies in me.
