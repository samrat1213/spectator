[Exodus and Baloff]

Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

[Chorus]
The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you
DIE!!!

[Chorus]
The darkness lives forever
Within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

Brain dead
