"The thing about love is that we probably are too stupid or weak to properly diagnose, acquire and maintain such a beautiful state of being. Its easy to claim love is fake and such trash when you look like shit and have the appearance of a fucking slob."
This world is slowly tipping into the void. Solace will be bestowed when the cosmic abyss swallows us whole and our insignificant blink of an existence is extinguished leaving nothing but ash behind.  Well deserved in my humble opinion.
The shadow of existential shame cast upon humanity is dark and long.  What a sad bunch of pathetic fucking losers we are.  We study our own history as if we had accomplished grandiose feats worthy of mention. Narcissistic sacs of sentient shit is what mankind embodies to me.
"Some people believe their intelligence surpasses the norm. They think they can fool us and that we won't notice when they replicate tweet styles or act shady around our significant others, like rats. These rats (grossly out of shape) claiming retributive acts are merely actors."

Perhaps the meaning of life is to serve as sustenance to something malevolant and far darker then we could ever imagine. Something unknown that watches from the shadows and ceaselessly feeds on our suffering.
"This world has failed us so we retreated into the forests, with wish to start again."
"The poison runs through our veins, we are the cursed.  Don't you see?"
"Devil take my eyes, I no longer wish to see.  Oblivion take me, I no longer wish to be."
The light has long since departed from their eyes.
Nothing left for us or anyone at all.
la lune est absolument magnifique ce soir mais elle n'est rien a comparé de ton visage qui s'illumine lorseque tu me sourit.
"Il n'ya rien ici pour les nôtres, sauf de la souffrance incéssante."
"In violence we trust, until this world crumbles into dust."
Oh how I crave release from this filth we call existence.
"Until the eternal embrace of the cold, loveless void do us part."
These words don't mean a thing.
"Her words, my world."
*runs you over*
The only father I honor on this day is Lucifer.
"Happy Father's day, whore."
"Eventually, our shadow fades to nothing."
It's called 'the gift of life' because it leads us unto death.
"Eventually, we finally die."

Your kind could never fathom the things that we do to feed the behemoth of absolute darkness.
"Forever united by the blackness of our wretched souls and left standing defiantly amidst the remnants, watching the crimson sky rain red.. We are timeless, We are eternal."
"I want to show you the madness that resides with my cracked psyche, but you keep looking away whenever I open the cage..."
"I cannot be saved, nor do I want to."
I reside within the darkness dwelling.
What a cold and lonely world we live in.
Words are insufficient. Actions however will accurately reveal your worthlessness in their eyes.
The visions of lies have poisoned our minds.
They enjoy watching us suffer.
We were all wrecked from the start.
This disgraceful life takes its toll.
Unrelenting agony and despair pave the way to hell.
"Time keeps forever slipping away, like sand falling though my fingers."
"Endlessly searching for her soothing presence, in everything and everyone."
Nothing can save us from the pain.
"Awake, I stare into darkness."
"Existence is a meaningless piece of shit that inevitably leads to suffering and decrepitude but atleast the sun is shining bright and today is going to be a beautiful fucking day. (Void of meaning, but beautiful nonetheless)"
"I am, therefore, worthless."
"Everything we do, seems predestined to be devoid of meaning."
"""The greater the thirst for life is for some souls, the more solitude swallows them""  ~Emil Cioran"
"""The flowers that are not picked by pale hands have bloomed for nothing.""  ~Emil Cioran"
Doomed to a future in which we yearn for death.
"Don't forget to Live, Love, Leave your worthless opinion under tweets thinking we give a shit what you could possibly think."
"Facedown, lifelessly solaced."
"Loneliness like cancer, gnaws without end.  Until there's nothing left."
Lets see them try to stop us now.
"I, the Dreamer, forever cursed to awaken from slumber unto this nightmare world.. Oblivion, deliver me."
I am everything you hate.
"Promise me, that you will remember."
"My eyes weep not, yet I am drowning in tears."
Hopelessness and nothingness.
Such things mean nothing to me.
I am the Superuser.
Malevolant machinations of the autodidacte technosentient.
"Slowly one by one, forever forgotten."
"The maelstrom rages on, devouring everything in it's path."
"I was waiting in line earlier and the couple in front of me bought 2x rounded dirt shovels and I thought ""This is goals."""

You probably think I'm unhappy in my life.

We are all Voidposters.
We are the faithless ones.
"Cancer, probably."
Humanity disgusts me.
Incessantly pondering a means to swiftly vacate this wretched existence.
Isn't she absolutely perfect? She's just the way the devil intended.
You can never control the darkness.
"Come along my friends, the void is calling our names."
"If alcohol bad, why good?"
"""Forever or nothing"" is also a love language."
"Every where shadows fall, you will find us."
I'll show you coldness.
"Algorithms ceaselessly compute, herding humanity through the unstoppable process of termination."
Why do we hopefully look to the futur when all that lies therein is desolation and death?
"No longer, do we find comfort in your false prophecies."
"Nature reclaims all, in time."
"Obliterate the shrine and instead raise the Obelisk, dedicated to those from beyond the trees."
"One day I'll take you to the timeless place, deep within the forest where our names are forever etched in the heart of the wood."
Darkness may fade but it will never leave.
"Sometimes I wish that you could be me, so you could see how beautiful you are."
"I thought it was over ""something""... 🤔 😄"
"I've been off drugs for about 2 months now. That's why I clearly see arrogant pieces of shit from a mile away. However, I'd love to further discuss this face to face.  hmu."
"I'd sit here for hours on end staring at the moon, just thinking about her."
"Suffering can never be eradicated, it can only be alleviated."
Manufactured terror keeps them in line.
Maybe the reason you can't find love is because you're unloveable.
I hope life humbles you.
"There is no rock bottom, only an infinite downwards spiral."
The feeling of sheer loneliness is enough to drive anyone beyond the boundaries of sanity.
"So much wasted time in our fleeting, ephemeral existences."
Nothing could ever turn this wolf against his pack.
We don't know what it is but we're all looking for something.
Spend a little time with your tweets.
Some people on this app seem to think after zero Respect shown ever they can step in and invalidate whatever post with their worthless fucking opinion. Don't be surprised you get put in your place when that happens. Arrogant assholes annoy me. Just be glad we're not face to face.
Normalize putting people in their fucking place.
"When I was face down in dirt, suffocating on absolute darkness without hope, a familiar hand reached in.  I've been holding on tightly ever since."
The updated definition of eternity is a single day without her.
"Spending time and telling you about me, while you lay in your grave."
I'm on a broken road.
Revel in the un-life that we lead.
"oh great, another day."
"Who wouldve thought calling arrogant assholes out on their bullshit replies would be ""unappreciated.""  Must be an ego thing."
"Hark, the calling of crows."
The darkness consumes us.
Mankind inherently bears the darkness of death.
I weep as I walk through the gloomy streets.
"Ruin upon ruin , humanity was doomed from the start."
👀
Black Tongue on loop.
Holy fuck this is deep.
Depends on what Im doing or not doing.
Some times I tweet stuff and then sometimes not.
"If you saw me irl you could never know its me. No apparent darkness, no scars and no tears.  Unless ofcourse you looked into my eyes."
"Time will take your pride, away."
"Make no mistake about us, we are the children of darkness."
"Because she exists, a heart now beats where a void used to be."
The hatred only builds and builds.
We've been holding back the tears since forever.
"Today, I grant you solace.  There's always tomorrow to suffer with insignificance."
Some wounds will never heal.
"In the dead of the night, I never felt more alive."
Why do we unwaiveringly endure?
Everything shifted that night.
Is this who you really are?
Cleanse them with arson.
Beyond this hellscape world lies another.
No remorse for the creatures of the earth.
"I might be drunk, again. You don't know."

How long can you contain your demons?
"We are the fractured, emerging from infinite murk destined to burn in martyrdom."
"Annihilate all, and wish to start again."
"Nihility awaits, for everything and everyone."
WE ALL LIVE FOR NOTHING
The beast rears it's ugly head.
"The signs were heavily obfuscated, evidently."
Take a look and recoil in disgust at this world.
I hate these dead streets. They will never let me leave.
Retreat to the forests.
I'm so tired of this place.
Like the filth that you are.

And things will never be the same.

I've been living two separate lives.
"Despair, forever."
I am the sentient paradox.
"If I ever liked or retweeted your posts that means I have Respect for you and that in many ways we are similar. Although we will never meet irl I want you to know that I love you my Twitter brothers and sisters.  Now go forth, and show me some malevolant fucking darkness."
What doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger.
Im just a contractor.  Satan is the employer.
The devil is real and he knows your darkest fears.
I will gladly burn.
To me my life is worthless. I want you to take a second and consider what your life is worth to me.

Wordless viligante with the flaming hatred of a thousand dead suns.
"Who I was, Who I am."
"My beloved eternal, until death."
I am the child of rage.
We're all obsidian souls dreaming of an obsidian sun.
We never asked to be part of this world.
Sad to say that no amount of A/C is sufficient to melt away the suffocating existential dread that follows us around like a black cloud.
Your life is such a mistake.
"No matter how the world changes, suffering has been and always will be inherent to humankind."
I know you see the hate in my soul.
Follow my voice. I swear I’ll get you out alive.
Who would forgive this world?
You better learn to stand your ground because you're not going anywhere.
We were all meant for so much more than this.
My favorite thing about people is when they finally leave.
Be the reason people show Respect and pay back money they borrow on time.
The sky opens up for the apocalypse.
You won't get in my head.
"Social media mirrors the weak nature of humanity each and everyday. Rare are those who seek to elevate their game, they think we dont see the same old tired ass tweets from years ago still being reposted. The same eroded quotes from Goodreads or one liners from memes or reworded."
When human intellect eventually spawns the vocabulary needed to fill in the gaps I'll have such anecdotes &amp; stories to tell you. Until then I only hope that you read between the lines and remember the base lessons.

Stop blaming everything and everyone for the state of decrepitude that defines your existence and the way you lead your life.
"Remember, death."
Red &amp; White forever. Even the company shirts.
We willingly walk among the damned.
We will all rot the same.
"They emerge from beneath, the messengers of darkness; bearing his words and sigils. This world is ours."
I've chosen not to follow your ways.
Ultimately your life amounts to nothing.
Have you no shame?
Soulmates and true love do exist. Most people are just too pathetic and weak to pursue and maintain such things. Effortless existence begets nothing of value. This is why I often say that most people are nothing but worthless pieces of shit. Because I know.
Can confirm.
"""Now we were living an absolutely wholesome life. We took a sniff of cocaine whenever the pace slackened up, and one of heroin when the cocaine showed any signs of taking the bit in its teeth.""  ~Aleister Crowley"
Are you normal or are you happy?
How many of us awaken and immediately turn to this website to bathe in the insatiable suffering and existential emptiness behind it.
Seeing the brother who put me on the map years ago and receiving that level of love and respect is in itself one of the most important life lessons.  Respect is everything.
Apparently evil does sleep; for days at a time when the miracle man runs out.
A place in the woods where time stands still.
Collabo with @Voisistere
I will stop at nothing.
They say that the most dangerous man is he who has nothing to lose.  Have you ever seen the fury of a man who is motivated into retaliation by love? The vindictive anger of this man is what I truly fear.   I am this man.
"Her distance is darkness. Its a good thing that Ive been using my heart amd gut since the beginning. What good are eyes, for affaires of the heart and soul?"
We often blame miscommunication. What if words were simply insufficient and the communication needed to fully express the things within had been lost in time.  What if we were doomed from the start and had been fighting against the void between us..  I wont ever stop fighting.
I could blacken entire notebooks with things I love about you. Things Ive been seeking all my life and that I could never find again.
I use Arch btw. (for now.. until I reinstall Gentoo)
Just a little while longer.
One love to @iSlangAIR who's probably reading this but can't reply because he's in Twitter segregation for a week.  Real recognize real.  So here we are.
"Say what you want about me, but say it to my face."
"In my circle women like her are worshipped.  Truth be told, they're usually the true wolves and we, the lesser evil. Its an honor to lay your life down for the matriachs in my world."
I expect violence everyday. When it doesn't conclude I've come to be rather pleased and content. No wonder that I flee to her at every possible opportunity.  Love is the remedy in this crazy world.
Accelerationism has more appeal to me now than classic pessimism.

Even extreme pessimism is watered down for our weak minds.
Make me forget.
I often wonder if she's looking with disappointment through shadows at the way I lead my life and the choices I make. I wonder if she knows the way everything was shattered when she stepped out.  Its probably best I never know.
Perhaps to love and be loved is the purpose of our lives.

I'll show you malevolant fucking darkness.
We're so scared of returning. Back to the void.
There is nothing after death.
The door to the other world is open.
You'll never be one of us.
Humanity doesn't deserve shit besides a shallow unmarked grave.
There is no sunshine where we go to thrive.
"In the maelstrom of eternal morte, I willingly drown."
Pathetic fucking replicas. You may fool the unknowing but I see  you rather clearly for the unintelligent pieces of shit you really are.
"In the mirrors you see their faces, don't you?"
You scream into the void whilst I vomit virulent hatred and malevolant blackness with intentions to infect.  We're not the same.
Solace begotten through prompt sentient obliteration.
Expectation is weakness. We should have the courage to stand on our own severed from other humans. Thus shielding us from their doings/undoings. Yet our pathetic nature leads us down the same path over &amp; over again. In the end we're only setting ourselves up for disappointment.
"'Fuck life, it's shit anyways.'"
"Oblivion, take me. Take me home to the realm of all darkness, sorrow and eternal death."
You probably give more than you get.
This is the time when we all pretend everything's fine.
Who needs teeth anyways.

Humanity is literal filth.
Don't ask. Don't tell.
It's usually about money or ego.  Either way it usually concludes in bloodshed.  But not today.
Helth.

Bask in the void of the composer.
The hivemind has morphed. Behold the gravemind now bestows our damnable fate.

"Exposed to the horror, I smile."
Broken and empty roads are paved with regrets.

Awakened from my dreams I see a world on fire.
Your best days are long gone.
"Ceaselessly it beckons, unseen from within malevolant shadows.  Death."
We might be broken but we won't fall down.
The shadows are closing in. We are stuck in the silence.
Why do I follow the moon?
What is the worth of my words? When my words don't mean shit.
"There is absolutely nothing I need from anyone , except her love."
My final moment upon this wretched earth will no doubt be marked by the realization that I never really lived.
"The more I think about life, the less I want to partake in either."
Disappointment will never disappoint.
Pessimists who lead by example should be worshipped.
You can't succeed if you don't try.
It's important to remember that earth is not our home.  We're merely passing through.
How can someone die when he never existed?
"At home, in the street."
No one will ever shed a tear.
We are burdened with existence.
Everything we do is in vain.
Nihilist Earth was one of my Facebook meme pages. I made 2 memes with the tag. This is one of them.

Ive said it time and time again but retards on here will have huge follower counts while the realest and most well written profiles receive way less. Its a fucking shame but also an indictator as far as global intelligence across social media.

"You spend your life struggling to survive, I spend my life wasting away. We're not the same."
Crazy is underrated as fuck.
The voids between us are flooded with cascading emotions spilling into an ocean of eternal hope.
"I never showed anyone my world entirely until I met her. I thought she would turn away and recoil from me but no. She stood by me even during moments when I was below ground. For people with my values this means so much, I dont even have the words.  I hope you find yours too."
Circle of cowards.
At the epicenter of the void lies an even greater and much more malevolant darkness.
I overthink therefor I overtweet.
Your quest for meaning and significance is quite entertaining for those that know and watch you struggle from afar. Similar to the circus clown your act distracts many from their own problems.
We are the lost souls condemned to walk this earth in search of things we could never comprehend.
This world is the cradle of all despair and misfortune.
humble asf too for a titan.
Holy shit what the fuck..
You're not replaceable.
I was saying earlier how my bro was a psychopath. So he just stopped Oceano and put on Céline Dion if you needed further proof. 😄

The devil knows all your secrets.
The society of consumerism in which we exist is to blame for the state of decrepitude in human relationships. True love does exist. You're just not patient and invested enough to find and nurture it. To bring it from seedling to full bloom until your departure from this realm.
For her I would willingly walk through the flames over and over again.
"All we see is darkness, but she's firmly holding my hand.  Fear is non-existant."
Stop saying 'humans are just numbers.' Numbers have an actual value.
Reality is one of the most depressing sources of pessimism right now.
Don't give up on your dreams. Keep sleeping.
The only certitude we have in this nightmarish existence is that one day this fruitless pursuit for meaning will come to an end. Everything will cease.  The torment and suffering will be brought to a complete and perpetual halt as nothingness washes over the world again.
We are just mindless slaves to the sinister algorithms.
"If you can't reason with them, you can always knock em out."
Everyone has left you here. Discarded and Deluded.
Any meaning you give your life is meaningless.

My worthless name in the local obituary will be the ultimate void post.

I'm not a 'sad piece of shit' it's called depressive realism. Look it up.
who called it life and not 'bottomless abyss of never-ending suffering.'
It will probably get worst.
I want you to know that I will do absolutely everything necessary to conclude. You may forget about me and 20 years will pass.. I wont forget you and the harm done. I wont ever forget. I will conclude what you started. I hope it was worth it.

"I hate so many things about myself &amp; my life. My list of regrets is insane. One thing I absolutely love about myself is the incredible patience and malevolance when acquiring revenge. Im so vindictive that I often wonder wtf is wrong with me. But I smile. Keep subtweeting, whore."
"Some people on this website/app would like to make us believe they have such interesting lives. If such is the case , why are they wasting away with the rest of us in cyber reality instead of enjoying their near perfect existence?"

"Romanticizing death is a mistake.  Death isn't theatrical , it's practical."
It's like I always tell em:
..and bring you to your knees.
We welcome the night.
Welcome to my undying nightmare. This is where the dark and hate await.
And I dream of her in death.
Many are torn apart but I will stand with my heart on my sleeve.
Broken minds soaked in lies.
😌
"“Fear not death for the sooner we die, the longer we shall be immortal.” ~Benjamin Franklin"
Like this tweet about my fleeting happiness or suffer eternal damnation godammit! 😄
"""A Trust Unclean / She Must Burn"" vocalist accepts my friend request and suddenly my day is going significantly better."
"When it's dark enough, you can see the stars. But when it's really dark the abyss above threatens to swallow me whole."
I'm growing sick of this wretched condition we call life.
"I, the shadow was born from absolute filth &amp; nothingness."
I gave my soul for this withering world.
This is the last time we will see the stars.
These words will last forever.
Relinquish existence.
"I've found my home, where no light can reach."
This darkness is far too familiar.
Light grows dimmer every day.
You lost everything you ever had.
All I see is darkness.
MURMUR
Break the mirror that reflects the insidious darkness behind your mannequin smile.
Not knowing is blessing.
You're wide awake But missing all the signs.
😌
In this world there must be a place for people like us.
They say that ignorance is bliss.
Hell is what you see right now.
Absolutely beautiful. Just fucking beautiful.
Nights like these...
"Dear Infosec Twitter , I piss in your general direction."
You make me fucking sick.
"You probably think that I don't see you. Oh, I see you, worthless piece of shit.  I see right through you."
We are not worthy. Our destiny is one of ceaseless suffering.
Purge the world of hope.
"I am he, who dwells in shadows."
"Everything in this life is temporary, only coldness lasts forever."
Hail to the night.
The devil dwells inside my head.
I wish I could show you the monster I really am.
I wish I could really say the things I want on this app.. I wish I could show you the blackest possible hate..
"You were born alone , and you'll die alone."
"We laugh , they scream."
"The black sheep , the unwanted filth."
You gave birth to your own doom.
"“Sleep, those little slices of death — how I loathe them.” ~Edgar Allan Poe"
"I never knew what unconditional love was until I met you. I'll always remember you in dreams standing beneath our sacred witchwood , on that starless rainy night."
Everything we love withers and dies before our very eyes.
Beset by your absence I've been living my life in reverse ever since.
Cast into oblivion we emerged bearing the mark of the void.
Cursed to waste time until we are dust.
She's so precious when she laughs.
The veil of oblivion cries my name.
Under the moonlight I yield.
My mirror no longer reflects.
Maybe home is a pine box beneath ground.
Bear witness to mankind's demise.
The voice inside my head is not my own.
We would thrive under a blackened sky.
Now the martyrs of time are safe in their tombs.
I only wish to vomit my virulent hatred upon this wretched world and it's worthless inhabitants.
The shadows reclaim this world.
Condemned as children.
"Eclipse the sun , forever."
There's nothing we can do to stop it.
All I know is that...
“Unbeing dead isn't being alive.” ~ E. E. Cummings
"There’s no moon nor stars , only blackness."
Hatred will flow forever.
"The devil speaks to me and reassures me, I am doing my job well."
"I am free, in this realm of unreality."
Twitter class reunion in the grave.
I don't think words can express your beauty.
We think we are in control. We can't even save ourselves.
You give me every reason to breathe.
Life is worth nothing.
Our headspaces filled with thoughts of infinite night.
We returned bearing the mark of the void. Our suffering now serves as it's sustenance.
In her eyes I see no fear.
You are the devil. Look.
"All hope is lost, the beast tempts from within."
"Raven of darkness, send us into a bottomless abyss."
Eternal fucking hatred for rats &amp; snakes.
Do you even know who you really are?
The old me has been visiting more often. I hope you know what that means.
Your life is a lie.
What ever happened to those threats?
Together we will topple any obstacles.
"Obsidian hearts , obsidian eyes."
All I want is the world to turn cold.
I am my own enemy.
In my head everything is dead.
“I am in chains. Don't touch my chains.”  ~Franz Kafka
I don't care for this empty world.
Shadows growing in my mind.
Isolation is your only saviour now.
You are the whisper in my ear.
It was always her.
Spread the filth.
I can hear their voices.
Humanity is a dying breed.
Bow to the devil until you've broken through the floor.
“Hell has no interest in our debauched moral currency.” ~Nick Land
"Oblivion take me, take me home."
Come save me from myself again.
I'll never know why all things beautiful must reach an end.
You dont fucking know.
Take a moment to remember the place.
The burden is my own.
Fade back amidst the shifting shadows.
From my cold dead hands.
Worship annihilation.
"Silence mortal, I am the devil."
All existence shall be void.
We now know we’ll never be saved.
"Misery will rise, and desolation eternally prevails."
Your sorrow is forevеr.
Abandon all fucking hope.
My blackened soul never belonged to this life.
Everything ends in darkness.
Reunited in madness.
We have been damned to suffer.
"Bound to a lifeless future , we are the chosen."
"We children of malevolance , bring forth a new dawn of darkness."
"Nothing will be left of me, when I'm dead and gone."
I have come to grace the night with the spoils of human life.
I know how I will leave this earth. I just dont know when.

"Watch me shatter and break. Watch me do it all over again, just to be with you."
And if I leave a note who really gives a fuck?
I tried to fill this void but you are my everything.
Why must I feel one with this sickness?
The blackest thoughts they always call.
My demons are calling.
I know we've never met and you'll probably never read this.
I'd sever the stars from the sky and place them in your hands.
When you read this I will not be the same.
And silent darkness.
One simple wish now dies.
"You will all witness, all that I've become."
The time has come to face the end.
"I'll wait here for you, just for you to realize what you have done."
We will remain as one.
I pray for the worst so that we all may go home.
Inhale dirt.
Watch me fade to nothingness.
The tree of life bears rotten fruit.
All my friends are dead.
"You are not like me, you are just like them."
Guided by the moon.
Leave me behind.
A dead flower at an unmarked grave.
By my grave I saw you weep.
Nothing is built to last.
I wish we could forget we're mistakes.
Pitbull smiles.
Our hearts will fill the abyss.
"There's no light, only darkness."
Drowning in woe.
Hadn't hung out with these two in 2 years. Crazy is an understatement.
No gods. No masters.
"She , Zenith. I am the obelisk."
You're in love with a speechless siren.
All your life is a fucking disgrace.
Close your eyes.
We are eternal.
The Maelstrom consumes us.
Darkness comes early down here.
It was Murmur who cursed this place.
"Evil lingers , where ever we set foot."
The ceaseless ebb &amp; flow of time gnawing at your being.
"Shattered, the fragments of my life lay scattered."
The world will end.  We've turned our backs.
I pray for emptiness.
😌
ily.
If you only knew.
"To sacrifice it all would bestow significance to my hollow existence.  For her , without hesitation."

"You can't rival with us , maggot."
"In the end , malevolant blackness shall extinguish all."
"You impress me demon, we will meet again."
This whore digs her own grave.
All the things you'll never be.
All howling voids and torment beneath.
No one will shed a tear.
Soon this world shall crumble beneath its own foundation.
There is no god to pray to for deliverance.
We have no sympathy.
The whispers of doom.
"In the dark, they have no name."
There will be no end to your suffering.
What you call fear is but a shadow of its truest form.
I am the host of Satan.
Abhorrent and soulless. When will you learn your fucking lesson?
I have become one with the damned.
The cycle never ends.
I hope you enjoy living in my shadow.
Vulture you speak Words of poison
How did we get so empty?
"When all is said and done , void prevails."
"Hollow sentience, desolate essence."
Nothing will stand between us.
We are all slaves to time.
Torn to pieces by the demons in me.
What is there to fear?
"You're so quick to run and hide, where is your spine?"
Lunacy has shown its face.
The earth will drown in sin.
I want to bask in the glory of the night.
"Sub-tweet me to my face , whore."

No one can be saved we're all doomed from birth.
If you could see me now.
Your life has become nothing.
You speak of death. You've seen nothing yet.
We're here to infuse hope in the hopeless.
No more turning back. No more giving in.
Bleed this heart with pen and ink.
"Dressed in all your best black clothes, mourn."
"Let’s get lost in this moment, I’ll do anything to make you mine."
"We will not be torn. Our hearts will stand, they will stand as one."
I want to burrow into the void he left inside you.
You've never met anyone like me.
You'll never find comfort in things as empty as your soul.
We're all born to rot.
It's easy to get lost in the woods at night.
She brings out the best in me. Im far from perfect but Ive been making changes. Some things will never change however.
The devil is my sheppard and I am born of sin.
The shrill whispers are back again.
As night falls my thoughts begin to darken.
The eye of Lucifer is upon us all.
Life becomes a dilemma when you are living a purposeless and goalless life.
All paths lead to oblivion.
We now stand before the flames.
Your life is a hollow excuse for existence.
You look to the heavens for answers but true guidance lies buried in the soil beneath your feet.
Shoutout to the voices in my head.
"All is cold, cold is all."
...and back again.
heavy is the nod that ventures unto the edge of oblivion and back again.
OPEN YOUR EYES.
We are the children of the void.
What doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger.
"""There's a man living inside my head And he talks to me in the dead of night Lying in my bed And he says in my own voice ""You wish you were dead."" And I’m starting to believe what he says""  ~Black Tongue"

The ones left alive will envy the dead.
Stand and face your consequences.
"in the heart of the void , trouble."
All hope for mankind is dead.
It was always her.  Now I am complete.
All life fades away.
YOU EXIST ONLY BECAUSE I ALLOW IT.
I'll build her shrine upon a mountain of skulls.
"In due time , this I promise."
We all die for nothing.
Chronos the deceiver.
For her I would tear down the fucking skies.
We are the slaves of technology.
Misery is the realm in which we dwell.
She controls the tides.
Lucifer devours the souls of the weak.
"Amidst a world of perpetual chaos and uncertainties I find tranquility and peace , with her."
I wear this smile like a fucking disguise
I am void of life.
I am the man I fear.
Sorrowful memories never fade.
Choices you make will haunt you to your grave.
An existence conceived from remnants of filth.
The filth is second nature.
The frozen reaper bestows solace upon mankind.
Observer of the end.  I smile in resignation.
"""That messy thing called 'mind' has created many destructive things. By far the most destructive of them all is God."" ~U.G. Krishnamurti"

I watch you turn cold and smile.
"I willingly offer my soul to thee, Lord Murmur."
As the night falls shadows overtake me.
Absolute blackness will purge the cancerous filth.
Void fire claims the shattered earth again.

Blue Flowers
I keep praying the devil to black out the sun and send us into an age of perpetual abyss.
Hatred grows and so does the temptation to release.
Disrupted vision creates a reflection of only darkness.
Mannequin smiles.

Everytime I hit the ground I keep on falling deeper.
Funeral home was my throne.
Don't let go of what's left of your humanity.

"""A regret understood by no one: the regret to be a pessimist. It’s not easy to be on the wrong foot with life.""  ~Emil Cioran"

I'm not interested in fabricated sympathy or spewing my laments just to have you shrug them off.  Walk with me to the lake and sit with me silently until dawn finally rears its ugly head then hold my hand and drown with me.  Forever together entwined in the cold embrace of death.
"There is no end to the pain &amp; misery. All is devoid of meaning and we learn nothing. In the end we are only reminded that this life, is hell. Shake your fist at the heavens and beg; yet no fucking god answers you.  Cries of desperation left unanswered Watch me fade into oblivion."
"this, is a death sentence."
paranoid people are people who know very little of what's going on.
No one will shed a tear at your death.

The familiar taste of rot within your foul mouth preceeds revulsion and disgust as absolute worthlessness is revealed by a sickening glimpse of the filth reflected by the mirror you so hopelessly avoid.  Plastic surgery can't camouflage sheer putrefaction of the soul; whore.

"He rolls the dice. The clitter-clatter on the tabletop wakes me from a dream. He picks up the dice and rolls them again. Another clitter-clatter across the wood. ""Go back to sleep,"" he tells me, picking up the dice for yet another roll. ""I'm just deciding the fate of worlds."""
