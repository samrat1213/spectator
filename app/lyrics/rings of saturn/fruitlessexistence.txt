Erasure of degenerates by the celestial

Divine otherworldly beings prepare for a detrimental invasion of another planet
An empire reborn, fabricated from the inhabitants neglecting it's utter importance
Hollow eyes pierce the soul with no remorse, an emptiness not of the mortal comprehension
The atmosphere, thick with the stench of decomposing bodies, entice my minion to kill

Bow to your true fucking creators
Bow to your true fucking creators

The odious, suffering the doom they have reaped
A fruitless existence
Ungrateful species of filth and corruption, we cast you into the void

Heavenly wrath upon the nefarious
Created to satisfy our growing hunger
They fade away, their extinction predestined

In place are celestial avengers
Who now gaze upon us humans

Erasure of degenerates by the celestial

Divine otherworldly beings prepare for a detrimental invasion of another planet
An empire reborn, fabricated from the inhabitants neglecting it's utter importance
Hollow eyes pierce the soul with no remorse, an emptiness not of the mortal comprehension
