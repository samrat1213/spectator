Serpent upon the cross,
faith swept into blackness,
so shall there be restitution,
in the slaughter of the masses...

Rise oh great deceiver,
return to the gardens alas,
as it was so it shall be again,
enthroned in mirrored halls,
the day of the false prophet has come to pass...

There'll be a cleansing of the saints,
towards the left hand path desperate they crawl,
all are guilty of their own demise,
the burden of lies will swallow them all,

bring me the eyes of the father,
spill their wrists recite their vows,
lay the lamb of christ upon his altar,
slice vengeance in the neck of the sow,

demons of doctrine,
creatures of the cold,
forged preachers of hatred,
outdated gospel to the world of old...

Serpent upon the cross,
faith swept into blackness,
so shall there be restitution,
in the slaughter of the masses,

scholars shield their fate,
a void within the walls of sanctuaries,
fraudulent labor ripened with temptation and indulgence,
for the true author of the soul to savor,

as they gather in masses upon the hills beyond the sands,
rejoice the morning star rises in the east,
the word of god departs from man,
and as the centuries seam together,
shall we open our hearts to truth,
man is one with the fire in the center of the earth,
Lucifer bring us rebirth...

Lucifer...
Light bearer...
Bring us rebirth..

Rejoice
The day of satan and man is upon us!
