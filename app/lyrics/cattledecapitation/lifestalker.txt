What is this death wish we impose on ourselves?
Apparently endless display of ill intentions
Look! See how far we've come?
Global insemination of our practice - fucking the masses

We're coming to kill you
Your name is engraved on the knife
Reaping, controlling, absorbing your life

Look! How we've locked ourselves in a self-made hell from
Which there is no redemption

Through the rise of technology, we lost our "humanity"
Trash heap lobotomy, self-imposed sodomy
We are undertakers, rapists and future failures
Inter the world with our filth, from day one -
Should have been killed

We rise to the slaughter...
...of the essence of our being

We're ripe for the slaughter...
...but live to ruin another day.

A species that boasts of overdose
That takes pride in deriding all other forms of life
Even our own

The advent of technology - beginning the disease
There is no survival when we are liable for everything that is
Wrong in this world
The Lifestalker

Reaping, controlling, absorbing the
Essence through only our presence
We must be stopped

This is suicide
This is how we die
This is the end of life
The ouroboros

This hill of compost grows by our own gross
Mistakes and the demands that they've made

Execute the lifestalkers
Damn us.
Kill Us.
Suck us dead.
