Explosions and screams resonate in the distance
Notice the thousands lifeless at your feet
Overwhelmed with fear
Struggling for breath
And a recollection of why you're still here
Everyone has left
Everyone has left you here
You were condemned to die here
Endure the event
Condemned, discarded, left to decay
Intake your final breaths
And recollect of why you were abandoned here
Above a sky so bleak the sun intensely burns
Scorching through the lands
Until no sign of life is visible
The environment has transformed into an abysm
The terrain begins to quake as billows of smog erupt
It all unfolds
Earth is engulfed and exists no longer
All life disposed
