You should never take too literally what you read,
Misinformation, distortion, make belief,
Fabrications, half truths implied,
Misquotations, out of context and lies,

"I promise to tell the truth,
The whole truth and nothing but..."

Lies - you believe them all,
Lies - you swallow them whole,
Lies, lies, half truths misinformation and...
Lies - you believe them all,
Lies - you swallow them whole,
Lies, lies, half truths misinformation and...
...lies,

Fact and fantasy united as one,
Real power stems from the barrel of a pen,
Living memory can easily be erased,
The pen is mightier than the sword,
Yet with no blade,

"I promise to tell the truth,
The whole truth and nothing but..."

Lies - you believe them all,
Lies - you swallow them whole,
Lies, lies, half truths misinformation and...
Lies - you believe them all,
Lies - you swallow them whole,
Lies, lies, half truths misinformation and...
