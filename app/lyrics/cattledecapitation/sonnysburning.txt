Hands up who wants to die!

Have you heard how Sonny's burning
Like some bright erotic star?
And he lights up the proceedings
And raises the temperature
Flame on! flame on!

Someday I'll cut him down yeah uh
Now I've seen to Sonny's burning
Yeah someday I think I'll cut him down
But it can get so co-cold in here
And he gives off such an evil heat
Flame on! flame on!
Hai-hai hail my incubatic incubator

Now pay witness to Sonny's burning
Warming the damp and rotten seed
Warming the damp and rotten seed
That blooms into the DEMON FLOWER
Now both fire and flowers consume me
Flame on! flame on!

Evil heat is running through me (through me)
Flame on! now flame on!
Evil heat is running through me uh! uh!
Sonny's burning pits into me
Flame on! yeah flame on!
Sonny's burning holes into me
Don't interrupt! don't interrupt!
Flame on! flame on!
Through me yeah through me
Don't interrupt! flame on!
Flame on! flame on!
