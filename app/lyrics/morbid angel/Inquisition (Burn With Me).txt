Inquisition (Burn With Me) LyricsCome burning
Are you going to burn with me?
Won't you come burning?
The world is watching
All the king's men riding hard
All their horses foaming
And if they were to catch us we'd be set ablaze
Burn!
Won't you come burning
All the dissident ones
Come and walk the line and you will burn with me
Witches yes, slaves never
And still I speak
A heretic amongst you
Don't you let me live too long
Burn!
Could you imagine the pain
Why would my country men let me down
They're bearing witness just to save their skin
That this might keep them from burning
They'd sell their mothers just to save their skin
That this might keep them alive
The marks I'm bearing are oh so deep
My will ingrained at birth
To flood true darkness with light and reverse
You'll see my covenant to keep
Your judgment in the hands of the most inept
Condemn those similar to burn with me
But the night is still young
I'm also feeling very bold
I think I'll do some burning of my ownEmbed
