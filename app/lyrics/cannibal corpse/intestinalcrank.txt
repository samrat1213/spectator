Butchers drag me to the rack
Bind my hands to the bar
Legs are fastened to the table
Hooded man unsheathes his knife

Incisions will be made
Blood drips from the blade
Visceral display

Hook attached inside
Cavity gaping wide
Soon I will die

Intestinal crank

Merciless, they turn the crank
Interrogation has begun
Awake I'm being disemboweled
Rotation pulling out the guts

Excruciating pain
Body starts to strain
Struggle in vain

Tortured by this tool
Intestines on the spool
Barbarous cruelty

Intestinal crank
Intestinal crank

Winding
Innards

And the crank will turn
And the crank will turn

Turning
Pulling

Unremitting pain
Turn the crank again

Twisting
Coiling

Drawing out the guts
Drawing out the guts

The rack
Stretching

Snapping cartilage
Dislocate joints

Writhing
Broken

I will die in pain
I will die in pain

Torment 
Endless

Disemboweled alive
Disemboweled alive
