Life spent with lips on glass
Another hit, just one more blast
How long can you make it last?
Hit the pipe and vaporise
Feel the rush, so energised
Your lungs begin to crystallise
Try to stem the tide
From another five-day ride
Don't you know you're dead inside?
The world spins out of control
All amped up, nowhere to go
A glass house is all you know

Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine

Spun and sleep deprived
The calendar burns before your eyes
Another hit, for now revived
So many sleepless nights
Only wet your appetite
Strike a match, the torch ignites
See the shards start cracking back
Watch them turn your world to black
While waiting for the heart attack
All your dreams are dead and gone
I'll tell you now, it won't be long
Before death ends this marathon
Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
Deathamphetamine

Withered and sucked up
You're wasting away
Eyes sunken deep in your skull
You care not about yourself
Nor any other
Only if the pipe is full
Lick your lips
As you hover around the glass
Anxiously awaiting your turn
Depressed and paranoid
It's all gone to Hell
Inhale as your world burns

Lost everything you own
Now waiting by the telephone
For the dope man to come home
All your friends and family
Are sickened by your need for speed
Only driven to exceed
So many years, so little time
For you to halt your life's decline
You've got to read the signs
Everything has come unwound
You've got to turn this shit around
Before you're six feet underground
Poison cloud hangs in the air
Breathe it deep, your only care
It's a nightmare, not a dream
