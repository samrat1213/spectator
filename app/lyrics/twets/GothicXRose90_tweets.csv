"I’m praying to god I get a goodnight sleep soon so I can finish my assignment in the next 3 days. I feel like I’ve been falling behind due to spring weather changes, fatigue + laziness."
"If I was to bump into my peers who followed the life script + were religious etc, they’d be shocked but not surprised I turned out this way. Part of me doesn’t want to move back to a big city again to re-encounter them, but part of me is also excited about a new life."
"When I look back at who I was years ago, I never envisioned I would become an asexual, irreligious agnostic antinatalist. I always thought I wanted to win the race of finishing the life script before anybody else. I was so wrong."
"I want to be forgotten when I die, I embrace futility as the highest of Gods, I don’t need to leave a part of myself behind to suffer for futile remembrance that means absolutely nothing."
Antinatalists are:  - Compassionate - Kind - Wise - Sensitive - Empathic - Farsighted - Selfless - Detached from worldly things - Conscious - Higher IQ/EQ - Considerate - Conscientious
That’s how we will be remembered until we are eventually forgotten.
Breeders force their children into a land full of mines.
Breeders are:  - Selfish - Narcissists - Pimps - Greedy - Arrogant/Pompous - Gamblers - Exhibitionists - Attention whores - Entitled - Childish - Impulsive - Terrorists - Naive
"Every cell in your body carries trauma from your conception right until your last breath, courtesy of ma + papz."
"Breeders are like experimental vaccines, they know anything can go wrong with trials yet they put their offspring right in front of the fire."
Sex is the body’s ultimate form of betrayal. No different than a Venus flytrap coated with honey but the end result is breeding more maggots.
Parents are pimps who sell their offspring into slavery. Society is a brothel + nature is a whore. The earth is one massive whorehouse.
Make procreation (especially in this day + age) a crime.
Normalise being childfree.
"Childfree people have better opportunities to excel in their career, more time for their hobbies, more time to relax, they have relatively stress free lifestyles that enable them to contribute better to society + to focus on their mental health + wellbeing."
Being childfree means you have greater opportunities for a better purpose in life than to just procreate.
"Society is built by breeders for breeders, I’ve said this many times before, that’s why I don’t vote, everything is the best interests of breeders, no one advocates for the childfree that’s one way I’m alienated by society."
I hv absolutely nothing in common w my millennial peer group (that I grew up with) bc almost all of them are breeders + there’s barely any childfree people. Antinatalists + childfree (by choice) people make my life less lonely bc I can’t relate to most parents. It’s alien to me.
Life is a terminally ill sexually transmitted disease.
“You’re living and dying simultaneously at the same time” — @cyclownez
"It is pointless, meaningless + we are simply meat suits experience decay + decline as each day goes by."
Life is decay courtesy of meat suit terrorism + that which has been given to us by our parents.   Thanks mum + dad for forcing me into this hellhole to work 9-5 + pay bills for the rest of my life.
Being forced into this prison planet is very undignified. The least people should be given is an opportunity to have a dignified death on their own terms + conditions.   #LegaliseEuthanasia
We have a global mental health crisis right now where so many people are trying to take their own lives + they are resorting to psychotropic drugs to maintain sanity in an insane world. The solution is sometimes to let them die safely + honourably bc nothing else can help them.
Voluntary euthanasia is the solution to:   - Overpopulation - Greed/corruption - Unemployment/Poverty - Diseases (all kinds including mental health) - Existential boredom
"Voluntary euthanasia is the ONLY ethical, practical + sane solution to the overpopulation crisis.   Antinatalism is a preventative measure that ensures people don’t have to resort to euthanasia bc they don’t exist to suffer."
"We live in dystopian times where “anything goes”. Traditionalism is NOT a solution to the dystopia.   Antinatalism is bc the ones who suffer the most in a dystopia are children. Children now more than ever are brainwashed with bullshit, surrounded by chemicals + societal toxicity"
Last night I had a strange dream that I was living in Baghdad with my family. It felt so weird + so surreal. I’ve never even been to Baghdad or come close.
"So many people hate living in dystopian times where degeneracy is at its peak, yet they turn to traditionalism to counteract the dystopia. They should be turning to antinatalism bc in a dystopia, the future is terrible for all children."
Procreation is the most unethical thing in the whole world that almost everybody does + thinks is perfectly okay.
Are you a black sheep compared to those of your generation who followed the life script + went on to marry + have kids?
95% of my people in my peer group I know have had kids. I’m proud to be childfree + glad I found antinatalism before I ended up following their path. Antinatalism saved me from imposing suffering on my progeny + saved me tonnes of money + unnecessary stress in my life.
"I managed to work on my assignment a bit, got the first part almost done. My drawings are hideous, but hopefully I score more marks in the next section. Having that green tea really helped energise me."
"Antinatalism is a beautiful philosophy - sure it can be dark, pessimistic + somewhat misanthropic bt intent behind it is noble, altruistic + compassionate. Those who c it negatively don't understand it, or their skin isn't thick enough to accept the harsh reality of our existence"
"anti-human, misanthropic, eugenicist message. Although it seemed very materialistic + superficial on the surface, they failed to talk about philosophical antinatalism + examine the deep ethical nature behind the philosophy.  TLDR; Anti-crazy fruit cult vegan figures turned me AN."
They promoted vasectomies as an effective tool to have a happy + fulfilled sex life without worrying about pregnancy. They also promoted having disposable income for travel + luxury items as well. Despite all of this so many people gave them crap for their AN message calling it a
"much agree with their AN message. Aside from their drama + weird cult diets, I found their AN message to be very positive. They promoted the childfree lifestyle like a permanent vacation lifestyle where you can wake up + do whatever the fuck you want which is pretty cool."
"Altho her video was very anti-AN, she turned me into an AN almost instantly + I finally had a label for myself that fit me very well. I started engaging with other ANs on Reddit then slowly I moved to Twitter. While I don't agree with some of the crazy vegan fruit cults, I very"
I had been vegetarian/vegan for about 3 years + I was heavily involved in following crazy vegan youtubers during 2015-2016 + many of them were promoting vasectomies + a childfree lifestyle. I didn't think much of it at the time until I came across Unnatural Vegan's video about AN
My next tweet will be a long thread story time about how I found antinatalist (you can thank vegans for that).
I'm thinking about making an antinatalist flyer to hang around my college campus when I go back to school next year. I like the ones done by STOP HAVING KIDS. Its time to promote AN to everyday people.
"I love fellow antinatalists so much, I wrote a free book for them.   Antinatalists are awesome af + they make me feel less lonely + happier in this world. God bless all antinatalists."
I love all antinatalists ❤️❤️❤️.
"Breeders call antinatalism an eco-fascist, eco-colonialist, classist, ableist + eco-eugenics movement yet they are the fascists, colonisers, classist + ableist people. Fuck breeders."
Psychics are the ultimate scammers.
Much better trade than having a kid!
I think I ruined my zippo lighter by putting lighter fluid in it.
"The suffering in life outweighs the good, life is a slaughterhouse + it is an inefficient corrupt system. It’s better not to be born + no amount of love, friendship, music etc can make life tolerable. Sorry you don’t see it that way.   #SorryNotSorry"
"My brother gave her Turkish delights, a card + some money for her birthday it goes to show how much my brother means to her. I wasn’t expecting to be disappointed like this. And she complains I gave my brother a flash gift for his birthday. My brother gave me $900 once."
"My brother is very autistic + his support worker did not give him a card for his birthday, so my dad reached out to her + asked her to get a card. She basically stuck buttons to a paper + gave it to him. She has no class to even spend $1 on a card.  #misanthropy"
Wow.
I agree with you. But suffering mostly prevails over lack there of.
"That’s possible for sure, but according to a study referenced by Sarah Perry in her book “Every Cradle is a Grave” we tend to remember more traumatic incidents in our lives than happy moments."
"Breeders overlook the concept of trauma that we suffer in our lives. Hence, bc trauma is so overlooked they decide it’s perfectly okay to procreate. Trauma is an underrated problem + children under the age of 7 are especially vulnerable to it."
One of my main concerns with procreation is trauma. I carry a lot of trauma in my life that manifested in the forms of seizures + migraines. Anxiety also runs in my family. I don’t know how to heal trauma + I don’t want to pass that down to my progeny.
Same here. I was inspired to make this poll after someone said to me that we opt to continue life just bc we don’t commit suicide. Even if someone paid me millions of dollars I still wouldn’t have kids.
"If voluntary euthanasia was legal + easily accessible, would you procreate?"
"I don’t care how much wannabe breeders suffer by being infertile, the children suffer far more + only their suffering is valid, I don’t care about the suffering of the infertile.   #SorryNotSorry"
Not legalising euthanasia is the equivalent of holding someone ransom for money.
Society + parents love bomb infants until they are old enough to see life for what it really is. This creates a trauma bond + Stockholm syndrome that we are left with for life.
"“We have to transcend our worldly desires” said every monk, ascetic + sage. Worldly desires include sex + reproduction. Nuns + monks devoted their lives to meditation, service to others + spiritual enlightenment bc that was the only way to get out of this life trap we are in."
"I don’t believe in good forces in this world. Everything about life is inherently evil, even if good scratches the surface. Even the gnostics said so. Nothing about life is good."
We need more infertile men + women. Is there a way to speed up female infertility? I heard cats can help with that.
The female reproductive organs look like the head of Baphomet + sperm resemble mutant worms. We are a disease + an incarnation of the devil.
"Sexual, religious + imperialistic conquests are all FUTILE."
Loving life + bootlicking on this planet (for existence) is a sign of being brain dead + low iq. That’s how society + our parents want us to be.
"Coming into existence is the most painful thing a human can experience, ironically despite giving birth being painful we are still overpopulated."
"Death is like a lottery, everyone will win someday, but there will be millions of lucky people who get to go before you."
The foundation of all evil:   1.) Existence 2.) Sex 3.) Society 4.) Greed 5.) Money 6.) Power/control/megalomaniacs
Funerals are pity parties for envious people to remember those who have moved onto freedom in this prison planet.
"I finally printed out my course work. It’s close to 600 pages. My assignments look pretty tough, but I’ve been nailing it so far with a B average so I think I can handle it. Tomorrow I will dedicate more time to my finals + try to wrap it up before the end of the month."
"I received my online course material for the next two courses I'll be taking during summer school. Its a PITA having to copy &amp; paste everything into a document to print them out + bind them. After this, I will be finished in my first year of construction study."
Are emotional affairs considered cheating? Would you ever have an emotional affair if your needs with your partner weren’t being met?
I’ll do most of these things except tax evasion I don’t want to go to prison.
"This is why I don’t want to get married, I’d rather fight with myself about these things."
The ugly truth about sex.
This is the best piece I have ever read about becoming free from sexual desire. I recommend it to all neo-antinatalists who plan to remain celibate for life. It’s worth a read
Burn + destroy our reproductive capabilities + watch the earth become peaceful as we go extinct.
Sex is terrorism especially when it involves forcing unborn children into this world. When you boycott sex you are saying no to this mayhem.
"Procreation is terrorism. To fuck an unborn into this world is to repeatedly torture, terrorise, enslave + destroy them simultaneously. Ad infinitum."
"Humans are rats in sewers destroying everything they touch. Nothing but trouble from flesh, bones, blood, piss + sacks of shit. To see humanity as beautiful is to be delusional wearing rose coloured glasses. That’s why we must go extinct."
Antinatalism is the only route to world peace.
Suffering begins in the womb + ends when we enter the grave.
"If needless suffering is the prime purpose of life, then I say abolish this insanity."
My best friend is flying back from Australia in 2 days. I’m very excited. I have been having gifts ready for her return. My other best friend is coming back at the end of the year. It will be like old times again 🥰🥰🥰.
Instagram is spamming my feed with pictures of the queen + royal family. I couldn’t care less for the royals or monarchy. I hope the UK becomes a republic + all countries in the commonwealth leave. The commonwealth is modern day theft.
The god I worship is futility bc futility conquers all.
Clean bedsheets + duvet covers with clean clothes is extremely underrated. One of the small joys in life I enjoy is fresh linen out of the dryer + it’s warmth.
"I would rather you attend my funeral or not attend. The point is, I’d rather be dead than still alive. Suicide is the answer."
Existence is eternal + infinite slavery in various forms.
I’m not Iraqi either. USA forced me into becoming a world citizen.
"I’m Arabised + not proud. The people who Arabised me spread the religion of peace through religious conquests + slavery. That’s the story of the whole human history. I’m not proud to be human, I’m ashamed. I wish I was never born + I hope my life ends soon."
21 in 2011 during the Arab spring. I have been using the internet since I was 9.
"Finally changed my linen + took a shower + washed my hair. One load of laundry is almost done, next is my second load + then off to the laundromat I go. I’ll probably vacuum + tidy up tomorrow + then force myself to complete my assignments."
"We need a campaign to glamourise adoption + fostering. Hardly anyone wants to do either of those things these days bc of reproductive technologies, it’s sad + devastating. Celebrities used to adopt, now the trend is to have geriatric pregnancies."
"This is so true, yet more people are fucking + breeding more people into this prison planet."
"I consider most LGBT people allies with antinatalists bc many are childfree. I adore those who adopt, but like all breeders I hold contempt for those who go on to pass on their genes."
"My mother brought an Apple laptop + she wants me to teach her how to use it. I’m kind of dreading this bc my room is messy, I haven’t worked on my assignments much + I need to change my linen. I’m so unhappy with myself."
Breeders are dictators.
Can someone please explain to me how antinatalists are privileged? Is it bc they have some special gene that removes them from the gene pool? How are we special? I don’t get it.
"I’m proud to be an antinatalist, nihilist + misanthrope bc I am preventing suffering for future generations, I’m looking out for my mental health + wellbeing by avoiding toxic people + I’m honest enough to see life for what it really is. That doesn’t make me toxic."
"Why do people think antinatalists are privileged with good lives? I’ve heard that we, along with misanthropes + nihilists are privileged. I know I am privileged + blessed in many ways, but I’m trying to do something with my life, I’m not sitting on my ass doing nothing."
Watching Inmendham’s old videos + waiting on it to be Friday so I can play my video game.
"At the vets, it might be fleas. I hope my furry son will be okay."
#ThrowbackThursday Me on holiday in Taupo 7 years ago.
"I have to take my cat to the vet bc his fur is falling off near his tail area. It’s gonna be hard to get him into the cage + then he will be crying like crazy on the way to the vets. It breaks my heart when he cries, but hopefully he will be all good."
And people like Elon Musk say overpopulation doesn’t exist. Pfft.
Slavery starts in the womb where conception begins.
And all of them are anti-suicide + anti-euthanasia. Many of them are even anti-abortion rights.
The art of society:  Schools = Indoctrination camps  Psychologists/Psychiatrists = Brainwashing drug pushers  Religious Leaders = Brainwashing  Tax Department = Profiteers of ppl farming  Parents = Evil behind this hellhole  They all work for the cult of life industrial complex.
"Everyone is a secret agent for this prison camp we live in, many people don’t even know it. Psychiatrists + psychologists r the manipulators at the top. Then come schools/social institutions for brainwashing. Of course religious leaders brainwash as well."
"Procreation is a mental illness bc it seeks to control, regulate, kidnap, rape, torture, enslave, steal + murder innocent children. The fact you intrude on somebody else’s peace for your own sick gratification makes you a creeper + at best a selfish control freak."
Intruding on the unborn is opening up a can of worms that can never be closed again.
"Everyone rests in peace undisturbed in the realm of non-existence, until breeders decide it’s a good idea to intrude on them."
"Procreation is intrusive. It’s intruding on the unborn who are resting in peace. I certainly do not like intruding on others, hence, my philosophy in life is do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
"Therapy is a scam. Most therapists don’t have real solutions to your problems. They are paid to listen + be your emotional tampons in exchange for your money. I’m not gonna lie tho, my last therapist was pretty good, but she never called me again for months."
I hold so much contempt for imposition of existence on people who had no consent in the matter. Existence = is pain. To force someone to exist is to force someone to be in constant pain against their will.
"I have the strongest disdain for imperialism + colonialism + oppressing other people. It’s one thing I hate about existence. Futility rules over everything in life, but ruling classes + narcissists + psychopaths feel compelled to spread suffering + pain to others."
"Indians haven’t forgotten what the British did to their country. Same with Africans + Asians, not to mention  Middle East + the Balfour Declaration. Even Native Americans suffered under the crown + millions of other indigenous people. Imperialism is the worst parts of this life."
"After the death of the Queen, everyone is beginning to air out their grievances against the crown. I don’t think King Charles III is going to be a good king. I hope the monarchy is abolished someday + the wealth of the British people + the world will return to its rightful owners"
Parents have kids to fix their unhealed childhood traumas + they traumatise their offspring.
"Schools are prison indoctrination centres for children. Thank god I never had children, I’d never want to send them to school."
Snake oil salesmen.
"Dear Breeders,   No one cares about your mediocre genes. No one cares you have functioning genitals. The world doesn’t need your offspring to be fruitful + multiply. Your children don’t want their lives to be gambled with. Embrace being childfree + move on."
"In some countries infertility is seen as a huge taboo, if you’re infertile you’re ostracised by society. Hence why people are pressured into breeding. It’s not a competition folks, nor do you need to prove your fertility. Don’t have kids at someone else’s (the child’s) expense."
"Just bc we have genitals + the ability to procreate, it doesn’t mean we should. No matter how much you try to look at it, its gambling with a non-consenting person’s life."
"Today is our first day of having mask mandates lifted (ex @ GPs + hospitals) + I feel naked without my mask, it’s almost like I’ve forgotten what life was like before Covid. It will take some getting used to, but at least I won’t have to wear a mask when I go back to school."
"If I was the queen, I would low key want a simple funeral, no special ceremonial events or rituals for my death, just a cremation + everyone to have a shot of whiskey in my remembrance."
"I don’t understand why anyone would want an elixir of life, unless they are our supreme rulers who oppress us!"
Protect the unborn by not breeding future generations to suffer into existence.
Parents rape their children into existence through force + coercion resulting in Stockholm syndrome.
"Suffering is the embodiment of all evil in this world, courtesy of sentient gamblers called “parents”."
Gambling with sentience is a very dangerous game. It’s equivalent to nothing imaginable beyond this world.
Seriously? The bloody witch’s death is taking over everything
Children are always the casualty in the natalist game of procreation.
"Is it okay to be mad at your pets? My cat came into my brother’s room when he didn’t want him there, then he scratched me when I tried to take him out. Aside from giving him his dinner, I haven’t been talking to him. I’m upset that he disobeyed me."
Stunning!!
"I understand gamers, they are looking for escapism from this meaninglessness that life offers. Going in a virtual reality provides that comfort and solace away from this world."
All we are looking for in life is escapism since meaning does not exist.
Everyone has gaming nostalgia. My brother + I grew up with Nintendo - that’s why I can’t game on other consoles bc I’m not used to their games. So I’m sticking with what I’m familiar with.
"Playing Pokémon on my brother’s Nintendo Switch that I got him for his birthday has bought back so many memories, I’m thinking if I don’t find a job in my city after I graduate, I’ll get myself a console too so I can spend my lonely days gaming when I’m not reading or working."
"I’ve been gaming for 8 hours straight playing Pokémon Diamond. Now I know how it feels to be a gaming junkie. It’s nostalgia from my childhood. I caught a legendary Pokémon, I feel proud of myself. It’s so strange for me to be talking about games like this. I usually hate gaming."
"The purpose of life is to prevent/reduce suffering. Hence, spreading + practicing antinatalism is my mission in life."
“Life is a game of parasitic organisms killing each other.”
parents have kids for the worst reasons | Childfree Kimberly   via @YouTube
"So the Queen of England is dead. I was never fond of the Queen, she killed Princess Diana, she had mines in Angola that explode to prevent native peoples from collecting her stolen diamonds + she killed 80,000 Native American children in Canada. Fuck the Queen!"
Existence is a death sentence. Life in prison + then capital punishment courtesy of Mother Nature.
Procreation is an irredeemable crime against all children.
I’m so happy to be childfree + single. Seeing so many of my ex-classmates in miserable marriages with kids makes me grateful everyday that I didn’t go down the conventional path of marriage + children.
"Natalists are sadists bc they know what being part of this world entails, yet they continue the perpetual cycle of needless suffering.   Natalists play God with destiny of their offspring forcing them to endure infinite suffering for their own sadistic pleasure."
All natalists have a sadistic god complex.
"CRAP:   Consumption, Reproduction, Addiction, Parasitism."
"Antinatalists provide everybody with rational descriptions of reality. If people don’t like that, that only means their skin is not thick enough to handle the truth."
Human life does not improve this world nor the universe.
"We don’t prevent harm by being here, we perpetuate it by being here!"
Procreation is retarded.
Sex is like a toilet with every flush more human beings are forced into a meaningless shithole existence.
Reproduction is perverted by your own emotional problems + has nothing to do with logic or reason.
You are a biological robot with programs + no purpose in life.
Procreation is insanely irresponsible.
"To my unborn children,   I know u wouldn’t consent to being part of this shitty existence, hence I chose to respect your right to choose.   I hope u enjoy the beautiful heavenly world of non-existence. Knowing you will never suffer the evils of this world gives me eternal peace."
Everything in life is futile + we are all experiencing decay via our meat suits.
It’s so hard to sleep in a bed that hasn’t been made.
"Cats have different personalities. I used to have this tuxedo cat who would share her food with other cats. She was kind to everybody. My mum would work in the garage + listen to Arabic music + she kept her company, she was such a sweetheart."
"The mother is a POS. She forces him to existence then when he’s barely an adult she kicks him out of the house, what a bitch. Especially in these hard times when rent is high + most jobs don’t pay living wage."
"It’s never about competency or meritocracy, but about how much ass + bootlicking you do to get ahead in life."
Starting a family isn’t a rite of passage into adulthood. It’s something people do bc they’re bored or they have been indoctrinated to believe it’s necessary.
I agree. Yet everyone is obsessed with starting a family. It doesn’t make any sense. I think too many people grew up  consuming media that romanticises the institution of family. It’s not as rosy as it appears.
“Families are where all suffering begins”
I don’t desire or romanticise families bc my family was messed up due to narcissists + psychopaths. I realised many families are like this which is why I don’t want to start a family.
"I can say, I have a family outside my extended + family of origin. My best friends are my family + so is my cat. My brother is my friend too. I don’t need to create anything more than that to feel fulfilled."
"From my life experience, all families are dysfunctional at various degrees. They look polished + shiny on the outside in family photos, but inside everybody is suffering with struggles, misery + pain."
"I can understand some people didn’t have a happy functional family + they wanna recreate that with a person they love, but they forget it entails somebody else’s suffering for your pleasure. And there’s no such thing as the Brady bunch. Those “families” are fictitious."
Why is everyone so obsessed with starting a family? Why not try to fix the already broken families we have? Or create a non-traditional family that has no biological children? Why do we need to create more people just bc they share our DNA + genes?
"You can start a family without forcing children into this hellish existence. Adopt, foster, get a pet(s), consider your closest friends an extension of your family. I don’t have a family other than the one I’m born into + I’m still happy."
"Existence + procreation are the root of all evil, but the desire to have a biological family is the greatest evil of all."
Life can only be seen positively if you are constantly indoctrinated with toxic positivity + if you accept being lied to + gaslit constantly.
"The foundation of everybody’s existence is lies, deceit, manipulation + constant gaslighting."
I'd rather be unemployed + unvaccinated than forcefully vaccinated + employed. So many people I know who got the jab have been suffering from blood clots + heart problems after getting it.
"I just applied for a construction internship at a major company in my country but I probably won't get offered the internship due to not being vaccinated. Idc about that anyway, its just one opportunity. Besides I'm going to summer school + it only pays living wage."
I’m thinking about applying for an internship for the summer.

“No one has a right to play (a game) with your destiny.”   #antinatalism
"Procreation is NOT a positive contribution to society. All you are creating is another consumer, who suffers needlessly with existential dread among many other pains this life has to offer. How does inflicting pain improve society? It makes no sense."
"I want to write a blogpost about advice no one gave me when I was growing up, especially career advice. If I can help one person in their late teens/early 20s, I’ll be happy. Society’s advice has always been wrong + designed to sabotage us. I was so misguided in my youth."
I have contributed the best I can to antinatalism by publishing two books. I was contemplating writing another but it needs extensive research. I talk to people everyday about antinatalism whenever I can. I want to do my part always bc all I see is suffering + I’m tired of it.
"I’ll always be closer to antinatalists more than breeders, aside from my family + friends who hv kids, being on antinatalist social media makes me feel less lonely. All my friends who have kids regret it, despite being good parents, but I rarely talk to them abt my deep feelings."
I love Stop Having Kids. Best activist group ever. Love VHEMT too. We need to go extinct.
I love the Ikigai concept; my therapist introduced me to it + I read the book. It aligns itself with my field of study being what the world needs.
"Antinatalist vegans don’t make veganism look bad, quite the contrary, they show how far they will go to reduce harm + suffering to all sentient beings including humans. Vegan breeders live in wishy washy delusion."
Vegan breeders are delusional. They think being vegan is going to reduce their carbon footprint more than not having kids. They have rose coloured glasses + think their kids will be great vegan activists when it is likely their kids will probably end up eating meat.
My cat is sluggish + seems sick today. Maybe it’s the weather or the wind. I’m worried about him. Hopefully he’ll be okay.
Antinatalists are black sheep in society who do not follow the herd.
"I stayed up late playing my brother’s Pokémon game. It’s just like old times when we used to have a gameboy colour + play Pokémon silver. I managed to get a badge, but I’m lost about where to go next. At least I’ll sleep well cuz gaming is tiresome."
"I don’t think life has endless opportunities, but I refused to settle for a crappy job, I have really good friends + I dumped my crappy SO, so now I’m happy."
Yup. That’s me.
Have you ever been shamed for being childfree by a breeder?   I have. Ironically she got pregnant at 13 + became a great grandmother in her 50s. Thank god I didn’t give into her pressure to have kids.
"I remember when I was 25. This ageist woman shamed me for not having kids + told me I have to hurry up + find someone to knock me up. It broke my heart for a bit, bc I wasn’t an antinatalist back then. Now I feel blessed to have never given into the pressure of having kids."
"I hate how society hates + shames women above the age of 35 bc they lose much of their fertility. When you are childfree, you are liberated from the burden of a biological clock + yes, your looks slowly fade but it’s not all bad, except menopause symptoms."
How many countries still have mask mandates? My country still has mask mandates even tho there is talk of removing them 2 weeks from now. I really hope they go soon bc I can’t imagine going to college + studying wearing a mask 24/7.
"Breeders have major delusions of grandeur, hence they feel the necessary need to pass on their superior genes."
Becoming mentally ill is inevitable in this life.
Breeders sacrifice their children to the devil. The devil is the prison of this hellish existence + the lord they sacrifice their innocent beings to.
That’s true. That’s why I only have 3 close friends I trust + dedicate myself to. I’m not interested in having more friends bc it’s exhausting.
"Most antinatalists I’ve talked to are interested in science + philosophy. I have learnt many things from them. I consider them more intellectually stimulating than breeders, altho I have met many breeders who have taught me a lot too. They seem to lack depth + insight though."
"You can be rich + be low class. Low class people like to gossip, sabotage others to get ahead, are cunning + manipulative, have no good taste in clothes, makeup or music + are unrefined + uncultured. Money can’t buy class, you can still be poor + classy."
"Childfree people who are high value have many options in terms of dating but they don’t centre their entire universe on children, they can afford to give more to society bc they aren’t parents 🙃."
You can still be childfree + a high value man or woman. Being a parent doesn’t define your value as a person. For all these “power couples” many of them build empires together without having children. Your contribution to the world IMHO determines your value.
"One of the most traumatic things that happened in my mother’s life was witnessing her black cat get attacked by a neighbours dog + then the cat died. This cat would wait for her in the kitchen, he spent time with her outside + she couldn’t stop the dog. It was so sad."
Using Your Kids for Money   via @YouTube - How breeders exploit their kids for views on YouTube.
Family vlog channels on YouTube are basically full of breeders exploiting their children by whoring them out for views. Thank goodness my parents aren’t like that + YouTube wasn’t around when I was a kid.
"Parents hurt their children when they force them to endure existence, whether they are conscious of it or not. Most parents aren’t conscious of it + their children suffer as a result."
I was looking for cat books with quotes + the book I wanted was sold out so I picked up these. They are so heartwarming to read. Cats always cheer me up when I’m feeling down.
"I passed my second assignment with 65% yaaaay!! I was dreading it so much, now I have one more assignment to go + then another assignment for another subject. So happy 😊."
I spend money on my friends + loved ones. It makes me feel good. But they usually tell me to spend it on myself.
"It’s the second day of spring here. I usually hate spring bc it makes my bipolar symptoms worse, but I feel okay. These daffodils are from my garden. Enjoy! The cherry blossom Sakura will be blooming soon! Will take pics!!"
"Just bc you can create life, it doesn’t mean that life is yours. You have your own life, you don’t need to gamble with somebody else’s. In fact, gambling with someone else’s is morally + ethically wrong. Feel free to gamble recklessly with your own life."
The only way I’d ever vote for a political party is if they legalise the following:  - Abortions - Allow children to sue their parents for forcing them into this world (via legislation) - Voluntary euthanasia + make Nembutal accessible in supermarkets
This would make an excellent title for a book. I’d love to see it published someday or I wouldn’t mind writing it.
"If you’re against abortions, voluntary euthanasia + you support the prolife movement or sanctity of life bullshit, then I want nothing to do with you."
"Corporations are obsessed with greenwashing everything. The elite eat prime steaks, while they want us to eat bugs. The most eco friendly thing is voluntary human extinction or euthanasia. They know this yet they want to spread more suffering."
I’m sick + tired of wanting to die + seeing others around me who want the same thing. I wish they would make exceptions for us to die. At least that’s less people consuming resources + suffering on this planet.
"If overpopulation cheapens the human experience, then euthanasia should become legal as our blood is cheap."
"If I was still living in the Middle East where they have the death penalty for homosexuality, I’d falsely come out as a lesbian so I’d be executed + be euthanised by the state."
"Serial killers who get the death penalty are angels/demons of death. On one hand they liberated people from the burden of existence, on the other hand, they imposed their will on others."
"People envy those who will opt for euthanasia if it’s legal bc those people don’t fear death. They want everybody to fear death, they don’t even want to open the file of voluntary euthanasia + they always use so-called ethics as an excuse."
"The ruling elite are so narcissistic they believe in life extension therapies for not only themselves but for their slaves bc they need people to serve them. They are behind the whole “life is sanctimonious” movement, but of course they blame it on religion."
"Euthanasia is illegal (or bureaucratically legal) bc this is a prison planet. You gotta do the time baby, cuz mummy + daddy did the crime. This world is so unfair + cruel."
#ThrowbackThursday An old picture of me from my memories.
"Animals are entitled to a dignified death bc capitalism cannot profit off of their suffering. Humans are denied a dignified death bc capitalism can no longer profit off of their existence. It’s all about the money, but Prolifers say it’s the sanctity of life bs."
The conspiracy to prolong the average human life is to benefit pharmaceutical conglomerates at the expense of those who want to be euthanised.
“This life is a prison circus full of ruthless clowns.”
I gave my brother his birthday present early (a Nintendo Switch Lite) + he was so happy. He’s gonna let me play Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze. I’m not much of a gamer but I enjoy some games occasionally.
"I’m mentally + physically exhausted from this existence. I literally want to spend the rest of my days bed-bound until I get the energy to finally continue this tiresome, grotesque existence."
I managed to sleep for 2 hours after my acupuncture session. I think I’m starting to get results. I feel really good. I really needed that long nap. I also brought an eye cream. Finally.
"Life is a scam + no, you don’t get your money back."
Natalism is the most destructive force in the universe. Sperm + eggs are weapons of mass destruction. Worse than a Molotov cocktail. I wish the worlds greatest superpowers would drop atomic bombs that would sterilise the whole world.
Breeders: You can gamble with what’s not yours in the first place.
"Breeders are the most reckless, inconsiderate, risk takers. I like to take risks + be reckless but I don’t let my actions affect other people, namely their children."
Breeders gamble with your genes. The worst form of gambling imaginable to mankind. Then what’s left is determinism where you have no free will.
The biggest + worst gamble in your entire life is your existence. You never knew what cocktail of crazy genes you were getting + the rest of your life depends solely on your luck + your fate/destiny.
"I have so many skincare products, mostly samples + gifts from buying full products. Im out of eye cream. Really need something good. I think I will go for this one. Not many eye creams to choose from."
"Watching Doug Stanhope Beer Hall Putsch it’s a bit funny, I love Stanhope but I don’t get some of his jokes/references. I relate more to Russell Peters + George Carlin."
"I just received a rejection letter for a job I applied for. I’m not that disappointed tbh, bc I haven’t finished my qualification yet + there maybe better paid opportunities out there for me once I’m done, but at least they emailed me back. I’ve been waiting forever."
"Now I can have the rest of the day off + chillax. Then start on my final 2 assignments, hopefully, I get them done before October (they are due in October) but I start new courses then so need to get them out of the way."
"Just submitted my assignment, hoping I will pass. I didn't struggle with anything except the word count of 2400 words. It was quite tedious + repetitive but hey its done 2 weeks ahead of time. Now I have two more assignments to go + my semester is finished."
"Iraqi people are ahead of their time, they don’t trust banks bc banks steal money. They bury their money in the backyard. I withdrew most of my assets + spent the money on gold + kept some cash at home. I only have like $2k left in the bank. I don’t trust banks either."
The bank has been harassing me abt where my large sums of cash come from. I provided evidence of bank accounts + gave them a copy of my summary of earnings from the tax department. Thank god they’ve left me alone now. I don’t want to change banks bc I have a credit card w them.
Yuck 🤮
"Natalists terrorise the unborn, just as much as this meatsuit, if not more than the meat grinder called existence."
Procreation is the mother of all beasts.
Procreation is uncivilised.
"I’m grateful to be living in NZ. Clean water, fresh air, good food + free education (at least for my diploma). I’m looking forward to working, earning a high salary + paying taxes."
Recreating a vile species in the name of progeny.
"My assignment is nearly done. Only 533 words left to meet the required word count, then I have to do sketches. I can do it all tomorrow + then submit."
Prolifers are mentally retarded.
"I went for a drive early Sunday morning + I saw people getting ready to go to church, it wasn’t very many people. The last time I went to church it was full of only old + coloured people. My country is 48.6% irreligious, 37.3% Christian."
"Wow, I can’t believe it’s midnight already."
Interesting.
"34% of pregnancies worldwide are unplanned. If children are inconvenience to your life, why have them?"
My rib cage hurts bc I slept on it in an uncomfortable position.
My biggest addiction is nicotine + disposable menthol vapes. I’m spending like $60 a week on them when I have a vape ready to use. What’s wrong with me?
"Question to my followers:   If someone did horrible things to you or someone you love + then the child of the person who did horrible things to reaches out to you + basically wants to be your friend, can you accept them knowing maybe the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree?"
"If I could turn back time or if time machines existed, I’d turn back the clock to when I was conceived + un-conceive myself."
The drive to procreate is so destructive that it destroys everything around you.
So many people have deactivated or are inactive on twitter. Many accounts I liked gone. Unfortunately.
"My husband, the Grim Reaper."
It feels like way more than that. Just saying.
Freshly squeezed lemonade with spicy Mac and cheese.
Epigenetics. We inherit trauma cells from our parents. So much trauma that’s why it’s best not to procreate.
Insomnia again hopefully I fall asleep soon so I can finish another section of my assignment.
I brought my brother a Nintendo Switch Lite for his birthday. Nintendo like PlayStation + Xbox like to keep customers in their ecosystem. Growing up we had Gameboy Colour + Nintendo DS. My brother wants to buy Mario + Pokémon games for it. I got over gaming when I was 13.
"Predatory religions teach you to “forgive and forget” or to “turn the other cheek”. It is a way to enable you to take back abusers, narcissists + psychopaths into your life."
I haven’t written a blogpost in a while. I don’t know what I should write about.
"Addiction, escapism, instant gratification etc. are the only ways we can survive a hellish existence."
الحياة سجن داخل سجن.
Capitalism and procreation have an unholy alliance.
The road to heaven is paved by a million hells.
"Forced into a hellish existence, Made to endure a life sentence, Of biological enslavement, In a cruel world with no excitement, Slaving away to satisfy the parasites, Purposeless procreation rites, In meatsuits that await a meat grinder, To destroy us slowly in decay + silence"
"Conceived in a world of lust, Everything here is so unjust, Nature destroyed by us, Everything we touch turns to rust, Internal conflicts weigh our minds, Suffering comes in all different kinds, Ruled by determinism that is our god, To perpetuate our genes in a futile act."
Arrogance + ignorance are the driving forces behind procreation. Arrogance about your genes being superior to others + worthy of carrying on. Ignorance about the situation in the world + lack of concern for what future generations have to endure.
"We are free within a prison. It’s a funny paradox. With that freedom we have the agency to refrain from creating more inmates to endure prison life. None of us are free, but we have the freedom to walk away from genetic enslavement of our future (non-existent) generations."
"Natalists are dull, unoriginal people who lack creativity + tools to enable them to create meaning in a meaningless existence. They are toxic co-dependents who depend on their offspring to give them purpose in life that is unsustainable beyond 18 years."
"The barrier that separates antinatalists from natalists is empathy, compassion for the unborn + conscious + self-awareness. Natalists lack empathy, compassion, basic courtesy + conscious awareness. Natalists are perfectly comfortable gambling with other peoples lives recklessly."
"I don’t dream of a fairytale wedding + happy marriage. My dream is to accomplish my goals, have a good career, come home to my cats, read, study, explore + maybe engage in deep intellectual conversations. My long awaited dream is to die in my sleep peacefully alone."
Antinatalism is the best gene I inherited courtesy of evolution weeding my pathetic genes out of the gene pool.
Natalism is the catalyst for all of life’s troubles.
If you leech off of someone you are not entitled to complain about them unless they are predatory charity-givers who give to you conditionally with strings attached.
Religious people are eternal victims of the ideologies they are enslaved to.
Abusers come back to haunt you bc they have nothing better to do. They need that narcissistic supply + it’s an intergenerational thing.
So many people I know are cyber stalkers. Social media has made it easy for everyone to become stalkers. Privacy + anonymity are luxuries in this day + age.
"Success is the best revenge, but I’m not afraid to cut people off. Cutting people off is easy for me. I cut people off who waste my time, backstab, abuse, hurt or betray me. It’s a form of self-care + a defence mechanism against parasitic predatory people."
"Does anyone still write handwritten letters to their friends or family who live far away? I love handwritten letters, they’re so sentimental  One of my best friends and I still write letters to each other and send postcards. She lives in Australia but she’s moving back to my city"
I also love “Moonlight Sonata” by Beethoven which I wouldn’t mind dying peacefully listening to or anything by Tchaikovsky.
I’d like to write love poems to the Grim Reaper for he is the master of ending all miseries.
"Before I die, I want to play the song “Nothing Else Matters” by Metallica + I’d like to eat some of my favourite food + then die peacefully in my sleep in a small cottage somewhere in the meadows with a beautiful sunset + greenery. That would be the most beautiful way to go."
My favourite song when I was 15 was “Be Yourself” by Audioslave. Now I think my main song I can listen to 24/7 that sums up my whole life is “Nothing Else Matters” by Metallica.
"Non-existence is the only real heaven. I don’t believe in fictitious heavens with beautiful sex gods, virgins, infinite palaces + eternal life. The only real heaven is one where the unborn remain non-existent + safe from all suffering in this world."
Ever since I started going to my acupuncturist every week I have started to gradually change my bad habits. I haven’t had any soda for a week. I’ve only had chocolate once + eaten out once. I’m slowly making changes towards a healthier lifestyle.
"How could someone fear a soft, cuddly, adorable creature?"
Procreation is the major sin + sex is the vehicle for it.
"If Adam &amp; Eve had immortal life in heaven they never needed to procreate in the first place. Sexual activity is degrading + they degraded us by engaging in it + forcing us into this hellhole. Procreation is the most evil sin, especially knowing how evil + corrupt this world is."
Procreation led to the fall of man(kind).
The garden of eden is non-existence + our parents are Adam + Eve who fucked us out of the garden of eden thanks to the lusty serpent who tricked them.
"Watching Orphan: The First Kill. I like the first orphan movie better, but this looks good so far."
The fact we get dementia when we are older is an indication that we are living too long thanks to technology + modern medicine. Instead we should legalise voluntary euthanasia to combat this problem. But of course that won’t happen bc big pharma wants ongoing elderly customers.
"I definitely get into freeze mode more than fight, flight or fawn."
"Made my bed, showered, washed my hair + just chilling. Waiting for my appointment with the acupuncturist. Hopefully it improves my sleep. I’ve still been struggling to sleep these days."
My cat jumping on the bed 😘😘😘
Me calling my cat. Look at him run!
"Overpopulation has been realized due to a decrease in death rates rather than birthrates. There have been advancements in the fields of medicine, technology, education and nutrition which have contributed to lower deaths."
Approximately 34% of the population was probably unwanted or accidental. This is universal. It is caused by cases of unwanted pregnancies by young girls as well as poor family planning methods. Absconding of children is also a factor.
There are around 80 million births per year - way too much to sustain the massive consumption of the worlds ecological resources.
Over 108 billion people have lived on earth + despite all this people continue breeding like rabbits.
We need to legalise voluntary euthanasia to combat ageing + longer life expectancies.
Overpopulation turns the world into one gigantic sewer + slum with a few high rise buildings for billionaires.
Antinatalism is progressive bc it’s proactive in reducing harm and suffering to others on the planet.
Humanity’s final stage of evolution is antinatalism + voluntary extinction bc the human experiment is going nowhere + it’s pointless + meaningless so imposing it on future generations is futile bc the end will always be nowhere. I consider ANs more evolved than other human beings
New Zealand is one of them.
I prefer dogs to children any day of the week.
I need more raw onions in my diet.
"I’m sick and tired of people abusing black cats due to outdated archaic superstitions. God bless the English and the Japanese for caring for them. Although I’ve never had a black cat, I think they are kind of adorable."
I also explained to her how much I detest imperialism + Islam was just as imperialistic as the West abusing Africa + Asia + then turning around + blaming all White people for imperialism of the Arab world. We also talked about the hypocrisy of religious people. So much to unpack.
She also showed a surprising interest in our family’s genealogy. I explained to her our family was forced to convert to Islam + she seemed to understand + accept it due to her being agnostic. I must admit I’ve never had deep intellectual conversations w any1 in my family like tht
"My cousin may become an antinatalist bc she’s familiar with existential nihilism, she studied philosophy at university + she’s probably heard of Schopenhauer. I had to explain peaceful voluntary extinction of our species to her + tell her this human experiment is going nowhere."
What I can’t stand is natalists who are ebeggars.
Thank god I’m not a jellyfish. I’d hate to have immortal life.
"So I talked to my cousin for a few hours, I found out she’s pretty liberal, she’s irreligious + we have some similar interests. I feel closer to her already even tho I don’t like to admit that. She’s going to be reading a lot of AN literature, so hopefully it will be good."
True.
"My cousin (who I don’t talk to) found my AN book + blog. I messaged her on WhatsApp to find out how she found me. Her mum used to abuse my mother. I don’t know if we should be friends, but if she’s into AN, maybe. She thinks we have “a lot in common”."
Breeders are horny af.
"Imagine if we all went to LA, we would then notice how overpopulated we really are."
Not many Arabic tweets about Antinatalism. I wish my Arabic was better so I could tweet more Antinatalism tweets to a larger audience.
#ضد_التناسل #antinatalism
الحياة كلها الم ومعنى ملا نهاية. أخطر و أنجس شي في الحياة هو التناسل. لا تفرض الحياة ومأساة على الاخرين.  Life is all pain without an end. The most dangerous and unclean thing is reproduction. Don’t impose life on others.
اتفه شيء في العالم هو الحياة.
Breeders are primitive and infantile. Inferior beings to all childfree and antinatalists.
Breeders are human traffickers. Stealing souls from the abyss.
(Biological) Parenthood is  Selfish Exhausting Bullying Meaningless Purposeless Cruel Imposition on others  Don’t become a biological parent. Adopt or foster
Procreation is  Cruel Selfish Mean Sadistic Nasty Harmful Unnecessary Burdensome Meaningless Bullshit  Don’t procreate!!!
Existence is  Pain Tedious Repetitive Exhausting Miserable Misfortunate  Full of struggle Existential dread Meaningless Pointless Purposeless  Spare future generations this unnecessary burden.
Abortions are salvation to the unborn.
Procreation = purposelessness
Motivational quotes are corny.
The ultimate act of love for a child is to leave them in the realm of non-existence where they will only find peace from all the evils of this world.
Natalists are douchebags.
Decolonize the planet from all putrid human beings who turn everything they touch into shit.
Every life is not worth starting.
Natalism is an evil act falsely masked as altruistic.
Procreation is a death sentence for those alive and future generations.
Natalists are to blame for every problem on this earth.
"Natalism is for losers, people with no lives or real goals in life."
The future generation are always burdened with our problems as soon as breeders force them into this world.
We waste all the world’s natural + economic resources on a future generation that never asked to be born in the first place.
"Procreation drains you physically, mentally, emotionally + spiritually. Instead of using your energy for yourself or betterment of society, you waste it on gambling with the life of an infant. Get a grip, breeders + go find someone else’s (who is already alive) life to improve."
Breeders fetishise babies + ass wiping.
"Antinatalism will solve the crises of the human condition for all generations, especially future generations who are burdened with so many problems left behind by previous generations."
My existence is a HUGE mistake.
Prolifers are the worst. They force the imposition of life on both parents + unborn children.   #RoeVsWade #AbortionRightsAreHumanRights #AbortionIsHealthcare #AbortionRights #AbortionBan
Toxic positivity is all about lying to yourself + other people.
Existence is inhumane.
Endless tragedy will always mask toxic positivity.
Toxic positivity vs. pessimistic realism. You know which one will always win.
Toxic positivity is a poor coping mechanism for our existential crises.
Toxic positivity is detrimental to our health bc it leads to a long series of disappointments that lead to depression and disillusion of our reality.
Linen bedsheets are more expensive than cotton sheets but they feel amazing. It’s a new sensation you feel on your skin and it’s nice and breathable.
"Periods are natures way of punishing women for not breeding. Every month I am reminded of many unpleasant things that irritate me. The moodiness, the cramps, the crime scene in my underpants + the cravings of sugary unhealthy foods. It sucks."
I finished 2 loads of laundry. Grabbed subway for lunch/dinner + now I’m about to wind down. Too tired to clean my room + shower/skincare routine. Hopefully I get a good sleep tonight + I feel better 2mrw. 2mrw I plan to get a lot of study done. I need this whole week for study.
Thank goodness people don’t breed like this anymore.
"Changed my bedsheets. Waiting on the first load of laundry to be done so I can put the second load in + go to the laundromat + dry my clothes + sheets. I also need to shower, vacuum, finish tidying my room + prepare for study tomorrow."
Toxic positivity.
I think all of society worships beautiful people even if they are criminals + society tends to distrust ugly people. It’s been proven in countless studies.
My personal punishment to those who have hurt me is the silent treatment. I refuse to talk to or engage with them. It drives them insane + most of the time they beg for my forgiveness.
A meat grinding conveyor belt leading to the abyss.
Life is full of decapitated dreams broken by reality.
Human existence is sugarcoated with positive euphemisms falsely describing the human experience.
"Life is full of backstabbers, asslickers, social climbers + novelty seeking assholes. I despise most humans with these traits + I was surrounded by so many people like this in my life."
I’d rather have 8 billion iPhones than 8 billion people on this planet.
Too bad I’m lacking sleep a lot these days.
Despite this fact natalists keep infesting our planet with more sacks of shit.
Existence is like being trapped in a mental asylum filled with lunatics that rule over us + optimistic bootlickers trying to spread toxic positivity in a wasteland filled with maggots.
"Procreation turns the world into a cesspool of shit. Sacks of shit multiplying like there’s no tomorrow. Turning the world into a sewer, consuming world’s resources constantly in unsustainable ways. Destroying the environment like a cancer rapidly spreading into the jaws of death"
I’m 32. So I’m 1 billion seconds old.
I brought a skull with a mow hawk.
Existence is like a 5 minute crafts video.
My best friends have been with me for almost a decade. I see us being friends for life.
"40% of my assignment is done, 950 words so far. I need another 1500-1600 words + it will be all done. Hopefully I can finish it in the next couple of days. I feel full + exhausted, really need to shower + do laundry. Might do all that tomorrow."
Broccoli soup tastes so amazing. One of my favourite soups ☺️.
Me and my cats Romeo + Nessie ❤️❤️❤️
The one thing I hate about studying is how repetitive it can be.
"I’ve never understood the desire for eternal life, aside from insecurities or being physically deformed I have noticed people who get plastic surgery want to live forever, even if they deny it. What’s so great about being a replicating sack of shit anyway?"
We forget we come from our father’s ballsack + mother’s womb - both dirty nether regions that require constant care. We are conceived nastily through animals humping each other grotesquely + we die with decay + insects eating our insides + a nasty stench.
"Humans r so nasty that when we die people want to bury or cremate us ASAP, bc of the stench, odour + unpleasantness of our corpses. Despite being conscious of this, we think more human beings on this planet is a good thing. We are quick to forget we came from a ballsack + ovum."
"Humans are nasty. Despite how many personal care products we use, we always seem to forget this + procreate."
Very well said!! Agreed!!
"Breeders forget that we are sacks of shit, piss, blood, guts + gore. Behind our aesthetics lies a rotting skeleton that haunts the land of the earth."
Tired of being controlled by determinism with no free will.
"A coma is the next best thing to death, but for now, the closest thing is sleep."
"You are a clone of your parents, there to replace them when they die on this earth."
Life is a fun shit show for a mad sadist.
I had my first acupuncture session with the lady my dad goes to. She spent two hours with me + it was a pretty good session. She gave me some herbs to take for depression + anxiety. She said I have a lot of energy blockages. I was exhausted when I left her house. See how it goes.
"At the nail salon, getting a pedicure + manicure."
"Not exactly. I need a whole queen size bed to myself. I have insomnia when people sleep next to me, except my cat."
Cute!! She looks like my old cat kitty. I love tuxedo cats.
This world is chaotic + disordered.
Did 4 hours of studying + I feel kind of exhausted. Hopefully I sleep well tonight + am ready for my first acupuncture session tomorrow. 😞😞😞
I started my second assignment on liquefaction in earthquake prone areas. It’s going well so far. I have about 300 words written. It’s taken me 2 hours of research. I’m a bit tired so I’m taking a break.
So true my ex taught me never to settle + working miserable jobs that pay little also taught me to never settle.
Children are the human meat grinder’s favourite food.
Hope is the most hopeless thing of all.
Life is an incurable disease.
Chance and whim govern the world.
"What men call friendship is on a reciprocal conciliation of interests, an exchange of good offices; it is in short simply a form of barter which self-love always expects to gain something."
"The greatest felicity is never to be borne, and the second soon to die."
Nature has given to man nothing of more value than shortness of life.
We begin to die as soon as we are born and the end is linked to the beginning.
"Man should ever look to his last day, and none should be called happy until his funeral."
We are but dust and shadow.
Life’s short span forbids us to enter far-reaching hopes.
"Life is short, the art long, opportunity fleeting, experience treacherous, judgement difficult."
Suffering for mortals is nature’s iron law.
The life of mankind is full of woe; with never a moment’s grace.
Misery comes at last to the healthy man; the end of life is sorrow.
"There is a house whose people sit in darkness; dust in their food, clay in their meat. They are clothed like birds with wings for coverings; they see no light, they sit in darkness."
I think I’ll tweet some of my fav quotes.
"Insomnia again tonight I took 4 quetiapine tablets this time, hopefully they knock me out. Just vaping away + spending time in Twitter land."
"Nothingness is salvation, From broken hopes + dreams, An eternity of peace, Once we cease, We taste the garden of eden, Full of natural wonders, Enchanted by the seas, Where we float away into heaven."
Non-existent is a beautiful world of undisturbed lustre.
"Taxed into a hellhole, Every broken soul, Conceived cruelly, In the name of compassion, False lies fed to us, Until we vanish."
"Enslaved by our genes, We’re stuck in a prison, Salvation hasn’t risen, Conceived by selfishness, Encapsulated by hollowness, Meaninglessness consumes us, Claims of truth that are bogus, Lied to since we are born, From nothingness we are torn."
A genetic legacy of dog shit.
Your genes are hard wired to screw you over.
Antinatalism is my only religion.
Children are a dumping ground for the world’s future problems.
Love is a chemical concoction of manipulative brain chemicals designed to biologically enslave you.
Boycott sex for it is why we are here.
There’s no hope for humanity except extinction.
"Adopt cats, dogs or children. No need for biological children. Cats are way better anyway."
Natalism is a malignant egotistical cancer on this planet.
Happy 75th Independence Day to all my Indian followers. Much Love ❤️.
Sperm + egg donors should be prosecuted. I’ve added some screenshots of the painful experiences of people conceived this way. Breeders need to think about the consequences of their actions.
"I heard about a wild cat (I think it was a leopard), who kidnapped two human children + raised them as her own. When someone took the children from her + tried to domesticate + integrate them into human life they died. That aside, animals probably adopt more than humans."
"Thanks to our selfish genes, adopted children are treated like trash + coldly discarded by those wishing to have their own biological children. Even monkeys + other animals adopt other peoples offspring to raise as their own."
I had a look at my next assignment. It's written in a complicated language I have difficulty understanding like my previous one. I already posted a question on the class forum to clarify things. I'll start working on it tomorrow or the next day.
Procreation is malignant self-love. Bc you are cloning an unsuspecting victim in the image of yourself + your partner purely for your own gratification. Nothing else is more selfish + egotistical.
Procreating doesn’t increase the love between 2 people. It causes tension + strain on those in love especially if the children have many problems.
"Insomnia again tonight, but at least my cat is keeping me company. If I get one hour’s sleep I’ll be happy."
I have big plans for revenge on a certain someone + that involves finishing my diploma + earning six figures. Something he said I can never do. I’m confident I can prove him wrong.
I disagree. #Antinatalism is the only way to save the world.
Love your non-existent offspring enough to spare them the burden of existence.   #antinatalism
"Breeders and society constantly gaslight you with mantras such as “life is good”, “life is a gift” and “life is precious” you believe these lies until you grow up and realise life is disposable, life is bad and life is a burden."
I’m sleeping with my cat tonight. I left the window open for him but my room is cold this winter. Hopefully we both have a good night’s rest.
I miss my therapist. I haven’t talked to her in what feels like 2 months.
"I just enrolled in my October courses for my qualification. Once these are done, I will officially be half way through my diploma. I’m happy to be doing well. Hopefully I can start working + everything in my life will go smoothly."
I passed my assignment that I was dreading!!! Yaaay!!! I’m so happy now.
Procreating is childish + immature.
"Yesterday, my colleague told me she regrets getting the first vaccination bc it has caused her heart pain + heart palpitations. She had to leave the job before she was going to get sacked for not taking the second jab. I hate the company for doing this to her."
The future of humanity is nowhere.
Procreation is a suicide mission.
"I submitted my job application, resume + cover letter to company for my QS Cadetship. Hopefully, I get the Cadetship, if not, I will continue my studies anyway.   My best friend also offered to reference me. I have finished my assignment + this job application. Now I can relax 🙏"
"I finally submitted my assignment. I am not satisfied w it, it feels like something is missing. I hope I pass + don't hv to resubmit it. I still didn't really get it much but worked with what I got to see where I go. Now I have 3 more assignments to finish + my 2 subjects r done."
"Mum told me at least he isn't suffering anymore, I agree. Sometimes death is the only salvation + road to freedom."
"I found out 2 months after I left my job one of my clients passed away from a heart attack. This made me feel a bit emotional bc he was still young, I think it was the medication. (They were giving him too much). My old job makes me get attached to people easily :|"
My ex-colleague agreed to be my reference!!! Yaaay!!! Now to revise my CV after this assignment..
"My mum said I slept for like an hour, she heard me snoring. I made a coffee/milo + showered. Feel ready to take on my studies today."
I need to vape.
Greek yoghurt / sour cream with Himalayan sea salt + extra virgin olive oil 😊
That’s why I’ve only ever voted once in my life + refuse to ever vote again.
"I still haven’t gotten any sleep except for maybe an hour or less. I can’t function like this. My dad wants to take me to an acupuncturist - I think I’m gonna take him up on the offer bc at this point, I’m desperate."
"Almost 48 hours without sleep, I’m wide awake my body is physically exhausted but I’m mentally on high alert. I really hope I’ll get some sleep tonight."
I need a manicure + a pedicure.
"I despise parents who use technology as free babysitters for their kids. When I was a kid, my mum would spend time w me, I played w my legos + my dad spent a lot of time reading to me. Aside from gameboy colour, we had no tech except a TV + my parents discouraged watching it."
"I have decided to take the plunge + text my ex-colleague for a reference tomorrow. I will revise my CV + ask another friend for a reference as well. I’m going to apply for the Cadetship + even if I don’t get it I have nothing to lose, I’m still studying + study is good."
"A pain pierces deep into my heart, Crushing my soul as each day goes by, Longing to die and forever be forgotten, My ashes sprinkled by the river, Forever leaving the last of my remnants to rest."
Lazy breeders who use the iPad a substitute parent.
Yes. My favourite is Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Lotion + Perfume. I use that after every shower.
"Soo I went out with mum + I got a new soap dish + some handmade soaps on sale. Then I did some walking + window shopping. I came back exhausted, had late lunch/dinner + now I’m trying to wind down. I hope to sleep tonight bc I have a lot to do for my assignment this weekend."
Most people are fools.
I think I found the book I'm looking for. I might buy this:
I remember this one time when my dad went to Turkey for a conference + I had contacted one of his shrewd Turkish friends. He had an avatar of a tabby cat on his WhatsApp + I remember how talking about his cat broke the ice between us.
"The best ice-breaker in an awkward situation is to talk about cats. I went to visit a lawyer who my family disliked + he had a picture of a tabby cat on his table. His cat resembled mine, so I broke the ice + started talking about cats + the meeting went well."
"I've had many cats... my first was a Persian cat, then I had a tuxedo cat, some ginger tabby cats, two siamese cats, a brown tabby + another brown tabby who has been with me for 10 years now."
"U know what I think would be a best-selling book that no one has thought to create?   A book filled with cat pictures + quotes on cats.   If there was a recent one, I would buy it to keep on my nightstand.  I have many cat fridge magnets + cat playing cards but I need a cat book."
"I took my dad's car to be washed. Mum is waiting for the laundry, so I just ate some Oreos + decided to chill until we go out. I'm excited to come home, have a snooze + study. Social media is the best place to chill when you're trying to pass time by."
Transgenderism is exploited a lot to push various agendas/narratives + to virtue signal much like blaxploitation. The true struggles of your average trans person are forgotten about.
"The main purpose of sex is to propagate our species. All other sex is meaningless, purposeless, disgusting + a waste of time/energy.   No human being is worth being vulnerable, trusting or loving with unless those things are purely platonic. The safest path is misanthropy."
"Prof. Sam Vaknin said that society is becoming more schizoid. The internet has helped us become more independent, self-reliant + we can teach ourselves anything. It’s better than having someone take half your shit, cheat on you, abuse you + add to your list of responsibilities."
"Men were traditionally providers + protectors, most modern men don’t fulfil these roles. Women r independent, can make their own money + realise being alone is better than having a modern man around. Modern men r the ones chasing marriage not modern women."
"I’ll take my meds, take sick leave (if I need it), try to get healthier + not be a tall poppy but work hard, but not too hard. I’ll try not to get too invested in the job. I’ll try to overcome my autistic limitations + smile more. Who knows, maybe it will work out for me."
"I’m a job hopper. I’ve never had a job for more than 2 yrs. I worked in warehousing retail + mental health/disability care, I’ve also done a few paid articles for a newspaper. Vineeth told me it’s bad to job hop. My goal is to stay w this company for at least 5 yrs if I get d job"
"I didn’t sleep at all last night, I just did my usual skincare routine, made my bed + cleaned my room. It feels like 1 degree Celsius this winter. I plan to go out with my mum + buy some items. I hope I manage to get a nap, if not, I’ll just keep studying like yesterday."
"If I can't get her as a reference, I have two Indian colleagues who might be able to help me. One of them I helped with healthcare qualification assignments + another one I referenced for a job in the South Island."
Sure :)
"My ex-colleague was also v unhappy in her job (being abused by the same Team Leader). If we reconnect, I might convince her to join the construction industry or help her with her Healthcare qualification which I completed. I always like to see ppl earning more money + doing well."
"My last job had a high turnover rate w managers changing all the time. I hv one colleague I haven’t talked to since I resigned, I wanna ask her to be my ref bc in my country employers care more about references. If she says yes, I’ll take her out to lunch + buy her a small gift."
Not procreating means you are challenging the status quo by not creating more slaves for the upper classes who remain in power + oppress you + your future generations.
"To ALL CF people + ANs:  Next time someone calls you selfish, remind them you are:   1.) Helping the environment 2.) Contributing to less traffic, pollution, job shortages etc. 3.) Putting less strain on water, food + other natural resources 4.) Minimising suffering/harm"
"Call me a conspiracy theorist but I hate fluoride - I have a fluoride blocker in my water filter, and I use loose tea leaves (tea bags have fluoride in them) + fluoride-free toothpaste."
One of my best friends stabbed me in the back at work + got me fired over jealousy. Never make friends with people at work.
That's why I hate greenwashing + the Green Party.
African women are beautiful ❤️
I have to update my resume. I spent some of 2021 studying + writing AN books (but I won't mention that in my resume) - I need to come up with things to fill in the gaps.
I haven't met the right person. I enjoy my freedoms I don't want to be trapped with more responsibilities + obligations. I'm also an antinatalist which is a dealbreaker for most people who want a traditional family.
You know what makes me more misanthropic? People who put small hidden cameras in hotel rooms + AirBnBs. As if this world doesn't have enough perverts already + tech companies stealing our data.
Biology (courtesy of Mother Nature + the DNA Molecule) that rule over us are responsible for all the suffering in the world.
"It's funny when ""responsible"" natalists + environmentalists like Prince Harry + Meghan Markle choose to have 1-2 kids. The most ethical choice is no kids + leaving behind your wealth to help people in need via a charity or foundation."
I want to work in my city bc then I don't have to worry about exorbitant rent prices. I don't mind learning hands-on or possibly continuing my study while I work. I just can't believe I emailed them. I normally don't approach potential employers.
That's true.
I can't believe it. I really would like this opportunity just so I can be close to my family + not have to move to another city far away from them. I really need to update my resume + my references in case they ask for them. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
"I just found a job listing in my city for a cadet position in QS. I haven't worked since the end of 2020. Out of the blue, I decided to email em enquiring abt the position to be trained under experienced QSs. I haven't planned on working but this a good opportunity for me."

Same here... 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
My best friend has her children's initials tattooed on her body 🫥🫥🫥
A successful tennis career is MORE IMPORTANT than being another breeder. Anything is better than being just another breeder.
Religious people + The Ultra Rich are the biggest breeders on earth 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Procreation ≠ God's Divine Gift Two People FUCKED WITHOUT PROTECTION + here we are SMH
This video is making me sick...   breeders are so deranged. Thank you to the person who shared it with me.
"ELON MUSK HAS FATHERED 10 KIDS!?! WOW, I DID NOT KNOW THAT. He's the richest man on earth, of course, he would be a worldly person who desires eternal life + heirs for his riches. But 10 kids STFU."
Things I can't live without:   1.) Music/Headphones/Sunglasses 2.) Writing/Writing Accessories 3.) My Laptop/External HDD 4.) My Vape 5.) My Medication 6.) My Cat 7.) My Kindle
"Random Thoughts:   The electric toothbrush is another good invention, especially the one that beeps/blinks every 30 seconds - it forever changes the way you brush your teeth."
"Random Thoughts:  I hate flavoured yoghurt. I am not a big fan of ice cream, but I LOVE plain Greek yoghurt. Best thing ever."
Random Thoughts:   Waterproof headphones with the built-in MP3 player are the best invention ever... they make my time in the shower + swimming feel amazing.
My desires...   1.) To know/discover the truth.  2.) To have wide knowledge. 3.) Simplicity.  4.) To always have a cat for companionship.  5.) To contribute positively to the world.  My shopping addictions among other addictions are just to pass time + get a dopamine hit.
I am like a monk/sage...   I don't desire eternal life. I have no sexual desires. I don't want children.  I don't want to be rich (but I learnt the hard way that having money is important).  I don't desire physical beauty (I have average looks).  I like ascetic lifestyles.
"If I won the lottery tomorrow + I got to live in a palace with all the world's riches, I'd still want to die + would prefer non-existence over the vanity of the world.   Of course, if I won the lottery I would spend a large amount of my fortune on lobbying/promoting antinatalism."
"Contrary to popular belief...   Natalism is a greedy, selfish, materialistic, and innate desire for eternal life + denotes a strong attachment to the evil in this world.  Antinatalism/being CF is selfless, compassionate, w a strong desire to end suffering + denotes detachment."
I don't care what people say...   Natalism is a WORLDLY activity.   Natalism = desire for ETERNAL LIFE (aka eternal suffering).  Antinatalism is DETACHED (and somewhat spiritual).  Antinatalism = desire to END SUFFERING (compassion-based).
"Breeding is a worldly activity. It demonstrates an attachment to this world + desire for immortality.  You'd think atheists would be more worldly + procreate more... but it's the opposite.   Religious ppl are pro-life, have more than 2 kids + they are supposed to be less worldly."
I've only ever seen one vegan atheist promote procreation. Every other atheist is indifferent to natalism.
Most atheists + other irreligious people I know have 2 kids (max) or they are childfree.
Every single person I know with more than 2 kids is religious. No exceptions.
"Religious people are supposed to be the least worldly people... they are supposed to be attached to an afterlife or some sort of reward from God, yet they breed the most + breeding is a worldly activity far from spirituality or unworldliness."
Funeral directors probably understand the futility of life more than most people.
"I picked these up from the supermarket for my fur baby. He loves his treats. I can’t wait to give him some tomorrow. He loves his dry treats too, but he’s fond of anything saucy."
Ignorance is bliss for those who live in denial about life + the current state of the world.
I've done 11 hours of (almost non-stop study)... (I haven't opened a book in weeks). One assignment + 1.5 modules. I'm excited about having dinner + going to bed. I also received a special sleeping tea in case I can't sleep.
"I think I’ve got this. If I manage to finish my second assignment after I receive my results from my first assignment (which I’ll hopefully pass), I can re-enrol in 2 more courses in October."
You’re right. The second best lifestyle is childfree/AN 😅.
1200+ words done... need a minimum of 1500 which shouldn't be a problem. Then I need to do my architectural drawings.
"Still working on my assignment, it's coming along smoothly (hopefully I've got the right idea)... I've been studying for 8 hours, I think I can go on longer. I might make myself a herbal tea + keep going. I definitely feel much better than before."
Very well said! Everything about this life is a scam or a Ponzi scheme.
"All breeders + the rest of society (their enablers, excluding childfree people) are megalomaniacs that thrive on controlling the lives of those who are smaller, weaker + less developed brains than them."
"I have had a productive day so far... I woke up at 10:30am, had 2 cups of coffee, did a few hours worth of work, showered/facial, back to work again. Not sure if its the extra Venlafaxine Dr. Mathew prescribed or its the fact I slept better. I finally understand this assignment."
Childfree + Antinatalist Lifestyles need to be incentivised.
"As I print my paperwork to highlight, I decided to treat myself to a face mask. I use I'm From Honey which is amazing on the skin, and it feels just like a facial at a salon. I highly recommend this. South Korea has the best face masks + get products."
Today I'm working on my assignment in the dining room. It's nice to be away from my bedroom for a change. I had 2 large cups of coffee + I started working on it. I needed the coffee as I was heavily sedated from my Seroquel last night. I'm gonna put in the effort + do my best.
"Two rights I want to see in my lifetime:   1.) Special rights for childfree people (tax cuts, leave etc)   2.) Legalised euthanasia for anybody that does not want to live.   If these two things are accomplished in my lifetime, I will be one happy camper."
"The less we procreate, the more opportunity we have to improve the living standard, eliminate problems in the world + create a better quality of living for those already alive."
"Children are an inconvenience on everybody - they cry, they are easy to manipulate, they abuse other children, they are indoctrinated, they are corrupted etc etc. The world is not ready for children, they are a liability + an inconvenience no one in their sound mind would have."
"When you get married, you are given special taxation benefits. It's the same when you have children. Childfree people who are single don't get any of those special perks instead they are punished with extra exploitation via taxation. Everyone has rights these days, except CF ppl."
Breeders get paid maternity/paternity leave... Childfree people should paid leave. Childfree ppl deserve tax breaks bc they are reducing the negative impacts of overpopulation on planet. People who have lots of kids should have to pay higher taxes for inconveniencing other ppl.
"I'm all for freedom of religion, LGBT rights... but I hate the far left, the concept of inclusivity.   I'm anti-natalist rights. I think natalists shouldn't have designated parking spaces, so much tax payer's money spent on them... and childfree people should have more rights."
"I refuse to be a natalist, far-left, cis-gendered normie. I hate natalism, I hate the left, I am indifferent to sexuality but I hate the term cis-gender, I dislike all religions + I hate marxism. I'm all for free speech as long as people don't invade my personal space."
"There are many things I hate in this world bc they are shoved down my throat... these include: natalism, politics, sexuality/gender ideology, religion, marxism etc... I wish everything was centrist/neutral + there was no hidden agenda behind these things."
"I'm all for freedom of speech + freedom of expression, but when things are forced down my throat, that is when I get mad + hostile bc I didn't sign up for anyone's agenda, so please leave me out of it."
"I am against imposition in all forms. It's wrong to impose life on others and religion, sexuality, politics etc. Society imposes so much on us so thats why I am anti-society."
I managed to knock myself out with an overdose of Seroquel which put me to sleep for at least 6 hours. I feel much better now finally 😊.
The best time to call the mental health + addictions is 2am. I finally managed to get thru + they’ll try to contact my Keyworker sometime soon.   I also ODed on some pills I had that I hope will knock me out. I usually don’t OD on anything but I’m so desperate for sleep.
I’m Iraqi. My mother told me it’s very hard to abandon a baby in Iraq - usually people leave it outside in a mosque. It’s also hard to have an abortion if you get pregnant out of wedlock - the OB/GYN insults you + threatens to tell your family.
"My great grandfather found a baby girl in a cemetery + decided to adopt her. My mother’s cousin could not conceive + she adopted two twin baby boys who were from a war torn country. Other than that, I can’t think of a single other person in my family who has adopted."
Still wide awake suffering from insomnia.
I have heard so many stories about breeders who adopt bc they can’t have kids then they fall pregnant + return the adopted child to the orphanage or agency. Breeders are the most selfish people on the planet.
I just watched a video on YT where this couple (man in a wheelchair + woman) can’t have kids + they had to choose between adoption + a sperm donor. They chose the sperm donor bc “having a biological child is more intimate” wtf?
I tried to ring the mental health + addictions hotline + I couldn’t be bothered waiting on the line to talk to someone. I’m so exhausted + I have signs of mania coming my way
“Vasectomy” 🎤: Torio Van Grol - #comedy #toriovangrol #donttellcomedy #s...   via @YouTube
"So I made some yogi tea for sleep, I tidied my room + I’m aiming for a nap. I still feel very anxious about my coursework but hopefully I’ll be okay.  I remember 2 years ago when I left twitter I was sleepless for 2 weeks + I became manic almost to the point of hospitalisation."
I haven’t slept since Thursday and I’m starting to feel like I’m gonna die. I really need my sleep
Over 36 hours no sleep. Insomnia.
Workplaces are factories that create PTSD in their employees.
My mother had some fava beans so I decided to make foul mudammas + despite the fact I didn’t have fresh ingredients it turned out very delicious. I have never been fond of fava beans but since watching a YouTuber try breakfasts from around the world I got inspired.
"With that said, I’m open to the idea of open relationships (I’m not the jealous type) but maybe that’s just me being too naive."
"One of the reasons I don’t want to get married is bc the person who will be stuck w me will be stuck in a dead bedroom that they’ll resent me for. My parents are happily married in a dead bedroom for nearly 40 years, but it’s hard to find a partner who is in it for companionship."
"True, but many plants spread their own seeds. They don’t need humans to propagate them."
I feel like drinking moscato rose with my best friend. I miss the days we would drink wine + just talk.

Nothing in this world is worth salvaging except your sanity.
"I just found out   My sun sign is Aries. My moon sign is Scorpio. My rising sign is Leo.  Not really into astrology, but good to know."
"My mum noticed that garlic is $52 a kilo here. That’s insane. It used to be around $30 a kilo. Harvest must be bad this season, plus inflation."
"Child poverty should not exist. I hate to bring religion into this but in Islam we were taught money comes before children bc money is sustenance for children, yet we have people who can barely look after themselves mindlessly breeding. If you don’t live comfortably don’t breed."
"My country has a population of 5 million people. According to govt statistics we hv over 180,000 children living below the poverty line with no food to eat. We are a first world country, we have cheap + easy to access contraceptives yet these stupid breeders create more suffering"
Workplace bullying costs taxpayers in my country $1 Billion a year. Never underestimate what damage bullying can do to people/the economy.
That’s true. Friends are often the worst thing to have bc people are fickle + they can/will turn against you. Real friends are rare - I’m fortunate enough to be blessed with a few.
"I gifted my manager a gift along with other managers, I gave an epic speech + resigned on the spot. No regrets til this day. I no longer get psychosomatic migraines + I don’t have to drag myself to work anymore. I’m much happier."
"My team leader was abusive, he tried to set me up with negligence, he used to hide things all the time + he spent all the time trying to sabotage me only for it to backfire in his face. He also almost got one of my clients killed by over drugging him. I left work for my sanity."
I used to believe in having good career prospects but I realise now the only thing I know is I don’t want to work a dead job I hate. I’ll probably work again if I’m still around but it will be in a professional field. I have no regrets for walking away from my job.
"Work is a scam. Toxic work environments are designed to take you to an early grave so employers + the govt don’t have to pay you a pension. Walking away from a toxic work environment for the sake of your sanity, mental health + for self-care is valid."
"My psychiatrist upped my dose of lamotrigine in hopes of improving my sleep. I feel okay on it, but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to sleep properly. My sleep pattern has been so messed up, I sleep once every 36 hours or so. We’ll see what happens."
Do any of your parents have social media? My dad has Facebook and Twitter. We don’t follow each other.
"Two people had sex in 1989 and here I am now paying the price for it by maintaining my meatsuit, working 9-5, dealing with mental illness, studying and overall suffering, all bc two people had sex."
My existence is a sin.
My Cat ❤️❤️❤️
“Love is purely based on the pleasure principle.” — #Quote   @OhMyAngelaLove
Existence always involves exploitation. You cannot exist without exploiting or inflicting harm on others. This is one reason why I hate existence and I wish I was never born. Nothing about existence is ethical. That’s why humanity will always be in a never ending predicament.
"Love is not a finger food buffet. Along with the good, you have to love the bad and the ugly, you cannot choose to love only the good. Therefore, love is not altruistic. Bc love objectifies, it’s convenient and gives satisfaction."
“Altruism is selfish and self motivated.” — #quote   @OhMyAngelaLove
"I would like to thank @joedan346 for being my rock + supporting me through my most difficult times. You have helped keep me on track + ensured I remain goal oriented. Although we have never met in person, I am eternally grateful for everything you’ve done for me 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼."
"What good have humans done to the planet?  Nothing.  Does our presence improve the earth for other inhabitants besides ourselves?  No.  Therefore, we are cancer that should not be procreating. Reproduction = destruction + degeneracy of the earth in our name."
Procreation is degenerate bc it is advocating for spreading disease. Humans are a cancer on this planet + to say so otherwise is to be in denial. Procreation is worse than spreading any other terrible disease out there bc we are the worst kind of parasites to infest the earth.
"Morally, procreation is a hallmark of degeneracy bc the right choice for humanity is extinction. Extinction is the only moral choice for humanity bc of the destruction we inflict on the earth + our fellow earthlings. We destroy everything we touch so it’s time for us to go."
"So I went to see the psychiatrist. They offered me respite care at a place I am not very fond of. They increased my medication to the maximum dosages recommended. The psych ward was too full to allow my admission, so it looks like I’m resting at home + trying to get some sleep."
"I tried to do it, but this method is really tricky especially with the gas cylinder. It was terrifying when the gas was making noise. I thought offing myself would be easier."
"I’m so tempted to kms tonight. I think I might do it. It feels like the right thing to do. I’m tired of living, having to work, study + do things. I’m ready to die. There’s nothing to live for in life. I’m so tired of this life I can’t do anything right, I need to go."
Goodbye.
I made a packing list + packed my bags so I can be ready for the hospital tomorrow. Hopefully everything goes well but some part of me still wants to die tonight. I’m tired of this life thing + I feel like I’m ready to go.
"I planned to off myself tonight, then my father told me my keyworker called. A psychiatrist will see me tomorrow to determine whether I need to be admitted or not. I hope I get admitted so I can socialise a bit + get some rest while some professionals keep an eye on me."
Indeed it is!
"Forcing someone to exist, suffer + die is immoral, unethical + selfish."
#ShitNatalistsSay
Menstruation is natures way of punishing the childfree. Childbirth is natures way of doubling on punishments for procreating. Nature is misogynistic.
Me too.
"I didn’t sleep for the whole night, might nap later on. I hope to try + attempt to finish my assignment later on this week + submit it. I’ll c if I can take my brother on a road trip once I submit everything. I need a change of scenery don’t think I’ll spend it in a psych ward."
Parents who post pictures of their kids online are attention whores. Thank goodness my parents never posted anything about me online.
Questioning religion is like having an identity crisis it’s like questioning your entire existence. It takes a lot of bravery to walk away from your entire identity or worldview.
The only safe space for everybody that has inclusivity is a non-religious space. Most religions clash with many social issues. I don’t envision religions opening up to let others in despite the fact they preach tolerance.
I can’t believe the exmuslim subreddit has almost 120k followers. I can totally relate to some of the posts on there but I find the people a bit hostile sometimes. There’s a beef between Arab muslims + non-Arab muslims. I feel bad for the non-Arabs bc they are treated as inferior
"“The smarter you are, the sadder you will be in life.”   Most antinatalists are smarter than the average person, and many of us are very sad people."
"I’ll care for my parents as long as I can, but they didn’t give up their life to save me they brought me into this world without my consent + I suffered terribly bc of their irresponsible choice to have me."
"But what shocks me the most is when educated women want to do it all + be mothers to many children, like my 2 cousins who have 3 + 5 kids. I don’t believe it’s possible to be a career woman + still raise happy, healthy children. The children always suffer when mothers r too busy."
"Empowering women reproductively is the only solution to the procreation problem. When women are educated, they have less children, hence why female education + empowerment are vital to antinatalism."
"I also support men’s rights too. Men’s rights to not be raped in a divorce court, men’s rights to child custody, men’s rights not to be demonised. Hence, why I am an egalitarian centrist."
"In some countries women are illiterate, oppressed, miserable, victims of domestic violence + have no access to safe birth control or abortions. As an antinatalist you gotta support feminism mainly bc of reproductive rights that many women are deprived of."
"I am a feminist, but not a radical third wave feminist, more of a centrist-feminist. I recognise the rights of both women + men + I believe in most forms of individual equality. I’m more of an egalitarian than a feminist. Why am I a feminist?"
What are your dreams?  I dream of my death and my own demise.
What are your goals in life?  To die a dignified death.
I am  Nihilistic Right handed Childfree/Antinatalist Apolitical/Centrist Irreligious/Apostate Don’t drink/Occasional Smoker Eat Kosher/Almost Vegetarian Voluntarily Celibate
I just spent over $6k on a gold necklace. I liked it + it’s a good investment considering it’s 22kt gold. I’m broke now w less left in the bank + more savings at home. It’s better to spend yr money on gold as an investment than to let money continue to depreciate due to inflation
"Stolen from the void, The existence I want to avoid, Sadness fills my soul, Nothing makes me whole, Misery prevails in my life, I’m tired of this strife, Pain engulfs me deeply, I feel so sleepy, Exhausted from this existence, Nothing provides me with sustenance."
I wish I could physically be here
I want to be 11 minutes closer to meeting the almighty creator
I watched a video from IncelTV where he discusses r/deadbedrooms it never ceases to amaze me how so many people are addicted to sex + feel entitled to it. Thank god I’m not married or stuck married to someone I’m repulsed by. So many people are stuck in miserable marriages.
"Another one of my cousins has 5 kids + she dresses the whole family in matching outfits. She wants many kids bc she loves + romanticises the idea of a big family. Big families make me a bit uncomfortable bc I’ve never been v warm, social or outgoing. I like small families better."
"My family is full of delusional natalists who think having a big family (3 or more kids) is normal, wonderful + great accomplishment. Meanwhile, I think they are stupid fools who don’t know any better. Dnt they c how degenerate society is + how sucky life is to bring another kid?"
"I tried to get myself checked into a psych ward but unfortunately my Keyworker didn’t call me back, meanwhile, my stupid cousin has given birth to twins. I worry everyday about the future of children being born. It’s terrible."
Personal Dilemma:   Commit Suicide or Go To The Psych Ward???
Suicidal insomnia.
I forced myself to shower maybe this is a good first step towards recovery + healing. I don’t know wtf is wrong with me + why I can’t pull myself out of this terrible mood/phase/episode.
"I want to kill myself. I feel so tired. I can’t do my assignment. I can’t even shower or clean my room. I feel awful. I want to get just enough energy to clean my room, shower + change my sheets so I can end my pathetic, mediocre existence. I’m so tired of living."
I was fast asleep yesterday + my mother opened the door to find my cat snuffing + hissing at her telling her to go away. I never thought my cat would be so protective of me when I’m sleeping.
I have autism + bipolar disorder. I take medication I’m unfit to be a parent + I don’t desire anything in life but death.
"I have mental issues, I’m unfit to be an ADOPTIVE parent."
"I’m a hardcore antinatalist, I’ll never have a child. I can barely take care of myself, let alone a child. I’ll probably commit suicide regardless of whether I have a child or not."
"If I can’t commit suicide in this lifetime, I will commit genetic suicide by not procreating + safeguarding my progeny from meaningless suffering.  #antinatalist"
Antinatalism is genetic suicide but genetic suicide for a good + noble cause.
The pinnacle of human existence is parasitic. We begin as parasites after conception + we live our entire existence as parasites. What a way to exist!
Insomnia 😫😫😫
Nature is sadistic.
Breeders are megalomaniacs. Always imposing their will on others.   #antinatalism
Why is marital rape delegitimised just bc you’re married? People have the right to refuse sex if they are in a committed relationship. Not sure why people are entitled to sex just bc they’re married.
"Why is the word “breeders” considered derogatory? They procreate + multiply of course they deserve to be labelled as such, not sure why they find it derogatory."
What do gays + antinatalists have in common?   We both refer to natalists as breeders. I respect gays who stand their ground + don’t have children but what I find awkward is when gays go for IVF or surrogacy instead of adopting.
Natal-apocalypse.
"Breeders deteriorate the quality of life for other humans on the planet - they are to disease, traffic, stress + almost every other problem we have."
This tea seems to help my anxiety. Perhaps I’ll be able to clean my room + study tonight 💕.
"Consumed by many fears, Enduring so much all these years, Sadness, worry + constant stress, I wish I cud b laid to rest, Festering wounds unleashed inside, Beating hearts want to hide, Kill me already, let me die, Don’t let me continue to sigh, Otherwise I’ll need to get high."
"Butterflies in my stomach, Aching hearts over the monk, I feel so stressed deep inside, Many things make me wanna hide, Tears in my eyes that wanna dry, Fears that can I can never cry, Bottled anger within me, So much I don’t want to see, Stress that overtakes my sanity"
I have so much anxiety right now. It’s driving me insane 😫.
"“The purpose of marriage is to be fruitful + multiply, hence why we must procreate.”   #ShitNatalistsSay"

"My parents want me to change my scenery + maybe go to the psych ward to socialise, get some rest + some medical treatment I am not sure I want to go. I’ll probably try to finish my assignment + then go or take a road trip somewhere. I’ll see."
"I used to have an iPod nano like this. I had about 4 apple iPods, I settled for a Sony Walkman which I’ve had for 7 years now. A much better investment."
"“I want to leave behind a legacy, otherwise I’ll be forgotten”  #ShitNatalistsSay"
“Who will take care of me when I’m old?”  #ShitNatalistsSay
"Aside from eating, sleeping + reproducing, the purpose of life is to experience + maximise pleasure + minimise or destroy pain."
"If sex is about control + dominance, firstly, I don’t desire to control or dominate anybody, hence, therefore, I don’t need to have sex or to oppress others to feel powerful or invincible."
"Sex is about power, dominance + submissiveness to authority. The fact we are naked + vulnerable symbolises oppression + shamelessness."
"My family + I go to a Chinese dentist who is terrified of covid + is a germophobe. Today my mum left the clinic to sit in the car while my dad was having his checkup, he was so happy. He’s obsessed with masks + you have to have a negative covid test to come see him."
"“My child will grow up to cure cancer.” Says every Tom, Dick and Harry.   #ShitNatalistsSay"

I wanna start a hashtag + have fun tonight. #ShitNatalistsSay
"I wrote an outline to-do list for my assignment. If I follow the schedule, I should be done by the end of July. I’m scared tbh. I feel so suicidal when doing assignments bc I’m so anxious + afraid. I need to relax + just do the work. Worst case scenario is repeating assignment."
I’m really struggling with my assignment + I can’t seem to get started. I need to break it up into small chunks + develop an action plan so I get it done without stress + procrastination 😫😫😫
That’s only one of the many problems we have to face.
"Sexual desire created you, your desires are endless bc of it + in turn other people pay the price + suffer bc of desire."
"My problems in life all started by two people having sex. All the world’s problems are caused by ppl having sex. This is eye opening when u think abt it. When 1 of my followers said “he’s boycotting sex” he’s right. Why fall into the trap that caused all pain, suffering + misery?"
"Chinese people also love turtles bc they signify old age + they live on average about a 100 years. Same with fish that signify wealth, among many other positive cultural omens they have."
Chinese ppl are obsessed w life extension therapies + longevity. You can't gift them a knife or a clock bc both mean death. My family + I go to this Chinese dentist who expects us to wear a mask almost constantly + he wears more than one mask. Never seen someone afraid of COVID.
"If there's one thing in life I've learnt, that is nobody in life is entitled to love except for children with love from their parents. There are some men women will automatically find repulsive bc of their actions + promiscuous men are a turn off, they are immodest + cheap."
"I watched this video on YT where this YouTuber is complaining abt y girls don't like him. He's a dirty, STD ridden man who cheats on decent women, he's also a basement dweller who has no real job or substance as a person, yet he feels entitled to women throwing themselves at him."
To terminate a pregnancy is a noble act of compassion towards an unborn foetus even if the foetus does feel pain.
A drug overdose = taking too much to numb the excruciating pain away or being so desensitised you need an extra dose just to make everything stop.
"Everyone is equal as a fellow human being. What I am most intolerant of are breeders + fascists who believe in any form of imposition of their way of life on others. I also can't stand some political pundits, people who abuse their rights/privileges to harm others."
Life is a slaughterhouse of horrors that await us. Our only protest against the terror of existence is to not have children - for their sake + ours.
The meat grinder is the most merciless thing known to existence picture yourself as naked cattle on a conveyor belt awaiting terror + a nightmarish demise.
"The truth is, I’m to Eastern for the West and too Western for the East. Cultural hybridisation makes existence that much more of a struggle."
"I grew up w traditional conservative values, some of which I still uphold. No matter how hard I try to ‘liberate’ myself from them I find myself stuck between a rock + a hard place. If I forget them I spiral into degeneracy I detest, if I uphold them they contradict some things."
"Life should be measured by the amount of suffering in the world vs. the amount of happiness, since suffering wins the prize, that should de facto be what we expect life to offer us."
"If we put happiness + suffering on a kitchen scale, the suffering by far outweighs the happiness in life."
"I also watch the same movies over + over again, b/c I can hardly find any movie or series that interests me. Maybe it’s an autistic thing."
"I haven’t slept in over 24 hours. When I have insomnia, I just rewatch old sitcoms I liked when I was a teen. I’ve been binge watching 7th Heaven + playing candy crush, hopefully I’ll have an early night tonight so I can be ready for study tomorrow."
"Have you ever felt as though even when you age (physically) you still feel like you’re 15 years old? You rewatch the same series/cartoons when you were a teen, you listen to the same music + you read the same books etc  My secret is I still think/feel like I’m 15."
Tomorrow + the rest of the week will definitely be dedicated to my assignment due in 2.5 weeks. I’ll pay off my credit card tonight + chill out for the rest of the day. Never under estimate the power of retail therapy + what shopping can do to lift your broken spirits.
"Today my favourite department store was having a birthday sale + I had store credit expiring in a few weeks so I decided to take mum on a shopping spree + I brought some new clothes. I rarely go out + shop in person, I mostly shop online but it was a good break from my routine."
"When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears, When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears, And I held your hand through all of these years, And you still have all of me, I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone, But though u're still with me, I've been alone."
"Life is full of despair, Everything I don’t wanna hear."
Sadness enchants my soul.
"Born without my permission, I refuse to give in to submission."
Existence is a subpar experience.
"Feeling so weak, Inability to speak, Struggling to live, Suffering to thrive, Hatred of existence, No sustenance, My heart is hurting, Slowly reverting, Futility burns, Everything returns, To shit and life hurts."
"Life is a burden, Full of the uncertain, Tragedies and pain, Suffering in vain, Distressing days, Everyone pays, Struggles insane, Pain reins, Futility bites, Sadness rites, Of passage, Drifting into nothingness."
"Life is a constant series of disappointments + misfortunes bestowed upon us. Existence is a constant vicious cycle of suffering, pain + doom."
"I showered + washed my hair, did 2 loads of washing + cleaned my messy room. I feel like I’ve accomplished something big considering I have bed bound depression + I can’t do anything productive or constructive in my life."
I need to check myself into a psychiatric hospital.
"I’m in love with these candies, they r from America + I had to find a place from out of town just to order them."
Today I learnt Americans call silverbeet chard. I’ve never heard this word before.
"Procreation is NOT a rite of passage into adulthood. If all we do is age + we are all children stuck in adult bodies, then it’s children raising other children."
"One thing I dislike abt procreation in some cultures is it is seen as a rite of passage into adulthood, which it is to some extent, but being childfree doesn’t make you any less mature, responsible or any less of an adult. As long as I don’t have kids, my parents see me as a kid."
"There’s no real happiness, only short term gratification."
"We live in a sexist world. When men get sexually harassed by women, they aren’t taken seriously if they report such behaviour. When women get sexually harassed they are also silenced about it. This world has so many people giving unsolicited advances towards people. It’s crazy."
I would like to extend my thanks + gratitude to my followers for inspiring some of my random poetry. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
"Our wounds are still fresh, Meat suits covered in flesh, Constant agonising pain, Long lived in vain, Depression overshadows, Misery in foreshadows, Lusting for escapism, That pain is sadism, Inflicted on us by our parents, With sheer abhorrence."
"The beauty of life is all vain, Short lived and all for of pain, It feels like an eternity, Of constant insanity, In a world of no return, Everything is so stern, Take me back to non-existence, Where I can finally be laid to rest."
"Roses are red, And life is futile, Yet they tell you To go an extra mile, For something you never asked for, Pains and deep sores, Plague me in my head, Lock me in a shed and let me die, For this life is worthless, And everything is senseless."
"Roses are red, Life is full of blues, I hate it so much, It makes me blue, Kill me soon and let me die, Let me disappear away and fly, Into the heavens of nothingness, But why should I settle for any less? Break me and stab me, liberate me, Feel my pain + take a look + see."
"Waiting to unleash a beast, To have + consume a massive feast, We suffer everyday for nothing, We die to live for so-called “something”, We wish to end it but no one understands, All this happens within many grains of sand, But in a world of vanity, death always prevails."
"What do I do with an unwanted life? Struggle + pain, constant strife, Living in constant fear, All we say is what they want to hear, “But life is good” is what they say, Yet everyday for this life we pay, Tragic moments of deep silence, Internally within us is constant violence."
"Crushed by the system that screws us all, The rein begins to fall, Upon us when we shall taste death, To taste the consumption’s wreath, Let us be liberated from this deep pain, For all that is vain"
"Vanity prevails in a world of greed, Superficiality is all they need, In a world full fake faced clowns, Emptiness fills our towns, Disaster + disease plague our minds, Trapped + enslaved is our finds, Consumed by many endless needs, Parasitic meatsuits of infinite feeds."
"Existence is dreadful, They say life is wonderful, Infinite cycles of pain, Everything is in vain, Tragedy by tragedy, Ruled by instincts of greed, Slaves trapped in creed, Misery prevails as joy dies, I wish time here flies, Melancholic crimson tears, Ridden with many fears."
I can’t wait for my child to experience the beauties of life #antinatalism
Existence is demoralising.
Maybe I don’t want to play games.
The biggest problem in the world is pedophilia + natalists are to blame for it bc they keep popping out children to be abused by sex offenders.
"Antinatalism is a countercultural movement against natalism which is toxic, poisonous + unnecessary. Everyone is born of constant needs that need to be fulfilled + this leaves us constantly agonised + suffering in pain."
"Life is dramatic, Everyone says it’s cinematic, Exhausting drain, Constant pain, Peace is long away, But life is good is what they say, I want to die + find peace, But this existence I cannot cease, Sadness consumes me deep inside, All I want to do is hide."
"Existence is toxic. Everything about life is venomous. We will eventually poison ourselves + die, it’s only a matter of time."
I never had a bad day in my life until I was born
My favourite brand of disposable vapes is being discontinued. I just brought the last 6 vapes so minty and so good.

"“Mother Nature is a brutal bitch, red in tooth and claw who destroys what she creates.”  #Quote #ErnestBecker"
I watched a documentary on Mumbai + how people are building houses next to forestry habitats which result in children being eaten alive by leopards + it makes me realise that we invade the lands of these creatures only to be eaten by them.
Humans are the most entitled species on the planet. They feel entitled to encroach on anything that does not belong to them. They cannot share or live in harmony with other creatures which is why humans are parasites + vampires looking for their next source of supply.
"New Age spirituality, like religion was designed to keep you enslaved with the toxic positivity mindset."
Zoomers and millennials aren’t having children bc they can’t afford it Antinatalism ftw.
Said every natalist man who forgets the God of futility.
"Coming into existence is like being born an asshole, all that spews out of you shit + everything in life means nothing to you but shit."
"Slaves to a meat suit, Of endless needs, Breaking away trying, Not to spread our seeds. But this godforsaken meat suit is a terroriser - punishing us with obesity, anorexia and heart disease."
Am I too old to be buying children’s toys? I think not. People never grow up. We age + instead often confuse ageing for becoming more mature. I hv become obsessed w buying squishy toys to self-soothe. My recent purchase was a squishy journal I love so much.
"My dad still reads left wing media like the New Statesman + The Listener magazines, but he’s very much heavily invested in this right wing stuff."
"My dad is a leftie, recently he’s entered the world of national right wing blogs written by fellow ethnic people. It’s strange how the left pushes centrists to the right bc their agenda oppresses everybody. It will take a while for me to accept dad’s “transition”."
Pregnancy is gross.
"Covid lockdowns caused a baby boom in the Philippines. Watching a documentary on the rise in unwanted pregnancies + the inability of family planning to provide their services. How tragic for those children born. 214,000 extra unwanted children were born in 2021."
My baby fast asleep 😴
"Sex is a poor man’s free ticket to pleasure that results in billions of children suffering worldwide who are malnourished, miserable + struggling.   Poor men need free vasectomies to stop this mayhem. At least that’s several less million people being born."
I have autism + got misdiagnosed with BPD. I also have bipolar disorder which often gets mixed up with BPD. It must be hard for people who have BPD.

"Our meat suits are the first prison in which we are trapped, followed by a second prison called needs/desires, then another prison called the wage/slave system then another prison called capitalism. It’s a prison within a prison, so instead of dying once you die a million times."
Breeders disturb the unborn for no valid reason that is ever good enough to force them out of the void into a meat grinder existence.
"Antinatalism stands for everyone who is oppressed by the cruel forces that rule this world, except for breeders who continue the oppression by replicating more cloned carbon copies of themselves."
"Breeders,   One day you will regret having kids + your kids will grow up to hate + despise you."
"Society is run by scam artists who want you to be fresh flesh for the meat grinder, hence why they push people to procreate or re-create death."
I forgot to mention imperialists.
"People I dislike: - Theists - Pronatalist Breeders - Sexists, Misogynists, Racists - Pro-Statists - Rapists/Pedophiles - Pro-Lifers"
"Procreation is a death cult poorly disguised as a life cult. As long as you are here, you’re gonna die, everyone conveniently tends to forget that bc they are so busy living in the moment."
"Everyone will screw you over, it’s only a matter of where + when. Everything in life is all about our own self-interest."
"Life is a circus, Full of clowns, That make us frown, I wanna get out of this town, Kill me already, Death is steady, But I cannot wait."
"Existence is pain, It drives you insane, It kills you inside, Breaking you piece by piece, Death is the only source of peace, Constant slavery and sorrow, Melancholy we borrow, From our ancestors, Who screwed us over"
"Breeders are responsible for slavery, mass graves + the genocide of our species. A peaceful dignified death without continuing our progeny should always be an open option to end our existence."
Why did your force me to endure existence? If all it means is suffering + death? Should be the question every child asks their parents. Parents need to be held accountable for the crime of procreation. Breeders are responsible for this mass genocide of humans.
Children are crotch goblins - I don’t understand why people wanna have them.
Breeders are kleptomaniac kidnappers who steal children from the world of nothingness.
My handsome boy!! ❤️
"I agree with a lot of the antiwork subreddit, but another part of me wants to work. That good Islamic hard work ethic was strongly instilled in me."
Everyone (with the exception of antinatalists) is a simp for breeders + breeding in general.   No wonder why we feel so alienated in this work.
"I scored 70% on an assignment worth 40% of my final grade. I’m struggling w the last assignment + my new subject. I hate being a student, it’s tough esp when you’re doing it all on your own. Idk if I’ll pass everything but I’m shocked I passed this when I failed last year."
My brother threatened to stab himself multiple times if I commit suicide :-/ way to try + make me feel guilty if I decide to leave this world bc I’m tired + a failure at this life thing.
Natalism makes me want to self-flagellate.
Isn’t it strange + ironic when pronatalist breeders like antinatalist posts?
I just rung my other best friend + she told me she might have cancer. My friend is a very kind person who is hardworking + always helps people. Life is so cruel if she does have it. She’s the last person on earth to deserve to suffering agonising pain 💔
I have to learn this lesson the hard way. I’m brutally honest + that has caused me to be punished a lot for it in my life. Don’t be too honest.
You will always have a safe space to talk to me I won’t judge you or berate you I’m here to listen non-judgementally. I’ve had many people reach out to me regarding suicide + I did nothing but support them. I’m the last person on earth to judge anyone.
I hope there will be a time when everyone + anyone can talk about antinatalism comfortably without being judged or misinterpreted by people.   Im confident + comfortable talking about AN bc I don’t care what people think. I plan to list my published AN books on my résumé too.
Life is cruel.
"Life is so shitty, yet the cost of living (for an unwanted “gift”) keeps going up. It’s not even worth it."
I’m sick + tired of this life. I really want out. I think my life sentence on this planet has been wayyy too long. It feels like it’s time for me to go.
"My biggest dream in life was to be homeschooled and my parents never let that happen until I reached university age.   I never had interest in uni life - drinking, partying, hooking up, friends etc. I was always the weird autistic, introverted nerd who liked to be alone."
Who here prefers studying via distant learning over a mainstream classroom with a lecturer?   I have completed 2 qualifications via distant learning + am working on my 3rd one currently. I will however be switching to mainstream study next year for my more challenging courses.
"School castrates children when they are young, so they grow up to be corporate cucks when they are older."
"If I don’t succeed in my studies, I will commit suicide, bc I’d rather be upper middle class than poor, struggling to make ends meet from one job to another. I am however going to do my best to succeed + hopefully I make it."
Pain and suffering are the rent we pay to live on this planet.
I highly recommend this book on spirituality and capitalism it’s very eye opening.
Spirituality has been infested with capitalism which makes it nauseating.
"Contrary to popular belief, spirituality was designed to enslave us + keep us fearful so we remain slaves to the system."
"Traditional conservative societies are cruel. They pressure asexual people into arranged marriages + those people are forced to have children bc everybody else is doing it + if they don’t desire children, there’s something wrong with them. We need to break down this stigma."
Indeed!
"When you get pregnant, your body starts to treat the foetus as an unknown parasitic invader - which is what it is essentially. Foetuses are basically like autoimmune diseases. The cells attack themselves + self sabotage."
Love is what fucked you over. Your parents said they brought you here in the name of love. Your lover who broke your heart once loved you The world only loves you bc the meat grinder needs more meat to be processed.
Most people born into this world are pawns in a game of chess none of them consented to even play + this game of chess is rigged as always.
"Life is a waste of time. It’s useless, pointless, meaningless, mediocre, trivial, asinine + painful. By the time you’re done, you will have suffered eternal damnation."
Natalists are selfish assholes.
It takes two people to fuck so you come into existence But for that reason you are eternally fucked for the reason two people fucked. Sorry for the tongue twister with too many f-words.
So I started my new course early + I’m learning all about architectural drawings I’m struggling to understand them + my drawing skills suck. My mother was a draughts person. Hopefully there’s more research + essay writing in this course.
"Enjoying sushi with my brother. He’s broke so I shouted him + wracked me up with an expensive bill. Man he can eat so much. My spiral binding won’t be ready for another couple of hours, it sucks when I have to drive to a place twice for a job that takes 10 minutes :-/"
The world resembles a sewer full of shit.
"I just rung one of my BFFs, she’s moving back to my city in a couple of months!! I’m so excited!! That’s two of my friends coming back. I’m truly blessed."
My therapist was sick yet again today + the hospital didn’t inform me that she was not in. Frustrating I had to drive to the hospital + she wasn’t there. We had so much to talk about she will probably call me tomorrow to reschedule another appointment.
I started looking at my 3rd assignment + I’m almost completely lost + don’t understand it. I printed out my new course work + tomorrow I’ll get it spiral bound. Looking forward to finishing this course early so I can proceed with other courses.
Procreation is the mother of all tragedies bestowed on humankind.   #antinatalism
True equality will only happen on the face of the planet when everyone agrees to stop procreating.
"Next time feminists argue with antinatalists, remember that “it’s all about keeping women barefoot + pregnant” that’s how men keep women enslaved on the plantation called earth."
To truly embrace feminism is to walk away from (biological) motherhood + procreation. Procreation is biological enslavement + it reinforces + gives strength to the patriarchy. To truly embrace feminism one must become an antinatalist.
"Procreation has been made the whole entire centrepiece of our existence, to sustain this we had to create patriarchal systems to keep women enslaved by their flaw of fertility. Procreation thrives on an endless power struggle between men and women."
"Procreation has been rendered obsolete since the industrial revolution. As long as we aren’t all living on farms or plantations, we don’t need children to sustain a civilisation anymore. As we age, wither + die, our civilisation will remain as a reminder of our futile existence."
Abortions + contraception have been around just as old as fertility cults.
"Fertility is a curse. Abortions + contraceptions have been around since the beginning of time. I’m not sure who’s idea it was to create fertility goddesses + cults. Natalism is a curse, even in ancient times."
"You convince people you are valuable by being irreplaceable. If people are too blind to see your value then it’s their loss, not yours."
Tomorrow I need to study hard + then go to my therapy appointment. I have a lot to talk about again. There’s so much I need to get off my chest.
A true successful relationship does not need children as strings to hold two people together.
"I’m proud of the antinatalist fairytale children’s book I wrote. If we can convince children that feeding animals + caring for each other is more important than having kids, we can redefine the whole meaning of existence and society as a whole."
We need to stop associating femininity + womanhood with biological motherhood. We can still have a matriarchy without procreating.
“Life is a gift” is society’s way of gaslighting you about the crime committed against you by forcing you into existence. Society has to gaslight you so you don’t revolt against your parents + other pronatalists endorsing your existence.
"Motherhood is not wholesome, unless the children are adopted. Biological motherhood is psychopathic."
"What’s the point of being a squeaky clean vegan who reuses, recycles + reduces their carbon footprint if you procreate?"
I hate Jordan Peterson.
Abortion doctors are a godsend saviour to unborn crotch goblin parasites.
Foetuses are crotch goblin parasites.
Breeders are a burden on society. Especially the childfree taxpayers.
Smashing the circle of life.
My legacy in life is removing myself from the toxic human gene pool.  #antinatalism
"Religions are a cruel manifestation of nature   Concubines are for hot, dominant alpha males.  Virgins in heaven are for incels that die fighting wars who can’t get concubines."
My religious parents who r prolifers + pronatalist have become antinatalists for the following reasons:  - Cultural Marxism - Rising food/fuel costs/cost of living - Environmental Catastrophes - Rise of a militarised police state - Unemployment Rates/crime - Globalist Agenda
"Most of these men aren’t even half the man my father is, yet I managed to convince my father Antinatalism is the future + he agrees + he’s a religious righteous Muslim who prays 5x times a day.   Long before I became an AN, my father used to criticise couples w too many kids."
I’m don’t defend the rights of misogynistic men bc despite being a daddy’s girl many men in the manosphere feel it is their divine duty to impose motherhood on me.   My father is a religious patriarchal man but he supports my Antinatalism bc he knows how fucked up the world is.
Shaming women for choosing to be childfree for ethical or selfish reasons is misogynistic. A woman deserves the right to be liberated from the burden of fertility without being called a whore of having people be suspicious of her.
"As a woman, one of my biggest pet peeves is men who shame women bc they are childfree, assume they r a whore + hypergamous or looking for a male ATM.  Many women r voluntarily celibate, childfree for ethical reasons + don’t care for any men. Yr money isn’t worth anything to them."
I just got approved to resume my construction course in a week or so. I’m going to try + work extra hard to finish it early so I start working ASAP.
I like that whoremoans. Existence/life is the ultimate whore which needs whoremoans to ensure we pass on our mediocre genes + continue the cruel cycle of existence. Everything begins with a whore.
All the time. It’s hard to constrain myself from it.
Many pagans had very rare artefacts that were stolen by the Catholic Church bc they were for “idolatry”. Indigenous religions have some answers. This is why Rome destroyed them. What I want to know is what is the purpose of us suffering besides being food for the demiurge?
"The Gnostic story of our origin makes the most sense to me than the Abrahamic Adam &amp; Eve mythos. There are a lot of answers we will never know. What Id love to do is raid the Vatican library, bc it probably has answers from the many stolen items from indigenous people w answers."
"Experimentation of consciousness evolution via sentient life creation is cruel + sadistic. As a species, we haven’t accomplished much in the past couple of million years, so I think we should just go extinct. It’s the only way out."
"The Aeons created us as an “experiment” to see how our consciousness evolves, but this is cruel, bc we are suffering for the sake of this conscious evolution.  I wish the aeons would press the escape key on this cruel experiment + just let our consciousness go back to source."
"According to the Gnostics, the Aeons who were inferior Gods created us, but the demiurge controls our universe.   I despise the Aeons for creating us, bc we don’t need to exist. If our purpose in life is just to consume + reproduce then non-existence is always the better option."
"The best thing for me has been to choose a male dominated career pathway less drama, less toxic. I also recommend anything in STEM. Try to get a specialisation in high demand that pays well + do your best to be irreplaceable. It’s the next best thing to working for yourself."
"Some workplaces let their staff have mental health days off, but often times when you’re having an “episode” to safeguard your job or reputation you have to lie + pretend you are physically ill bc your boss just won’t understand."
I got punished + given a verbal warning with a performance improvement plan and there you have it a disability organisation discriminating against a disabled employee. That’s why I decided to leave low wage menial jobs + start working towards something better.
"Another traumatic experience at work I had was with a client’s mother who basically complained to a higher authority bc I didn’t introduce myself to her while she was talking to colleagues. I worked for a disability service, little did I know, I would later be diagnosed w autism."
"It has become a trend to be tolerant + supportive of people with mental health issues only for the sake of PR, brownie points + to avoid looking like a toxic workplace. In reality, nobody really likes the mentally ill + they only will tolerate them if they have no other choice."
We have to sell our beauty to the highest bidder just to procreate. While the potential mates are disposable + replaceable. Nature is cruel - it requires one sex to be weak + submissive to gratify the ego of another that thrives on dominance + the end result is a child suffering.
"Arrogance + ignorance make us forget the reality of our existence that we are live rotting carcasses covered in flesh. Once we remember who/what we are, we realise how disgusting we truely are."
"Shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, aftershave, perfume, cologne, laundry detergent + other personal care products etc just to cover up our rotting stench from these flesh meat suit prisons. We take for granted how much we suck + stink + need these products just to be presentable."
"It’s hard to say you’re for humanity when you advocate Antinatalism + extinction of our species.   I don’t understand secular humanism bc it’s all about being pro-humanity. I don’t like humans at all, I prefer animals over people. I also think this planet is better off w/o us."
"I was born a monotheist.  I left Islam when I was 22.  Most people who leave become secular humanists.  I’ve always been a misanthrope, so I can never be a secular humanist, only a secularist at best."
Humans r flesh sacks of piss + shit. They r the most invasive species on the planet. Nature never fails to remind us everyday how much we stink + suck. Yet we still continue to procreate as if we are shitting roses + pissing gardenias. We are a nasty species but we live in denial
"Never was and never will be, You don’t know how you betrayed me, Somehow I’m not your everybody’s fool.  #lyrics"
"Held hostage by my parents, I’m born into a sick world, With constant pain + suffering, I want it to stop so I can return to the void where peace avails + torment ceases to exist."
"Roses are red, Violets are blue, I never wanna see you, You broke my heart + crushed my soul, There’s no place to ever feel whole, U betrayed my trust + constantly lied, U took me for the greatest ride, Constantly mimicking + conning me, So blinded by love I could not see."
"She cries everyday, Painful existence she says, Tortured and broken inside, There’s no place to hide, Misery and vanity unveil, Melancholy prevails, Until one day she takes a knife, To cut her wrists and take her own life."
Everything in life is all vain.
"This life is vain, It drives you insane, Misery prevails, Pain hails, This life sucks, No one gives two fucks."
"Life is a scam, Everything is a sham, Mostly suffering, misery and pain, Everything in this world is vain.  #antinatalism"
"Antinatalism + abortion are both VOLUNTARY eugenics. Removing yourself from the gene pool has a negative connotation to it, in actual fact it’s actually liberating your offspring from ongoing suffering."

"Why would people feel guilty for having abortions? I don’t understand it. I wouldn’t feel guilty, I wouldn’t even care."
"“My body, my choice” IMHO applies not only to abortion, but to vaccines + anything related to bodily autonomy."
"Pregnancy is the cruelest burden nature has imposed on women + bible thumping patriarchal men want to continue that burden, even when many of these unwanted pregnancies are results of rape or incest. It’s sickening."
"Prolifers aren’t getting rid of abortions, they are only making it harder to obtain a safe abortion in a clinic. People will still take various concoctions + go to alleyways for coat hanger style abortions endangering their lives bc some asshole thinks a foetus is sentient."
"My next true crime story will be about a very gifted high IQ student + heroin addiction. Honestly, listening to this story terrifies me so much of hard drugs, I won’t go anywhere near them."
One of those nights where you’re so tired but you’re cursed with the curse of insomnia.
"When I hear someone has attempted suicide or plans to do it, I instantly feel a connection to them just like in the movie “All The Bright Places” the pain we share together helps us bond in a strange way that people don’t understand."

I want to write more true crime stories on my website from the Middle East. They weren't very popular tho.
"In hard times, economically, there will be more organ trafficking gangs internationally just like there is in Brazil. That is one reason am against procreation, bc during hard times, desperate times calls for desperate measures. If you would like me to do a post on this I will."
"If anyone asks you for organ function tests + you're in an online relationship, please know this is a HUGE RED FLAG and get out of that relationship ASAP."
"Organ function. Days after the sham wedding, she disappeared completely and her parents don't know what happened to her. Apparently, there are gangs that recruit handsome wealthy people to lure women on dating sites for organ trafficking. This also happened in Egypt."
"I want to draw the attention to my followers about the dangers of dating sites particularly in the 3rd world. Recently, there was another case of a woman in Lebanon who was lured by a handsome wealthy man who proposed to her. He gave her USD$4000 to get a medical check-up for her"
I feel sorry for American women who have had their abortion rights stripped away from them. This is a 1st world western country that was supposed to be a beacon for freedom + liberty. Now they are denying people basic human autonomy over their bodies.   #Abortion
Existence is a bundle of misery.
"Children are NOT investments. To call children investments is very dehumanising. It’s the same with Human Resources. We are burdens, not to be resourced."

#Antinatalism is the next step forward in human evolution.
I have listened to a lot of stories on honour killings. Maybe I need to share some of them on my blog since I’m writing true crime stories now.
Just helped my brother set up his new MacBook Pro. Now everyone in the family is an Apple user. It’s insane bc I’ve been using Mac for over 8 years + I don’t know how to use windows now. I hate how Apple keeps users locked in their ecosystem.
Pronatalism is a malignant cancer on this planet.   #antinatalism
"Procreation is the source of every existential, social, economic, population problem we have on earth.  #antinatalism"
"Intellectuals always have something new to teach me, whereas most people are of no use to me bc I can do everything myself + meet most of my own needs. In this day + age most people are misanthropic + have few or no friends. Don’t believe me? Observe the world around you."
"If we have nothing in common, I’ll be polite + cordial, but we will never be friends. I’m only interested in people with a pessimistic worldview, who are creative, intellectual + deep thinkers. Everybody else is meh. I don’t care for them. And I’m not sorry for being so blunt."
"I dislike clingy ppl who can’t read subtle cues that u aren’t interested in being their friend. Being autistic, I’m v direct to the point of offending people, luckily I don’t deal with them, but a few years ago, their daughters felt entitled to my friendship which pissed me off."
"I have a few people I consider v close dear friends to me, whom I love v much. Besides them, I only socialise w immediate family. Recently, my family have been harassed by clingy people who feel entitled to our friendship, luckily dad told mum to drop hints we aren’t interested."
I think I’m going to kms soon. I don’t have any hopes/dreams or desires for the future. I’m sick/tired of my father micromanaging my life. I just want to talk to my mother before I do anything and say goodbye properly. I have other things I need to do and then I think I’m ready.
You will know when you’re ready to die.
Parents who expect their children to be just like them are normal. They want mini-mes + that’s just a mini-me’s job description to be just like their parent(s).
"My father is obsessed with emailing my psychiatrists + other medical professionals behind my back to “intervene” in my life. It makes me feel so frustrated. I hate it when people try to micromanage my life behind my back. Seriously, I just want to die. Nothing else."
"Some people think I have a phobia of pregnancy, I might but not really. I don’t think I would make a good mother + I don’t think my genes are particularly spectacular to the point I need to replicate them.   #antinatalism"
To only consume + reproduce being the prime purpose of our existence is hellish + parasitic.  #antinatalism
A baby is a watermelon sized parasite feeding off your lifeline for sustenance. That is the essence of pregnancy.  #childfree
"I brought my therapist a sensory toy as a gift bc she encouraged me to have a sensory box to self-soothe. She’s been great to me, visited me in hospital more than once when I was admitted. I think we will have a lot to talk about today."
"Today my mother told me that she wants me to find someone bc she doesn’t believe I can live on my own bc of my severe depressive episodes. I told her that I am not interested in relationships, I’ve lived alone twice + I’ll probably commit suicide when she or dad die."
"Happy Not-A-Father’s Day to all gentlemen who are childfree + happy Father’s Day to all adopted/foster fathers, cat dads and plant dads.  #HappyFathersDay #ChildFree #Antinatalism"
Natalists have no mercy on infertile people. The stories I’ve heard about abuse towards childfree couples who can’t conceive is beyond anything imaginable. My mother didn’t conceive until 7 years after marriage + my paternal grandma threatened her with divorce.
Adults are traumatised children stuck in mature bodies. Traumatised man children + women children create a trauma based society that functions toxically. We have so much injustice + inequality in this world bc people give into wishful thinking + procreate.  #antinatalism
Procreation is a major malfunction in our DNA.   #antinatalism
"Sex is degrading + undignified (at least to me it is not judging anyone here). Sex is about power + nothing else the thought of being vulnerable + having someone have power over me is absolutely terrifying. No matter what people say, the novelty of sex always wears off."
Having disposable income + freedom to do what you want without being tied down by your parental responsibilities is the best part of adult life.  #childfree
"In this world children are liabilities, not assets.   #childfree"
Natalism is a brain virus.  #antinatalism
"As a result of being on antidepressants, I’ve become fully asexual. I have no desire whatsoever. Even if my depression was cured tomorrow + I didn’t have to take pills, I would still take them for the sake of remaining asexual just bc of my attachment issues + misanthropy."
"Sex brings more pain than pleasure. It’s not even about pleasure anymore, it’s about suffering, just bc reproduction is the main purpose of having sex. If we had sex purely for pleasure without creating carbon copies of ourselves as a result sex would be an easier pill to digest."
"I have never experienced loss of a loved one before. I’m not sure how I would cope with someone close to me dying. If I’m really close to them + I can’t imagine life without them, I might end my life with the illusion I’ll be reunited with them on the other side."
I just listened to a true crime story about a woman who killed her sister to be with her man who she started an affair with. Everyone involved was arrested except her - she fled to Turkey. It’s scary when there’s killers on the loose + how bad some crimes of passion can be.
"Minimalism is great, but it removes character design from items. I wasn’t conscious of this until I saw a thread here on twitter."
"My first true crime story translated from Arabic to English. ""The Tribal Mother-In-Law""     #cannibalism #mother_in_law #brutal_murder #France #Algeria"
"If I end my life, I’ll never know what it’s like to succeed in society, that’s one thing keeping me going in this miserable life. I want to feel like I’m part of something much bigger."
I’m afraid of failure + uncertainty. I also fear success. One of the main reasons I’m choosing to focus on my future career is so I have something to distract me from my suicidal thoughts + I feel like I’m contributing positively to society. It gives me a sense of purpose in life
Ghosting toxic people is self-care.  #misanthropy
When we resist the urge to procreate + we go against our base instincts we prove just how strong we are. Nothing is worse than following your biological programming + being a slave to your genes.   #antinatalism
"People think I’m strong, but I’m weak maybe I’m stronger than what I give myself credit for, but I have always had a plan in case all fails.   Why I haven’t done it yet? I’m a little bit scared, I’ll miss my family + I’ll never know what surprises life has in store for me."
"This is my suicide kit. I have wanted to do it, but I’m a bit of a coward. Not ready to go just yet."
"I used to hoard some of my brothers medication in my nightstand but I remember throwing it out when I promised myself I wouldn’t kms.   I always have an internal conflict when it comes to suicide, but I’m open and honest about it when people ask."
"Confession:   I sleep with a nitrogen tank + an exit bag under my bed. Knowing if things get really bad, I can always end my life. It gives me a sense of peace.   I ordered the nitrogen tank from a beer brewing company. I also keep a copy handy of the suicide handbook."
I’ve been binge listening to true crime stories in Arabic that r v graphic + brutal murders/cases. I’m thinking of translating the stories in English and publishing them on my blog. I wonder if anyone would be interested in reading them? Crimes seem to differ from place to place.
"Roses are red, And life sucks, But I don’t give two fucks, Kill me already and let me die, Send me to heaven, let me fly, Break their hearts + sell their souls, Determinism screwed us like dolls, Burn the earth and kill all life, Snap my neck with a knife."
Online shopping is so addictive. I need to delete all shopping apps from my phone. I’ve spent way too much money already.
Not a fan of daycare centres either I think anyone who has children should raise them themselves + with little help from anyone outside their family.
I hate the idea of domestic servants. They encourage people to procreate and dump their parental responsibilities onto domestic workers.
"The Arab slave trade is still alive, regardless of what people say. That’s why I love Gaddafi, may he RIP. He said every Libyan house shall serve itself + he prohibited maids from coming to Libya bc he didn’t want problems arising with other countries."
"I watched a documentary abt how maids in the Middle East are treated - it focused on maids from Kenya, Ghana + other parts of Africa. It was disturbing to see how some of these countries stopped sending their citizens to work there yet bribes are given to bypass such restrictions"
"Ruled by the forces of evolution, Antinatalism is the only revolution, Among our futile species of puppets, Bc there’s nothing to find bt nuggets, Of truth the this world is pointless, Our existence is all for nothing, The sooner we realise, we make peace with the angel of death."
"My mother attempted suicide before I was born. My paternal grandmother once said if suicide wasn’t haram she would do it bc life is so pointless. Depression and suicidal thought seem to run in my family, but due to religion and cowardice no one has actually taken their own life."
We are puppets enslaved by the forces of determinism.
"This life is a burden, Procreation is the main sin, Tragedy lingers yet they all sing, Life is good keep on living, Parents bringing me here is unforgiving The futility and pointlessness, Is something I don’t understand, A puppet enslaved by cruel masters, Only cope is laughter"
"Sadness consumes my soul, I rarely feel whole, Melancholy overtakes me, Blues I cannot see, I crave death to be my fate, This world is something I really hate, Uncertainty plagues me, Nothing is as it seems to be, I just want to die + let them see, How pointless this life can be."
"Listening to a suicide story in Arabic on the true crimes channel. Whenever I hear about someone killing themselves I feel motivated to do it. I just can’t stand the uncertainty in life, being alive gives me so much anxiety"
I wish he would take me sooner.
"Why I tried to impregnate my Ex Girlfriend   via @YouTube - the wishful thinking of breeders is so disturbing. How can someone assume just bc poor people have many kids, anyone can do it?"
"Craving disappearance, Into thin air, This life is anything but fair, I want to die, kill me now, My progenitors brought me here, how? Murder me, Let me see.. Make my time go fast, I wish to die forever at last."
"I dread this so called gift, I crave a day adrift, To no longer be here, Back to the void right there.  #promortalism"
Unprotected sex that results in pregnancy is the root of all evil.  #antinatalism
I’d take any wage job over motherhood.
Society fetishises children + pregnant women to the point of victimising + exploiting them in this cruel existence.
Listening to all these tragedy + true crime stories makes me realise how excruciating life is for many people. Breeders impose tragedy on their offspring who are helpless + often unlucky in this life.
Why are children referred to as “gifts” or “blessings” from god? Life is not a gift + children are not a blessing. I don’t say this out of spite for children children are only gifts to sadists who seek to control + indoctrinate them.   #antinatalism
"My fav Arabic true crime channel. He does some stories of drama too, but I love the way he tells stories so well, he gets millions of views and donates money from YT to charity. Most of his stories have a tragic ending to them + some of my family members hate the gory details."
ابو طلال الحمراني - سوالف طريق   via @YouTube
"Apparently pedophiles are brutally beaten in prisons everywhere, even in Arabic countries I was surprised to hear that since there is some pedophilia there."
I can’t sleep well these days so I listen to my favourite true crime Arabic YouTube channel til I fall asleep. I just took 2 quetiapine tablets that hopefully knock me out. I’m deprived of high quality sleep these days.
Just listened to a vile true crime story in Arabic. Nothing is worse than being murdered in a crime of passion brutally tortured by someone infatuated with you. I hope no one ever falls in love with me to the point they can’t let me move on and live my life.
Antinatalists save millions of future potential unborn decedents from suffering. Shout out to all antinatalists!
Why do natalists pressure the childfree to have children? The answer is misery loves company.  #antinatalism
The Education System   #brainwashing #misery
"Teen pregnancies seem to be declining which is always a good thing. The worrying trend is more women are freezing their eggs + we see more geriatric pregnancies on the rise. Women who procreate are immature, insecure + brainwashed by society."
"Contrary to popular belief, the abortion procedure is not as bad as pregnancy + giving birth. Society has been brainwashed into believing abortions are dangerous to coerce pregnant women into giving birth!"
Hell is between our legs for it is where life is created + our species is propagated. To avoid sex or sterilise ourselves is to safeguard future generations from this hell.   #antinatalism
Pregnancy is dangerous for women. Women risking their lives to perpetuate more suffering is idiotic.  #antinatalism
"Human sexuality is a disguise for procreation to propagate our mindless, idiotic species!"
Pregnancy is a curse for every child born.  #antinatalism
The very least men did for women is invent abortions + birth control. It’s the very least they owe us since they are guilty of impregnating us.
"In this world, getting pregnant is a sign of optimism + hope in a pessimistic + hopeless world.  #antinatalism"
Toxic positivity is a cult.
I wish I could press the escape button on my keyboard to escape this hell of a life.  #promortalism
"Life is a scam, Pyramid schemes are shams, Stolen souls from the void, Existence to avoid, Parents dragged us into this hell, Parasitic relationships to get through this hell, Long awaiting an escape, Away from these landscapes."

Memo to myself
#ThrowbackThursday - me wearing a hashmi.
"Society incarcerates us as we r born,  Like circus animals we are torn, Destined to perform, age + die, We take a deep breath and sigh, The world around us is a meat grinder, Ignorance is what makes us blinder, All in plain sight, we live in denial, Constantly going an extra mile"
"Don’t procreate for it harms others, Don’t listen to your mothers, Protect future by bringing no one in, For procreation is a major sin, Crippled by illness and old age, Trapped in this world in a cage, Economic collapse + mass extinction, Knowing it’s wrong is key distinction."
"Gambling with the lives of the unborn, Is normalcy no one scorns, Brought into a world w/o their consent, Escapism persists in the present, One day to be forgotten in the abyss, Nothing to ever be missed, The only hope is to never do it again, To save generations from the insane."
"Born into indentured servitude, Against my consent pursued, My parents gambled with my life, Promising me a better afterlife, Sadness begins to ensue my soul, Desiring no existence to feel whole, Living in this wasteland with no cope, Dying one day is the only hope."
I love watching what's in my bag videos on YT. It's one of my guilty pleasures.
"The best form of revenge is success + that’s what I plan to do.. a successful career, better health + happiness."

All parents are con-artists bc existence is a sham.  #antinatalism
Existence is fraud.  #antinatalism
"Antinatalism is a philosophy of love, Kindness for future generations, Sparing them unnecessary suffering, Nothingness is what's worth discovering, A life without pain is what every soul desires, But having a child results in fires, Flames that last an eternity, With no courtesy."
"Antinatalism is about compassion, Leaving souls in the void of passion,  Refraining from gambling with other people's lives, Enduring the pain of one's own life, Denying one's off-spring future suffering, A philosophy of no imposition,  A life of peace in nothingness."
"Born into 9-5 slavery, Living in a broken economy,  Natural disasters strike every day,  Millions of lives gambled with... But everyone says its okay. The world is collapsing,  It's only a matter of time,  But they don't believe me Til its too late... This is every child's fate."
"Life is overrated, There I said it,  My life was gambled with... By a selfish breeder.  #antinatalism"
"Two breeders decide to have a baby, What disaster my soul tells me, Violating consent and gambling with my life, A life of hardship and constant strife,  Promises of liberation and wishful thoughts, Emptiness awaits and peace after 80 years, Self-fulfilling prophetic fears."
"Forced into a world I hate, Two people f*cked + this is my fate, Slaving away from 9 to 5, Indoctrinated into a hive mind, Struggling to make ends meet, Bent over someone else's feet,  A catastrophic world awaits a near end, The void awaits my resend.  #antinatalism"

"Loneliness plagues my heart, Solitude comforts my soul, Darkness whispers in my ears, Enduring insanity for many years, Long awaited peace I yearn for, This Mother Nature is a whore, For her carnal desires breaks us all, Restlessness to which we fall."
"Break this heart, Curse this soul, A life of desire to be whole. This world is full of madness, Tears, endless cries and sadness. Kidnapped and enslaved to evil, Long we await its upheaval."
"Life is full of pain, Silent moments of rare smiles, Chasing the rat race for miles, Eternally broken seeking solace, Which lies in the voids of nothingness, We used to be happy knowing none of this but our happiness has been stolen. Only to be forgotten."
"Carnal pleasures, Pain and misery, Endless suffering, Life is lame, Existence drives me insane, Stolen from the void, Nothing to enjoy, Satisfaction of my perpetrators, Every parent is a traitor. For everyone dies at the hands of selfish desires."
"Stolen from the void, Life is what I want to avoid, Carnal pleasures lead to tragedy, A clown shit show of lame comedy, I heart death to return home, To avoid mindless zombies that roam, Death to a life full of strife, Desire to end this life And return to the abyss."
Stolen from the void. Every #antinatalist’s worst nightmare.

Honesty is only brutal if people aren’t thick skinned enough to handle it.
Every person on earth comes with millions of strings attached to them + many desires that are difficult to fulfil.   The solution is to not procreate because every problem only exists as long as humans exist.   #antinatalism

My mother wants me to write a second antinatalist book but I don't feel inspired to do so. I wrote the beginning of what will be a book but I haven't written beyond the first part. I honestly don't know if I should do it or not.
#antinatalism is about considering the ethical implications of bringing a child into this world...  But it takes it one step further...  And that is to ask... why your parents needed to create you in the first place.
"In a world of uncertainty... with ecological catastrophes, economic collapses... the only thing left for us to take charge of is our fertility. Don't bring kids into this world, it aint their job to clean up your mess.   #antinatalism"

How many of you know more divorced couples than ones still married? I do   The only marriages in my family that have been successful have all been arranged.   Few love marriages have actually survived enough to succeed.
It is a breath of fresh air when your natalist parents validate + acknowledge antinatalism to be truth even tho they don’t identify as antinatalists but they read so much that they see how degenerate this world is becoming. Antinatalism is sensible choice in a degenerate world.
"My father just acknowledged that while he’s not an antinatalist, the future of humanity will be single childfree ppl who are divorced/never married + more antinatalists bc the future is bleak for everybody. My father reads intensely on so many issues + he’s usually right."

It's funny how I can sell antinatalism to conservative religious men in my life.
"I told my father I gifted a copy of my book to my psychiatrist + he's like ""you aren't gonna gift me a copy"" I said, but the book is controversial... he insisted on a copy + I finally dedicated a copy to him... I doubt my father will become an antinatalist, but its possible."
Do any of your parents refer to you as “investments”? My father does it’s very dehumanising.
"I couldn't care less abt inheritance, but I believe after suffering for no good reason, I deserve at least some compensation for my non-consensual suffering against my will. She + dad cud do whatever they want w money when they are childfree, but instead they use us for nothing."
deny us that is hypocritical. My mother starts talking about slaughtering sheep for charity + basically all the inheritance going back to the poor if Faisal + I are childfree for life. It's a reflection of how toxic religions can be. They are fake + we get nothing in the end.
"will suffer? Then I said, ""I know we aren't the perfect, dream children"" but we should at least be given notice if we aren't gonna inherit anything. The whole house turned into a heated argument about how we have inheritance... then I said, ""your parents gave you inheritance + to"
"nothing + my dad gets angry + says, ""we would never take away your rights to inheritance + you will inherit something""... I told him, I don't believe it, its your money + you're free to do with it what you want, but you forced existence on us + we didn't ask to be born so we..."
"My mother constantly talks about how our family wealth must go to poor people so God grants her entry into heaven. Today after so long of hearing that, I asked her... So does this mean, my brother and I get no inheritance + everything just goes to the poor people? My mum says"
Indeed! #antinatalism
Religious men are hypocrites. They advocate for pro-life ideas when the child isn’t theirs + advocate for abortions when it is their unwanted child that is an inconvenience to them.
Human existence means constantly every step we take forward is a step we take backwards
"“Leading a human life is a full time occupation, to which everyone devotes decades of intense concern.”  #antinatalism #quotes"
"Morning mint tea with my vape yes, I need a change of wallpaper + I’m renovating since this house is almost 20 years old, not double glazed + this room doesn’t get much sunlight."
"Antinatalism is partially a social justice movement for children's rights advocacy... All children should have both a mother + father + a decent childhood/upbringing AND this should be the BARE MINIMUM... Ideally, those who are childfree should be celebrated."
Sexpats + parents who abandon their children should be crucified... seriously.
"Why do sexpat men feel entitled to sex with women in other countries + then they abandon their children like they are trash? It's sickening. People should think before they fuck + not abandon their children or better yet not bring them into this cruel, harsh world."
"Saudis have been Abandoning their Kids Abroad, Now the Children want Ans...   via @YouTube - I have heard the same about sexpat children in the Philippines + other countries. Another reason why I'm an antinatalist."
"“The myth of Sisyphus arises, bc the world fails to meet our demands for meaning.”  #Quote #Nihilism"
“All roads in life lead to nowhere bc the essence of all life is nothingness.”  #antinatalism
I went to the swimming pool today. I did some aqua jogging + swimming. Did about 21 laps (back + forth) of a 25km pool. I got hungry + brought some keto friendly food. I feel exhausted after my swim. I’m planning to go as much as I can but not too much.
“Nothingness has killed itself. Creation is its wound. We are it’s drops of blood.” — Karim Akerma   #antinatalism
Procreation is intrusive on the unborn  #antinatalism
I’m so exhausted I need a long sleep to recharge myself + engage in more self-care so I can finally start doing some reading.
As recommended by @AntinatalNews I got hold of this book. I can’t wait to read it! It got here quite fast! Thanks again to Amanda for recommending this gem!
Anyone want a copy of The Dark Side by Alan Pratt? Please DM me your email address so I can grant you access to the link. I cite/recommend the book in my chapter on futility in my book. The book is no longer in print. I managed to get most of it scanned until my scanner played up
I have had suicidal depression since I was a kid. I definitely didn't let myself go intentionally...
"ECT is a high risk for me due to my weight (I'm at risk of dying, and I'm not exaggerating)... while Idgaf if I die, my death will impact many people around me. I don't want to scare my family anymore, hence why I'm postponing it until I get healthier."
"Meanwhile, since getting ECT, I brought a new handbag, I went to the library, I cleaned up my bedroom a bit + I feel a bit more lively. I probably will spend time engaging in my hobbies + reviewing my study a little bit. Rest of my focus will b on getting healthier for next ECT."
"I will spend the next month fasting + going to the swimming pool to try + lose weight so I will be in better shape for my next ECT which will probably be a month from now. My parents think my ""broken teeth"" were a sign that I should postpone the treatment + I agree."
"Meanwhile, I have been scanning Alan Pratt's book on futility + I will upload a copy on my blog, as per request by someone who has read a copy of my book since I have cited the book multiple times and it is out of print."
"I am going to be postponing my ECT for about one month due to reasons I will explain in an upcoming post about my experience with ECT. This was made as a decision by my family who were concerned for my wellbeing. According to em, I have ""improved"" quite a lot but I need some rest"
One of the best snack foods ever!!
To be used + abused by severely mentally ill ppl. I feel so much happier just engaging with likeminded people + other autistic people. I’ve come to enjoy the company of this one person in particular but I still need to work on becoming a better version of myself.
"I have come to realise now more than ever, that I am not as mentally ill as I have been misled to believe. I only dated mentally ill people bc I found them intellectually stimulating + interesting. I can’t date normies bc I’m not part of their neurotypical world. I set myself up"
"There has been an increase in youth armed robberies in my country, robbing jewellery stores, electronic retailers + other luxury stores, as an economist, my dad anticipates most of these big cities where this is happening will turn into ghost towns. I might do a post on it."
The new mars bar with raspberry tastes amazing.
"My brother’s friend complimented me on my LV handbag the other day + she had an LV wallet which I liked. You can still have a kind heart, be simple + loving = yet still appreciate luxury or fine made goods with the best craftsmanship."
"My next expensive purchase will probably be my Rolex, once I start working again. I already wear a Swiss army watch everyday which I absolutely love. I am more sentimental than I am materialistic, but I still appreciate some finer luxuries in life."
I’m going to not buy anymore designer bags. I like designer items but not excessively as some people. I have yet to find a designer wallet that can hold over 30 cards! That’s about the number of cards I have. My go-to bag for now is my Michael Kors which I got secondhand.
Meanwhile my cat noticed I was distressed + he came to console me. I love cats so much ❤️❤️❤️.
I told my psychiatrist I would hv rather run out of oxygen + died trying to save a tooth than chip a tooth + still live. I booked an appointment w my dentist to fix it up. It never ceases to amaze me how doctors are brainwashed into believing saving lives is a “good thing” lol.
"Parent 1 is probably my father + Parent 2 is my mother. It’s possible they could be the other way around. Not sure who likely to be Levant. My mother is mistaken for Syrian. My father claims to have Syrian ancestry, but he’s indigenous."
"Ancestry DNA just sent me my parent ethnicity estimate. Gosh, all I can say is it confirms how Arabised I am. Hardly any Arab DNA."
I bumped into a friend in the hospital + gave him my vape juice bc I didn’t like the flavour very much. He was very appreciative.
"Just did ECT + they broke my tooth my oxygen levels were dropping. They will compensate me for dental treatment I’m kind of annoyed, I feel a bit of nerve pain. I don’t remember anything at the moment. I’m a bit hazy."
"The world is shifting towards antinatalism whether they like it or not, involuntarily... as more women r educated they delay having children, sperm counts continue to decline in the West especially bc of BPA in plastics. Generations of women on birth control struggle to conceive."
Procreation is primitive + archaic. Breeders will either be forced to change due to external circumstances or be unfortunately burdened with bundle of misery. Evolution has taught us to either adapt or be left behind. #antinatalism
#Antinatalism is my legacy + purpose in life.
"I made friends with a guy I met in hospital who was also having ECT done. I pray to God, I see him tomorrow. I brought 3 vape flavours that are too strong for me nicotine wise + I’m hoping to give them to him. If I don’t see him, I’ll just text another guy + drop them off to him."
"The weather is triggering my depression + feelings of melancholy. On one hand I haven’t slept for 24 hours + I feel amazing. My ECT seems to be working okay, but on the other hand I still feel a bit depressed. I hate the emotional cocktails life hands me."
Amen! 🤲🏼
"It’s only just now starting to sink into my psyche just how little time I have for my hobbies, activities + reading lists + travel plans due to me having to resume my studies."
"Our culture needs to stop shaming women into motherhood, w the exception of fostered or adopted mothers, most mothers are selfish or have selfish underlying motives for procreation. Women who use their evolutionary instincts to serve humanity should be made positive examples of."
"Many of you may hv seen the hashtag #RIPShireenAbuAkleh I wanted to mention Shireen was unmarried, childfree, survivor of 2 attempts on her life by IDF + she also opened her home to poor Palestinians in need. She’s an inspiration to CF women who love their respective countries."
"#Antinatalists r writing history as we speak. The minute we win the right to have respect for the unborn (to be left alone) + this becomes a social norm (the hard part), the less ppl there will be to suffer + pay d price. Eventually AN will win bc its basic common sense + logic."
"We show respect to the dead,  We show respect to the elderly, We show respect to our parents, We show respect to religious leaders,  But EVERY BREEDER COMMITS A SIN AGAINST THE UNBORN, CALLOUSLY W BLATANT DISRESPECT + DISREGARD FOR THEIR RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE.  #antinatalism"

"I never got into skincare products until my cousin pointed out her fear of ageing to me. I started buying high-end skincare products when I was 26. I know I'm going to age + ageing is inevitable + I accept that, but it's also part of self-care/self-love."
"I remember being praised for wearing makeup by my colleagues who also wear makeup. I gave em a challenge to try + leave the house w/o makeup + they couldn't do it, due to self-consciousness + insecurity. This is y I hate the beauty industry bc it thrives on people's insecurities."
"Maybe I should do a blogpost about makeup. I believe in makeup to help boost self-esteem + confidence, to enhance pre-existing beauty but not for the sake of deceiving people + changing one’s entire appearance with hardcore contouring."
"My makeup collection most of this stuff I didn’t buy, it was given to me as part of a skincare promotion. I leave barefaced, but when I do wear makeup it’s for special occasions or to boost my confidence. Eyeliner, mascara, lippy + concealer r as far as I go for a natural look."

"In many cultures, elephants are considered good luck!! I gifted a friend an elephant bracelet + she told me this. I also gifted another friend an elephant keychain plushie. I love elephants, they are adorable 🥰."
All high end cosmetics I got for free. I never have to buy lipstick or mascara ever again. My mother always taught me to buy things I need with free gifts. I religiously adhere to my skincare routines which offer free gifts. The only makeup I buy is concealer/eyeliner.
"I want to post a picture of my makeup collection. 90% of the time I don’t wear makeup, but when I do I automatically get more compliments. I rarely buy makeup bc I keep my look simple/natural. Much of my makeup is given to me for free bc I buy skincare products with free gifts."
"I found my light box so I can upload more pictures to Instagram. It was strenuous finding it, but now I can update regularly/semi regularly there. I might post some books on there. It can be a second visual blog for me."
"The best investment in life is in knowledge bc no one can steal knowledge from you. The second best investment is in your health bc health is wealth. The third best investments are real estate, land + precious metals. Everything else is kind of bullshit with some exceptions!"
Just posted a photo
"I’m trying to find my light box. I want to update my Instagram which I haven’t updated until today. Sharing a part of myself with my followers is nice, bc they get to see the human side of me behind these tweets."
"How many of you have a sentimental box full of cards, letters, photos + gifts people have given you over the years? I got the idea from Jenna Marbles, but I’ve always had a sentimental box bc I consider myself a sentimental person."
"Antinatalism is common sense - it is part of the “no harm, no injury” philosophy. When something is in harm’s way, injuries are inevitable. Hence, why #antinatalism is common sense. Non-existence doesn’t harm anybody."
"Pessimism is realism. To be pessimistic in life is to be in touch with reality. To be realistic, is to have common sense. To be in an ivory tower + overly idealistic, is to be optimistic + to hope for the best case scenario."

"I'm not in a rush to find love, I value companionship much more. I'm happy to have moved on from my past toxic relationship. This inspires me to work hard on myself + be my best version to see if this works out."
"I think I might have met someone. We have a lot in common - we are both on the spectrum, irreligious, antinatalists + love cats. He's a PhD student. We will stay in touch, I will try to finish my construction qualification + maybe meet IRL. If it works out, I'll sponsor his VISA."
A tribute to Shireen Abu Akleh   #RIP
"I hope ECT helps me + eventually more people work up the courage to try it, if it helps them. I definitely will be writing a detailed post about it next week once I've had 2 sessions without the lamotrigine."
"Dating sites hv never served a purpose for me to find love. Contrarily, I've made platonic friendships on there + somehow as a result, those people have come across my work on antinatalism or my blog which has influenced the way they see the world. Gosh, I feel like a missionary."
"If someone likes the Azan, the next best thing is to find them a person who does Quran recitation - my favourite is Abdulbasit Abdul-Samad. Of course there’s many more. In my biased opinion, Egypt has the best Quran reciters."
"My brother’s friend who I met today told me she brought an Azan clock bc she loved the call to prayer so much. She’s not Muslim, but likes all religions + I found it interesting. Some non-Muslims hate the Azan + some love it. It’s a strange dichotomy."
Indigenous Christians + Jews are anti-Zionism + anti-apartheid. We put aside our religious differences + learn to love/appreciate indigenous people as one. The land is sacred to us + we will give our blood/life for freedom.
"I rarely tweet abt politics here bc my views are unpopular opinions, but indigenous Christians + Jews in the Mid East represent our diversity. Altho we r arabised + Islamised we still care about our roots + we share common goals. I feel closer to arabised Christians than Muslims."
You were one of the best journalists I ever came across on TV. I remember watching you as a kid. Your legacy lives on forever.   #RIPShireenAbuAkleh
"Coming from a Muslim family, I have always had a special love for our Christian minorities bc they are patriotic, indigenous + their presence represents the tolerance we once had before Islamists taking over. I will always stand by Christians in the Middle East."
"I was devastated to find out #ShireenAbuAkleh was murdered by an IDF sniper. I’m not a fan of Al-Jazeera, I grew up w her reporting news from Palestine. She is an example of Christians who thrive in the MENA. I hope she’ll b buried where she belongs + her legacy will carry on."
"I like supporting the local small businesses. They make a huge difference in the world, to name a few I like artisan candle makers + soap makers. I’ve tried candle making myself + I enjoy it. Soap making is a bit more challenging but it’s a good business venture."
"My brother and I met up with an old friend for lunch at a cafe. She wants to start up a social enterprise for mentally ill people. My brother + I fully support that. Mental illness is tough, it’s good to be financially independent running your own small business enterprise."
"I used to feel sad when I saw neurotypicals ahead of me in life who have their shit together. I realise now I must be more compassionate + kinder to myself. Life in a neurotypical world is tough, so the fact I’ve made it this far tells me I’m stronger than many people."
"You look forward to imposing death + needless suffering on a sentient being for your own sick, sadistic pleasure, knowing exactly what coming into existence entails.   #antinatalism"
My autism + short comings have been blessings in disguise. They stopped me from dating/breeding. They stopped me from tying myself down with a corporate job I hate + they made me more aware about the world. It’s great to be out of this rat race.
Becoming an antinatalist was the best thing in life that ever happened to me.
Antinatalism - A Handbook by Karim Akerma NOW IN ENGLISH!   via @YouTube - I just ordered the book from @Amazon I’m excited to read this antinatalist handbook!!
Happy Friday the 13th
"I just finished my ECT. Doc told me I have to stop the lamotrigine to get more effective results. I feel a bit weak + hazy. Can’t wait to go home soon. I bumped into a patient I made friends with in the ward while I was there, he had ECT done too - said it gave him mental clarity"
"One of my acquaintances has done it all I don’t know how she managed to juggle motherhood + a corporate job at the same time with a business, mortgage + a marriage. I’m happy for her but unfortunately she turned out to be a breeder."
"I just finished my ECT, I woke up confused with low oxygen levels. The doctor said after 4 sessions, I should feel better. I’m not so sure tbh. I’ll wait it out and see tho. Can’t wait to go home."
I’m in the waiting room waiting for my ECT + the nurse just informed me that an inpatient before me is having it done. I’m wondering whether she’s having it done consensually or against their will. Apparently it’s legal in my country to give people ECT against their will.
The downside of ECT is it gives you confidence to commit suicide especially knowing how extreme it can be compared to most treatment options.
"I’m thinking about suicide again. I know I’m doing ECT, + I’ve had 2 sessions so far, but I still have a lot of contempt for life + existence. I hate it so much. I want a way out. I can say after ECT I’ve tried almost everything but I still hate life so much."
"Happy Belated Mother’s Day. I’d rather have not been born, but if I have to be a mother, it’s a mother only to my cat."
"I am grateful to God for liberating me from so many troubles, the first being people from my past who hurt me. I’m also grateful to be in recovery w my ECT journey + psychotherapy slowly easing back into school + the workforce. The only person I aspire to be better than is myself"
"When your ex moves on + you never see or hear from them again - it means you’re finally liberated from their presence. Best feeling ever. When someone cuts you out of their life + comes back, that’s one more burden to deal with on top of life’s troubles."
Binge watching my fav Mexican soap opera don’t feel like sleeping at all.
My charms from my bracelet. I am waiting on one more which is a puzzle piece to signify my autism. These are pretty much all my favourite symbols.
"People who oppose contraception + abortion or anything else that restricts reproduction are fascists trying to punish people for having a normal, healthy sex drive."
This world is like an open sewer + breeders flush their children down the toilet called “existence”.   #antinatalism
Using a serum for your skin makes a huge difference.
Antinatalists are not life scripters. Antinatalists are non-conformists.
"Are any of your parents on Twitter?   My dad is, but we don’t follow or read each other’s tweets. He tweets mostly journalists in Arabic with his commentaries."
"I have been more determined to lose weight since I started my ECT. I did a 41 hour fast which I was forced to break due to my mother insisting I eat something before my next treatment. I have so much weight to lose, but I feel good so far."
"I just found out my psychiatrist has been moved to a different team + I’ll no longer be seeing him. I feel really frustrated bc I have been w him for a year + it’s hard to find someone I can get used to. I hope I get the psychiatrist who is doing my ECT, but there’s no guarantee."
"I just remembered the dose of my ECT was increased, that’s why I felt confused + a little distressed when I woke up. Not sure if they will increase it more next time."
ECT is the price I have to pay so I don’t kill myself + push myself to stay alive in a world I totally despise + hate.
I just woke up from my ECT and I’m so confused I was ready to rip my drip off until the nurse stopped me. I didn’t know where I was + it took longer than the first time. I feel better after that coffee + sandwich tho. I can go home in an hour’s time.
Going for my next ECT in another hour. I’m still half asleep bc they do it so early in the morning. Hopefully it goes well.
Indeed! Preach!
I am happy + grateful for the good people in my life. I’m grateful to my followers as well.   #gratitude
"If people have to walk on eggshells when they interact with you + their intentions are nothing but pure, you’re the one with the problem. If somebody has to change their entire world philosophy bc what they believe triggers you, then you’re the one at fault not them!"
Be careful what you say to people or say about them. Don’t say anything if you have nothing nice to say. Keep your mouth shut. Harsh words are forever remembered + they hurt. Not everyone will necessarily forgive or forget them. Be a decent human being is all I’m saying.
"Dear Pronatalists,  Please read r/regretfulparents + look at your future + the future of your children.   Sincerely,  A concerned antinatalist"
"r/regretfulparents - an interesting place to read testimonies from parents who regret having their kids. There’s a recent post on there about a parent who regrets having their autistic child. It’s sad, but very eyeopening. Worth checking out."
I love these playing cards so much bc they have different cat breeds on them along with the history + origin of the cats. I’m a sucker for anything cat related 😻😻😻.
My friend @Logoletta is raising funds for Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Please check out her Instagram + Etsy shop to support her with her noble projects.
"I was terrified of getting ECT, I was scared I would bite my tongue or lip but it went so well for me. I used to think it was an archaic torture method for people, but it’s a great treatment option for people who have suicidal depression. It’s good to give things a chance."
Human children are born vulnerable + weak. Yet we are the most destructive species on earth. Animals are born to fend for themselves but they live in harmony with nature.
Children pay a heavy price for their cuteness and that is existence + all the suffering that comes with it.
Everyday I give thanks to god that I’m not in a relationship or married. Nothing is better than being a free bird.
Depression is the worst bitch anyone can ever fight. Depression is an inevitable part of the human condition. Suffering on the inside makes people feel invisible + alone. Few people understand this.
"Abortion is not about murder, but it is about returning someone mercifully back into the void to prevent their future needless suffering."
Orphans are treated poorly like the scum of society. Who we should be treating badly are those who forced them into existence.   #antinatalism
"I received a hate comment from someone on buying my bag. Firstly, I don’t spend much money, secondly, I enjoy luxuries - my vacuum cleaner was over $1000. My next plan is to buy a $10k Rolex watch once I graduate + start working. I also invested a lot of money in 22kt gold."
My first Louis Vuitton bag arrived today + I’m absolutely in love 😍. I hope my parents don’t know it’s expensive otherwise they’ll kill me for spending $3k on a bag. I also had a wonderful day today ECT seems to be helping me. I made soup + started an art project. I feel good.

Music to my ears from my Mexican friend I introduced antinatalism to. I’m so happy that more people becoming antinatalists.
There’s something so satisfying about doing word searches. It brings back so much childhood nostalgia. I brought my tablet + hard drive thinking I’d be bored but this is a great pass time activity which gives me a break from screens.
My next ECT is this Friday I can’t drive for 24 hours bc of the anaesthetic :-/ but hopefully I’ll be able to go out tomorrow.
"I just finished my ECT. They anticipated I might have complications due to my weight. They were worried I’d stop breathing. Unfortunately, I’m still alive + well. I have a headache + feel lightheaded but other than that no complaints."
Definitely. We are expected to take extra shifts + give up our holidays for breeders + this is taken for granted.
"Antinatalism is the best thing that ever happened to me. It liberated me from so many unwanted burdens. Thank you, antinatalism."
Stories from my mother:   Childfree couples have breeders hide their kids from them.   Mothers who give birth to daughters are also ostracised + mothers who have sons hide their sons from them.  Women lie about their husband’s infertility to protect his fragile masculinity.
Childfree should not be a taboo. Being single or in a relationship with no kids should be normalised. Breeders who abuse childfree people should be ostracised + called out for their callous behaviour.
"Being childfree is still taboo in the Middle East + Asia where society is focused on children. Infertile people are treated terribly + ostracised by breeders bc they are childless. Breeders are very cruel, my mother told me they will hide their kids from childfree couples too."
I prefer materialistic people who are childfree + focused on living the “good life” than breeders. My parents were well off before they had kids. I feel like my brother and I ruined their childfree lifestyle. Unfortunately childfree lifestyle is still taboo in some countries.
"I still haven’t received the brand new purse yet, but hopefully having something expensive will motivate me to work hard + achieve some thing in my life. Celebrating what I accomplished even tho it doesn’t feel like much is a good thing. I still haven’t told anyone abt the purse."
I know I have never really been materialistic but I brought a Louis Vuitton purse as a gift to myself. I promise I won’t splurge any of my money on materialistic stuff. I have been shopping like crazy these past few weeks. Insane. I hope I don’t get addicted to designer products.
Tomorrow is my first day of ECT. I hope they overdose me with anaesthetic + I die peacefully in my sleep. Hopefully it goes well.
"According to a study conducted by the Helen Clark Foundation, in NZ, there is a high rate of suicide amongst pregnant + postnatal women. This is very eyeopening bc pregnancy causes mental health issues. Pregnancy is high risk + hazardous."

"Children will only have problems as long as they exist. No children = no problems, no worries + no harm. Even parents with the best of intentions fail to recognise this."
"Some parents will sell their gold or estate to fund their children's education. Some parents will work long hours to put their children into private schools. They do this all bc ""they hv their children's best interests at heart""... unfortunately they fail to c the problem is life"
Children ALWAYS pay for the mistakes of their ancestors.  #antinatalism
"Life can be beautiful... but for one beautiful image, there are a thousand tragedies that lie behind it."
"The people who foot the bill for your carelessness, lack of conscientiousness + lack of foresight are the children. Always. No exceptions."
Procreation = Dragging a person into an open fire or taking them to a hazardous place + then leaving them to fend for themselves right after you pass away to leave them alone in this world to suffer + die for nothing.   #antinatalism
My main concern with natalists is how they are okay with imposing life on others.   #antinatalism
"Everybody knows life is a constant struggle BUT the question remains... ARE U GONNA FORCE THIS CONSTANT STRUGGLE ON SOMEBODY ELSE? If so, why is it ethical to do so? If not, why is it unethical? This is the most important question everybody should ask themselves.   #antinatalism"
Definitely.
"I commend you for not reproducing, it’s a noble + honourable decision even if you missed your chance. I wish you the best in life too."
What I’m saying is it is wrong to impose misery on children without their consent by gambling with their lives. We can still be positive optimists + be ethical about reproduction.
"I agree with you partially. However, every tragedy feels like it lasts an eternity in comparison to a quick dopamine hit. What I’m trying to say is imposing that on people without their consent + gambling with their lives is wrong."
"Procreation = Gambling, Suffering + Imposition.  We gamble with other peoples lives + impose suffering on them.   All #antinatalism is saying is doing that is wrong. That’s it. There’s nothing cringy or irrational about that."
"From my experience the best gifts are handmade but for other ideas, soaps, candles, mugs, fridge magnets + handmade creams are the best gifts bc people universally appreciate them + they require less effort (in terms of putting thought into them)."
I love supporting small artisan businesses bc they always appreciate the support + usually they give nice gift samples with their products. I recently brought some handmade soap + got some free samples. Soap is one of the best gifts to give people.
I have so many skincare products I honestly don’t know what to do with them. I will probably use up all my samples + then move onto the full sized containers. I have so many sample sizes bc I buy more than one product to be eligible for a gift. I’m a sucker for free stuff.
Sleeping with my cat is one of my greatest pleasures in life. Sometimes I have to bribe him with treats. I don’t mind his snoring either. He makes me so happy 😀
It’s very hard for me to believe in a religion. Sometimes I envy those who can simply believe.
Often many of us from other countries are ignorant + assume by default Hindi is the national language in India when India has 22 official languages + thousands of dialects. I guess the only language to unify people is English alongside their respective mother tongue.
"It’s interesting to see the tweets from my Indian followers about Hindi being used to replace other local languages. In a sense it’s a form of imperialism, especially if those people are of different races with their own local culture + historical identity."
"I guess maybe it’s exciting for some to have sex during times of danger, maybe it’s a cheap dopamine rush. Maybe it’s a good way to relieve stress, but still who wants to get pregnant + have a home birth when the grid is down?"
"In survival mode, people breed like rabbits especially in war zones or during famines It’s a natural phenomenon encoded in our DNA. That aside, it makes me wonder why someone would get horny while they are in danger? The last thing on my mind would be having sex."
"We need to stop fetishising children. If we don’t have children, we have no future. No future doesn’t hurt anybody, but it protects unborn generations from pain, trauma + tragedy that life brings."
"Natalists are preoccupied with the cuteness of children to the point of fetishisation. They aren’t conscious about imposition, gambling with someone else’s life or the current state of the world. They are so out of touch with reality, you’d think it’s raining treasures everyday."
"Experiencing the vast beauty of the universe + nature does not equate the trauma + ugliness of the human experience. I would prefer remaining in the void for eternity than to experience suffering, anguish + pain that is inevitable in existence.   #antinatalism"
I miss Jalil + his tweets. Luckily we still follow each other on Instagram.
"Poor farmers in India + Bangladesh who are debt ridden drink commit suicide by drinking weed killer. There are tonnes of cases of suicide every single day by people with various disorders, debts or other problems I wonder how beautiful the universe is to those people."
When you don’t fear death or “being forgotten” you become invincible.
"I know I live in a dangerous world. I feel danger constantly all around me. I have never felt safe, that’s why I prepare for the worst. The best form of preparation for the worst is not breeding. People know they’re in danger, yet they still breed. It makes no sense at all."
"What does it take for people to stop breeding? In times of famine, war + physical danger I worry about the future, but here are these breeders getting it on + creating more needless suffering. The whole situation perplexes me."
Life is going to become more hellish as the middle class cease to exist + we live in “generation high rent” the whole fabric of society is going to be dismantled completely. It’s only a matter of time til this happens everywhere. Yet people still breed mindlessly.
"Robberies continue in my country. Gucci + Louis Vuitton were robbed, as well as shops that sell gold + electronic goods. All robberies are happening in stolen cars, by youngsters under the age of 20 at 1 am. This trend will continue as poverty continues to rise. Life is hell."
Existence is a curse!
"We are on the verge of a food crisis, all this + people are still having kids.   #antinatalism"
"A healthy skincare regimen is far more important than makeup. Makeup clogs your pores + sometimes your face can’t breathe. Unless it boosts your confidence + enhances your appearance, less is always more. Natural makeup is extremely underrated."
Am I the only addicted to buying travel accessories + miniature items? They are so handy + so cute.
"I think I met someone on the Hiki app. So far I’ve convinced him that procreation is wrong. We have so much in common - both diagnosed with autism 2 years ago, never held down a job more than 2 years, easily bored, similar interests. I think we will be good friends."
Why do so many people want to have children? For me that’s a relationship dealbreaker. I don’t care how desirable the person may be.
"Some people should lose their right to procreate. Ideally everyone shouldn’t procreate, but some people are far worse breeders than your average joe. Procreation shouldn’t be a right for anyone."
"What disturbs me the most about some criminals is how they are entitled to conjugal visits + they go on to procreate while being in prison. It’s so disturbing to me, especially considering how many criminals are former trauma + child abuse survivors."
"The Elizabeth Arden green tea + white tea body lotion + perfume is so underrated. I’m normally not a fan of cheap perfume, but something that smells fresh right after a bath or shower is awesome 🤩."
I just had a good conversation with an online friend. She told me she agrees with my AN views + she's also childfree. I'm so happy when I meet people who are older than me + they share the same sentiments about life + this world.
"My shopping addiction is getting the best of me yesterday I brought skincare products, today I indulged in some online shopping + got myself a teddy bear. I brought other items in between too. I also ordered a glass heat resistant mug. I must be so bored I need the escapism."
"I have a hard time choosing gifts for my girlfriend, so I got her a unicorn mug with a matching coaster, a handbag, a keychain with her initial on it, some artisan handmade soap + an Elizabeth Arden bag. I hope she will like it. Some people are hard to shop for."
Parents are wolves in sheep’s clothing.   #antinatalism
"Our parents are gods, they sell us to the devil (existence) + we are sacrificed mercilessly to return to nothingness.   #antinatalism"
I think I just converted someone to antinatalism on an autistic dating/friendship app. He asked me what my book was about + briefly researched AN + he agrees with me. Wow I will keep preaching AN til the day I die.
Suffering is what makes you human.
The greatest form of love + nobility is refraining from the original sin of procreation.  #antinatalism
"Once you’re captured into existence, you’re held hostage by your parents, a merciless society + existence itself.  #antinatalism"
Constant needs that need to be satiated makes life inconvenient.  #antinatalism
Boredom is the centrepiece of the human condition.   #antinatalism
The best resolution for #EarthDay2022 is to have no more kids. Procreation is the worst way thing anyone can do to the earth no matter what they tell you.   #antinatalism
One of my school bullies became a serial fraudster - she ended up going to prison + getting sentenced to home detention and community service for trying to steal money from the tax department. My parents say it’s karma for making my life at school miserable.
"I think we should talk about inflation, price hikes + food/water shortages more often. #antinatalism is the only solution to these problems + we need more people talking about these problems so we can start working towards the solution."
"Your feeling is not far off, first the pandemic, now this. It’s a war between billionaires + your average joe. The world is a stage + everything is a big joke. An eventual collapse will lead to social unrest worldwide."
Poorest hit harder by inflation with benefit hikes now linked to average wage |     #antinatalism
Indeed!
Wow yet people breed mindlessly. I wouldn’t know how to survive at this rate.
Convenient stores are robbed everyday bc they sell cigarettes. It costs about $31.50 for a 20 pack of cigarettes + the govt continues to tax smokers heavily despite their shorter lifespan. Most convenient store owners are Indians - it’s already a dangerous job for them.
The world’s future is like the hunger games. 1st world countries will become the new 3rd world. I talked about food + water shortages in my AN book. I wish more people would decide to not have children for environmental reasons.
In my country teenagers are robbing jewellery stores + terrorising the Indians who run them. It’s so sad. Robberies + theft will only continue + police will do nothing to stop it. Safety in big cities will also be a thing of the past.
"Food prices are high my frozen berries were $10.50, now they are $16.50. Toilet paper was $9.50 now it’s $16.50 for 24 rolls. Petrol is about $2.55 a litre and everything else is going up. Life is becoming more expensive + it’s only gonna get worse."
"High Inflation should equal less people breeding, but unfortunately everyone keeps breeding like there’s no tomorrow.   #childfree #antinatalism"
"Happy Birthday to @oliveratlantis hope you have a wonderful day with your loved ones + wish you years of happiness, good health + prosperity ahead."
"According to the news, we are having a cost of living crisis with high fuel + food prices people cannot afford all this and people still breed children they cannot afford.   #antinatalism"
This world is a stage. The puppeteers are our genetics + the powers that believe they be and we are the puppets ruled over by the god of determinism.
The circle of life leads to nowhere.
Sexistential crisis... that is the genetic code that rules over everybody.
Forced to consume mindlessly or die starving.
To be human is to dehumanise others.
Everyone is full of repressed trauma... life traumatises people + the world is ruled by a PTSD type of system.
Life is an inefficient system poorly managed by mother nature.
Life is a circus... the 1% are the ringleaders + everybody else is a clown or performance animal forced into acrobatics.
I have been listening to a lot of true crime stories that are about munchausen + munchausen by proxy. It’s fascinating what people will do for attention. I’ve only ever faked an illness to get out of doing something I didn’t want to do.
"I made a new friend on the Hiki app. She’s a writer too. I shared my antinatalist book with her. She didn’t have a comment, but every time I tell people I wrote a book, they always ask what it’s about and it’s a good conversation starter on antinatalism."
"I find the Sanskrit script very beautiful to gaze at. All ancient languages have beautiful scripts. Although I don’t understand what they say, I appreciate them."
"This world only offers suffering, cruelty + meaninglessness.  #antinatalism"
Too many millennials are SJWs.
I miss SarahJo. I haven’t seen her account for over a year :( hope she’s doing okay.
Misanthropy is a defence mechanism against predatory people who dominate this world.
"We aren’t compensated for our suffering the only prize for suffering is death, back to the non-existent void of where we came from."
"Meaningless suffering is the catalyst for being #antinatalist. We suffering for nothing except to die later on. Religious people use non-sense to justify suffering, but most suffering cannot be justified by all means. Suffering is the main ingredient in this whole life game."
Suffering is the main ingredient in this life “experiment” everything else is subjective.
Life is an inefficient system that runs on the fuel of suffering.   #antinatalism
I like the Hiki app. It’s a dating/friendship app for people with autism. I’m mainly interested in the friendship aspect of it. Sometimes you end up finding friends on dating apps. I do get lonely sometimes with my reclusive lifestyle. I’m looking to slowly change my lifestyle.
"I will do a blogpost on my ECT journey for my followers, so if it works out maybe others can try it. Hopefully it helps someone."
Next month I start ECT treatment for my mental health. If it doesn’t work out I can say I’ve tried everything + nothing has worked + then I can commit suicide. I have been signed up for 6 sessions so far. I might need to have 12. Hopefully they go okay + I don’t suffer too much.

Slavery is a 100% hereditary.   #antinatalism

"I have been tweeting about how terrible men can be, women can be worse when it comes to procreation - sperm jacking, lying about being on birth control, paternity fraud it’s best not to take any risks, especially with a child’s life. Everyone is guilty until proven innocent."
"Ladies don’t trust anyone to father your child. Gentlemen don’t trust any woman to mother your child. Beneath human nature is vile, selfishness + a hidden desire to enslave. Treat everyone like an enemy + leave your children trapped in the void. Trust me it’s for the best."
"Life is all about betrayal. Your parents betray you, so do your educators, other peers + spouse. Everyone will betray you someday. The first act of betrayal is your conception + coming into existence. Few people understand this.   #antinatalism"
"I’m not stupid enough to trust some mindless asshole to put a baby in me. I’m too misanthropic for that. What if he leaves, dies or let’s me down somehow? Im supposed to trust this fool I supposedly love with gambling with someone else’s life?  #antinatalism"

Refraining from procreation is decolonisation of the earth from our parasitic species.   #antinatalism
We are born to extort money from others + continuously exploit + massively consume. What a tedious + parasitic way to live.
"When you procreate, you disturb the unborn, the planet + all other inhabitants on earth. To achieve any kind of peace is to refrain from disturbance in the first place.   #antinatalism"
Procreation always leads to a disturbance of the peace.   #antinatalism

Suffering is a 100% preventable.   #antinatalism
"My brother thinks I should carry on living so I can meet someone + have a career earning six-figures I’d rather be dead. I’m too misanthropic to date + my health is not in a good place to work hard on a career. God, please kill me already"

"The best ways to promote outreach on antinatalist international day is probably putting up fliers on campuses, at bus stops + maybe even having a street outreach campaign. Next year I will try to put up fliers. It’s hard to do so on a weekend unfortunately."
Happy Antinatalist International Day to my fellow ANs. I never forget this day every year bc it’s 2 days before my birthday. I hope everyone has a wonderful day + we keep spreading the wonderful message of AN to more people.   #antinatalism
"According to SBS Insight statistics, 40% of pregnancies in Australia are unplanned. Wow. I wonder how much the general statistics are overall."

I’ve found YouTube more useful for autistic adults than books. My favourite channel is Olivia Hops. Her videos make me feel less lonely in a neurotypical world.
It’s autism awareness month + I realise how saturated books are about autistic children. There’s hardly anything about autistic adults. I think many parents of autistic children resent them bc they are tough to parent. We need more resources on autism for adults.
"As an autistic person, I have more shutdowns than meltdowns. I had a shutdown today trying to recover from my many errands. It’s frustrating."
We wear disguises to mask who we truly are. Don’t be fooled by the many masks. Beneath that is the dark filthy core of our being.  #misanthropy
I got my hair + nails done today. I feel pretty good - it’s my way of celebrating some mandates coming to an end. I felt very exhausted + drained today tho. I also managed to get hold of my favourite magazine as well. I need a lot of sleep just to recover from a simple outing.
I helped two ladies at the laundromat today. That’s my good deed done for the day :)
Kindness makes the world go around.
"As an autistic person, I like the puzzle piece logo.   #UnpopularOpinions"

My photo album on my phone is full of pictures of exotic birds. I find some pictures from birdwatchers + I send them to my mother. She absolutely loves them.
"Life is a series of lotteries all of which are lost the moment you come into existence. There’s the genetic lottery, the luck lottery + so on. Don’t gamble with someone else’s life bc it’s unethical no matter how hard you try to justify it.  #antinatalism"
Gambling with a child’s life is child abuse that most parents aren’t even aware that they are doing.   #antinatalism
"I’m trying ECT, going to try + finish my QS diploma, lose weight, + start a career in a big city living alone in an apartment. Will try to volunteer in soup kitchens + spend my time doing some charity on the side. That’s my life plan for the next 5 years if I’m still here."
I want to buy a salwaar kameez.
Is anyone else here a survivor of many near death experiences like I am? I’ve had so many + sometimes I’m terrified of why I’m still here. It definitely strengthened my spirituality for sure.
"I had my Friday consultation for ECT treatment + the doctor said it has a 70-80% improvement rate. I told my parents this + they told me to be optimistic. As usual, I told them I’m pessimistic about everything, but I’m willing to give it a try for the sake of continuing this life"
"I decided to try going on a dating site (as a joke) to see what I find. I discovered most dating sites have become like Tinder + they are very feminist. Being autistic, I always prefer someone else make the first move in a traditional courtship, so I deleted my profile."
Ramadan Mubarak to all my Muslim followers ❤️❤️❤️.
Do pessimists see the world in colour or black monotone only? I think we see the world as black with small shades of white here and there. It’s hard to see the world in colour when colour is a mask of deception.   #observations

I rung my BFF today + I found out she’s coming back to my city in 8 months time!! I’m so happy!!! I finally can socialise + have a social life again.
I’m so excited the mandates are over the first thing imma do is get my hair + nails done.
"Antinatalists are the most understanding, compassionate, empathic people I’ve ever known. Even if we disagree on some points, it’s okay, bc being intellectually honest is the first step to good dialogue + ANs are the most intellectually honest people online + IRL."
"They also got offended I would ask my future husband to get a vasectomy. For the record, if he refused, I would happily get a tubal ligation. I’ve been wanting to sterilise myself for years, my meds almost make me asexual so I would be happy remaining a celibate virgin for life."
"Someone told me that a vasectomy is the equivalent of a hysterectomy or FGM + it’s the worst thing you can do to a man. I think not, lots of men get vasectomies voluntarily. A tubal ligation is probably more equivalent to a vasectomy."
This Friday I have my first meeting with a doctor for ECT. I’m going to learn as much as I can + give it a try for my mental health. Maybe it will kindle a spark of some kind to inspire me to continue living this miserable life. Hopefully it goes well. I trust the doctor a lot.
My cherry flavoured vape juice tastes like an SKL cigarette ♥️.

Socialisation   #NewBlogPost
I need to write a post on socialisation + mental health how too much socialisation can be detrimental to your well being while a lack of socialisation can also be harmful.   My best friends also moved away from my city which is why I have to rely more on work instead.
"Evolution is fascinating, but the needless suffering makes it more so a burden than a miracle."
If people think life is a miracle... then we need a whole new definition of what a miracle is.
Suffering is how life begins... our parents suffer from sexual frustration... Suffering is the essence + meaning of life... People live to suffer + they suffer to live.
"I love the movie ""All The Bright Places"" bc I can relate to both protagonists in the film. The ending is very sad, but it also demonstrates to us how we can share pain through pleasure with those we choose to love."
"Suffering needlessly is the meaning of life. After all, ""suffering builds character""... but imposing suffering is morally wrong, yet bc it is the meaning of life most people by defacto choose to impose it on others.  #antinatalism"
My last straw is trying ECT for my mental health. Then I can say I've tried almost everything + I'm free to give up.
is an option for me as well since over-socialisation is also detrimental to my well-being.
"aspects of the job. One of the hardest things in life is being social animal. No matter how introverted or reclusive I become, the more mentally ill I become. I used to be heavily anti-work + I support the subreddit to some extent, but I can also be flexible... working part time"
day taking Lamictal + I feel it seems to be helping me (but its too soon to say as its only been 2 days so far). I have decided when I get better I will be focusing on finishing my QS qualification + then try to get a job not for the money but for the socialisation + contribution
"I realised recently that being a full-blown recluse (with contact only with my family + psychiatrist/therapist) has been detrimental to my mental health. I benefitted from structure, routine + socialisation which I used to have in my old jobs + in the psych ward. It is my second"
"Sessions with my therapist include reading self-help books such as this. I have already read Ikigai which I enjoyed. My homework is to read this book and do some Qi Gong, as well as mindfulness exercises."
More mental health professionals should be reading philosophy books + examining the works of Schopenhauer + Benatar. Time has come to validate the mentally ill + healthy people who describe life as what it truly is.
"Life + being able to replicate aren’t miracles, they are cruel curses by the forces of nature.   #antinatalism"
My psychiatrist has been reading my AN book there’s a cue of people wanting to read the book who are part of my local community mental health service. So far he has found it interesting. He says it’s very well it written + it’s a different perspective.
I wish I was never born. I’m very unlucky + I am also not a miracle.   #antinatalism
I might be trying electric shock treatment for my mental health.
Children are everybody’s problem created by 2 horny individuals who lacked the ability to control their urges or play it safe.   #antinatalism
Horny fuckers never hear babies screaming when they fuck all they hear is fake + mediocre orgasms + this is the story of why you have to suffer bc you exist.   #antinatalism
The fastest way to deplete the world’s ecosystems is by having more  kids.   #antinatalism
Today I opened the suicide box under my bed + I tried on my exit bag + gas I had to stop myself from doing the deed. I was almost ready to do it.
I feel very suicidal rn.
Life is being stuck in purgatory for what feels like forever.  #antinatalism
I’m tired of living.
"Ever since I got out of the hospital I realise I need more structure, routine + socialisation which my life at home seems to lack. I’m sedated a lot of the time bc of my medications. I just realise I’ve engaged with so many psychiatrists I’ve lost count of how many."
I’m finally a free bird. I got a new vape to celebrate. It’s good to be home.
I officially got discharged. I made some good friends I may see again someday. I met a girl Māori my age who has a narcissistic abusive mother + she’s schizophrenic. She brought me a vape + she’s really nice. I hope I can drop off one of my handmade bracelets to her tomorrow.
I have a zoom meeting in 2 minutes with dad + everyone looking after me. I’m so nervous so many people are gonna be there
"Ever since I have been here, I’ve been thinking about buying a new vape instead of cigarettes. I found one I like, similar to one of the girls here"
"Day 8: I slept in, slept okay. Had breakfast + was talking to another lady in here about my struggles with suicidal thoughts. The doctor gave me a full medical exam. I feel okay so far. I have a zoom meeting with dad at 3pm with the doctors, hopefully it goes well."
"Children are many people's saviours... that's why they choose to procreate, they are looking for salvation within their progeny... salvation is within yourself, not your children.   #antinatalism"
"No matter how much you love children or desire to be a parent, you must always remember that it is someone else's life + you cannot control what happens to them, this is why procreation is unethical."
Most people have been conditioned to accept forcing someone into existence + gambling with their lives. This is why few people can truly understand #antinatalism.
"Antinatalism is extremely hard for normies to grasp. Every time the doctor asks me what I'm doing, I have a chance to explain antinatalism to him bc I wrote a book about it. Unfortunately, most people have been conditioned to believe that its okay to force someone into existence."
I’m officially a free bird at least legally + on paper.
I started my cycle today... which explains why I was so depressed. Sometimes I become suicidal when I get my period. I feel much better today. I treated the fellow residents to some chocolate + I found some lip balm. I can't believe I've been without lip balm for a whole week.
"I just watched a young 17 year old jump up onto the roof + escape the psych ward while being on constant watch. Everyone is shocked not surprising he escaped, he hated being here."
I met my first #childfree person in this ward who told me that she doesn't want to bring kids into this world bc it feels wrong. I feel so happy when I meet fellow childfree people who have slight antinatalist leanings but don't realise it. I also talked to my doctor about AN too
"I saw the doctor, they are getting ready to discharge me maybe tomorrow or the day after. I'm allowed to walk to the shops across the street with my nurse which is exciting. I hope they have those bags of chocolates or a box of favourites. I want to treat the people here :)"
"Day 7: I slept in, my watch battery needs replacement, had breakfast + just showered. I've been here a week. I'm wondering if the doctor is going to give me a review. I think I need some time out of here even if its to go to the shop across the street. I'm still half asleep."
"I love grunge, rock + heavy metal unfortunately all these people play is pop, hip hop + r&amp;b."
"My nights in the hospital consist of vaping, loud music + chilling with these guys :)"

I took an afternoon nap + felt very energised. I have been here 6 days + am no longer under the Mental Health Act. I had a conversation outside with one of the patients who told me to live for other people... I'm deeply contemplating who I should live for in my life.
🤣 #antinatalism
"Day 6: I slept really well + showered this morning, had breakfast. I feel good, it’s nippy outside. The nurse said they might discharge me or review my case under mental health act. I was vaping + with the other people here. The quetiapine makes a big difference to my sleep."
"There are so many extroverts + optimistic people in this hospital. I don't seem to mind it tho. They seem nice. When I get my privileges to go out, I will find a way to treat them to something nice. They've been very good to me + time flies when I'm with them."
"I have a lot of respect for Indians from Kerala. Their ambition, hard work + good work ethic inspires me. I just talked to a nurse who knows my brother + she's graduating this year. Her husband is also working as a nurse."
I met some nurses today who know my brother + are very fond of him in the psych ward. They asked about him which was really nice. I think I might have a new lease on life bc I see the aspirations of some of these nurses + maybe some day I will be successful person in QS.
"I asked my nurse if I could go to the shop + buy some snacks + she said I wasn't allowed to go. I might be able to get some leave when the doctor approves it. Now I'm rewatching some movies to keep myself busy. That's all I do these days... watch movies, sleep + socialise a bit."
Day 5: It's 4am. I am wide awake in this psych ward. Last night I watched South Park + chilled with my new friend. I feel like the days are going by fast here. My dad says my cat misses me... he's sad I'm not around. I miss him so much too.
My new friend Emily brought me a vape. I will try to keep in touch with her when I get out of this place.
"Day 4: The nurse came to wake me up, I showered, had breakfast, took a nap + went to see the doctor. He seemed happy with my ""progress""... but I won't be getting out of this nuthouse until Monday/Tuesday. I feel drowsy + sleepy all the time. I miss my cat."
"I noticed one of the nurses had an Arabic tattoo on her arm + I asked her about it, she said she has a Lebanese aunt, I'm happy her tattoos weren't botched bc Google Translate isn't accurate. She seemed lovely. I told her Lebanon is the Switzerland of the Middle East."
"I spent a couple of hours chilling with the people here. Most of them are parents. I met a lovely girl my age with schizophrenia, we spent some time vaping + chilling outside stargazing + looking at the moon. The people here are pretty cool."
I was pondering going back to school + completing my QS diploma... not sure if I can do it. I can always try to study and resubmit my assignments for the class I dropped + then re-enrol. Or maybe I'm just better off dying... IDK. It's hard to say what will be good for me.
My dad just texted to let me know they changed my doctor yaaay. Hopefully I don’t get a religious nutcase like the last one. 2 more days + I can leave from here if I play my cards right. The last thing I need is a judgemental person sabotaging that.
One of the only acquaintances I made in this place is leaving. I'm gonna miss her. Hopefully she does okay + doesn't have to come back here again. It's hard to be in this place for 2.5 months.
"My brother texted me wanting to go to the Foo Fighters concert when they come at the end of the year, I was a bit pissed off bc I don't really want to go to any concerts. I'm happy living in my own world, doing my own thing. Plus the noise and I have sensory issues."
Drug addiction is always rooted in trying to escape a painful reality... I feel for those people.
I met some interesting people I kind of made friends within the ward. I vaped a little + found out some people have been here for months bc of meth addiction. Quite a few young people here are parents. I feel kind of sorry for the meth addicts - drug addiction = escaping pain.
I was having a scary nightmare about being kidnapped by polygamists (it felt so real) until the nurses came + woke me up to take my blood. I completely forgot I'm actually in a psych ward. I had the best sleep I've had in a while.
"I’m mentally fucked up, but not as bad as some people. I can “pass” for a normie but I’d think twice before I ever had a kid. I really don’t understand how people “roll with it” instead of considering options like abortion."
"I overheard two girls outside talking about their substance abuse + how they had children. They were very young, probably much younger than me I’m shocked to see they are parents. It makes me wonder how many people are conscious about bringing a new life into existence."
“Safety measures” in a psychiatric hospital are extra ways of making your stay there miserable.
"I haven’t had any problems with nursing staff yet, until I met this bitch ho who wants to take my earphones from me. As if I can hang myself from these earphones."
Motivational/inspirational quotes should be replaced with pictures of nature + animals. Cat pictures are my guilty pleasure... and everyone knows cat videos get millions of views on YouTube.
Toxic positivity is the worst cancer in this planet after procreation.   #antinatalism
"Psych wards in Asia are much more fun than NZ. At least we could play games, do activities, people socialised with each other more + we were like friends/family. Bc I was foreign, everyone talked to me there + I made friends easily. Here it’s much tougher + people r a bit weird."
"Existence is like being stuck in a mental asylum.. your sanity is constantly under scrutiny, everyone indoctrinated with toxic positivity is diseased, while the pessimists are the only beacons of sanity."
Psychiatrists are like a society that constantly gaslights you to get what they want...
I really need a cigarette right now. It's the best cure for my anxiety. Vaping doesn't make much of a difference.
"Many religious people cannot understand agnosticism. The doctor thought that Agnosticism is a God that is anti-suicide, LMAO."
Most psychiatrists despite studying for 11 years cannot understand antinatalism. The nurse had finished my AN book last week + the psychiatrist I gifted my AN book to has started reading it + he says its pretty interesting.
"He asked me abt my religion. I explained to him that I am basically agnostic, he didn't know what that was. All these religious guilt trips about my suicidality. He was curious about my suicide book. I wrote to the person in charge about changing the doctor so I get less anxious."
"I showered, had breakfast + met the doctor. Unfortunately, I had to see the Arab doctor + the issue of religion came up + so did antinatalism. I explained to him that I was forced into existence without my consent just bc my parents had sex... he froze when I said that."
"I slept terribly last night, maybe one or two hours only. I still haven't adjusted to hospital life yet. I had a cup of milo when I got up. Hopefully, I can get at least 2 hours of sleep very soon."
"Pregnancy is the only STD with a 100% mortality rate. Everybody knows this, yet people go on to reproduce. Go figure.   #antinatalism"
Indeed! The only STD with a 100% mortality rate.   #antinatalism
"Out of all STDs, pregnancy is the worst one out of all of them - bc it results in life/existence."
Desire is the root of all suffering.
The gateway to eternal suffering lies between your genitals.   #antinatalism
Breeders are malignant cancers on this planet.   #antinatalism
Pregnancy is a sexually transmitted disease.   #antinatalism
Existence is the ultimate con-game. Conning others + scamming them is foundation/meaning of life.  #antinatalism
Parents figuratively hold guns/daggers to the heads of their children when they force them into existence.   #antinatalism
"I asked for a change of doctor hopefully, it goes through."
One of the most frustrating things about my admission into the psych ward is the fact that I hv an Arab psychiatrist. Arabs always treated mental health w so much stigma + ppl like me get hated on bc I’m irreligious. I’m really frustrated w how many Muslims work in mental health.
Some people are so brainwashed. All Abrahamic religions were spread by some form of imperialism. My dislike of imperialism + the demiurge was the driving force behind my deconversion.   #Agnostic
"When my Indian psych nurse talked to me about Islam. I told him I left the religion bc I am anti-imperialism. When I brought up the imperialism of Islam in India, he told me that Indians saw the moon split in half + when they asked the Arab traders they converted to Islam."
Existence is like being trapped in a psych ward. It's a prison with illusions of freedom.   #antinatalism
"I just had breakfast/dinner.. the food here is not too bad. Two girls in the ward said hi to me. I've never had problems making friends in the psych ward. But usually, I expect ppl to initiate conversation 1st. Everyone seems kind of introverted which is okay. No problems so far."
Has anyone ever had ECT therapy before? I honestly don’t feel safe getting electric shock treatment.
This is my home for the next 5 days. My only complaints are not being allowed a phone + laptop charger. At least I don’t have to wear a mask + my covid test came back negative.
My cat was meowing saying goodbye to me as I left. I’ll miss my baby. Hopefully I’ll get to see him again soon.
"Religious Muslims cannot comprehend a person of an Islamic background can ever be suicidal. I tried to explain, high IQ makes it difficult for people to believe in politics or religion. My psychiatrist is also Muslim. Apparently every psychiatrist has lost patients to suicide."
"For the next 5 days I am here, I will watch some movies on my hard drive + read some books. I’ve been reading about Ikigai as per the request of my therapist. It’s interesting so far. I really don’t think I’m a danger to myself tho. I hope I don’t get electric shock treatment."
I went to see my psychiatrist for our 6 weekly catch up + he decided to admit me to the ward bc I’m apparently a danger to myself. I’m so happy the nurses let me drive home + get my belongings. One of the nurses is Muslim + gave me a religious lecture on belief in God.
My favourite autism t-shirts.
I think everybody in life should take the black pill + confront the ugly truths of existence. Once most ppl can c the blue pill reality is complete bullshit - they’ll accept the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia + antinatalism. The game is always rigged + everyone is a loser.
"Antinatalism is just going to keep on growing thanks to feminism for liberating women from the biological burden of bearing offspring.   Humanity finally has an opportunity for a peaceful extinction that involves birth control, sterilisation + maybe even euthanasia someday."
Haha!! Welcome to Ninja-niqabi land!
"For all of human history, we hv shed blood thru wars + gone to extreme measures just to ensure we pass down our genes.   Antinatalism + opting out of the gene pool were rarely even considered options. Not passing down our genes is a victory for future generations.  #antinatalism"

Religion was designed to suppress the dark sides of female nature while sacrificing incels who are deemed a threat to the fabric of society. Incel (martyrs) are promised x amount of virgins in heaven so they die.
That’s the one!
Yes.
"Ancestry DNA tests are exposing peoples age old infidelities + dark, dark secrets. You can’t trust anyone in this world."
"I was telling my friend a story about how this woman committed paternity fraud + conned him into providing for kids that weren’t his. It makes me wonder, how much of humanity grew up being raised by men who aren’t their real fathers. DNA tests r exposing age old lies + secrets."
"“Barefoot &amp; pregnant”  - to protect society - to safeguard the male ego  I say   - burn society down - fuck the male ego   Life is unfair, so extinction of our species is the only way we can have equality between the sexes."
"The next best thing to non-existence, is self-isolation in your room, chilling + observing the world burn right in front of your eyes while your only reaction is meh."
"The water is not clean or transparent. The waters are always murky, that’s why I need clarifications + very specific descriptions + explanations of everything."
"Dating &amp; relationships are all about playing games that’s why I don’t bother.   Careers/jobs force you to play games to keep your livelihood. If I don’t have to play those games, I opt out.  I feel happiest when I’m alone in my bedroom observing a world I don’t understand."
Life is much easier when you refrain from playing games.
One of my guilty pleasures is watching manosphere content. I saw this video on why Islam is not the solution for the incel problem + it’s spot on. Barefoot + pregnant most of their lives kept women away from Chad + incels were sent to fight in holy wars to die. Make sense.
My educators punished me constantly to “correct” my bad behaviour. They resented me for being bored + uninterested in what they had to teach + they also hated me for never having long lasting friendships. They terrorised me more than my bullies + parents combined.
"I resent my educators + the medical community for not having enough compassion to observe my behaviour + diagnose me with autism at a younger age. Had I been diagnosed earlier, my life would have been so much different. I resent my educators more than my parents for everything."
Existence is a maze of ongoing psychological warfares.
Existence is the source of all pain + misery.   I think there is a conspiracy to suppress this truth.   Morals are a conspiracy to weaponise shame/guilt to ostracise people for survival.
"Many scammers do not scam people bc they want to, but they do it bc they have to survive.   Many women do onlyfans not bc they want to, but they do it to survive.   The need to survive overrides peoples conscience + morality just becomes a luxury many cannot seem to afford."
"During the time of apocalypse, morals are always a luxury.   For those who want survive, they say fuck morals + take what they need to survive.   Morals are for privileged people who have some level of luxury."
"The dark side of human nature (both male + female) is evolution. It’s about survival, brutality + cruelty. It knows no morals it’s a Russian roulette game of passing down your genes."
Being autistic means I don’t understand NT mind games or games in general. I am indifferent to them. The only thing that matters is my world + nothing else.
"Me: MehI’m not a perfect unicorn, but I hate this world so much that I’d choose death over love any day. I also want no part in this mating game + I have already removed myself permanently from the gene pool."
Black pill theory has taught me that men want an angelic woman who is a virgin + women want a chadrone or lots of money to compensate if she’s “settling” for you. Basically men want a unicorn + women want to show off in front of other women to make them jealous.
Men + women want completely different things in life. Both project images onto one another that are completely non-existent. That’s why relationships are so messed up + overrated.   #misanthropy
"Choices I made in life. I take responsibility for what I did wrong, but some things can also be blamed on various different factors. I don’t think I will ever date again bc I screwed things up. Im happier on my own. I’ll prob die of suicide before I even fancy anyone else again."
"Being a sapiosexual was what screwed me over + attracted me to my ex. We were so different, yet he was a chameleon who “became” everything I desired in a man. Part of it is my fault bc I projected qualities onto him that didn’t exist. I look at myself now + look back at the bad"

Fast fashion - The shady world of cheap clothing | DW Documentary   via @YouTube
"I love the show 90 day fiancé, but so many of the couples they bring on the show are stereotypes. The Arabs are usually looking for green cards, the Africans are shady. The South Americans are gold diggers. They rarely show couples that seem as tho they have authentic relations."
"Children don’t belong in this world.   Why? - They don’t deserve to have the weight of the world on their shoulders, they aren’t investments, legacies or somebody’s property whose fate is already decided for them.   They are too good for this world.  #antinatalism"
"Those beatings were from “a place of love” bc if you don’t get good grades, you will be a failure + take crap from other people for the rest of your life.   This is the logic of middle class + upper class families in the Mid East. That’s why everyone is successful in my life."
"My grandparents + great grandparents used to violently beat their children with wooden objects if they got bad grades in school.   The secret to success, money, status + generational wealth, is brutality + cruelty. That’s another reason why I wouldn’t have kids."
Another story time   My mother knows a woman in Iraq who was a compulsive gambler. She lost her teenage daughter in a game of poker to an old man who married her.   That’s how messed up some breeders can be.   #antinatalism
World is full problems.  Solution = Do not procreate.   You have your own problems. Solution = Do not procreate.   It’s not rocket science. It’s basic common sense.   #antinatalism
"I lack the characteristics needed to survive in this world independently. This is one reason I refuse to bring children into this world. I know very well, they will probably turn out like me or my family + they’ll struggle to survive too. Not having kids is basic common sense."
"To survive this monstrosity of a world, you gotta be extroverted, charming, an asskisser/bootlicker + you gotta be brutal in a concrete jungle where you eat or be eaten. When you lack these characteristics you struggle to survive in this world."
"My parents were pretty lucky... I was well-behaved, quiet, shy + reserved as a child. But not many children are like that."
"Many parents don't care how their children behave publicly, but some do. I applaud those who are mindful of their children in public, but those whose children cannot behave... it always reflects on the parents. Some children are happy to be destructive."
I remember two stories from my teen years...  1. This woman came to our house + her daughter turned on the house + wet the carpet + curtains + her mother did nothing.   2. A lady with a severely autistic son came to our apartment + her son was grabbing things + she stopped him.
"Many parents cannot teach their children to be quiet in public places + not disturb the peace. Many children are nightmares from hell, but I don't blame them, I blame their parents for giving into social pressure to procreate + not knowing how to raise them.  #childfree"
"Many people don't know how to raise children properly, yet they still become parents. SMH.  #antinatalism"
"Parenting is the hardest job in the whole world. I don't know why people think its easy or its a walk in the park. It's better to admit you'll be a lousy parent + not procreate, than to become one bc of social pressure + destroy a child's life.   #antinatalism #childfree"
"This movie is exactly why I would never have kids...   Many people think parenting is a beautiful walk in the park, truth is, its the hardest job in the world. I already have my own problems... the last thing I need is a guilt trip for being a bad parent."
I watched this movie called “Shattered Innocence” about a naive girl who does nude modelling for a company + then she becomes a pornstar + cocaine addict + then she shoots herself. It’s based on a true story. Life is all about conning naive people + profiting off of them.
"My brother + I are both failed normies. We were both diagnosed with autism by American psychiatrists + we were diagnosed too late, my brother at 17 + me at 30. Being a functioning human being in a world of NT robots is frustrating."
Naivety gets people into unwanted trouble.
"Autistic people are more likely to die forever alone, be unemployed or underemployed + 67% have suicidal thoughts + are 10x more likely to commit suicide compared to their neurotypical counterparts.   I don’t believe in positive thinking or optimism but that’s my future."
This post is pretty much my life story + my circumstance. An autistic person doesn’t belong in a neurotypical world.
"I had a session on zoom w my therapist today + I’m supposed to figure out my future. Idk what to do, career wise, I don’t have it together + my disability makes it hard for me to hold down a stable job. It’s hard to find my purpose in life so I might have to opt for suicide."
"During hard times, people will breed children for food, water or shelter. They’ll sell their children to the devil for those basic needs. It doesn’t get anymore eyeopening than that.   #antinatalism"
“Educated people have no excuse to breed especially in times like these.”   #Quote #antinatalism
“Breeders in war torn countries are just creating future refugees.”   — Raphael Samuel  #antinatalism
America destroys Afghanistan + Iraq = the whole international community stays silent.   Russia invades Ukraine without destroying its infrastructure = the whole international community is outraged.   America is always above the law Russia is always the demon
Sometimes I’m tempted to OD on some of my prescription drugs. The only reason I don’t do it is bc I have a very trusting relationship with my psychiatrist. He gives me monthly scripts instead of weekly dispenses like other clients. I don’t want to betray his trust.
"As an Arabised person, I absolutely despise the slave trade + Arab colonialism/imperialism. My native history + culture were also wiped out by Arab imperialists so I feel some of the pain. My opinion doesn’t matter much bc I’ve always been an outcast in Arab society."
I used to be an INFJ now I’m an INTJ. Interesting shift.
"I’ve been autistic my whole life + I suffered so much bc I wasn’t diagnosed til weeks before my 30th birthday. It explains y I’m so isolated, awkward, kind of bold + a bit weird. It’s hard. Autists commit suicide higher than any other disabled group of ppl. No one understands us."
Less news about Russia - Ukraine on my TL.
I’m tempted to take some sedatives + pull the plug. I feel so sick.
True!!
Choose one of the following for war:  1.) Survive + lose = cucked 2.) Win + you’re traumatised for life 3.) Die = you go extinct but you’re at peace provided your loved ones died too   The only winners are those who die with dignity. I can’t see things any other way.
"Even wars, imperialism + colonialism are futile bc no one really wins anything. When it comes to defending your territory, it’s better to die a dignified death than to be cucked + that’s what we are seeing in Russia + Ukraine now."
"Everything in life is vain + futile. Ecclesiastes says so + Schopenhauer said everything in life is vain. Why so many people are attached to life is what I don’t understand? You can tell antinatalists to go kill themselves, but that won’t change your attachment to vanity."
"Human extinction is long over due. What’s there to fight for? We have experienced almost everything + history always repeats itself, so why not spare future generations the burden + just cut to the chase of extinction - after all, there are no real winners in this game."
"I don’t want the world to end via war. There will always be survivors of war, women + children r always the spoils of war + ppl will want to repopulate the earth + rebuild civilisation. An asteroid, super volcanic eruption or alien invasion r better ways for us to become extinct."
The extensive coverage of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict demonstrates how cheap Black/Brown peoples blood is. No one cares about our conflicts even if they affect others geopolitically. It’s very eyeopening.
I wonder if this Russian-Ukrainian conflict will lead to balkanisation of Ukraine.

"Children deserve to exist only in a safe world where they can consent to coming into existence. I find this world confusing + difficult to navigate, hence, why I don’t wish existence on anybody else."
Very few people can turn me on. I’m turned off by most people. I have a RBF + a death glare which makes me difficult to approach. I don’t envision myself having a child bc children are precious + this world is evil. I love children too much to want to hurt them unnecessarily.
"Someone told me if I meet a nice, dominant, traditional man I will change + become a pronatalist breeder. I doubt it. Yes, I’m submissive by nature + I like dominant energy, but motherhood is not for me. I know what’s best for my unborn children.   #antinatalism"
"Every life story of my ancestors is tragic none of them lived a truly happy life. It’s time for me to burn what’s left of my bloodline, for that is the only road to peace so future generations don’t suffer like I did + those before me did.  #antinatalism"
I’m stuck between a rock + a hard place traditionalism vs. feminism. #antinatalism is the only winner against both. I live my life by the principles of choosing to not impose life or anything else on others.
#antinatalism is the only form of justice in an unjust world.
Being born is a curse.   #antinatalism
This world has scarred me for life I don’t want to traumatise/scar anyone else.  #antinatalism

If you're wondering why I am tweeting about zombie apocalypses here's a copy of the book I finished reading today... Beyond Collapse: Surviving and Rebuilding Civilization From Scratch by T. Joseph Miller Jr... I found it very informative
"I have many new followers as a result of spending time in Twitter spaces. For those who are traditionally conservative people, I want to link you to my article on why I'm an Antinatalist so you understand my feminist views"
If I had to choose between getting raped/becoming pregnant + dying... I'll choose death before anyone touches me. This is why I don't think I will survive any collapse. Women will be raped/sexually assaulted in a dystopian post-war collapse. Death is better than pregnancy.
"In an apocalyptic scenario, I would rather commit suicide than have sex with a man + get pregnant. I can't bring myself to force children into this existence as a retirement plan. In an apocalypse birth control pills won't be available + abortions won't exist. Terrifying things."
"Just finished my book..I need to reread it again in future..It had a lot of hard pills to swallow. In an event of a collapse, I will probably kill myself. Women + men will revert back to trad gender roles + I might get preg if I can't stay celibate due to lack of survival skills."
"I have a very important book to read, so gonna have some dolma + coffee + read. I’ve never read a 442 page book in 24 hours but I’ll try. I need to take notes too. *Fingers crossed*"
Iraqi dolma.  #Food #Lunch
Every child forced into this world carries the burdens of all previous generations.  #antinatalism
My kindle is working again yaaay!
"A friend gifted me a great collection of ebooks + my kindle is completely dead, I’m trying hard to fix it I might need a new battery. I’ll do my best to take better care of it next time."
Being autistic in a neurotypical world is tough.
"I'm Iraqi. Many people in Iraq did not see a war with the U.S. coming + they happily had children. After the death of 2 million civilians, we are left with 5 million orphans. Their parents never saw it coming. Similarly, many parents never see the worst coming for their kids."
"You can have the best security in the world, you can be skilled at marital arts + have a collection of weaponry to protect your family from predators, but the only way to protect children from harm that is 100% effective is by refraining from having them. Futility always wins."
"Many people may snark + cringe at comments made by antinatalists now, but the world is heading for collapse which is inevitable, you can laugh at antinatalists now, but when the world is burning + you have children you can't protect, who will be crying then?"
Many people do not know how to live a life without procreating + that's where the problem lies.
I feel passionate about #antinatalism bc it is rooted in ethics.
Humans going extinct in a meatgrinder world is an act of compassion for both the humans + other species.   #antinatalism
You can still have traditional values without reproducing. Recognising you are not a good candidate for procreation is being conscious + aware. Few people have that deep self-awareness + humility.
"It's better to be a ""genetic failure"" + not pass on your genes than to pass on your genes + spread ongoing trauma to the next generation of humans. #antinatalism"
"#Antinatalism is the route of safety + the real abode of peace is nothingness + non-existence. Unfortunately, natalists cannot recognise that + hence, the cycle of suffering + hell continues."
"I don't have a fear of giving birth, bt what I fear is the uncertain fate that awaits my children... I would prefer to have never been born, so I assume by default everybody would prefer to remain unborn. Our natural state is nothingness + that is the home of peace. #antinatalism"
People are afraid of #antinatalism + they react to it with hostility bc it triggers them. The fear of nothingness + purposelessness + nihilism to some extent reminds them of how insignificant they are in the grand scheme of things.
"#Antinatalism doesn't have to be about misanthropy or contempt for the human race, but what it can be about is compassion and desire to end all suffering."
"The concept of gambling with someone else's life is about the genetic lottery of randomness. You can give your child everything + do everything right by the book, and many people do, but you cannot control if your child is born with a disability, unstable future or bad luck."
"Most mistakes can be undone, but forcing someone into the realm of existence + gambling with their life... that can't be undone + its the worst possible crime people aren't conscious of. #antinatalism"
"40% of men pass on their genes... 80% of women pass on their genes, not everyone is meant to be a parent or a life scripter and you get so much hatred, hostility and ad hominem attacks when you choose your own path in life."
"Trying to explain antinatalism to a bunch of traditional minded people is very exhausting. Even when you are nice, polite, cordial, you get attacked bc you ""want the human species to die out""... people just don't get it."
"It’s very hard to undo years of programming, social conditioning + indoctrination."
"It’s funny I’ve been interested in spaces lately, particularly this one a friend of mine linked me to that I thought I was supposed to troll. I’m not very good at trolling, I ended up sitting in + listening. I would say I am now a feminist with semi traditionalist values."
My fidget cube is addictive 😍😍😍.
"I see life as futile, meaningless, pointless + as overrated. Life has been imposed on me against my will by my parents My soul is dead all that’s left of me is a piece of flesh that is decaying."
"I’m an existential nihilist. Most days I wish I didn’t wake up to live to see the next day. I have no hope for the future, no goals/dreams/desires. I yearn for death. I think this is y I don’t want a partner bc I’ve been hurt before + I’m pessimistic"
Made some Chana Masala for the family ❤️.
Why I Don’t Write More Posts On Spirituality
"You can be a traditional Christian + an antinatalist. People take ""be fruitful + multiply"" out of context in the Bible. Jesus was antinatalist + so was the Apostle Paul... so traditionalism can also align with antinatalism as long as you're not procreating."
The only traditionalists I respect are a Christian sect called The Shakers... they were well-known for making furniture + they followed the teachings of the Bible + were antinatalists. They never reproduced + adopted so many children out of hardships + gave them better futures.
"I was also asked if I had a traumatic childhood... I did to some extent, but I think I was destined to become an antinatalist... because futility, nihilism, pointlessness of replicating purely for selfishness + suffering leads people who contemplate deeply down this path."
I encourage traditionalists to adopt. But traditionalism is about the selfishness of passing down your own genes in a futile game of Russian Roulette.   #antinatalism
"People hold onto traditionalism bc it gives them ""purpose"" in a life that has no cosmic meaning. Before feminists + ""traditional"" men decide to debate they should ask themselves why they are traditionalists + how far our species has come. Everything goes back to futility."
dehumanising them by forcing them into existence to be taxpayers + work their whole lives. I'm not a 100% anti-work but nobody asked for this. I used to be a traditionalist until one day I woke up + realised imposition is wrong + the first thing people impose is life on others.
"I realised then + there, I am a feminist to some degree. I believe in autonomy for women + their sovereignty... I am antinatalist before I am anything else + I advocate for the rights of children. Meninists claim to have the best interests for children at heart, but that involves"
"Today a friend of mine asked me to enter Twitter Spaces + there was a debate going on between feminists + ""traditional"" men... I spent a few hours in the space + we got to the topic of antinatalism. Someone asked me why I don't kill myself + but all couldn't grasp the to"
Storytime... brace yourselves people.
Indeed!
"I have two problems with the patriarchy:   1.) I’m a misanthrope  2.) I’m an antinatalist  Therefore, I can’t trust the patriarchy + the only alternative is to support feminism bc feminism can afford to accommodate misanthropes + antinatalists."
"Antinatalism doesn’t care about families + patriarchies it’s all about the children don’t force people into this world who cannot consent to be here or gamble with their lives, period."
Antinatalism is anti-traditionalism.
"I spent some time in a space today, about feminists vs. meninists honestly I’m an antinatalist. Yes, I grew up in a traditional household + I have some trad values, but I also align partially with feminism bc antinatalism isn’t about forcing more people into this existence."
Why I was skeptical of religion at such a young age I remember hearing this story when I was 15 + how disgusted I felt.
Exactly what my ex did to me luckily I fucked him back twice as hard.

I can’t sleep. Lately my circadian rhythm is out of tune. I’ve been sleeping all day and I’m awake all night. So I made myself a hot drink + I’ll probably do some diamond painting while I watch a movie. I can’t seem to focus. I can’t wait to sleep normally again.
I’m addicted to my new fidget cube.
Organised religion is magical thinking.   #Irreligious
I think misanthropy is becoming more normalised + mainstream. Some people take this as far as choosing pets over partners. The future is investing in pet stocks. Less young people seem interested in seriously dating + more people using dating apps just for hookups.
"Apparently, there are more single person households than ever recorded in history, people are opting out of relationships, choosing childfree lifestyles + this trend continues to grow. Prof. Sam Vaknin was right when he said the future is humanity becoming schizoid."
Money is important to have... but having too much money is a headache. I'm not saying I am rich... far from it... but I hate managing my finances.
My parents advised me to take all my life savings out of the bank (bc of an economic crash) which I did... then they are talking about our society becoming cashless. I have started making investments with my savings... its hard but I'm getting somewhere slowly.

"All throughout my adult life, I have struggled with issues with my weight. I'm an emotional eater who eats out of boredom. I have decided to start a water fast which I've done before... I feel good so far. Altho I say I will end my life... someday I might, but my weight has been"

The biggest buzzkill is when you find out your favourite social media influencer/s are pregnant. WTF?
I saw a lady with a double baby pram + one of those baby carriers you wear on your chest. Wow I don’t understand people who have kids one after the other. It’s insane.
"LOL I just got called a Karen by a breeder. I’m flattered, honestly."
What’s wrong with hating humanity? We suck!
Breeders are pretentious.
The mother chose to have children for selfish reasons so now we have to pray to our parents + chant + sing hymns of gratitude? WTF?
Idiots who don’t understand antinatalism should be sterilised at birth. Fuck breeders.
Children aren’t the problem. Parents who have children are. #antinatalism

The first part of my new book introduction is out... still a work in progress... Antinatalism: A Socio-Environmental Discourse – Introduction (Part 1)
I told my best Ghanaian friend who is a mum about my AN book. She has started reading it. So far she says the world is full of terrible people which is why AN makes sense. I still feel AN is a bit difficult for many people to grasp.
I just found out my friend’s daughter is pregnant with her second child I didn’t expect her to get pregnant so soon after her first baby. When I see more millennials having kids my heart sinks into darkness + sorrow. I wonder why people can’t see the truth. #antinatalism
"Sheeple are addicted to infotainment, not intellectualism. Most people just want to be entertained.   #misanthropy"
“Life is a sheep infested reality.”   #Quote
“Existence is a circus prison.”
"Everyone is cancer on this planet... myself included... the more I realise that + try to be more mindful of my thoughts + actions, the more humble I become."
Life lovers are the most cancerous pests imaginable. They lack the vision to see their existence as a burden on this planet + on other people/species. Once you realise you’re worse than a malignant tumour that’s when you’ll become more humble. #misanthropy
Scrapbooking is one of the coolest hobbies out there. I got some stickers to decorate my goals planner. I don’t have many goals or plans but it keeps me busy so that’s always a good thing.
One of the side effects of the vaccine is memory loss my uncle + my cousin cannot remember certain people or events in our lives. It’s so sad. They are too young to have dementia. I’m glad my aunt still has a sharp memory. I can’t imagine what it’s like for people with dementia
"I started SNRIs for the first time in my life. Today is my 2nd day taking them. I don’t know if they will cure my depression, but I feel pretty okay so far. I’m slightly motivated to do more self-care but I don’t know if it’s a placebo yet. SNRI’s r a PITA to get off apparently."
"I despise social climbers so much. All everyone wants in life is a real friend, but we only find that in animals. Most people are phoney/fake. All people of high status should know this I’m not hating, I’m just saying."
"A few days ago there was a royal wedding in Brunei + my parents know the groom - my dad calls him an asslicking, social climber. The whole Middle East is celebrating an Iraqi married into a royal family. My cousins went to school with the “mysterious” guy + his past is dirty."
"Pray to God, I get a publishing deal with these people for my AN book. Anything for #antinatalism"
"I just gifted my psychiatrist a copy of my AN book. He was so happy to receive it + the nurse started reading the book. She’s young, maybe childfree. It should be interesting to see how they react to it. She found it interesting how I called life a Ponzi scheme.   #antinatalism"
"Sorry I’ve been MIA. I’ve been feeling very bleh lately. I will reply to mentions, emails + DMs soon once I’m feeling better. Thanks 🙏🏼."
Insomnia
Tears are like rivers; they never stop flowing. Rivers are like tears they become dry.  #Quote #Poetry
"I minored in environmental science - all it is, is green-washing mass consumerism. It doesn't help anybody except MNCs. I'm glad I woke up to that myth before I invested too much of my life into it. ""Green washing"" has become a strategy to deny our cancerous effect on the planet."
"So many of these journal articles I've been reading have been personifying cancer with humanity. We are a cancer on this planet. In fact, we share so much in common with malignant tumours - I don't know how we live in so much denial about it."
"For great in-depth articles on Sacred Ecology, I recommend The Trumpeter Journal of Ecosophy. Thank you very much @oliveratlantis for recommending this knowledge-rich reading for me. I'm almost half way through reading it + I'm loving it. Resonates strongly with me."
The trees for a Maori represent the clothing the earth wears to keep Her warm. The rainforests represent the earth's lungs. Crude oil is the blood of the earth. When they demonised Paganism that was the fall of humanity.
One of the first things I was taught going to school was it is a Maori tradition to put the first fish you catch back in the ocean to show respect to the earth + not overfish. Its small traditions like that from indigenous people that help keep us living in harmony w the earth.
"""Yahweh's command for man to dominate the Earth has provided fuel to the delusionary process and justifies any abuse inflicted on any species on the planet.""   #Quote #Religion #Environment"
"""The full embodiment of man's need to control, manipulate, sculpt, or otherwise shape nature to its human-directed ""betterment"" finds its origins in many places (cancerous religions)."" #Quote #Environment"
It looks like I am going to be purchasing some books on sacred ecology... I'm vaguely familiar with the topic.
It's an honour to not pass on my genes. My (non-existent) offspring have nothing to inherit from this wasteland (earth).   #antinatalism
"I discovered Gnosticism before AN, I'm familiar with the spiritual components of our existence but I rarely discuss them bc AN is secular + most ANs are irreligious. Somewhere deep down they make sense to me. I have always been drawn to ecology + sacred knowledge."
Antinatalism is secular - most ANs r irreligious ppl. This is no coincidence. Patriarchal religions promote environmental destruction + expansionism. Many ANs are vegan or environmentalists... AN is a secular component of sacred ecology that promotes living in harmony w nature.
Researching overpopulation + antinatalism always leads you back to sacred ecology. Humans are a cancer on the planet unless they live in harmony with nature + this is impossible bc of patriarchal religions.
Going to sit down and highlight/analyse more overpopulation articles to help me finish my writing.
Why I Don’t Cherish (My) Life
It’s my first time sleeping on linen sheets. I accidentally brought a fitted sheet thinking it was a set of sheets. When I realised it wasn’t I had to buy the rest of the set on sale. It cost a tonne never again will I buy something so extravagant. But they feel good 😔.
Job/Career = forced enslavement.  Non-existence = emancipation from forced enslavement.
The reason many of us don’t want a job/career is bc we would much rather not exist.
Haha 😂
I listened to this video by Prof. Sam Vaknin   I must say it was music to my ears. These days men chase relationships more than women do + many women including myself choose to be single. The manosphere has it wrong about us.
"Antinatalism has helped me put myself out there more... I never would have done interviews with other ANs, sent my book to publishing houses or literary agents, let alone even published a book had it not been for the support of other ANs. I'll do anything for AN + the movement."
I just sent my manuscript of my AN book to 17 publishers/literary agents. I already received 2 rejection letters. At this point idgaf if I get published in the mainstream or not. I can always republish my book a few months from now after I have given some time to await a response
"Author E. O Wilson promotes the acronym HIPPO – habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, population and over harvesting to describe human activity.   #misanthropy #environment #antinatalism"
Pests + parasites would probably be an understatement... I wish there were worst synonyms to describe humans.   #misanthropy.
As I write my Environmental Introduction... I realise one thing more and more... humans are PESTS +  PARASITES more than any other species on this planet. We sterilise animals + have various ways of controlling pests... but the biggest pest we can't seem to control is ourselves.
"Everyone suffers in life including ""privileged"" people. The suffering varies from person to person... its hard to compare one form of suffering with another, but we must remember life sucks for everybody. To assume some people have it easy is an understatement."
"One of my biggest pet peeves is ppl who complain abt the ""privileged"" as if they r whiny, assholes who sit on their butts doing nothing. Lots of ""privileged"" people are disadvantaged (i.e. they might have a disability/trauma), many do charity + contribute positively to the world."
I’ve been struggling with bad sleeping patterns I need a hot coffee/milo so I can sit down + do more writing.
The reason I’m suicidal is bc I had a traumatic past + I dislike life/living. I live a pretty good life I enjoy sometimes but I feel sad sometimes I can’t be like everyone else. I also find this world boring + not stimulating enough for me. It’s hard for some people to understand
I’m privileged in the sense I don’t have to work a job I hate my parents always said they’d support me regardless of what I do. They know due to mental health issues + autism I hv trouble holding down a stable job for too long bc ppl irritate me. All I have now is my writing.
"I want to write books + help my fellow antinatalists as much as I can. I don’t want to work a job I hate, or study something I’m not passionate about anymore. Nothing in this life makes me happy. I am privileged to some extent. The longest I can hold down a job I hate is 2 years."
"Today I got a call from a psychologist my psychiatrist referred me to. I have an appointment with her next month. I plan to not waste her time + outright tell her that I don’t plan to live for very long. I’m working on my books, but I can’t be helped in any way. It’s best tbh."
Am I the only one who hates the TV show Friends + thinks its lame + overrated?
I slept terribly last night... I'm hoping a power nap will fix me up so I can start working on my book introduction.
"The root of most evil is boredom. My theory is, most people procreate bc they’re bored."
You gotta love it when people say   “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem”   My argument is  “Procreation is a permanent solution to a temporary problem”  #antinatalism
Ghost towns are the future.
I watched the news with my family today + I saw some Afghanis selling their children bc they can’t afford to provide for them. They were begging people to buy their kids — it reminded me of how millions of kids are unwanted + how breeders selfishly exploit kids.   #antinatalism
It’s better to die fighting on your feet than to live on your knees a slave.
It’s better to exist in a harsh reality than to spend your life in a non-existent fantasy realm of mythological euphorias.
"In a world of sick, sadistic natalists, breeding grandchildren is like trophy hunting.   #antinatalism"
Life is a circus full of sad clowns.
Destroy your DNA before it destroys other life forms.
I'm thinking about publishing every chapter of my new book as a blogpost to engage my readers + keep myself accountable to meeting deadlines as well as to obtain feedback from people. It makes my job more exciting.
My Love-Hate Relationship with Nature
"I need to explain my love-hate relationship with nature in a blogpost. Maybe once I clear things up, I will have a solid stance + stronger vision about where exactly I stand."
"Digitalisation = environmental destruction + mining of rare earth minerals to ""preserve"" the environment. What a joke + a hoax."
The price of petrol in my country is going to reach $3 a litre.. my mother thinks its a conspiracy to get more ppl driving electric cars. Electric cars are apparently much worse for the environment thn regular cars. I anticipate more people will be siphoning petrol from cars now.
The main objective of legalising voluntary euthanasia + teaching antinatalism in schools/universities is so people think twice before procreating. People need to think first euthanasia would be a universal human right + AN would be regarded as universal ethics.
I’m still writing the intro section of my book really struggling even tho I’m an environmental science minor. I plan to touch on some of Wohlleben’s inspirational work my proposition will definitely touch on voluntary euthanasia + antinatalism (I need to be less idealistic).
It’s my third night in a row taking 2 Seroqels to knock me out. Hopefully I’ll be knocked out soon.
Procreation on an overpopulated planet means you’re essentially putting your children on a planet full of disasters/tragedies waiting to happen.
I have experienced several earthquakes - some of them life changing in the sense my family lost friends in those tragedies + I saw first hand how demand for mental health services went up exponentially for peoples home who have been destroyed.
I think everyone is going to experience a life changing natural disaster or catastrophic weather conditions that will have an adverse impact on them at least once in their lifetime.
"Last year, I spent my time trying to justify not procreating for philosophical reasons. This time, I’m excited to get into environmental reasons of why we shouldn’t have kids. Each argument will appeal differently to people. I still hv a love/hate relationship w the environment."
400 words written so far I guess I gotta start somewhere it’s been hard lately gotta keep on going.
"I strongly recommend ""The Human Overpopulation Atlas"" to people interested in overpopulation + its environmental impact. Gonna be using this book a lot for my research     #antinatalism #childfree"
I finished reading that thesis on overpopulation. It was quite insightful. Now I’m working on my first chapter of my new book.I need to make this book rich in facts + information to encourage more people to not procreate.
Deep down you know antinatalism is the truth. We all know it. That’s why it triggers you so much.
"I never wanted to exist, so to wish non-existence on me is a compliment. #antinatalism"
Parents are the first terrorisers of all children. #antinatalism
"“The world would be better off without me” or “I should have never been born” are compliments to me. In truth, I am better off alone without the world + me not being born means I get to enjoy peace in non-existence.  #antinatalism"
Eugenics was a PRONATALIST ideology. Antinatalism is an ANTINATALIST ideology... there's no way to compare the two.   #antinatalism
Secret sperm donors and the DNA unravelling the truth     #FuckBreeders #Antinatalism
I have a lot of extensive research to do for my next book... I printed out a dissertation on overpopulation + the environmental effects it has on our ecosystem.
The worst thing is these natalists leave the state + technology (AI) to raise their kids while they try to provide for them. Being childfree is the sane + sensible solution to this major predicament. The kids aren't missing out on much anyway.
Houses in my country are on average $1 million for an average home. More than half the country earn $50k a year. Couples both have to work unless one is earning more than six figures to afford a decent life. All of this + people still have kids. I just don't get it. #antinatalism
Why Intent Is Everything
"I’m going to keep trying with my writing when I succeed, I will start building my life + improving myself. If I fail or the success gets too much to my head I’ll kill myself. I hate life + living, but if I can make it as an artist who doesn’t starve, everything will be okay."
"Consumerism is a cancer that I am addicted to in the last 6 months, I brought a new tablet, a new smart tv, DVD player + a whole DVD collection of Hey Arnold which I watch almost everyday I’m trying to lift my broken spirits. I need a break from my dark days so I can write."
"The pre-modern world average life expectancy was 30 years. Now thanks to modernity, the average person lives to the age of 70 - I personally prefer lower life expectancy rates I’m not keen on longevity at all."
I’m sick of ads on my Twitter feed. I’ve been blocking so many of them.
People hate #antinatalism bc deep down they know it’s the truth.
"I have every right to bitch, whine, moan + complain about my life bc it is unwanted gift, imposition + I was fed bullshit about it since I was a child. If people don’t understand that, then so be it. #antinatalism"
"We have every right to hate life bc it is a burden, imposition + coercion. If our hatred for life triggers anybody then they have their own demons to reckon with. #antinatalism"
We just had a strong and deep earthquake I felt my bed shaking late at night. No damages or casualties reported
Pronatalist societies freak me out. They fetishise pregnancy + treat women as objects for gratification. Pronatalism needs the patriarchy to thrive. Destroy the patriarchy + we see more couples embracing childfree lifestyles.
My mother was telling me about her cousin’s husband who wanted 12 kids + his wife refused. They had only 4 kids + she refused to have more bc of the strenuous process of pregnancy. I find it so weird when men have the audacity to demand their spouse bring more kids into the world
Definitely.
Very far from privileged.
"A 100% true! Suffering happens to people of all races, social classes etc. There are no exceptions to the rule."
More than half of most antinatalists come from third world countries. How does that make them “privileged” - it doesn’t make any sense.
Indeed.
How is antinatalism for privileged people when most antinatalists I’ve known aren’t privileged at all?
I hate having to watch my words constantly + walk on eggshells with people who are triggered by anything I say + by those who have the highest of expectations. It’s better to be discarded for trivial reasons either way.
"Most seem to be mentally ill or hv some other issues. Some ANs hv had a good childhood + r positive well rounded ppl. If life is some wonderful “gift” + my antinatalism is some type of problem to others bc it triggers/offends em, perhaps I’m not meant to be friends w such people."
"I received a message telling me   “antinatalism is a sick philosophy for privileged losers”  Yes Schopenhauer was wealthy + lived extravagantly yes, many antinatalists were probably “well off” but from what I have gathered most antinatalists aren’t well off or privileged."
Reflections &amp; Resolutions – 2021
I’m trying to write a long overdue blogpost on my reflections about 2021
My book is currently with proofreaders + I’m going to take the plunge to try + get it published to get antinatalism out more to people. I’ve started the outline of my new book which I’m currently working on. I feel so lazy + worn down but this new project should be interesting.
Part of me feels a bit ashamed + embarrassed to be mentally ill. It’s held me back so much in my life
Life destroys everyone it comes into contact with. #antinatalism
"Wide awake, late at night"
"Get it mainstream published. I am proof reading the book once again + I will also pay a more accredited proof reader to read the book + I will send it to local publishers here + see if it can end up as a paperback in bookstores. I’m not doing this for me anymore, this is for AN."
I decided to pull my book from Amazon bc I received a few complaints about some spelling/grammatical errors. I made a post on Reddit + my book has been read/downloaded almost 900 times. I’m surprised there would be such demand for this book. Some redditors even asked me to try +
Your life is a fraud.
"This world is a dangerous playground for narcissists + psychopaths. Knowing this, no one should procreate.   #antinatalism"
Children should not be forced to wear rose coloured glasses that become copes in their later lives.   #antinatalism
"Life is a nightmare, Procreation is a sin, Break the cycle, Don’t have kids, Rid mankind of existence.  #antinatalism"
I’m so tired of living. I just wanna die.
Ever since I was a child I think about suicide every single day. I just need the courage + drive to do it.
Frozen berries are my guilty pleasure.
Imposing life on others is sadism. #antinatalism
"Procreation is the most acceptable, normalised, encouraged crime in the world. #antinatalism"
Just attended a zoom meetup with some fellow antinatalists in my country. Had some interesting discussions. Really enjoyed it.
90s - early 2000s cartoons are the best.
I’m very disappointed in my proof reader. Apparently my book has some errors in it. I need to be able to find reliable proof reading services for my future projects.
I’m thinking my new obsession should be watching David Attenborough’s documentaries. Such a soothing voice that is so informative + enlightening.
Chronic suicidality
I saw this post on Reddit. #childfree + #antinatalism for the win.
I haven’t followed my tradition of writing a reflections post on 2021. I need to do that. My highlight of 2021 is publishing 2 books last year + also finishing 2 semesters of construction course. Also taking a trip out of town 8 hours away + surviving that.
Small tiny goals small baby steps are what keep me alive. Everything else just makes me wanna die.
I brought a Goals Planner diary for 2022 + it has all these cliche goals like “where do I see myself in 15 years” etc..I must have been in a positive mood when I got it. My only goal + New Year’s resolution is to write another book (if I can). I dnt c much of a future for myself.
"The human experience can be summed up in one word: “cannibalism”. We try to deny it, we frown upon it + label it a taboo. But to some extent, we are all part of it.   #antinatalism"
The games people play in life are not worth playing.
The human experience is not worth continuing. #antinatalism
"Happy 2022 New Year to my fellow #antinatalists + #childfree people. May this year bring forth happiness, peace, prosperity, wealth + good health. Much Love 💕"
"If I wrote another AN book that focuses instead on sociology + environmentalism, would anyone be interested in reading/buying the book? This is a draft of my content page. #Thanks #antinatalism"
"Instead of trying to screw your friends who are childfree over by pressuring them to have kids, make the conscious decision to not have more kids. Socially pressuring someone to have kids out of envy for their lifestyle is sick. #antinatalism #childfree"
"If you still think about having biological kids, you’re way behind the times. The concept of family has changed, life has become tougher + regardless of whether or not you’re an environmentalist not having kids has many benefits. #childfree"
"Every childfree + (already existing parents’) New Years resolution should be to not bring any more ppl into this world. Clean this world up by not adding more people into this world. Remember, being CF is the most effective way to reduce your carbon footprint. #antinatalism"
"I regret buying my smart TV. It takes up too much space in my small bedroom + all I can watch on it are TV shows streamed online. I’m tempted to return it bc I’m not really a TV watcher, but part of me wants to keep it."
"I’m too cynical to fall in love with people. I’ll fall in love with inanimate objects, but not people"
My BFF came down to visit her fam bc she just became a grandmother. Her daughter’s bf drove 8 hours to come down here to “surprise” her + spoiled their trip. It’s amazing what crazy things people will do for love. My friend had to shorten her holiday bc bf’s mum wanted him back.
"It’s hard to commoditise #antinatalism bc it’s a deep, rooted important cause for humanity. That’s why I made my ebook free. If there’s anything I want to be remembered for, it’s being an AN activist to some degree in my life."
My author copies of my book have finally arrived. Everything seems to be okay. I can’t wait to gift my psychiatrist a copy before I kick the bucket. I can’t believe I authored this book. My best 2021 achievement + my legacy before I die
My best friend + I went out for ice cream today + we drove around all the parts of town that were so nostalgic during our friendship. She promised me in 2 years time she will move back here. I didn’t have the heart to tell her if I’ll still be around by that time.
"I’m thinking about redecorating my bedroom to escape my misery. I’m considering buying a smart tv. I hate TV, but I watch a lot of YouTube and documentaries. Perhaps watching on a screen besides my laptop will be a good change. See how I constantly try to distract myself"
"Maybe the reason why I have so much hesitancy regarding ending my life is the fact I don’t really want to die all the time, but I’m crying for help. Yet I know few people can help me bc maybe deep down inside I don’t want to be helped I live in so much conflict + contradiction."
Fantasy is escapism from reality. Everyone is addicted to escapism in one form or another.
"I have to replan my life out + be prepared for obstacles + plans not working out. It’s too tedious, tiresome + exhausting. Death is much easier bc at least I escape the constant fatigue + exhaustion."
"What kills me most isn’t life itself, it’s the repetitive, mundane routine I have to follow + the amount of exhaustion + fatigue I feel from living. The input vs. output is an insufficient model. This is the driving force behind my suicide ideation."
My friends + family do not understand how much I suffer to get thru another day of life. My psychiatrist doesn’t get it either. Only a few of my AN followers get it. That small validation goes a long way.
"Adam Maier-Clayton (may he RIP) inspires me to end my suffering for good. Suicide takes courage. When others are doing it, there is no excuse, especially if you’re suffering constantly + no one understands your pain."
"I have a wart on the bottom of my foot. I tried almost every treatment from freezing, liquid nitrogen, baking soda + castor oil. Only remedies which seemed to have helped are Apple Cider Vinegar + burning the wart with a lighter. I may need another burn treatment after a while."
When I am around Iraqi Christians I feel welcomed + I feel warmth more than I do with Muslims who are more prejudice. I’m happy my friends daughter found a sense of community with my people. Sometimes there is a happy ending at the end of every multicultural melting pot.
"It’s strange when you’re in diaspora, you’re isolated from your local community of origin + you avoid them. I have found Iraqi Christians to be more accommodating than Muslims. My parents + I think my friend’s daughter will be happy with one of our fellow countrymen."
My best friend’s daughter is dating a fellow Iraqi (from my native country) I feel happy that our cultures are merging together. My best friend is from Samoa + we have been friends for about 8 years. She says the guy is a gentleman + treats her like a queen. I feel happy for them
Sometimes I wonder how much of an impact I can have on people as an AN. Everyone close to me is a parent but not so much a hardcore pronatalist. When people say they have only childfree friends I wonder where you can find those kind of people except on the internet.
I am a millennial (31 years old) all my friends are Gen Xers in their 40s who have kids + didn’t know any better + have told me they regret having their kids. I always have a conversation about AN with people I meet IRL. I do my best to try + help the AN cause as much as I can.
"The baby looked so cute... he didn't cry, he was absolutely adorable... but this world... it's so cruel, unfair + unjust."
"My best friend became a grandma for the first time + we went to meet her new grandson a few days ago. I felt nothing but sadness + grief in my heart (as an AN), I brought him a baby gift... all I hope is that one day he will be okay in this godforsaken shitty world."

"My psychiatrist is working in the ward today - he insisted I meet with one of his colleagues, another psychiatrist. I explained antinatalism to him + he says he agrees with it. I think he was South African like Benatar. It was a fruitful discussion. I hv to c him again next week."
I'm trying to write an introductory essay on human nature + this is all I could come up with for now... I need some sleep so my brain can focus without spewing more crap due to insomnia.
The human condition is a constant ongoing power struggle. The egotistical illusion of hierarchy + dominance that fuels our vanity is what makes our species deplorable.
"I like this tshirt, it’s funny!"
I don’t know where or how I will begin writing my two essays   1.) Misanthropy - Contempt for Mankind  2.) A World I Despise  I figured it’s easier to write about misanthropy first bc it’s the main reason anyone should despise this world.
Freud said procreation is the ultimate form of narcissism.
"Abode of peace, but as Schopenhauer said “misfortune in general is the rule.” The evil nature of humankind outweighs the good"
"Being entranced by the charm and facade others present to you, is an inevitable part of life. It is to be naive, foolish and easily deceived by predators, social climbers + opportunists. As each deception occurs + one is burnt more frequently one seeks to isolate themselves in an"
"Forced to exist in a world full of hate, Enduring eternal hell is our fate."
Rereading Schopenhauer + trying to write an essay to a similar style like his on misanthropy.
"I finished my AN book (still waiting on my designer to upload the new spine for the book cover) so I can launch + purchase a few copies from Amazon. I need a new project what should my new project be? More blogposts, some extended essays or a book on misanthropy?"
I’m thinking of stopping my medications bc my mother thinks they’ve made me sleep too much + become lazier + Im still suicidal.
"My book is partially launched on Amazon. I wanted to make the Kindle version free, but had trouble doing so. The hard copy version will be ready soon."
My Antinatalist book is finally out!! Please read your final copy of Honouring The Dishonourable: The Truth About Our Parents here + get your free copy of my ebook here. The Amazon edition will be out shortly.
Showing off baby bumps + other pregnancy related stuff is exhibitionism for breeders. It’s no different than trophy hunting where you show off the next animal you have killed or enslaved for no good reason. #antinatalism
“Hope breeds eternal misery.” #Quote
Watching a Nicolas Spark movie full of romance + tragedy with my cat. He’s wondering why the f is she crying? Hopefully I wake up feeling better tomorrow.
"I feel compassion for children + contempt for most breeders, especially those who have kids for all the wrong reasons. #antinatalism"
"Many people think antinatalism is about misopedia (hatred or contempt for children) but it’s not that at all. You can dislike children, but you can also feel pity + compassion for them. Children are the innocent victims of this cruel game whether we like it or not. #antinatalism"
"I’m having so much trouble with self-publishing my book on Amazon’s KDP. I rung Amazon + still they couldn’t help with the issue. I really want to be able to get this book out very soon, before New Years. I may have to self-publish on another platform."
How the book will look :)
"The decline + collapse of Western civilisation is not for me to celebrate, but for Westerners to show the rest of us PoC the way to human extinction. I will mourn the West, but perish into nothingness along with them. That’s what happens to hybrids after all."
"Procreation = rape, greed + corruption.   #antinatalism"
I think we need to do a documentary on human life — how we are treated like cattle + made to be cogs in the machine. We need a slaughterhouse style documentary to stop people procreating.
Antinatalism is the antidote for our confusion. Everybody is confused + most people don’t know what they want. Antinatalism is about accepting the flaws of reality + making a mature decision to accept we can’t change the world except by preventing more suffering.
"I am relatively conservative I don’t like decadence or degeneracy but if the alternative is to be pronatalist, then I’m all for decadence + degeneracy."
"The patriarchy is the root of our misery. The patriarchy celebrates procreation - as long as that is the case, the patriarchy will always be the biggest enemy of antinatalism."
"Your patriarchal civilisation will always be destroyed by futility. Pointlessness is staring us blank in the face, yet few people can see it.   #antinatalism"
I think any jobs involving working with people or being in customer service end up making you into a misanthrope.
"My dad took my car to the panel beater for some work + the panel beater was telling dad how Arabs treat him (he's Fijian-Indian) very badly. They want discounts, refuse to pay him the full amount, beat around the bush etc. Being a business owner can make one become a misanthrope."
"When I engage with people who have the emotional maturity of 5-6 year olds... despite how brilliant the rest of their personality might be, I would much rather never have friends again, if the only people I'm gonna keep meeting are messed up due to trauma."
Another thing I also hate is shit stirrers + people who pathologically lie to cause further drift + conflicts between two people. I think those people should be burnt to ashes bc the last thing I need is to hate other people unjustly.
I need to write a blogpost abt vampiric relationships. Where u r somebody's world for one minute + then you're worth nothing to them the next. The emotional labour of dealing with people isn't always worth it. But why is it the most fascinating people have to always b bad apples?
"There is nothing more painful than being used, discarded + idealised + then devalued like you're worth nothing. I would rather be ignored + abused than idealised + discarded."
My final book cover!! I’m in love!!
"I decided to ask my designer to add a picture of a man next to the woman so the book doesn’t come off as sexist towards women. After all, it takes two to tango."
"Don’t mind the spelling errors, how does this book cover look? I sort of like it. I thought a pregnant woman would be the best image to have on the cover of my book."
I am gonna be so excited to have hard copies of my book once everything is sorted on Amazon. Then I can celebrate writing my first book on #antinatalism + I can slowly work my way into writing a book on misanthropy. I can't believe I wrote a book... I was not expecting this.
I finally finished editing my book. I have hired a proof reader to proof read the book for me. I am waiting on my cover design + hopefully inshallah my book will be available for free in digital format on various platforms + in print format for those who want to buy a paperback.
The best news I have heard in forever...⚡️ “World population set to decline for the first time in centuries says study” by @BreezyScroll
I managed to find a freelance graphic designer to design my book cover. I might do some editing before I hire an editor + my book might hopefully be launched before Christmas if I’m lucky or before New Years. This is so exciting. 2 AN books published in one year!!
"I was considering publishing my book traditionally, but that takes too long. My book is somewhat controversial + I hate censorship, so self-publishing is the way to go."
I found out how hard it is to self-publish a book + how hard formatting is today. I feel so stressed by it. It’s hard to understand.
"If life is a nightmare, then non-existence must be a fairytale.   #antinatalism"
When I hear someone say “making babies” I cringe so hard bc the thought of procreating makes me feel sick to my stomach.   #antinatalism
Sweet like poison.
"Sex is like honey - humans are like ants who are having a massive orgy in the honey. Their massive orgy only creates suffering, but they only care about the taste of honey."
I read somewhere a psychic say there are hospitals for the deeply wounded in the afterlife + sometimes people who commit suicide end up going to these places to work thru their issues. If I can’t sort my issues out in this lifetime on earth I need to find a place to help me.
Humanity will have reached the pinnacle of success + revolution when we decide we no longer desire to replicate more + more needless suffering. #antinatalism
"I want to hash things out with my psychiatrist + publish my book (+ gift him a copy) before I end my life. I want to end my life 3 weeks later. Check into a hotel room, spend 3 nights there eating good food + relaxing then just do it. I might have to set a date for the deed."
Hemorrhoids.
"Am I the only who loves to watch the same movies over and over again, and doesn’t really like new movies out that much?"
"Regardless of what people think of Inmendham + Amanda, they have both done more for antinatalism than most people. They both have outstanding work ethics + helped established large platforms to spread antinatalism. They deserve to be acknowledged for their hard work."
"I hate cancel culture + ppl trying to deplatform others more successful than them on the internet. Sometimes we may not like those who do better than us, but the mature, adult thing to do is learn from their success + try to maintain a good work ethic to be successful like them."
"My book is over 30,000 words in A4 paper (over 100 pages). If I want to publish in A5 I have a lot of editing to do + the most annoying part is changing my footnotes into end of chapter references. Once I'm done, I might make some changes to my final parts + hire my freelancers."
"There's no denying children are expensive, even if we lived in an abundant universe + everyone was self-sufficient I still wouldn't procreate. I hate vanity + procreation is the epitome of all vanity. Futility rules.   #antinatalism"
I can’t get past level 3515 on candy crush. Candy crush is my escapism.
Existence is a teardrop in an ocean of sadness.
Comments like this are what I find heartwarming. I’m glad I’ve influenced some people to become antinatalist. #antinatalism
"Most people live in denial of suffering. Why do you think they had to pull Nembutal off the shelves? Too many people were taking it to commit suicide. Antinatalism has nothing to do with suicide, but it’s about not gambling with someone else’s life without their consent."

#CurrentMood
So I found out my narcissistic aunt who paid a poor girl $5k for her kidney (from organ traffickers) to save her husband has become widowed. I have no sympathy at all for them
I have so much editing to do for my book + I’m so lazy n not in the mood to do it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. My inefficiency is one thing pushing me to kms.
An eternity of non-existence over a lifetime of existence.   #antinatalism
The beast thrives on the flesh of children to consume. That’s why it needs you to keep breeding more meat for the meat grinder.  #antinatalism

My sweetheart ❤️😘
I’m planning to hurry + launch my self-published book + gift a copy to my psychiatrist so he understands antinatalism + why his job involves losing a lot of people to suicide. Our parents are the cause of mental illness + society. Existence is the root of all evil.
I’m going to end my life. I don’t need the status of publishing a book with a mainstream publishing company. I can spend some money + self publish my book + order a copy for myself once it’s been launched before I die. Maybe someone will push to have it published when I’m gone.
"I feel somewhat guilty I may be breaking a lot of hearts + many people will lose ""hope"" in life. But my legacy is my book. It's not the best thing I have written + I can do better... but I can't go on like this. This is my positive ""contribution"" to be world."
"I have given my mother a one week deadline to ""solve"" my problems for me. If she cannot (+ I doubt she can), I have the right to end my life whenever I am ready. These days I spend most of my time sleeping + am too tired. I did what I had to + left behind a book for my followers."
Any idiot can become a parent. Many do. #antinatalism

Nihilism: The Belief in Nothing   via @YouTube
All the chapters of my book are on my website. I'm still unhappy with the book + am editing it so I can have it published by a mainstream publisher. My last chapter needs more work. I have been slacking off due to my deteriorating mental state.

"The best place to commit suicide is in a hotel room. That’s where I would go if I had to do it. I’d need to be away from everybody, switch off all my electronics + just do the deed."
This tweet is spot on #antinatalism
"I cannot relate to people my age, my peers, my relatives + to some degree even my normie friends. I find myself lonely from time to time. The only place I feel alive is on the internet, bc at least there are people who think similarly to me. Validation is always the first step."
Most of my peers are married with children. I found my old bully’s fb page + he’s married with a hapa kid. I always anticipated some of my classmates were much smarter than me. I didn’t expect them to be life scripters. Many of them seem to be ageing terribly.
How much hope is enough to survive without being high on hopium?
"One day I was driving on a narrow countryside road with gravel in the heavy rain, my car skid off the side of the road in the middle of nowhere + hit a tree + flipped over. I thought I was gonna die + I was so excited only to be disappointed that I’m still alive today."
"Futility is probably the best God ever bc it doesn’t need to be worshipped all you have to do is accept it, embrace it + promise not to try + cheat this God (by having kids or doing something to stay immortal) + this God will be indifferent to you."
"The God of Futility has taught me many lessons:   - Non-attachment - Simplicity - Acceptance - Contentment - Bravery/Fearlessness - Embracement  It helps me become a better person I envy no one, feel no jealousy, take life less seriously + laugh at all the worldly dumbasses."
"Everyday humans commit blasphemy against futility, ignorantly thinking they can cheat God + still win. It’s impossible. Futility is a badass kicking deity that is a force to not be reckoned w. Futility will destroy me + u, the difference is I’ll be celebrating being w d real God."
The pursuit of godliness (which is the ultimate form of blasphemy + sin) is procreation.   The acceptance of futility as the ultimate deity (that is indestructible) is true salvation.   #Antinatalism
"You can’t destroy God, God is almighty + God always destroys you what you can do, is acknowledge this. Refuse to have children + show God that you can contribute positively to this world but still be detached from it. A small win trumps a humiliating loss built on falsehood."
"Who is God? God is futility. God is omnipotent, omniscient + omnipresent. Futility is all of those things. God cannot b conquered, enslaved or destroyed. God will always conquer, enslave + destroy you + your offspring. Don’t believe me? Find someone who has truly conquered death."
Every child is a bundle of tragedy awaiting to unfold.   #antinatalism
"Hope is a temporary, self-destructive bridge designed for you to cross once on numerous occasions to relief you from the anxiety of your existence. You can’t cross the same bridge twice + every destination will eventually lead to death."
"Armies of children won’t conquer the future, nor will it be the hope for civilisation for armies of children shall always be doomed to suffer + be crushed by the almighty God of futility.   #antinatalism"
"You can’t conquer the future, but you can allow your future to be ashes that turn into dust + become a distant memory that will fade into nothingness.   #antinatalism"
The future doesn’t exist the future doesn’t need to exist.   #antinatalism
"Fertility is a burden, not a commodification sold to the highest bidder.   #antinatalism"
"Infertility is most probably an evolutionary phenomenon designed to allow room for adoption, fostering + helping establish important positions in tribes for women in hunter gatherer societies. Without people who aren’t busy raising offspring society would collapse."
There are evolutionary + natural reasons for infertility. Reproductive technologies are playing “God” + they are far worse than abortionists. At least abortionists prevent lifetimes of suffering. Fertility doctors create suffering by force + they are congratulated for it.
"Mum talks about how she knows women who cry + beg God for a baby bc they cannot get pregnant. Society acts like infertility is a disease. We need to change our attitude toward infertility - instead of seeing it as an ailment, we need to recognise it as natural + evolutionary."
"I have absolutely no sympathy for couples who complain about infertility or being childless you don’t know what you’re missing out on can go both ways a child can be your worst nightmare, so stop complaining + whining about your difficulty conceiving."
"I despise people who brag about their children constantly + cultures that promote putting children in the spotlight. I don’t mind a child-centred, child-conscious ethical decision to protect children from harm but parading kids around for egotistical gain is exploitation."
Natalists r the biggest exhibitionists I have seen in my life. The need to parade your crotch goblin around for narcissistic supply or even the need to brag about them is degenerate. I’d prefer a nudist beach to another excuse to exploit your child for attention.   #antinatalism
Many people live to manipulate
"When I was a little girl, I remember my parents talking about how sick, twisted + dangerous this world is bc a little girl close to my age got raped + murdered brutally while coming home from school. I wondered in that moment why people procreate if the world is dangerous?"
The legacy of all murdered children is how sick + twisted this world can be. When you watch true crime stories that involve someone causing harm to children you wonder how negligent parents can be + how on the opposite end of the spectrum is damaging overprotective parents.
So one of our politicians makes a sexual joke 5 years ago + then the political party leader decides it’s time to tell on him + he loses his job + she becomes an MP. Politics to me is a dirty children’s playground
"I don’t want to pity myself + I don’t I’m just far away from being what I want to be + since everything is futile, I should accept that + see if I find peace somehow"
"I feel like a failure in my life I gave everything a try + nothing seems to work, so all I have left is to Rest In Peace + end my suffering. It’s hard being wasted potential + being promised the world when you’re gifted, only to end up a worthless addict suffering so much."
"I tried to establish a career, but, I failed. I tried to have a side business, but I failed. I tried a relationship, but I failed. I tried to do something w my qualification, but I failed now I’m writing + trying self-care + if I fail, I’m ready to die to hide my shame."
"When I first started taking antidepressants, I published a children’s book + began writing a book. I felt on top of the world + was super productive. I haven’t felt euphoric happiness in so long. Part of me wants to write a few books before I die"
I took 3 quetiapine tablets hoping they’d slowly knock me into a deep nap. I feel so tired + drained from not doing much I need to recharge. I must finish working on my editing I need to finish my projects so I can at least say I tried to have a future prospect before I die.
"You know you don’t wanna be part of this world when being a religious, meat-eating, mindless breeder is the norm for everybody."
Society is still backwards + quite far behind if veganism + being childfree or antinatalist still have stigma attached to them.
"In an agrarian society where most people love sausage rolls + mince pies, you get a lot of funny looks from people if you’re vegetarian or vegan, altho they’re more socially acceptable. Being childfree has more stigma, but being antinatalist is a whole other level of stigma."
There are many mainstream celebrities who are vegan or childfree. You hardly see anyone identify as an antinatalist bc people can’t fathom the idea both us + the world would be better off without us. Being AN is also somewhat controversial in a snowflake society.
Tshirts are good conversations starters. My football club shirts + my metal band shirts are what get people interested in talking to me. I don’t put much effort in how I dress bc people where I live are kind of sloppy. Tshirts with quotes on them get attention too.
"You know you’re adulting when you get excited about vacuum cleaners + other appliances. Yesterday, my broken Dyson got upgraded to a newer model + I was so excited to try it out. The best investment was buying an extended warranty to cover it."
"If life was so great, why do we have infinite distractions to occupy our time with? By having so many distractions we are showing just how much boredom comes with life that we constantly need escapism for the next hit of dopamine."
My mum wanted to go shopping before vaccine passports become a thing. She asked me why the car park is crowded for Black Friday sales. I explained to her that life is so miserable people need consumerism as an escapism to cope with the misery of existence.
"If a mainstream celebrity with a high status comes out as an antinatalist who cares enough to fight suffering for future generations I guess I would care about them. It’s one thing to have status, but it’s an entirely different thing to do something with it."
"Am I the only one who is too autistic to care abt celebrities or their news? My family follow celebrity news like it’s a huge deal for me, it’s just meh. I see celebs as normal ppl w nothing interesting abt em. I also feel pity they have no privacy + everyone is obsessed w em."
"I was thinking of getting a third tattoo an Antinatalism tattoo. I won’t rush it I can get it years from now I live, breath + love antinatalism."
My keyworker has been with me for 5 months + now I have to say goodbye. That’s 2 keyworkers + a psychiatrist in one year. I hate that. I like to stick to my usuals always. I’m gonna miss him.
A brilliant speech on colonialism + how the West love to lecture poor third world countries on consumption who have no future bc of exploitation + debt enslavement put in place by oppressive superpowers. Thanks for sharing this.
Debt is created out of thin air to enslave us just as humans are created out of thin air to be enslaved all for nothing.
Impositions =/= debt.  #antinatalism
"I’m starting to think overpopulation is a conspiracy to spread disharmony, imbalance, war + ignorance in this world. With overpopulation, comes everything bad yet having children is widely promoted as if it’s a trophy or life milestone."
"Less people means more peace, mental clarity, harmony, wisdom, inquisitiveness and deep exploration. A world full of people or too many mindless drones is a world full of emptiness, anxiety, mental cloudiness, disharmony, shallow, superficiality + vanity."
If I were to write a misanthropy book I would cover these topics I wish more would come to mind. Just brainstorming. I might make it a series of essays on each topic.
"If I wrote a short book about misanthropy, would you read it or be interested in reading it?   #Misanthropy   #PessimisticPhilosophy"
"Antinatalism is the best charity to give time, effort + labour to. Preventing suffering is the most underrated contribution anyone can make. There’s no harm in helping others in other ways as long as they don’t involve indirectly prolonging their suffering."
"My parents talk abt tragedies in Yemen all the time + how they donate to their charities. Donating to the less fortunate prolongs their suffering. My charity is giving my time, passionate + skills to antinatalism and I wouldn’t mind helping at a soup kitchen once in a while."
"Humans are vain bc what defines our existence is vanity, embodied by flesh + fleshly desires.   #antinatalism"
"Every walking person is a corpse + every home is a graveyard full of corpses. No bundles of joy, only horror stories awaiting to unfold.   #antinatalism"
Colouring on the penup app on Samsung galaxy s6 is so satisfying. People are so creative with their colouring and artwork on there.

"My father has asked me multiple times what the title of my book is... I refuse to tell him bc how can a religious man who preaches obedience + subservience to parents be proud of a book entitled: ""Honouring the dishonourable: The Truth About Our Parents""."

"I have finally finished my book... 28,852 words, 98 pages long.. it still needs a lot of work. I have to take it to be spiral bound tomorrow... I need to do some proof reading, editing, find a proof reader, perhaps pay a graphic designer to design my cover + seek out a publisher."
Tomorrow is 20th November which is world children's day... I think its a perfect day to promote antinatalism + child rights advocacy.
"Maybe I should write a blogpost about my experiences with Indians... I have a lot to say. I lived beside some Tamils for 6 years + learnt a lot, I worked with many of them in my old workplace + my ex was Indian (but I won't talk about him bc he sucks)."
You can't lie to inquisitive people who are curious... bc they will always seek the truth + find it somehow.
"I was born a rebel... I never listened to my parents, society or culture. Ive always bn a skeptic bc I've been lied to so much in my life... which is why I was an unorthodox orthodox Muslim. I had mostly non-Muslim friends of all cultures + I avoided religious ppl like the plague"
"I have a lot of Indian followers bc of antinatalism. I don't have many Muslim followers, altho I have noticed on many forums AN is growing among Muslims surprisingly... I will always be a neutral person. I'm strongly against imperialism, I've been irreligious for a decade..."
"I was sent some video footage via Arab/Muslim WhatsApp of Hindus throwing urine + faeces at Muslims after prayers. I understand how deep the wounds of imperialism run, but I wish there was some way to maintain peace between religious peoples in India + elsewhere."
"So it’s become a new trend in India for Muslims to spit in the food of Hindus + they call it “jihad”. I’ve never heard of this kind of “jihad” in my life + I was a Muslim for about 21 years of my life. I am anti-religion, misanthropic + can’t stand society in general."
#Futility
The closest thing in life I feel to joy is when I’m in a hot bath tub alone meditating in a foetal position. Psychologically it reminds me of being safe from harm in the womb. It’s the closest memory of the void + it resembles a sense of inner peace + tranquility.
"Nothing in life makes me happy + I see other people who are happy. If I had what they have, I still would be miserable. I think they are happy bc of luck, connections, a lower IQ + ignorance. I have nothing in common with them which is why I keep to myself + avoid normies."
"My ex classmate I’ve known since we were 8 has a happy life - married, two daughters, always smiling/happy. When I c her Instagram I don’t envy her — I wonder to myself how she enjoys life, how she life scripts, I wonder about her luck + I wonder y everything makes me miserable."
"When I see vanity, I don’t feel envy. I feel indifference, apathy + meh. Most things my peers achieve, if I were to have them, I would still be miserable. They make no difference to my happiness or wellbeing. That’s why I don’t understand jealousy or envy."
Depression = realism
My most read chapter of my book is number 6 — “Acknowledging Futility” my theory is people realise how pointless procreation is but also everything else. Everything is short lived like a cherry blossom tree. The Japanese chose the right symbol for vanity.
"Every person with a message in life realises the many predicaments that come with existence. They realise how unworthy this world is of their existence — so they commit suicide, take drugs or self-trash to keep their sanity to salvage what’s left of it."
This world is of no value to me bc I have to be a misanthrope in order to survive + I need to self-isolate to protect myself from the evil everywhere. I lack the prerequisite qualities to be an asset to this world bc I represent everything that is weakness in this world.
"To have prosperity on this hellish planet we need kindness, compassion, sharing, cooperation, inquisitiveness, a thirst for knowledge + a complete collapse of the current systems we have in place that are tyrannical + totalitarian. But how can we hv that w a selfish core?"
My core values do not align w those of the world. When SHTF + people are forced to confront their values that is when I have a place in this world. I have been waiting for 9 years for this day + the world is descending into more decay + injustice which is why I don’t feel needed.
This world represents everything I despise which is why I do the absolute bare minimum to continue the futility of my existence.
"How do we define “success” in life without inertia, futility + indifference? True success is contentment, but when you no longer find pleasure in the little things you enjoy, you desire escapism. This world is one of escapism from escapism in a constant vicious cycle."
I bumped into one of my colleagues with his small son shopping today. He still works where I used to work. He can't get out bc he has a mortgage to pay. I feel grateful everyday I quit that job + I'm doing what I love.
"Coming from a country with sectarian conflicts, I try to avoid the topic of vaccines as much as possible. I wish others were mindful enough to do the same unless its an absolutely necessity to mention it."
"The subject of vaccinations has become a topic of witch hunts where you gotta pray to God you're part of the ""right"" religion, otherwise you lose your livelihood + become ostracised playing the blame game in dystopia."

Yes!!
"Still don’t have them anyway bc it’s ethically wrong, when you can adopt. I’ve seen so many people have kids who can’t afford them."
"Meanwhile, in good news this book was published 2 years ago. It’s an optimistic title for a pessimist. I’m excited to read this book. I already know China’s population is declining along with the West + East Asia. Let’s see what else I’m missing. #antinatalism"

"I took my mother + brother shopping at the mall twice, 2 days ago + spent most of the time waiting in the car in the summer heat. I brought some clothes since going out will be harder + it has taken me 2 days just to recover from that trip. I finally got some chores done."

How can you bring a child into this disastrous world? #antinatalism
I think I’m a promortalist as well but not sure about it as a philosophy. I need to browse the subreddit more.
Society treats children like crap. Antinatalism is the only child rights advocacy movement there is.
I just found out the nurse from my old workplace has resigned most probably due to not wanting to take the covid jab. Luckily she was given another position in our workplace.
"Indeed. That’s why we have special rituals for death + dying, bc we accepted its part of life."
Forcing people to comply with your fears should also be a disorder in the diagnostic &amp; statistical manual. We live in a sick society + this addiction to life + living (+ worst yet forcing it on people inhumanely) is a mental disease.
Wanting to live forever should be classified as a mental disorder that has its own section in the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual.
"The govt wants to force these experimental vaccinations on us bc they want us to surrender our civil liberties voluntarily. Furthermore, they want to force us to fear death + refuse to accept it as part of life so they can control us. It’s sickening. Worst part is ppl fall for it"
"My parents + I are the only people in our family besides some of dad’s cousins who are vaccine hesitant. My uncle is a huge hater of mainstream medicine, but his huge irrational fear of death has made him obsessed with being vaccinated + forcing everyone around him to be vaxxed."
"For sure. I hate how it is weaponised against the human race. I think there was a time when people accepted death, now they just wanna live forever + force others to do the same."
"I fear the unknown, but I don’t fear death that much to the point I’d wish to be immortal."
I’m sick + tired of peoples fear of death + the unknown it makes them controllable state cattle. I need to rant about it somewhere either here or on my blog.
"I’m trying to get all my shopping done for essential items before I’m completely banned from buying items due to not having my vaccine certificate. I managed to score some bargains I have anti-ageing products, tshirts + pyjamas which is all I need to lounge around + write."
It looks like all my appointments will be phone consultations or via zooming since I’m not getting jabbed. Not sure if doctors can do anything for me. I need to get a teeth cleaning before this law comes into place.
"Our fascist govt wants to impose vaccination certificates on us to enter hair dressers, bars, restaurants + other places + this is going to be implemented by the end of the month. I’m still not getting vax. If this drives me to suicide then so be it. I believe in civil liberties."
"Summer of 2020 was full of road trips, long drives to random places, visiting family + meeting my nephew, fishing, nature photography it was one of the best summers I ever had in my life + it was w an Asian man. Funnily enough, my best birthday was also with another Asian man."
"My resolution for this summer is maybe to get healthy so I can find a platonic crazy BFF I can spend my spare time going on adventures with. I don’t mind them being a bit extroverted bc to some extent I’m outgoing too, even tho I’m introverted."
"I need a platonic best guy friend that is crazy, a bit childlike, high IQ + adventurous. It’s been one year since  my BFF moved away. We used to go fishing together, do nature photography, talk about philosophy we had crazy adventures in the summer time, we were inseparable."
All of life is vanity anti-ageing cream is as far as I go with my vanity.
This covid pandemic has shown us how attached people are to their lives (+ how attached to life the govt expects us to be) it’s all a bullshit Ponzi scheme.
When choosing a suicide method you have to be strategic + choose something fail proof that will be successful.
It’s hard to die of an overdose. I have tried many times + failed. It needs to be done correctly with anti-emetic drugs + a high dosage. I would not try to end my life by ODing ever again bc all it will do is land me in the psych ward with my stomach pumped on suicide watch.
"Last month when I was abt to be admitted into the hospital for mental health issues, my nurse put my medication on weekly collection instead of monthly. Luckily I convinced em to change it. I haven’t overdosed in over 10 years + I refuse to overdose again bc it’s failed so much."
"I attempted suicide by drinking rat poison 10 years ago + all it got me was an overnight stay in hospital, my stomach pumped, being forced to drink charcoal. It didn’t kill me unfortunately."
I used to work with vulnerable migrant workers who were forced to work in very dangerous work environments for relatively okay money. They probably all have gotten vaccinated. I miss them sometimes. We had some good times together at work.
I’d rather die of covid than lose my civil liberties + be a sheeple who follows the rest of society blindly.
I just found out my brother’s carers have to be forcefully vaccinated now even to look after him privately with us. It’s such a shame bc we would have offered good un-vaxxed carers a job. Having worked 3 years in disability + mental health I strongly empathise with my colleagues.
Actions speak louder than words. What matters in life is what you do. Always remember that.
"Negativity + pessimism is the best way to repel people. Especially optimistic, religious, pronatalists.   #antinatalism"
I will always advocate for free speech + a life with no vaccine passports in a world where vaccination status doesn't matter. I am a centrist. I support religious people as long as they don't compromise my civil liberties... but I'm also kind of a secularist + am for LGBT rights.
"When it comes to civil liberties, the only ppl standing up for rights besides intellectuals are religious people who are homophobic + bigoted. I find myself united with these folks only for the sake of civil liberties, but I never imagined I would share anything in common w em."
The ongoing loss of civil liberties in a dystopian world is more than enough reason to not procreate. The fact people's very basic freedoms are being taken away by politicians + they stand + do nothing makes me feel hopeless. I expected more from people...
I heard about foetuses fighting instruments used during abortions + that is why some doctors + nurses have become pro-life. I would rather be murdered by my own parents rather than suffer for a lifetime + die. Both roads lead to death.
One of the things I hate about lockdowns is my inability to go to libraries without a mask + spend my time reading + writing. My local library closes for a lunch hour in between now. I also miss going to my favourite scenic cafes to do my writing.
"If my civil liberties continue to decline, I want to be no part of this world."
"I have 27,000+ words. I'm going to try + aim for 30,000 words then I will bind my book + start editing by hand w my red pen. Then once its finalised... I need to start looking for a publisher. I will launch a copy for my followers free on my blog. If I reach 40K words I'm safe."
I have finished my 11th chapter of my book. It needs some work. I'm finally on my final chapter... wonder... would u prefer I publish chapter by chapter as posts on my blog or do u want to wait for the whole thing so you can read it all at once? I'm looking to publish mainstream.
"I never envisioned myself into becoming an activist, but I am slowly going down that pathway with my antinatalism. I can't believe it..."
I've started the 11th Chapter of my book. Written over a 1000 words so far + have about 91 pages written so far. My father keeps telling me to take my time. I haven't written since before last week. I feel a bit tired so I'll take a break. I hope to finish this chapter this week.
"Being childfree is an opportunity for more purpose in life, happiness + prosperity bc the purpose of life is to serve others + your ability to serve others is limited when you have children."
"I finally figured out how to write ""The Alternative Meanings to Life"" chapter of my book... my biggest dilemma w contributions to serving others is I'm an introvert... the only way I c myself serving others is if I contribute financially to their causes or work from behind scenes"
It’s so hard to talk to people who are religious (and claim not to be) + optimistic about life + feel strongly about having a traditional family about AN. I wish the world could see life from my eyes + my perspective.
So my conversation with the Iraqi guy turns into a conversation about religion + I feel like I’m being proselytised. I think I’ll end up blocking him. I can’t stand religious people who feel the need to proselytise me + keep me away from antinatalism bc it’s too negative.
When he asked me what my religion was he said he knew only an irreligious person would write a book about AN. Then the issue of trauma came up. I find myself talking to everybody about antinatalism these days.
"I was worried about one of my friends I met on an app, I tried to find her there but I couldn’t. Instead I met an Iraqi living in Iraq on there who wants to practice his English to leave Iraq + do a PhD. We had a conversation in Arabic over the phone + talked about antinatalism.."
"Looks like I have to read Benatar's second book, The Human Predicament... I just don't understand the meaning of life at all. It makes no sense to me. I could say, I'm a nihilist to some extent."
"The meaning of life is the most depressing topic to write about... + I have to do it for my book. Life has no meaning. We live in existential hell.. How am I supposed to tell my readers that w/o lying to them, being condescending or encouraging suicide, when I myself want to die?"
"I started listening to a podcast w David Benatar on the meaning of life as research for my book... OMG, its the most depressing subject ever. Antinatalism is anti-suicide, but Benatar could only cite 2 reasons to continue living.. 1. For ppl we love. 2. To generate more meaning."
I don’t get upset when I lose followers. The number of followers is irrelevant. Being able to tweet what you want freely is what matters most.
Ever noticed how the most annoying people you would last ask advice from are always the ones who give it? Nosy people who have everyone’s business as their own.
Today is Guy Fawkes we have fireworks to celebrate the death of a king (If I’m not mistaken) it’s frustrating being part of the Anglosphere bc people overdo it with fireworks always. It terrifies pets sometimes + I’m not really a fan of noise in general.
Tonight I guess it’s Chris Everard’s documentaries + fall asleep.
"I managed to clean my room + take a bath. I need to get back to blogging, writing my book + reading. I can’t seem to do a lot of what I used to enjoy. I ordered a cross stitch piece to try + get back into needlework. I hope I’ll have a more productive day tomorrow."
To gift someone life is the equivalent of a lifetime curse.
Every child is an heir to a throne of eternal suffering until they die.
Happy Diwali to all my Indian followers 🙏🏼❤️
"So my medical centre + my hospital are no longer accepting mask exemptions + I was forced for the second time to wear a mask. It’s frustrating. Thank goodness my cloth mask arrived from China 3 months later + it’s breathable, it doesn’t suffocate like other masks."
Preach! #Truth
"9. The five models of filial obligation need to be abolished in favour of compassion w boundaries + limits to destroy the debt we ""owe"" society.   10. There are many reasons NOT to procreate, parents lack accountability + social responsibility in a dystopian era.  #antinatalism"
"7. Procreation is narcissism masked as altruism (even Freud said so), society needs to deceive children + exploit them in order to survive.   8. Respect your elders is an outdated concept when parent-child relationship is one of Stockholm Syndrome + Trauma bonding.  #antinatalism"
"5. Procreation is unethical in a world of overpopulation, environmental catastrophes characterised by future wars on water and food security + poverty + social ills.   6. Procreation is a futile, unpleasant reality of our existence we fail to accept.   #antinatalism"
"4. Procreation is a vehicle for statism + it is a way we are indoctrinated into enslavement via social influences, acceptance, purpose, belonging, tradition + ancestor worship.   #antinatalism"
"2. Procreation is a violation of natural, human + children's rights.   3. People procreate for... tribal instincts, the herd mentality, parenthood is overly glamourised, social pressure, fear of mortality, egotistical, vain, selfish, purposelessness + boredom.  #antinatalism"
"A summary of my book   1. Children cannot give consent to be born, they have the (legal + medical) incapacity to make decisions + they should not be part of any generic life scripting that is essentially gambling with someone else’s life + a Ponzi scheme.   #antinatalism"
"One of my psychiatrists wants to read my AN book. She’s young, maybe unmarried or childfree or has children. I said sure, anything to give people a new perspective on procreation, so they won’t procreate. My keyworker is still reading my book. It should be interesting for them."
"I have insomnia not the bad kind, I feel energised actually. So I decided to tweet a summary of my AN book to those who haven’t read it yet. I have yet to finish 2 chapters which might be my project for tomorrow when I go to the library"
I need to get back into writing... I haven't written a blogpost in forever...
I miss South Park :'(
"I also had about 2-3 blogs which I deleted... I regret that, I've come a long way."
"My first Twitter account was under my name + I used it to follow my favourite Arab bloggers + Middle Eastern news commentators. I was watching the Arab Spring unfold + doing assignments for school on it, 10 years ago. Here I am now preaching antinatalism..."
"Before I discovered I could learn a lot on Twitter + make friends, I used to hang out in chatrooms on this website called ArabChat, I met some interesting ppl on there. I was always looking for intellectual friendships... those were the days. I've been on Twitter for 10 yrs now."
"I wish I had the drive to binge listen to a bunch of podcasts for my research so I can finish my book... but when I need a break. My mother thought this would be my million dollar book, I doubt it. A historical autobiographical fiction would possibly bring in a lot of money."
Humans are very fickle. They change their minds so easily. They are quick to place you on a pedestal only to discard you when they feel you no longer serve a purpose to their benefit. I've seen this in most people. I must persevere + focus on doing it all alone w/o anyone.
"I’m addicted to juices + carbonated beverages. Thinking of switching to ice tea + swearing off of them, if I can find the right teas to brew cold. If I like the flavours, I’ll probably go on a diet again + include them in my regimen. I need to get healthy."
I didn’t realise one of my favourite authors genres is historical fiction. I love that genre - particularly books set in colonial Australia or South Africa.
"I have read a little bit of Nietzsche, he did say we need some delusions in order to continue our existence + I agree with him on that. He was definitely a philosopher who was ahead of his time."
It’s futile bc after 3 generations their DNA is diluted down to 6% until it becomes irrelevant. If only they could see having children as a terrible “investment”.
"I don’t c death as anything bad, death is a merciful + compassionate part of our journey. Futility is wht makes life hard, building so much in life only for it to perish away into nothingness. That’s y leaving behind a legacy of having children makes no sense, it’s still futile."
"They still have to suffer. They still get cancer, dementia, arthritis + other ailments. They also have to die sooner or later. They can’t escape futility."
Causing suffering + spreading pan is not okay. Antinatalism isn’t about being edgy or depressed it’s about the golden rule + it is a philosophy of anti-imposition.
"Breeders are what they are. They cause suffering, hardship + pain. Calling that out is common sense + intellectual honesty."
"“The earth is a toilet, if aliens invaded, they’d flush away all the turds.” — Inmendham"
Planet earth is one big mental asylum + the insane ones who need to be locked up + castrated are natalists who think breeding more lunacy is okay.   #antinatalism
Existence is essentially profiting off the suffering of others whether it is directly or indirectly.
The doors through heaven (being unborn) + hell (being born) lie in sex. #antinatalism
Abortion is a free pass to heaven for the unborn + birth is a free pass to hell for those unfortunate enough to be born. #antinatalism
"Dear Unborn Children,  Either you are fortunate enough to remain unborn or some asshole breeder will force you into existence. Pray to God you are one of the winners, trust me you aren’t missing out on much fun here on planet earth.   #antinatalism"
"I finally managed to clean my pigsty room, put on my favourite fragrance in the air diffuser + brew some ice tea. For the past couple of days I’ve been writing my book or spending 12 hours sleeping, I don’t know if I’m depressed or not. I’ve been neglecting my self-care a lot :("
"I feel depressed + suicidal once again so weak, so tired, so sleepy all the time spring sucks one more month to go until summer. I want to finish my book before I die. I don’t know how to write my last 2 chapters that are somewhat optimistic."
I’m thinking of writing a book on misanthropy after I write a book on environmental antinatalism
It takes suffering + common sense to unlearn pronatalist propaganda. #antinatalism is the only path to enlightenment.
"Natalists = n. sick fucks who spread the sexually transmitted disease of suffering for cruel, sadistic amusement.   #antinatalism"
Existence is a symphony of eternal suffering.   #antinatalism
Life = the sexually transmitted disease that never stops giving (until when you die of course).   #antinatalism
"The gift of life = forever in debt to parents, society + slave masters who profit off of your suffering.   #antinatalism"
Death = return to nothingness after needlessly suffering.   #antinatalism
"I'm thinking of adding an antinatalist speech to my book, a SWOT analysis, more charts + visual figures... maybe some case studies. So far I have 10 chapters, 25,000+ words and 85 pages. I'm hoping I can get up to 135 in terms of pages."
"My next two chapters are going to be a lot of work... I need to do more research on activism, write some case studies + look at how to find meaning in life which is a really nuanced topic. Altho I have a whole chapter on futility I need to give my audience something meaningful."
"I just finished my 10th Chapter of my book. I didn't want to be too repetitive so I decided to have charts in my book to visually illustrate my points to my audience. I have two more chapters to go + the book will be done. Then it will take extensive editing, research + reviewing"
For my followers out there who are single... do you still maintain friendships with your friends who get married or have kids or do you drift apart bc you no longer share much in common?
"steal their man. I am friends w married couples bt its rare. Its much easier for me to be friends w divorced, widowed, single people. With that said, nothing is set in stone... I'm a flexible person... this just happens to be one of my insecurities. Not sure ppl understand that."
"Can single people be friends with married couples or people who are in relationships + have kids? Its very hard for me to be friends with my girlfriends who get married or find men bc some of them look down on me, feel pity for me being single or I get paranoid they think I wanna"
"Calling it child maltreatment, is white washing + desensitising ""child abuse""... just call it child abuse."
"I've decided to include my essay on why I'm an antinatalist in my book to help lengthen up the book. I have also added some horrific statistics on child abuse in America to support my accountability argument as a reason to not have kids. I have 24,000+ words so far. So exhausted."
I am writing 10th chapter of my book. It’s proving to be much harder than I thought. I hv to convince my readers to break the cycle of procreation. After that I hv 2 chapters left which should be easier to write. I hate being repetitive. Writing is harder than I thought.
I finished my 9th chapter of my book + started my 10th chapter. I feel kind of sleepy + unsure what direction to take this chapter of the book. I’m thinking discussing dystopian times we live in to deter ppl from procreating. Man I didn’t know writing a book was so exhausting.
"I can write about determinism, epigenetics + birth traumas or childhood deprivation + abuse which will increase my word count. Not sure yet I really want to finish this book. It feels like I’ve been writing it forever."
"I have almost finished my 9th chapter of my book. I also finished the chapter on acknowledging futility which was unfinished. I have written close to 21,000 words - at the rate I’m going it will be 27,000 words which isn’t enough but I’ll find a way to make it to 30k at least."
I finally finished this masterpiece. It didn’t take me long to read bc it was so good. One of my favourite books. It will hopefully help me write my chapter on futility bc it’s incomplete. I want to be able to finish my book by the end of this year if possible. Fingers crossed 🤞🏼

One of my biggest pet peeves is going to a public place + seeing parents yelling at their children or threatening them. Parents can be monsters. There is a line between discipline + flat out abuse. The number of parents who resent their children is beyond me. #childfree
I respect children enough to not drag them into this world only to resent them later on. #antinatalism #childfree

I went to town today to buy my girlfriend a birthday present. I’m obsessed with buying these gratitude journals for my friends + they love them. I decided to get her a Christian mug as well with some other small gifts. I saw an anti-vaxx protest in the square. It seemed popular.
Once people can see that a true person who loves children refrains from putting them in harms way + favours the child's best interests over their own self-interest by choosing not to bring them into this world. This will eventually work towards a paradigm shift in filial culture.
The objective is to change the culture around child-parental relationships to a more egalitarian relationship + remove the unbalanced power dynamic. This can only be achieved if parenthood is no longer glorified + parental worship is abolished.
"I propose a new model for filial obligations - abolish them in turn for a new model called ""compassion with boundaries"" where we have compassion for our parents, but we decide what we owe them in terms of obligations without shame/stigma if we decide we owe them nothing."
"I'm looking at different theories of filial obligations towards parents... the way I c it is if our parents are decent human beings we owe them respect not as authority figures, but as people. Filial obligations need to be abolished + we need a more egalitarian alternative."
"a lot. I wrote a children's book, I've almost finished writing a book that has 199 hits on my blog, I managed to get on an AN podcast, I finished 4 construction courses successfully + failed one. It's good to be able to say ""fuck you"" to an employer + walk away w dignity."
"It's been exactly one year since I resigned from my dead end slave job + I have no regrets. I kind of miss having more disposable income, living in my own place + supporting disabled people along with my colleagues. This year has been interesting for me... I feel I have achieved"
I've started writing the 9th Chapter of my book about our parents + their obligations towards us. Society has indoctrinated us to believe that we owe our parents. This notion suggests we are constantly in debt to them - when they should be in debt to us for disturbing our peace.

Maybe I should write an essay about why I don’t like this world.

I’m really enjoying this book on futility the quotes are amazing + I’m learning so much. I have so many pages bookmarked + tagged. Hopefully it will help me rewrite my chapter on futility.
"“In sorrow, thou shall bring forth h children.” #Genesis"
My keyworker has been reading my AN book he said this is a new concept + it’s from the perspective of the children which is true. I don’t claim to speak for all children but I’m going to open more minds to accept a different perspective on life.   #antinatalism

I buy a book online on futility from a seller on eBay + I get a tonne of thank you cards + a thank you letter. It’s so sweet ❤️❤️❤️. I can already see I will love this book.
It wouldn’t surprise me that cat pictures get more likes on social media than pictures of children.
"I love urban exploring + I watch Exploring With Josh on YT + I follow him on instagram. I wouldn't mind exploring haunted places, but I would prefer to go with a group of people rather than alone. I used to live near a haunted mansion but I lost all the pics sadly :("
"I have a few short Arabic paranormal stories about haunted places I might write a blogpost about... a haunted palace, a haunted hospital + a haunted mansion. I'm lucky my mum loves the supernatural stuff + I'm bilingual so I can translate things for English speakers."
"Doctors love to scare people, but I know my GP isn’t like that. He genuinely hadn’t seen results like mine before in his career so he wanted to make sure everything was okay."
It’s good to finally be home home sweet home. Now to unpack + find something to watch to help me wind down.
My tests just got the all clear from the doctor + I can finally go home. I’m happy I didn’t have to stay overnight. Hopefully no more fevers or cold night sweats anymore and a normal CRP for once.
"I’m having a few tests done to ensure I don’t have my infections, after they are done + all clear, I will head home. We have been here almost 4 hours but it’s been flying quickly with dad + I talking + reading a good book."
I’ve started reading “21 lessons for the 21st century” by Yuval Noah Harari and it’s interesting so far. I find it resonates with me. I’m grateful to Dr. Martin Goldberg on YouTube for recommending this book.
"Democracy is based on the principle that “you can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” #AbrahamLincoln #Quote #Harari"
My doctor doesn’t know what’s wrong with me. My parents are crying I kind of wish I would die already but I still want to finish my book before I go. Hopefully it’s just a minor inflammatory infection that can be cured with something.
"I received an email from my GP, I’m going to the hospital. My CRP is through the roof + they don’t know what’s wrong with me. I might have to stay overnight. I’ll bring books + my laptop for entertainment."
How To Protect Yourself from The Evil Eye
"I did another blood test today + I threw up in the early hours of the morning. I feel much better + sort of in the mood to write. I brought some candle oils to put in my diffuser, I find certain fruity fragrances make me feel happy + put me in good spirits."
Last night I had another fever + cold sweats.. I felt very sick + I couldn’t sleep. Today I went to the doctor + will get another blood test done tomorrow. If my CRP hasn’t improved I may be admitted into the hospital which I will dread
I also brought myself a shungite statue + some beads to make a bracelet. I know peridot + citrine don’t like me very much.
I have been listening to + reading moldavite horror stories yet the gem had no effect on my life in such ways. Maybe this new piece I’m buying will stay with me for life unless I decide to gift it to someone else.
"About 4 years ago, I brought some moldavite jewellery to enhance my spirituality + I ended up giving my pendant + other specimen moldavite away. I still have my ring left. And silly me goes out + orders earrings online + a new pendant. Maybe it just wasn’t meant to be for me."
My cat needs one of these.
"It’s better to hate me for who I am, than to love me for who I’m not."
Every friend or lover may become your enemy one day.

The only good thing about antidepressants is the loss of libido side effect. They don’t seem to do me any good anymore I am at my worst during spring time. But I don’t want to come off them bc they liberate me from sexual desires + the need for intimacy which I absolutely hate.
Misanthropy is the only liberator from sexism + racism. Realising humanity as a collective is the real problem is enlightenment.   #Misanthropy
I received 2 emails from my old workplace threatening to fire me if I don’t get the clot shot by December since I used to work in mental health + disability luckily I quit my job almost exactly a year ago + I’m free from all this covid bullshit for now.
"I’ve been sleeping all day bc I’m under the weather I drank some caffeine + stayed up the whole night watching movies, doing diamond painting, taking a bath + reading some books. It’s as productive as I’ll get until my health improves."
"There are many things I have difficulty erasing from my Muslim upbringing that will stay with me until the day I die one of them is intolerance for usury, no pork, chastity, dressing modestly, no black magic etc. I drink socially from time to time, I have tattoos idk."
"I loaned my best friend a lot of money without having him pay me back w interest. I grew up in a Muslim household, my father taught Islamic finance I’m not a fan of usury. I think it’s source of destruction in this world. Why add fuel to the fire if someone is already burning?"
My diamond painting is almost finished I have a few more bits to add + then I’ll frame it. My next project is a cat I will work on once I get it. I also plan to buy some needlework to work on a landscape cross stitch (once I’ve picked one out).
"I don’t know which country to call home I never felt like I belonged here, my parents home country is war torn + I have lived in many other countries too."
I rewatched the movie Mississippi Masala after many years. I learnt a lot more about Ugandan history from it. It’s interesting to learn more about Indian diaspora in Africa who were bought by the British for different reasons. I personally can’t relate bc I’ve always felt nomadic
"One of my biggest interests is imperialism, colonial history, anthropology + indigenous people. Unfortunately my posts on those topics don’t get many hits. I need to shift my focus towards childfree people since they outnumber antinatalists to grow my audience."
"Sorry I have been MIA lately I’ve been unwell, partially from the weather as well as some health issues. I will try to work on my writings + tweets more. Much love to my followers + hopefully I feel better soon."

I got an email from my GP. Apparently my blood test results show my inflammation has reduced significantly since last week. I managed to do a bit of self-care + diamond painting. Still not a 100% yet but getting there slowly.
"Regardless of the fact of whether I can get pregnant or not, I plan to stay celibate for the rest of my life for 2 reasons:   1.) I’m a misanthrope 2.) The thought of being physically intimate with another human being is absolutely repulsive  #VolCel"

"I took a 4 hour nap today. I couldn’t do anything, then my fever started to play up + I felt weak + tired again. I think I might have just enough energy to take a bath + tidy room. I have been neglecting myself since Thursday when I saw the doctors."
"I haven’t been feeling well lately a 6 hour afternoon nap helped just a little, but I feel worse now that I’m awake. I hate the fact I can’t do anything productive or useful with my time. I just feel weak, tired + unwell."
Currently reading this book by a Maori psychiatrist. Enjoying it so far. I might review it if I really like it.
"I have read 15 books so far this year. I want to read more... I wish I had the attention span + ability to read more for pleasure. I love learning, but depression sometimes disables me to the point I don't enjoy things I love anymore."
I’m in love with this picture I decided to order a diamond painting version of this as a way to occupy my time.
My total Dark Triad score is 36% which makes me 2.83% Darker than the average person.   via @idr_labs
"Shamanism, Black Magic &amp; ETs (Content From My Old Blog)"
I have experienced many synchronicities + miracles in my life. I’ve had my fair share of unexplained phenomenon + I’ve had many near death experiences as well.
"I have many shortcomings as an autistic, traumatised person. My gifts are I give very soothing + healing massages, I can make some food that helps people feel healed, satisfied + replenished, my writing is healing for some ppl to read + I’m a little talented at my crafts."
I buy too many books I don’t read. I need to read more. I hoard books in print + on my kindle. I need to make time for reading as part of my healing process as well as for my learning experience.
People who are naturally gifted with mental illnesses have spiritual gifts or many talents. Normies need psychedelics to have a spiritual experience. I’m grateful to my dear friends who talked me out of travelling far away to try ayahuasca. It might have ruined me for life.
Conquer your fear of the unknown + you have conquered what others may hold against you to control you.
"Parents act like their children owe them something, the minute children realise they owe them nothing + they break the debt + enslavement cycle is when humanity will be free + that begins with #antinatalism"
I just finished reading “The Childfree Christ” I might do a book review on it on my blog. I’m a big fan of the work by Theophile de Giraud. It was a good read.
"Church Father Jerome said ""Shall a joint-heir of Christ really long for human heirs? And shall he desire children and delight himself in a long line of descendants, who will perhaps fall into the clutches of the Antichrist?"" #antinatalism #ChristianAntinatalism #ChildfreeChrist"
"According to Jesus Christ, not many people will make it to heaven, that's why not taking the risk + gambling with someone else's life is the safest bet, hence, #antinatalism"
"""Woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."" (Matthew 26:24) #antinatalism #ChristianAntinatalism #ChildfreeChrist"
"I find this funny, but it’s a serious matter"
Jesus was a children’s rights advocate.
"My highest value in life is #antinatalism bc I love AN so much + I’m passionate about it, I am able to put aside my differences + overlook most flaws in antinatalists."
"I’m starting to fall in love with Jesus   “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.” (Luke 14:26)  #antinatalism #Jesus #Bible"
My dream is to finish my book before I die to leave behind a legacy for antinatalism since I love AN more than life itself + spreading the AN message is one of the only things worth living for still.
I didn’t have fever last night I managed to force myself to shower + go to 3 medical appointments today so hopefully I’m not doing too bad. I rarely get sick. Will repeat my blood test next week.
Doctors love to scare ppl. I had abnormal blood test results that showed a high white blood cell count that’s “highly infectious”. Idk what that means. I suspected it might b strep. I may b admitted into hospital if I get worse. I feel okay. Hopefully I’m in stages of recovery.
"I feel sorry for my brother. We don’t have common interests, he’s extroverted + tries to be something he’s not to be accepted by normies we are total opposites, w a 6 year  age gap. My brother has no friends + needs people around him for everything. Life must be tough for him."
"I finally set up my brother’s PS5 for him after him nagging me to do it since yesterday. I must say I love the joystick. The console looks good aesthetically. I’m not much of a gamer I like candy crush, arcade games + Mario land. My brother + I don’t have much in common tbh."
"I want to try + finish my book perhaps this month. If I don’t reach 32,000- 40,000 words I am going to talk about birth trauma + explain some issues overlooked by potential parents who choose to procreate."
I’m going to get back to writing once my medical appointments are over. Hopefully the next couple of days will be better days ahead.
I just gave my key worker a printed copy of my unfinished AN book he’s a young Nepalese guy + he’s been wanting to read my work forever but I’ve been too embarrassed to give it to him. Maybe I could sell him on the idea of antinatalism. My psychiatrist might read my book too.
"Every child is born into debt debt to their parents, society + the rest of the world this debt is imposed on them by their parents + the govt.   #antinatalism"
"Everything in life is vain, So much pain,  It makes us go insane, Chasing illusions of glory, Every person has their own story, Behind the glamour is lies, Tragedy, sorrow, sweat + cries, All for death 6 feet downunder, To return to nothingness, To face our fear of insignificance"
I feel so weak + tired. I have so many medical appointments tomorrow
"My doctor got in touch with me about my blood test results - I’m low in B12, I have a high white blood cell count he accidentally typed cancer + I thought I had cancer. If I had cancer, I wouldn’t get treatment, I’d take heavy doses of painkillers + just die."
"We fall in love with ideas, fantasises and projections that don’t exist."
I’m not feeling well today at all I woke up with a fever feeling very sick to my stomach. Hopefully tomorrow I’ll feel much better.
"If I was a taxi driver, I would totally do this."
Every religious book should come with a warning label. Indoctrinating your child with religious ideals is child abuse especially if your religion promotes eternal hellfire as a punishment. Religion scarred me for life + even 10 years later after leaving I’m still stuck in my ways
The participation prize certificate for existence is death.   #antinatalism
Acquiring sexual trophies of meat sacks of shit + rotting flesh is the ultimate prize of vanity in a shallow superficial world.   #asexual #antinatalist
Every child is a futile attempt at acquiring vain immortality.  #antinatalism
The real God is futility. Futility is the destroyer of all things in life.   #antinatalism #futility #irreligious
Good genes are vanity symbols destroyed by futility.   #antinatalism
"This world is a wasteland + as sacks of shit, we contribute to making this world shittier than it already is without us.   #antinatalism"
"I have finally finished the 8th Chapter of My Book... I have 4 more chapters to go + my book is done. I will need to sit for long hours + expand more on the chapters in the book, then I'll need to write a blurb and pitch it to some agents so I can get it published."
"I'm writing about Stockholm Syndrome + the Parent-Child relationship in my book. The relationships mirror each other, word for word... victims of SS often hate people who try to free them, just like some people hate antinatalists for speaking the truth. #Antinatalism"
"My dad lost his walking stick, so he took my trekking pole as a replacement 😜."
The Most Perfect Of All Imperfections
"I'm considering trying to get published by a mainstream publishing company. I want antinatalism to reach more people. Yes, I have my own small platform + audience I am grateful for, but I need your average person on the street picking up my book + taking a long hard look at it."
Why I'm An Antinatalist   via @YouTube #MySecondYouTubeVideoOnAntinatalism
The system forcefully coerces people in subtle ways to procreate.   #antinatalism
Working on the 8th chapter of my book. Hopefully I will get it done in the next couple of days writing about social coercion atm.
My mother was telling me there is an Islamic Hadith that says there will come a time where people Weill prefer having no children or pets than having biological children.
"I finally finished my first PPT YT presentation on antinatalism. It's a 7 minute video. Waiting for it to save so I can upload it + share it with everybody. I still need to work on my editing skills, but slowly, I'll improve."
"Scriptures tell us to honour our parents bc they gave us life. Life is a burden + an imposition. It's not a gift. I would say, if your parents are decent human beings, respect them as people, but they don't deserve to be honoured for forcing you to suffer for their selfish needs."
It’s so hard to find resources about why parents are unworthy of respect or the high status society gives them. Everything is so skewed towards parental worship. That’s why I need to finish my book.
The research paper on Antinatalism I’m reading will give me enough of a foundation to finish my presentation on Antinatalism for my YT video lecture.
Misanthropes avoid intimacy at all costs.
The Story of Raj
"I am not quite in the same frame of mind to write. I hope my increased dose of antidepressants helps me. I have written a 3 part series about my childhood + life 2 yrs ago, I have yet to finish. I will tweet the parts + look forward to your feedback. I may write an autobiography."
"My father was in academics since I was a toddler + he said the main objective of most academics is professorship, flaunting their title, no one understands what they write + they are very perplexed + confused people."
"Well said, my friend. I talked to my father who is a non-conventional academic + he told me academics create perplexed people who are unsure of themselves + their only goal is to gain professorship + flaunt their title in front of everybody at conferences + other meetings."
My biggest criticism of academics + people who try to write like them is how they alienate the average reader from their works. I have always tried to communicate very simply so anyone + everyone can understand what I'm saying. No one wants to listen to overcomplicated stuff.
Life is full of extension therapies to extend our period of enslavement on this prison planet.   #antinatalism
My interview with @AntinatalNews is finally out for people to watch. Thanks again to Amanda for hosting me on her Exploring Antinatalism podcast

The Detrimental Effects of Fairy-tales On Children
“Marriage is the only investment people make that has no tangible result in assets that you gain. Marriage is a liability bc it always results in loss + compromise” - wise words from my keyworker today.
Everyone stalks their ex. Social media has normalised stalking. Anyone who says they don’t stalk their ex on social media is a liar or their life must be so good they moved on.
My ex is a stalker who wants me to commit suicide. He targets suicidal people. This is y I wrote 4 articles abt him on my blog. I worry about younger followers falling prey. He has the audacity of accusing me of stalking + wanting to murder him. You shudnt fuck w mentally ill ppl
My dad suffers from lymphoedemia + his feet r always swollen. My friend said diabetics r prescribed socks with silver threads to help ease the pain. I strongly recommend them for anyone suffering foot pain. Silver has antibacterial properties + has been used to sterilise forever.
"I explained to my keyworker that AN is not a suicide cult, we have many people who suffer from mental health issues who are AN, some unfortunate to be born in countries where there is a lot of stigma around mental health. AN is full of young ppl + we older ANs need to guide them."
I took my mum + my brother out today to buy their ps5 + MacBook laptop. It’s mums first MacBook + my brother’s first PlayStation. Hopefully they enjoy them.
"I just received this book in the mail today. I’m excited to read, review + maybe even reference it in my AN writings."
"I talk to my keyworker + my psychiatrist abt AN all the time. My keyworker wants to read my writings. I explained to him I have a lot of research + reading to do to write a non-fiction book. It takes a lot of time, effort, fact checking. For some reason he didn’t realise that."
"What causes atheism?  The skepticism comes when we discover we have been lied to our whole lives by trusted adults + authority figures.   The intersectionality between antinatalism, atheism + veganism is all rooted in society’s dishonesty + promotion of life scripting agendas."
Misconceptions: Antinatalism &amp; Suicide
I finally ordered this book online. It should help me write my chapter on futility in my book better
I can also finish my AN book + finally get it published.
"Since my sort of mental fiasco yesterday, my semester is finally over early + now I can start investing more time in reading, blogging + making videos for my audience. I want to write a blogpost about antinatalism + suicide. I need to dispel the myths around the two being related"
I might be getting admitted to the psych ward today :(
My parents used to be very strict when I was younger. They have mellowed out a lot more since my later teen years.
I have many traumas + Im claustrophobic. Im also scared of crowded places.
You worry too much over nothing + everything is gonna be okay.
"Smart, but naive. There’s a lot more I can learn to improve too."
Taking my ex-employers to court for their unjust deeds.
"No, bc most people don’t get me or will abuse me."
To be a bestselling author + content creator + retire early.
An unnecessary burden imposed on me by my parents + perpetuated by society.
"Not quite, there’s always room for improvement."
#antinatalism is about giving children back the power their parents have taken from them.
Every imposition brings resentment. That’s why antinatalists are sometimes hostile towards natalists. The imposition is what makes us angry.   #antinatalism
My Thoughts On The Selfish Gene By Richard Dawkins
"I am writing a blogpost on The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins - I find writing blogs on books I read as well as taking notes helps me remember what I read otherwise I forget. That's why I'm sucker for book tabs, bookmarks etc... Its always nice to reference what I read."
I love this sculpture so much. It’s a masterpiece. Especially the detailing. #Inmendham @AntinatalNews
I’m supposed to receive a bunch of antinatalist books in the next couple of days. I’ll hopefully read + review all of them. I plan to make more antinatalist content on my blog. Anything for my AN audience. If u’d like to buy me more books afterwards I’ll make an Amazon Wishlist.
#antinatalism is a rebellion against imposition.
Every human is sentenced to life on a prison planet in nature’s biological meat-suit uniform.   #antinatalism
"Life is not a gift, an imposition is a coercion not a gift, unless the gift is a gift in the world of sadism.   #antinatalism"
Every imposition in life begins with the imposition of life + existence. Everything else comes forced after that.   #antinatalism
Existence is imposition on the helpless + powerless.   #antinatalism
My Experience With Psychosis
"Feminism has afforded women the luxury of no longer needing men. I have respect for decent men, but abusers can go fuck themselves - feminism ftw."
"Men who engage in gossip, shit stirring + manipulation are sissies who are stuck in male bodies, they secretly wish they were born female but they use their toxic masculinity to oppress women out of spite + envy. They are worse than toxic post menopausal women."
My first love always told me to strive for success to get revenge on those who have hurt me. His words keep playing over and over again in my head like a broken record.
"I take ages to process emotion, sometimes I don’t feel things until much later.. my stomach starts to churn + my gut feels sick."
I feel very upset right now.
I feel emotionally scarred deeply on the inside.
I hate daylight savings
I'm channelling my negative energy + anxiety regarding my failed relationship + emotional pain into creating a ppt presentation for YouTube on Antinatalism. I promise to also try + write more antinatalist articles for my readers to show gratitude for their support for my work.
"Arab culture is an honour based culture, but misogyny has made honour based culture restrictive to women + virginity. Honour is also about truth, honesty, kindness, pure intention, loyalty + other virtues."
To taint someone’s honour when they’re innocent is the ultimate form of dishonour. A sex worker who speaks the truth is more honourable than any person who claims to be honourable but taints the honour of the innocent for their own sick pleasure.
"When somebody hurts you, all you can do is not sink down to their level + outclass them. Class is everything. Always be the bigger + better person with class. That’s how you want to be known."
I will finish my AN book + have it officially published on Amazon + available as a free ebook. I will try to put a lot of work into it. I might publish a book on Antinatalism + environmentalism + also a book on Women with Autism. There isn’t enough books on adults with autism.
Guard your secrets + your traumas against those u think love you. Most people will betray you the minute you leave them if they are toxic. Honourable ppl w class never betray the dark secrets of their ex partners. Dishonourable ppl need to dishonour others to feel honourable.
"When you’re in a relationship with someone + they do not meet your needs + you leave them, then you start a smear campaign against them disclosing all their deep dark intimate secrets to others that makes you worse than the scummiest scum of the earth."
My favourite place to escape to
Love has traumatised me worse than life itself. You can trust I’ll run 10 miles for the hills the next time I hear the word love or romance - please give me a gun and pull the trigger to my head.
"I feel sick to my stomach when I hear the words, “love” + “romance”. My heart is broken + scarred for what feels like an eternity. Few people understand this. I am repulsed by how love, loneliness + need for companionship destroyed my life + broke my spirit."
"I got ""Your Root Chakra is blocked."" on ""Which Chakra Is Blocked?"". What about you?"

"My ex apparently tried to take credit for “saving my life” after reading my suicide note he never even reached out to me, then he called my suicide plane a manipulation tactic. There were other people out there who helped me. You know who you are + I’m grateful for that."
"I started writing my catfish story about my ex I am feeling very unsettled + under the weather today. I will finish it when I’m in a better mood. I’m really struggling these days. If I die of suicide, trust me it will be in spring, bc I feel so awful."
Book Review: Women Who Love Too Much
Old World Sexuality &amp; Matriarchy (Old Blog Content)
"After I finish my readings, ease the pain in my gut + maybe take some notes, I am going to write a fun series of blogposts on my catfish like my narc aunt series. My ex thinks its perfectly okay to disclose things abt when I was with him, I'll do the same, but I'll keep it classy"
"Tonight I'm going to finish reading... and I'm going to write a blogpost, story or a poem. My heart aches, I'm in a lot of emotional pain deep inside my gut + I need to bleed out my pain + air out my emotional wounds somewhere."
My Medical Abuse Story
My Life Story In A Poem
My Religious Abuse Story
I hate spring bc the cycle of rebirth breaks my spirit + I suffer for it. I will finish reading my book + get back to resubmitting + working on my next 2 assignments.
"I submitted my assignment, probably failed bc I skipped some sections of it. At this point I don’t care. I have so much anxiety about my future + I can’t even concentrate on my study. My lecturers are unsupportive + I’m doing this all on my own."
Check out my @Ancestry DNA results!   #AncestryDNA
I don’t understand random people who send you Facebook friend requests. It makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever.
"I passed one of the toughest assignments I’ve ever done with an okay grade. Why don’t I feel happy? I have all this paranoia I will fail two of my courses this semester just bc I failed an assignment yesterday. I hate being a student, but I love learning. My spirit feels broken."
"What’s worse:  Burning in eternal hellfire / Heaven Reincarnation Existence  All of the above suck. I wish my consciousness never existed. I don’t want to evolve, live multiple lifetimes + suffer for some sadistic hairless ape human “experiment”."
"I felt depressed today bc I failed one of my assignments. I can resubmit in the next couple of days but it seems I just don’t get it. The only thing stopping me from suicide is the possibility of a gap year to escape the misery of work, study + making myself suffer."
"I’m terrible at relationships I trigger people, I say the wrong things sometimes or feel like I have to walk on eggshells. I’m too childish + immature for love. Accepting that is a sign of growth + maturity but it’s also a sign of avoidance + schizoid defence mechanisms."
A pure friendship is far more sincere + superior to a superficial relationship based on false delusions of domestic utopia.
My local supermarket has designated parking spots for breeders right next to disabled parking spots. #Childfree
A good friendship that lasts a lifetime is far greater than a broken relationship with the false illusion of domestic bliss.
"I've been reading this book called ""Women who love too much"" I've found it interesting so far, it makes me feel less lonely when it comes to bad relationship choices. Its amazing what abuse, absence + problems ppl will tolerate to avoid loneliness or to recreate their trauma."
I have been feeling unwell bc I only slept for 3 hours + I have a big assignment due tomorrow. I went out + got a large coffee + some treats to wake me up a bit. I think I will tweet some thoughts for a while before I start.
"I consider myself to be very inquisitive. I like to learn about everything that interests me. Especially things I don’t understand. I love to learn in general. Sometimes I don’t get it, but it’s okay, at least I tried to understand why."
"My goal isn’t to proselytise anyone to be childfree or antinatalist, but just to have some food for thought. That’s all. I’ve talked to all my friends + family about antinatalism + my family r the only ones who partially disagree bc of religious reasons."
"When people ask me if I have children, I use it as an opportunity to talk to them about Antinatalism. As ANs we shouldn’t be afraid of how people will react to our world views. Curiosity is part of human nature, we like to try to understand what may seem strange to us."
"If I put myself in the shoes of an undecided pronatalist breeder following my life script, I would like childfree people + antinatalists to talk to me about life + their worldview. I’m fascinated by things Idk much about. Sometimes talking to someone makes a huge difference."
They only way I wouldn’t be an AN is if all the lies I was told about existence as a child turned out to be true. If life was full of fairytales + happy endings for everybody maybe I might not be an AN. It’s really hard to say tbh.
Would you still be an antinatalist even if your life was going good + you were living the dream? I would still be an AN even if I had a good life bc I find life kind of boring + bothersome. So I don’t need any incentives to stay AN.
"I’m in a bit of a dilemma. I slept 3 hours I have an assignment I’m almost 1/3 finished due tomorrow before midnight + I can’t sleep. I might take my pill, read + try to squeeze another 2 hours of sleep then have a strong coffee to get the work done."
"My mother + one of my best friends are bird watching enthusiasts, so I follow the bird watching subject on Twitter + everyday I’m saving pictures of exotic birds I send my mum + friend. I’ve become familiar with some bird species. I am mesmerised by the kingfisher."
"Domestication of humans is enslavement. The truly free are those who run in the wild, barefoot + living straight off the land without the myriad of enslavement constructs created by domestication of our species."
Indians + Africans are the most woke antinatalists bc they have been from the pan straight into the fire with overpopulation. This is why they are among the most passionate people when it comes to antinatalism.
The little joys that come with human existence are destroyed by few corrupt elite in power at the top. But humans can’t handle anarchy so the only alternative is to be lifelong slaves.
There is no solution to the human experience except to cease it by preventing future generations from enduring needless suffering.   #antinatalism
Existence is the root of every human problem.   #Antinatalism
"Tomorrow + Wednesday I have to get as much done of my assignment as possible + finish it. It’s frustrating bc I’m really not in the mood, but I gotta give it a try. Then I’ll be left with 2 assignments + then my holiday begins."
"Antinatalism’s principles + philosophy are basic foundations to living a good life. If you don’t impose things on others, respect the right to consent, accept the uncertainty of misfortune in life + focus on reducing suffering you will have some peace in your life."
"The core principles of Antinatalism are:   - Anti-imposition - Consent - Uncertainty - Reducing suffering (no harm, no injury)  I plan to cover these points in my lecture presentation once I’m done."
Imposition is the ultimate form of intolerance. Life is all about impositions which makes existence very intolerable.
"There are many hurtful things I could say about people, but I choose not to bc I’ve never walked a mile in their shoes + I don’t know what it’s like to be them."
"My cousin called me a lunatic bc I’m not a life lover + I’ve attempted suicide. I’ll never forgive her for her sharp tongue bc words like that hurt. You are free to love life, but to impose your love for life on others + call them derogatory names if they don’t is v distasteful."
"For some strange reason, my posts on paranormal stuff get a lot of hits despite the fact a large amount of my readers are agnostics or atheists. It seems people are interested to read about entities, black magic + other dark topics I discuss."
I have really exposed many of my vulnerabilities with my readers on my blog bc of the positive feedback + response to my newer + older posts. I need to do some research on monetising my blog as google have rejected my ad sense applications.

"I’m thinking about finishing my AN book during semester break + then having it published in print, then I want to finish one semester of summer school so my first year is all done, then I’ll take a semester break to write more books."
I’m thinking about doing a YouTube presentation for AN. I like presentations.

I spent most of my day rearranging my bedroom furniture. My room is small + my bed takes up most of the room. I didn’t do any study bc I hadn’t slept properly last night. Hopefully tomorrow will be a more productive day.
Tales of A Female Narcissist (Part III)
"I hv another dilemma. So I have this best friend who I owe my life to bc she literally saved my life. We had an awesome friendship. She married + had a kid. I haven’t talked to her in 10 years + my psychologist + dad think I should reconnect with her, but it feels kind of awkward"
My brother wished his religious friend happy birthday yesterday and he told him birthdays are haram. I found that funny. I haven’t been around the haram police in a while. My mother thinks birthdays being haram is a conspiracy to avoid Muslims celebrating Muhammad’s birthday.
"Arab culture is very deep. The Middle East creates a civilisation of deep thinkers. Arab women love very deeply, especially those who have been hurt. Behind a veil of arrogance, coldness + harshness is a heart you will never find anywhere else. I’m biased but trust me on that."

"I've been listening to instrumentals for much of my day... it makes me feel tempted to move to Venice or Southern France, live on a countryside + spend my time drinking a bit of wine. I drink very rarely. I have a moscato rose with my friends whenever I see them which is rarely."
I brought a kindle holder that attaches onto my bed so I can spend more time reading. I get tired of holding a kindle for some reason. I have a lot of books to read + literature to review.
#Antinatalism is about valuing the lives of others over your own selfishness.
"Human existence is disposable. Stop calling life sacred. More humans on earth are disposable + few lives are actually valued. Only the lives of billionaires, royals + aristocrats.   #antinatalism"
"Every human life begins with superficial joy + ends with tragedy, suffering and pain.   #antinatalism"
"I read the latest issue of Nexus Magazine... I photocopied more pages to read.. I found out about a documentary titled ""The Wisdom of Trauma"" by Dr. Gabor Maté. I've read some of his works before. I might watch it and see what I get from it. My trauma has helped me grow bt it sux"
"Reincarnation is worse than hellfire, bc you have to relive the hell of existence all over again."
I read this article today about reincarnation + they talked about how Pythagoras believed in reincarnation. Apparently more psychiatrists are starting to accept it. Reincarnation terrifies me... wht if I wnt to reincarnate as a virginal untouched island of danger in my next life?
"I'm also going through a bit of a dilemma. Should I take a gap year off study + spend a whole year just resting, writing books + publishing + then come back to QS? It's a tough one. Uncertainty gives me anxiety."
"You may have noticed I have been a bit quiet lately... Its bc I have been stressed with study. I'm working on my assignments. I will tweet more when I need a break or something comes to mind. Btw, I just joined an private FB group. I don't use FB much but it should be fun."

"My posts on my blog that are by far the most popular are my antinatalist posts. I'm not sure what people like to read, but I'm willing to keep writing til I find the magic formula that gets it right."
"I don't find my life story that interesting, but perhaps my autobiography may be a bestseller. I'm well-travelled, I have battled so many demons in my life + maybe I can inspire other autistic, women of colour from patriarchal societies to pave their on way through life."
I'm more than half way through an assignment. I will try to finish it tomorrow. I have 3 more assignments left after I submit it + then I can start my vacation finishing my AN book + perhaps working on an autobiography. Idky people find my life story fascinating.
I’m a sucker for good fridge magnets to decorate my whiteboard with. My whiteboard is my noticeboard + kind of my planner. I’m a sucker for cat fridge magnets.

I can’t sleep the caffeine is keeping me up. I started a post on female narcs in my family but I’m too tired to work on it or open a book + study. I’m really struggling.
"Last year, I wrote this blogpost called ""Tales of Female Narcissists Part I"" I got a hate comment for it which I deleted, but I never wrote Part II, III, IV, V... so if people like it, I will write more stories like this   let me know your feedback. Thanks."
I have slightly lost a bit of my passion for writing. I want to write some articles on taboo subjects no one talks about I might also write about my family + narcissistic abuse too.
The Truth About Honesty
My ex was obsessed with labelling me a Cluster B Borderline even tho my psychiatrists + psychologists don't think I have BPD. My main diagnoses are Autism + Bipolar One Disorder. I may have some Cluster B traits but that's bc I come from a disordered family.
I'll go as far as saying its better to die alone than trust another human being with your heart.
"for the death of his grandma + all he could do was talk shit about me bc he semi-catfished me as a source of narc supply for his amusement. The cruelty, dishonesty, ill-will + hatred in ppls hearts reinforces misanthropy is a rational choice + being wary is important."
"My ex has told some people some very awful things about me beyond what I can imagine. All the opposite to what I truly am. I realise I'm a lot better than what I give myself credit for, I had no ill feelings towards him, never said anything bad, wanted to express my condolences"
"Last week I went to a department store + the sales lady had this beautiful soft spoken voice that was so gentle, calming + soothing. I complimented her on it... I remember doing the same with an indigenous woman years ago. Soft spoke, soothing, gentle voices are underrated."
"As much as I like my Nepalese keyworker, I find him too extroverted, optimistic, loud + outgoing for my taste. He doesn't seem to understand my suicide ideation. But he's a nice guy. He's gonna ring me every other day to check in with me."
I went to c a psychiatrist (my usual one was away) + explain my suicidal ideation to them. It was kind of a waste of time. I felt exhausted + it disrupted my study. I hate how I hv to justify wanting to die to people. If I can succeed with blogging + writing I won't need to kms.
Things I have learnt from the AN community:  - Genetic Determinism - Evolutionary Biology - Anti-imposition Arguments - About Narcissistic Abuse  Twitter seems to teach me many things I have never even heard of.
Many antinatalists are trauma survivors. Life seems to traumatise many people. I've seen many ANs tweet about narcissistic abuse + other pain they've endured. ANs deal with pain more rationally than others bc they refuse to pass on their genes to spread more suffering + trauma.
I was very sad today when I heard Amanda (Oldphan)'s YouTube channel was taken down. She had one of the largest AN platforms + she did a lot of activism for the cause. I'm looking forward to my interview with her this Wednesday. I hope her channel will be reinstated.
The Truth About Jobs
"8 billion individuals,  In a game of survival of the fittest, In a universe of cruelty and suffering, Where everybody loses + there are no winners in this futile game, Where non-conformists are shamed, Where everyone is a slave, Where delusional elite rave About futile dominion"
"I never would have made these choices, The first to be born, And then by society scorned, For my resistance and non-conformity, In a land of resource scarcity, Where cancer + millions of diseases await my fate, In a world of tribalistic hate. The only salvation is to be unborn."
The Truth About Virtue
My first YouTube video   I need to learn how to edit properly and make my work look more presentable + professional.
"I strongly recommend Clarins hydrating range for skincare. I’ve been struggling with looking for products. Their hydrating mask, mist + exfoliating scrub are all amazing."
"I brought a vape today not as good as my old one, but hopefully it stops me wasting money on tobacco. Still need to get used to it."
"I’ve been feeling suicidal lately. The weather has triggered me to sleep very long hours in bed. It seems settled but I feel so sluggish, worn out + weak. It makes me suicidal. I hate spring."
Being targeted &amp; Catfished in the Antinatalist Community
I feel sick today the weather is really triggering to me. I hate windy weather. I also don’t understand my assignment
I’d rather die a thousand times than be with a man who triggers my psychosis + labels me crazy. As if I have nothing better to do than kill him. No one is worth going to jail for.
If there’s anything being in a relationship taught me. It is “trust nobody”. I feel more adamant to die alone + never date ever again.
"I look up at the skies in wonder, I listen to the tears and thunder, I smell the air that cools my skin."
The darkest of shadows cast my soul Crimson tears that make me whole Ambiance and silent peace Slowly soothing my wounds in ease Bells ringing to mark another day Another reason to make me stay
"Stars glisten in the pitch black sky, Birds singing in the night they fly, Waves of the ocean sway, Sun rises and graces it’s stay, Cicadas blessing the early dawn, Lights cascading rainbow skies, Fresh breezes as it all eases, Beginning a new day, A cycle to forever stay."
I was gonna buy a vape cuz I gave my old one away. I have nicotine lozenges in case I need them.
Cigarettes are my anti-anxiety medication when my anxiety is severe. I don’t want to be a full time smoker tho. Only during emergencies + when I’m badly triggered.
I’ve finally finished an assignment. I’m typing it up + will submit. That will be 5 out of 9 of my assignments for this semester complete which ends next month. Recharging with a strong Colombian coffee to get it all done.
My existence is a huge struggle for me.
"I have a lot on my plate right now I’m working on my assignments + I need to finish. I’ll be slow with replies, not tweeting much. I may take a break from Twitter. I’ll wait + see."
"Very well said, my friend. Thank you. I’ll pass that onto people who have told me that they’ve been harassed by antinatalists who insist their lives are shit, when they say so otherwise."
"My ppl have suffered so much war, multiple invasions from other countries, deformed children born due to chemical weapons yet my people have on average 3-4 kids. Luckily, most ppl in my family have only 1-2 kids or are childfree. We need antinatalism bc we continue to suffer."
I’d rather have 5 hours of high quality sleep than 10 hours of poor quality sleep. I’m grateful for the 5 hours I got. I need to do some self-care + then decide if I’m gonna have a coffee + work on assignments or if I’m gonna go back to bed + wake up more fresh for study
We are. It’s time for us to go. We have overstayed our existence on this planet.
"I would never have children to “save my race” I don’t understand people who do that except those with a strong self-preservation instinct. It’s hard to let go of my nationalism, but I prefer it to being religious. I was raised with both as a kid."
"My family is v nationalistic. I was raised up on nationalism, I love my country of origin, but I criticise my own people frequently. Nationalism + pronatalism go hand in hand I think my people have suffered so much war + violence throughout history, so I’d prefer we go extinct."
"My biggest criticism of antinatalists is those that shove the idea down people’s throats. As much as I love my fellow ANs, I’m against this. I think that people have the fundamental right to agree to disagree with us. Once we take that away, we become like those we despise."
Most of my enemies were so-called friends who betrayed me. I’m only a threat to those who are jealous or hate me bc of their own insecurities.
Most people are weak and pathetic.
Last year I wrote a blogpost on how my Team Leader medically abused someone to the point of almost murdering them. I regret deleting it. I can't seem to find a backup copy on MS Word.
"It's ironic when people call you out as a grudge holder, but they themselves hold grudges against you."
"People ask me why I deny myself love from someone else I don’t feel I’m missing out on anything. If love means being controlled, manipulated + my needs are unmet, then what’s the point of love? I prefer apathy, indifference + being a nothing + a nobody."
I sacrificed a lot for other people. Now I realise most of them aren’t worth it. They should sacrifice more for me + if I value their sacrifice it will be reciprocated.
"Betrayal is about breaking a promise or dishonouring it. Testing someone is not betrayal - it’s testing someone. Actions speak louder than words if you love something you fight for it. If you don’t, you set it free + accept you never wanted it badly in the first place."
I like books on economics + politics. Not really a sciencey person. I love ecology so much + am in love with Wohlleben’s work. I like to read variety. Geopolitics is still one of my passions.
I just finished “The Selfish Gene” by Richard Dawkins. I enjoyed some parts of the book + bookmarked some areas I found interesting I plan to take note of in my notebook. My next book to read will be the updated version of “Confessions of An Economic Hitman”. I might review them.
Things I’m grateful for   - To be single/asexual/forever alone. - To be a student right now. - To be out of a toxic workplace + relationship. - To be writing again + enjoying my hobbies. - To have published my first book(s). - To be with my family again. - To have good friends.
The true face of parenthood + procreation. Parental regret is real   #antinatalism
Deconstruct the social lies + watch them unravel. Reconstruct reality + be prepared for disappointment.
The stereotype of the crazy cat lady no one wants to date + dies alone is just designed to shame women into dating + marriage. Same with the lonely incel who is stereotyped as an undesirable weirdo to shame men. Shaming tactics don’t work anymore. Pop culture doesn’t get it.
Socialisation is one of the biggest conspiracies against human beings. It weaponises the herd mentality against us but the tables are starting to turn in favour of people who loners + who have long favoured solitude over socialisation.
It’s my brother’s birthday + I can’t send him any money bc my banking app/site aren’t working. I plan for us to get some cheesecake + let him decide what he wants for lunch bc we are still in lockdown. I can’t believe he’s 25. I would have taken him out of town. Oh the bad luck.
Learn to master + love your time alone + you can master so many skills + learn so much.
If you could be alone in a room with 10 items for solitary time with no Internet what would they be? Mine would be  A notebook Pens My Berkey Water filter My MP3 player My kindle Some cross stitch or embroidery A colouring book Colouring pencils An aromatherapy diffuser A ball
Dolls are insults to the sentience of children.
No response is a response of maturity bc words are made of silver and silence is made of gold.
No strings attached is non-attachment without a catch 22.
Your greatest dreams can become your worst nightmares. Be careful what you wish for.
Marriage is a genie trapped in a lamp.
Romance is a natalist conspiracy.
Everyone is dragged into this world kicking + screaming. #antinatalism
Follow me on instagram @onetreekin to see some pictures of my solitary hobbies + crafty side.
"Sam Vaknin said the future of the world is schizoid + self-sufficient. It's better to get on board now than to waste time with mindless drones who hurt you + ruin your life. There's no better time to be alive when you have Netflix, Amazon, YouTube + other entertainment sites."
I love my followers + my actions speak for themselves. I never would have written a book on AN (still in progress) or made it free with high quality without my followers + people like @joedan346 who helped me with editing. I'm always for the ppl + you can't put a price on love.
My biggest advice to u all (I love my followers) is never settle for bad friends or a bad relationship. Find passion + love in solitary hobbies + find a way to fulfil ur need for socialisation somewhere where U R VALUED. Life is too short for toxic people + abusive relationships.
"how suffocating a relationship can be. I got so much hate from ppl bc I was his friend. Some random hotel lady told him that I seem like a control freak who is clingy.. he invites me to hang out, not other way around, he needs ppl more than I do + he discovered how wrong ppl were"
"Sometimes when you're feeling down, u can pray to God + ask for help + guidance + sometimes it will just come to you on the streets of Broadway like it did with me + my friend. One thing I must say about my friend is he can't stand being alone + it took me seeing that to realise"
"My message to any + everyone is never settle for toxic people who abuse u. It's better to be alone than to be with them. Sometimes a platonic friendship is more fulfilling emotionally than a physical relationship. If you can conquer sexual urges + loneliness, you can do anything!"
My Existence in This World Is A Crime
happy the universe brought us together. I love my friends so much + they will always have a loyal friend who cares in me who will go to great lengths to help them bc good people deserve to be in the presence of good people. We must uplift each other always.
"He offered to fly me to meet my ex, but I declined his generous offer. He also drove me to visit my cousin + see my nephew whom I had never met before. No one had ever shown me such love in my life. He's married + I am friends with his wife... our fathers are friends + I'm so"
He gifted me this plaque abt good friends + brought me a golden star while we were in capital city after church. He taught me how to value myself + he saved me frm an abusive relationship + I also managed to reconcile with my family. I am eternally grateful + we r friends forever
"day after I met him + I spent 3 months recovering frm psychosis while partially under his care. This time he had a mental breakdown + I've done my best to support him, I shared some of his amazing photography with my followers. He gifted me something special which I'll also share"
"I was also flatting in a house with people + this nasty lady moved in + tried to frame me for property damage to get me evicted. Then by some miracle, I met my best friend who is still my best friend to this day. The synchronicity between us was so strong I quit my job the next"
"Last year, around this time of year, I suffered a major mental breakdown after taking 2 weeks of annual leave due to anticipating an upcoming psychosis experience. This was due to my team leader narcissistically abusing me constantly at work + me feeling like I lost my sanity."
"Actions speak louder than words. If you wait long enough, the truth always comes out. People who wear masks will drop their masks + reveal who they truly are to you. Real people never need to wear masks bc they are always genuine, not fake."
"I have also made a note if ANYONE wants an article written on any AN related topic, I will be more than happy to cover it on my website and increase the AN content for my readers."
The blogposts that seem to get the most traffic on my website are Antinatalist-related. So I decided to create an Antinatalist page on my site so people can have easy access to all my AN content
Every time an illusion of mine has been shattered its felt like an electric shock I’m desensitised after a while bc nothing shocks me anymore. Apathy is resistance.
This world is a corrupt playground for psychopaths + narcissists + theres no escaping this hell except through ceasing existence.
Antinatalism is the antidote to the disease called natalism.   #antinatalism
Have you ever cried in your sleep + then woken up?
"Am I the only who finds crows feet attractive? In a miserable world, where we have wrinkles when we smile, you gotta love the imprints they leave on your face."
"Lately I’ve regressed back to being a child watching cartoons late at night, but I guess I have to feed my inner child somehow."
"I love the fact I have followers from all over the world, especially the ones who tweet current affairs on their country. I like to learn as much as possible about the world. I also feel happy AN is a global movement without borders + anyone can be AN."
"Last year I wrote a blogpost called ""Misconceptions About the Patriarchy in The Middle East"" where I talk about how most men in my family are cucked beta men subservient to their women who are malicious + nasty bitches   few people understand this."
"I have always had a skewed view of marriage bc my mother was badly abused by her in-laws + my dad never stood up for her once even now. People think women in the Middle East are oppressed, but they aren't, I argue many women in the Middle East wear the pants in the relationship."
"I hate geopolitics. It’s fun to study, but my biggest problem with it is somebody always has to make a deal with devil + somebody always has to suffer or lose bc of deadly alliances."
I used to believe in playing the game   - The education game was always rigged against me in other peoples favour.  That hurt me more than the dating/mating game. I realised then + there I’m better off not playing.
This meme is spot on it’s such a blessing in life to not be married or be under all this pressure from people. To quote a colleague “I’m a free bird” as free as I can be.
"In the game of life, cruelty always wins + cruelty always prevails. Natural selection is all about cruelty. Somebody has to lose, but the real losers are the winners + once you realise that, you have a weapon in your hand against suffering."
This is why I wrote my post “The Truth About School” bc I wish someone had talked to me about career options I’m brighter than my peers but so far behind them.
I’m not one to compare myself to other people but my ex friends + peers have all had successful careers in engineering that pay well. I chose to do what I love + ended up working shitty jobs. The only thing I did better than them was choose not to have kids.
"Antinatalists are mature for their ages... They make their parents + all breeders in general look immature, irresponsible + reckless. #Antinatalism ftw."
Although I am cynical + blackpilled... I'm still a hopeless romantic at heart somewhere.. my disillusion + disenchantment comes out in my research/writing etc + the fact I bleed for those who love my work.
One of my all-time favourites is Beatles Jazz Instrumentals by Ron Eschete
I discovered Jack Jezzro's instrumentals a few weeks ago. They are what I enjoy playing in my background music I quite like this playlist + enjoy the ones he's done for Disney
"With that said, the only spring I love is spring by Vivaldi -"
I wrote this post last year about why I hate spring... it will always apply   spring has the highest suicide rates + affects many people negatively
"I'm going through a bad spell of depression as it is spring... I slept really well, but just can't get myself to do things..."
I want to share my blogpost about the Gnostic Pagan critique of Abrahamic religions   - it mentions the demiurge which relates to antinatalism bc the Gnostics themselves were antinatalists. Most pronatalist cultures are rooted in organised religions.
"I can’t believe I’m saying this..one of the best manipulation tactics to get what u want from yr parents is to threaten suicide + actually attempt suicide a few times to show u’re serious. It might land u in a psych ward, but it’s effective. I learnt that from my cluster b family"
So being single + childfree in Japan is associated with being of a lower income or socioeconomic status + also lower education status. I would have thought that more intelligent + wealthier people would stay single. It’s a strange phenomenon.
"I wanted to write a blogpost about ""The Truth About Politics... but I already have a post on ""Why I Don't Vote""   so I guess I'll find something else to write about or I'll paraphrase."
I thank God I don’t have any friendships for superficial reasons or for social climbing.   I can’t sleep right now I might try to write another blogpost + finish reading + go back to sleep.
"I researched negative effects of miscegenation + even tho I’m a mixed race person myself (ancestrally) if I was a breeder, I would only have kids with my own race bc I want the child to have good mental health + feel like they belong in both sides of the family. Thank God I’m AN."
"Come to think of it all my friends have been married to white men at some point + all have mixed race children. 2 friends I don’t talk to are still happily married to white men, the other two got divorced but only the Asians + Arab did it for mixed race babies."
I understand middle eastern men come with a lot of baggage which is why you may not want to marry one. A lot of us have narcissistic parents + marrying a white guy would be more convenient in some ways but I know my ex-friend well + she wanted this a mixed baby for aesthetics.
I have nothing against white men. I think straight white men build the best civilisations out there. I just don’t like self-haters + exhibitionists who want a cute mixed race exotic baby + feel the need to throw their own entire race of men under the bus for white men.
"One of my self-hating, white worshipping ex-friends from high school had a baby who doesn’t look white. She’s prob disappointed. People who engage in race mixing + marry white men for “cute mixed race babies” disgust me. Breeders in general disgust me."

Why We Shouldn't Lie To Children
I'm going to write a new blogpost about why lying to children is wrong... it will also be an introductory part of a conclusion to my book..
"I want to express my deepest thanks, gratitude + appreciation to my followers who hv read my unfinished book + given me feedback to help me in finishing + publishing it. You guys are awesome, you keep me going + I will always do my best for you + try to diversify my content more."
"I may have some beliefs, ideas or world views that conflict w other antinatalists, but I’ll always admire them for not being followers of the herd + their intellectual honesty. Those things are rare in today’s day + age + you need to acknowledge them + give credit where it’s due."
"Being an antinatalist takes courage, a thick skin, not caring what others think, standing up for yourself + others, being prepared to lose friends who disagree with your lifestyle choices + ethical code. But the good news is childfree acceptance is becoming more common now."
"I read this tweet Antinatalism is for lonely people I disagree. Altho many are introverted, the philosophy itself is kind of lonely bc unpopular opinions take having a thick skin to adopt. I’ve seen many people right Antinatalism is right even tho they don’t like that."
I got prescribed Zolpiclone. I’m gonna save it for a real sleep emergency. I got a little sleep more than my usual but the taste in my mouth needs to be washed out with vodka (and I don’t even drink hard liquor). I’m going to try + stick with the natural way my body works.
Teach a child to procreate + every generation suffers so they can be remembered a few times. Teach a child antinatalism + their future generations are safe + they can enjoy their life with a guilt free conscience.   #antinatalism

For my fellow inhabitants of the Southern Hemisphere I hope you have a happy spring. For those in the Northern Hemisphere I wish you a happy first day of autumn.
The best decision I ever made was spending a lot of money on skincare products before lockdown. No department stores open. I really needed a new moisturiser + eye cream. I hate how I have to switch up skincare products constantly. I like sticking to just one brand/type.
"""Procreation is...""  - Narcissism - Stockholm Syndrome - Sadism  Rolled into one...   #antinatalism"
"""Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?""   Winning the lottery of nothingness, six feet underground."

"Describe how you see life in a few words...  ""A pointless + futile carnival + circus of social whoredom, suffering + cruelty with demented cancer patients on life support waiting for when they will finally kick the bucket out of this hell hole."""
"Existence is a dis-ease... everyone is a terminal patient on life support in this hell, but the cruelest part is we all forget we have an expiry date."
Non-existence is an abomination where existence is celebrated like a circus + carnival for idiots rolled into one.   #antinatalism
"If I could burn this world into ashes, the fire in my heart would destroy every planet in our solar system.   #antinatalism"
Society owes you everything for denying you the right to nothingness.   #antinatalism
"If only sperms + eggs could haunt breeders in some way, somehow without becoming embryos.   #antinatalism"
Every life is like a disposable diaper where you get crapped on + burnt in a landfill to turn into ashes + dust.   #antinatalism

A birthday is like an April Fool's joke. The joke is on everybody whose born.   #antinatalism
There have been sects throughout history or offshoots of major religions that have been antinatalist or at least very ascetic in their teachings.
A few yrs ago I was talking to a client + she told me about the Shakers who r Christian sect that used to adopt/foster many children from very rough backgrounds. They helped rehabilitate those children + they became functioning members of society. Those are people to be admired.
Adoption + fostering is doing justice to those who have wrongfully suffered from injustice + unfortunate circumstances inflicted onto them by society.   #Antinatalism
"you to the opposite extreme of asexuality + a disdain for sex. When you're younger, sexual desire is about hormones + curiosity, but when you grow older you realise sex is disgusting, overrated, a waste of time/money + the end result is always someone getting hurt somehow."
intellectual intimacy which encourages growth + challenges ideas. I don't mind or care if people watch porn as long as it doesn't hurt anybody or affect others negatively. I'm grateful no one on my TL retweets porn. When you are oversaturated with so much sex everywhere it drives
"I have a low tolerance for pornography. I accept that erotica can be considered art, but there is a difference between erotica + porn. I have grown to despise porn bc I was exposed to it by accident at a young age. I find porn, sex + intimacy a waste of time with the exception of"
I’ve done about 5 days of studying + I just didn’t feel like doing any studying today. So I think I’m gonna pamper myself + do some diamond painting + read more Dawkins before I take my sleep meds + try to have an intense day of study tomorrow.
"My bad. India banned commercial surrogacy, but its not illegal there."
Making transactional commercial surrogacy illegal is a wise decision... otherwise surrogacy would be like OnlyFans... the fastest way for someone to make $40k to pop out a baby. If I'm not mistaken one country (I think India) made surrogacy illegal. I think it should be outlawed.
Damaged Babies &amp; Broken Hearts: Ukraine's commercial surrogacy industry   via @YouTube - I recommend people watch this documentary on babies who have been abandoned by their breeder tourist parents who wanted a surrogate baby. Shows you how sick d world is.
The one thing I hate the most about lockdowns is the fact the library + swimming pool aren't open. I miss changing my environment for studying.
"I'm going to keep publishing these blogposts about... ""The Truth"" series. If shattering a few illusions can help someone, I'm happy to be the grim reaper of bad news + shatterer of all delusions. I honestly wish I had my cousin or an older figure to guide me when I was younger."
The Truth About School
This Is The First Time I've Ever Seen Anything This Freakin Positive In ...   via @YouTube - I'm really proud of these fellow ANs (StopHavingKids) when I talk to many people about AN I sometimes get a similar reaction to this video. Finally.
My psychiatrist tried to encourage me to reconsider suicide + be happy working + instead increased the dose of my antipsychotic. He thinks I should author some books if I don’t wanna take abuse from a job. I’ll give myself 2-3 years + try my luck + see how I may go
"With all due respect to children, I think children are a curse/punishment for having unprotected sex. Think abt how much sleep + wellness u sacrifice to raise em. Sounds like a curse or bundle of nightmares to me more than joy. Somehow we got brainwashed to believe its a blessing"
I have chosen a workplace in an industry dominated with men. My industry has one of the highest suicide rates but I figured it’s better than working with toxic older women who are bitches + all up in your business. From my experience men respect women with strong work ethics.
"Most workplaces are infested with narcissists. The most toxic people to work with are older women. I have also worked with narcissistic men. After a while, you get tired of the games + the gaslighting makes you lose your sanity literally."
Probably end up committing suicide bc I don’t want to be a burden on anybody + also working in an abusive environment is not worth it. It’s better to be dead. Few people will ever understand this. I can’t afford to experience more psychosomatic symptoms from work related trauma.
"I want to work again at some point in my life even it’s part time, my concern is experiencing psychosis + disabling myself from working like what happened to me last year. Perhaps my endeavour of working towards a career change may improve that. If I don’t find a solution I will"
I have a phone consultation w my psychiatrist this morning. I suspect we might talk about antinatalism or my family’s mental health history. I hope I’m deemed unfit to work or fit to only work in specific conditions compatible with my impairment as most jobs traumatised me.
First day of spring I hate spring. It makes me depressed/suicidal. Worst month of the year for me
So far I’ve seen breeders call ANs:  - Gay - Mentally ill &amp; basically say we should commit suicide.  AN has been mislabelled by breeders as: - Communism - A Suicide Cult - Atheism  So far it’s only been ad hominem attacks by stupid people.
The worst “gift” to ever burden anyone with is the burden of existence.  #antinatalism
"My favourite books:   Jessica (Bryce Courtenay), The Power of One, Hidden Agendas (Pilger), Confessions of an Economic Hitman, Grandmothers Counsel The World, Conspiracy Against The Human Race, Unabomber Manifesto, Antinatalist Manifesto, The Secret Life of Nature/Trees."
"My favourite documentaries:   Peak Oil, The New Rulers Of The World, Killing of Iraq’s Children (John Pilger), Diego Garcia (Pilger) Earthlings. Most documentaries I have watched are either about social issues, wars or environmental issues. I love DW documentaries they r awesome."
"I like music that is melancholic + I like films with tragic themes in it bc they are relatable + you are likely to experience more tragedy in life than joy. I can’t relate to happy, musical films that preach Disney’s blue pilled optimism wearing rose coloured lenses."
"My English teacher taught me to watch more “art” type films. I’m not really a movie watcher, more into documentaries, but I appreciate soap operas + films based on true life stories with some type of tragedy in them. Tragedy is what makes a story good even if it hurts to watch."
"My favourite films:   The Shawshank Redemption, One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, Girl Interrupted, Green Book, The Joker, The Omen, 10 Things I Hate About You, Pay It Forward, The Butterfly Effect, Stonehurst Asylum, Brave New World, It, The Colour Purple."
Papa Roach’s song “Last Resort” is by far one of the best songs about suicide. It was recommended to me by a friend in high school.
I listen to almost everything I have some cringe tastes too these days the songs I listen to are either from when I was 15 or they are more refined instrumentals or jazz. Sometimes I feel like I’m permanently stuck as a 15 year old.
"Nirvana, Audioslave, P.O.D, Papa Roach, R.E.M, Survivor, Zed, Yellowcard, Pavarotti, 2Pac, Aerosmith, Amy Winehouse, Beethoven, Bill Withers, Bob Marley, Bond, Chris Botti, DMX, Dido, Enya, Erykah Badu, Stellar, II Divo, Boney James, Brian Culbertson, Jack Jezzeri, Vivaldi."

I think I’ve finally got my sh*t together as a construction student. I’ve completed my first kind of proper SoQ. I spent days doing all my calculations. I hope I’ve done it right. I’m self-taught + not the best when it comes to math. *Fingers crossed I do okay*.
"People who trigger you aren’t necessarily bad people, but sometimes you get blinded by your commonalities that you become infatuated with the idea they are right for you. It takes a while to realise incompatibility doesn’t make someone a bad person."
"Sad, but true. All you have to do is be nice to your friends + relatives + they’ll bury you if you have some type of arrangement. It’s sickening when it’s a child-parent relationship."
Breeders create children who will one day bury them + they are oblivious to this trauma + pain they inflict on their offspring. #antinatalism
Tomorrow lockdown will allow getting takeaways after 2 weeks to celebrate I’ll get Indian food. My assignment will be done today inshallah + then I can start on the next 2. Need to go to the laundromat today
Breeders represent the selfish gene + antinatalists represent the altruistic gene that is meant to die in a cruel game of evolution.
"There is altruistic evolutionary population regulation where animals deliberately + altruistically reduce their birth rates for the good of the group. In humans, that’s antinatalists + childfree people.   #antinatalist #childfree"
My suicidal ideation is genetic. My grandmother was suicidal + my mother attempted suicide. But both my grandmother + mother never committed suicide bc they are/were devout Muslims + suicide is haram (forbidden) in Islam.
Natural selection favours conformists over non-conformists.
"I need to finish reading Dawkin’s book + start reading something else. I have a long reading list, but I don’t read enough. In order to be a good writer, you must be an avid reader."
"My father would always tell me that one day he will die. It was so distressing + traumatising for me to hear that. Then my father would say “it’s destiny, it’s the cycle of life it’s the fate God has written for us, my parents never stayed with me + I won’t stay w u”"
I watched LifeSucks’s video on his family + I also watched Inmendham’s video on the death of his father. It’s interesting to see people reflect on the death of their parents. It really doesn’t occur to parents how sadistic it is impose life on children who will mourn + bury you.
"Ive been a self-hating Arab for much of my life bc I never liked Arabs maybe it’s my autism. The concept of the “chosen race” is extremely toxic + it infested Arab minds via Islam. Arabs hv many good qualities like courage, love for philosophy + arts bt they need more humility."
You can’t be an anti-imperialist in your country while condoning imperialism in other places. That makes u a hypocrite which is y I don’t get on with my ppl v much bc I don’t believe in double standards. It takes intellectual honesty + courage to acknowledge uncomfortable truths.
One of my biggest pet peeves is how my family treat imperialism like a buffet. They are anti-imperialism but they condone Arab conquests in Africa + Asia. I have to forgive their ignorance bc they actually believe Islam was spread peacefully via trade in good faith.
Every time you’re dropping truth bombs + telling it like it is when it comes to life + some self-righteous person tells you to “get help” what that means is they’d rather gaslight you than face reality.
Most of my dreams that I have with my disturbed sleep patterns consist of me being back in Southeast Asia. They feel so real. It’s a pity I wake up when they’re over
I’m not a fan of Iran bc of their role in destabilising Iraq + Afghanistan. Not a fan of Pakistan either it will be interesting to see how this conflict will play out.
According to some articles written by  geopolitical analysts the liberation of Afghanistan is going to lead to two different alliances - one between India-Iran + another between Afghanistan + Pakistan. I anticipate there will be a civil war + internal conflict in the country.
"I have had Africans, Pacific Islanders, fellow Iraqis + other Arabs explain to me how China has flooded their markets with cheap goods, they give em condescending lessons on using condoms to prevent HIV spread, specifically to African ppl. And only a few countries hv fought back."
The Chinese are a threat wherever they go. I have heard horrible stories from people from many continents about the economic control of their countries. But harming your average Chinese person on the street isn’t a solution unless they threaten your livelihood + sovereignty.
"I am a misanthrope, not a racist, but it’s hard to avoid anti-Chinese sentiment. When you have a desire for economic control of peoples natural resources + you have cases of human rights abuses + an imperial past, it’s hard not to be anti-China. That said I condemn hate crimes."
Bullying is what makes childhood hell + parents enable it by sending their kids to school. When you're bullied at school the only hope you have is becoming a bully yourself + teaching people not to fuck with you or they have it coming.
"Schools are indoctrination centres that don't teach children anything except to obey authority. The parts of the curriculum of use to students are ruined by having to attend school. I believe in advocacy for more self-education, especially for bright students who r self-taught."
"I absolutely love online study... Yes, sometimes I feel lost, I don't understand questions or what my lecturer wants, but I'd never go back to mainstream study ever again. I have always been self-taught at most things + my parents denied me the right to excel alone."
I hv done about 9 hours of studying today.. the biggest chunk of my assignment giving my anxiety is finally over. I have a small chunk left + I can submit. I will need extension on my next 2 assignments bc I was unable to study for more than a week due to depression + exhaustion.
"Everyday when I use my German/Japanese electronics I am tempted to say grace bc I'm so tired of using low quality crappy Chinese products.. I'm thankful to Braun bc my electric toothbrush, my face brush, epilator have been w/ me for years. I'm thankful to Sony for my mp3 players."
Somebody recently died straight after taking the covid vaccine here + the media is keeping hush hush about it. This lockdown will probably last over 6 weeks altogether costing our economy $1.5 billion a week.
We need an investigative journalist to do a documentary on the bureaucracy behind adoption. We need to lobby for making adoption easier so less people procreate.   #antinatalism
Its much faster to use excel on your phone than typing out numbers manually on your laptop. #ProLifeTip
The Truth About Real Estate
I would rather be told the truth all throughout my life. As harsh as it sounds. It would help challenge me to be a better thinker who is more critical and it would also make me a more cynical person too.
Would you rather be lied to as a child to safeguard your innocence or would you rather people tell you the brutal honest truth you to enlighten you so either you accept it or find another way out? Nietzsche said we need delusions to survive existence.
I told him to publish photography book with his quotes on it bc he has a beautiful way with words. Maybe these few pictures will inspire him.
My best friend has been struggling with mental health issues. I’m trying to get him back into doing activities he loves. I decided to take some of his amazing nature photography + add my own quotes to it I hope he will like it + it will cheer him up.
"I tried to have a productive study day today, but I failed bc I hadn’t slept last night. I feel so tired and no afternoon nap. Who would have thought figuring out the SoQ for some trades would be so exhausting."
"If children could prevent their on conception, I’m sure they would do it.   #antinatalism"
Am I the only one who likes cheap instant coffee?
"The sin of procreation, Haunts every soul.  Plagued by imperfections, False promises to make one whole. We inherit the sins of our parents, Who conceived us through wilful ignorance, in a trance like state, Forcing upon us this evil fate."
Betrayed by my parents who brought me into this world.  Betrayed by society that promises me an oyster filled w pearls. Betrayed by my educators who indoctrinated me with lies. Betrayed by religious leaders who taught me to believe in an afterlife. Betrayed by my own existence.
"Life is full of broken dreams, That they tell us isn’t as it seems, Filled w empty promises, Only to deliver demises, Hopium is keeps us alive, False illusions to which we thrive, Butterflies + heart palpitations, Sweaty foreheads, bad temptations, Childfree is only sane choice."
My biggest fear in life is uncertainty. That alone gave me anxiety about having children long before I found #antinatalism. I don’t understand people who don’t have a fear of the unknown or are at least concerned about the outcomes of the devastation we are causing the planet.
"I am in constant internal conflict between desiring to work + wishing to take a long hiatus off work/study to ""find myself""... and another part of me wants to no longer exist. I hate how my mind has always been a battlefield with no winners or losers except casualities."
Idk if I will survive my QS qualification + pass everything. I get anxiety around numbers + calculations. I sort of enjoy it but the uncertainty in this world really plagues me so much. I refuse to work a dead end job that pays $50k a year + treats me as disposable.
I wish I was in my teen yrs or early 20s. Back then I’d attempt to commit suicide every couple of months. Now I hv a slight fear of death + a lot more anxiety. I’m not sure if I will successful be able to relinquish what’s left of my existence. Sometimes what Mum says haunts me.
I did 8 hours of studying today + managed to finish some sections in my assignment. It’s slowly coming together. I think I’ve earned my right to watch a documentary + work on my diamond painting ☺️.
I hate imperialism + invasion of foreign lands to steal their resources + abuse civilians. America has been humiliated again with defeat from a third world country for the 3rd time.
"#UnpopularOpinions - I have no sympathy whatsoever for imperialist soldiers trapped in Afghanistan. They shouldn’t have been there in the first place. The media like to paint the Taliban negatively. I’m not a fan of the Taliban, but they have a right to rule their country."
I have hobbies. They don’t include adding more people to suffer on this planet. #antinatalism
"I’m not an atheist, you moron! Antinatalism has nothing to do with communism or atheism. Take a look at the state of the world + see how bad it is. You’ve added to this burden with your 5 kids when you could have adopted, you selfish cunt."
"All of my friends hv children, but they aren’t fucktards, they’ve never told me to go + hv kids + all of them have told me honestly as much as they love their kids they regret having kids + were pressured to do so by society. The world needs antinatalists to show ppl another way."
"Childfree people do not add to housing shortages, carbon footprints, traffic, job market scarcity + every other hell on earth associated with creating more human beings. Childfree people serve communities in many ways pronatalist breeders do not yet they are crapped on."
"Long before I became an antinatalist, I have always respected voluntarily childfree people like nuns, monks + priests (the ones who don’t molest kids) bc at least these people dedicate their lives to something other than raising kids + they contribute positively to the community."
"Breeders act like antinatalists are so strange when voluntarily childfree people have existed all throughout history. Major historical figures + your average nuns, monks + priests were all childfree. Yes, they don’t tell people not to have kids but they are praised for being CF."
I would rather not exist than be forced to endure existence. I need productive ways to occupy my time otherwise I’m stuck doing nothing but spreading my legs + making carbon copies of myself bc I have nothing better to do + I’m bored.
"I despise breeders who gamble w the lives of their 5 kids forcing them to endure death + hell w go hand in hand with existence. At least I don’t create more slaves, traffic, mindless consumers + contribute to making life on earth hell + I control myself + keep my legs closed."
The only logical thing for breeders to do is clone themselves. Yet they go force more ppl into existence + gamble w their lives. It goes both ways. Breeders r destroying our planet + make the world living hell. They keep euthanasia illegal + then tell ANs to commit suicide. WTF?
One of my most popular posts which got many hits before I decided to share my blog was the dark side of arranged marriages which talks about catfishing in my family + abusive marriages people endure.
"Thankfully, my blog is getting more traffic (thank you for your support, to my loyal readers). To this date, my most popular blogposts are an angry letter to my parents + a critique of Maslow's Hierarchy, as well as a random piece of writing + my suicide note."
"I need to invest in some stock photos, editing software + study the editing style of my favourite content creators. I need to create a brand for myself. I would love to do social media as a side income bc I can't see myself working a 9-5 job again + I dread studying sometimes."
My days are nights + nights are days... my body clock is out of whack. I need to pull myself together + start studying late at night.
"Studying, academics, life scripts, peer pressure, parents, socialisation, self-discipline, consistency, herd mentality, virtue, hypocrites, scammers, distractions, skepticism, betrayal, loyalty, revenge, tragedy, narcissism, ego, cars, real estate, purpose, death, humanitarianism"
"I’m going to write blogposts on so many topics that will be truth bombs religion, politics, political correctness, honest, physical attractiveness, immorality, morality, ethics, conscience, love/romance, friends, unconditional love, sex, relationships, careers, jobs/employment"
"Antinatalism may be a death cult, but it has nothing to do with communism. Communism needs breeders to breed a proletariat class of people. Breeders who don’t understand antinatalism will equate it  to the most heinous of things just bc they are afraid of it."
"Antinatalism is apolitical + has absolutely nothing to do with communism. Every human being has the right to not be born into this world if they wish not to be. Communism needs people to survive, thrive + continue. Antinatalism is advocating for no humans left."
The Day I Found Out Meritocracy Is A Lie   - just quickly wrote this post... 700+ words in like 15-20 mins... I'm thinking of doing a series of my stories/experiences with discovering what this world really is like. It'll remind me of my pessimistic journey.
I’m thinking of writing a manifesto about how my delusions + lies were shattered by reality.
"I am indifferent to most people. I have some things I won't mention here which I dislike + have low tolerance for... but if my so-called ""enemy"" is an AN... I will break bread with them + ignore whatever superficial differences we may have bc the AN message is v important to me."
"I want antinatalism to be diverse, but also tolerant bc the underlying message that unifies all antinatalists is ethics + child rights advocacy. AN attracts ppl from all walks of life but the last thing we need is infighting. AN is apolitical + for everyone."
"My parents come from a formerly secular, ethno religiously diverse country + they grew up learning to tolerate people with different views. The only people I refuse to tolerate are those who wish to erode my civil liberties + impose their lifestyle choices onto me by force."
Antinatalism encompasses a diverse group of people. I noticed most ANs are left-leaning as soon as I began engaging with them + I made a conscious effort to be mindful + put aside our differences bc we are such a small community compared to pronatalists.
These women have been getting so many doctors and medical professionals on their live streams almost everyday with thousands of followers + they are interesting to listen to. The media here tried to mislabel anti-vaxxers but they are merely pro civil liberties + anti police state
I somehow signed some petition regarding safeguarding civil liberties + I got linked to this daily webinar run by women who have thousands of followers against the jab. I sent it to my dad + at first he hated their long live streams but now he watches + even donated to them.
Im starting to recognise myself as a bit more androgynous which is normal for people on the autism spectrum. I have never fitted in with girly girls. I have some masculine interests + generally I’m indifferent to most things.
"I’ve never identified as a feminist, I hv always leaned towards traditionalism. Somewhere down the line I’ve become open to alt lifestyles bc I realise how much limitations there are. Im an egalitarian - I advocate for everybody’s rights but I value civil liberties above all."
One of my biggest pet peeves is my family being extremely loud on the phone. I hate loud voices. I wish we were more soft spoken + gentler people. We are too rough sometimes.
It’s better to be bored + mentally ill than to force yourself to follow a life script where you will cause suffering + be a lousy parent who resents their children bc they chose to follow a life script. #childfree
"I hate how the manosphere associate childfree people with being mentally ill. It’s very sexist, prejudice + intolerant. I hate to say it but most are probably toxic incels who are life scripting conformists."
"I don’t like the word anti-antinatalist. Just say pronatalist, or breeder or natalist."
To show just how unresolved trauma can creep back into your life... my psychosis/mania occurred at the exact same time it happened 10 years ago + there were several triggers that were the same. Always look for patterns... keeping a diary is very important + making graphs as well.
"prevent an episode from recurring. Trends to look for are triggers, time(s) of year, various events, major life changes + put a plan in place to prevent a potential relapse or nasty withdrawal."
"I decided to give my BFF some space bc he seemed very irritable over text. He messaged me today + I realised that he's most likely suffering from unresolved trauma. When examining your mental health its very important to look for patterns, connections, trends so you are able to"
"I need to write a new blogpost... Or write something... I don't know what about yet... I've been planning to write about the limitations of psychiatry, paranormal stuff or true crimes from the Middle East involving the paranormal. I need to go back to my book of ideas."
I need to prepare some notes for my psychiatrist about how I have been doing these past few weeks. I’m going to explain my anxiety about going back to work + see what he says. I have a lot of self-care + tidying + study to catch up on bc I’ve been sleeping all day past few days.
I don’t discourage suicide but I don’t encourage it either. To discourage someone from suicide is to interfere in their private affairs without authority to do so. To encourage suicide is to perhaps motivate someone to make a mistake they may regret. The best thing is neutrality.
"If + when I commit suicide, u can be sure as hell the reason I did it is bc I have to work, I’m struggling with an existential crisis + I’m bored. If work was an option for me or I could make a living doing my own thing (that I love/enjoy doing) maybe I would stick around longer."
"I’m going to explain everything to my psychiatrist about work. My bro was deemed unfit to work for a long time, but his autism + other health problems r far worse than mine. Being a bit of a workaholic, I might change my mind + go back to work, but I’d love to hv option to rest."
Also the option of being in a relationship + being taken care of is not a choice. I am compatible with very few people + I’ve really let myself go bc of how much I dread this life. I also think my sexual orientation would make it difficult. There’s not much I have to offer.
"One of the main reasons y I would commit suicide is bc I have to work. Having a dual diagnosis, comorbidity compromises the quality of my life. I used to love the idea of working hard in life but I’m starting to realise it’s not for me + I can’t help it. Few ppl understand this."
"I have always been hardworking + had a good work ethic. At this point, I refuse to work unless my job is either a graveyard shift, from home or I have no colleagues. Being autistic in the workforce is hard. My last job gave me a major psychosis episode + the mania was insane."
Bye Bye babies - what our declining birth rate means for NZ
“Society makes a fake world with lies for children. You can’t bargain with nature. Nature is a backstabbing mother fucking cunt.” - #Inmendham #Quote
"“Life is entirely ignorant + stupid. We are playing a game that has no intelligence or elegance built into it. It’s all brass, knuckles, good fortune, bad luck + bullshit that runs the whole thing.” #Antinatalism #Inmendham #Quote"
We are god damn shit processors #Inmendham
I want to try my luck with video style essays
"“The basic game of life is broken from an irrational, civilised way of conducting business. Civilised people conduct business in good faith. That’s why we have contracts. But you don’t get that in life.” #Inmendham #Quote"
“Nobody volunteers to play the game their pain is completely obnoxious to their purpose in life there is no rational contract in procreation.” #Inmendham #Quote
"Inmendham is the 2Pac of Antinatalism. Some of his quotes are just gold bc of their originality, dry sense of humour + cynicism."
I wouldn’t mind binge watching some of Inmendham’s videos + transcribing some of them. Some of his quotes are gems. He really needs something published to his name that is in a written text format.
Artists starve + die for their work maybe I’ll talk to my psychiatrist about being deemed unfit to work + I won’t enrol in summer school this year + I’ll just spend time finishing my book + publish it. I have a few creative ideas but I’m having trouble functioning these days.
“An ugly standard of how define beautiful” #Inmendham
Religion is an existential scam.
"Procreation is a lethal game of superficiality, futility + cruelty on steroids.   #antinatalism"
If children truly mattered we would not bring them into this world + gamble with their lives without their consent. It’s better to abort a child than to bring it into a cruel world of hardship + poverty + needless suffering. It’s far better to adopt or foster than procreate.
Euthanasia is compassionate towards many people who no longer want to live. It’s better to die a dignified death than to live a degrading life being abused by your caregivers or those who have power over you in a vulnerable state.
"Yes there is. My grandmother said “it’s not about how many you can have, but how many you can raise to be decent human beings” - that said, there’s too many orphans + children in the foster system. Why procreate when you can adopt or foster? Especially in a cruel world like ours."
Breeders are like teenagers who go for joy rides + max out their credit cards and their children are forever in debt bc of their bad decisions.
#Antinatalism is anti-life scripts. Its all about taking back your life from your so-called slave masters by refusing to perpetuate the vicious cycle of breeding more unnecessary suffering.
Procreation is having pleasure at someone else’s expense.   #antinatalism
"I just heard this story about these breeders who adopted a baby from an orphanage + once they conceived their own they returned her back to the orphanage. It’s sad, but not uncommon. Selfishness is truly a gene in our DNA."
Reproduction is the catalyst of the enslavement of our species.   #antinatalism
#Antinatalism is the greatest form of non-compliance with the oppressive nature of the status quo.
Other species are resilient + endure so much suffering + cruelty to reproduce. They are so disposable. As humans we have are afforded the  privilege of not reproducing bc we are conscious of how unfair/flawed the nature of existence really is.  #antinatalism
"It only just occurred to me, my closest friends are all Gen Xers. I don’t have any millennial friends - there must be a reason for that maybe I’m so alienated from my own generation that I seek out older friends bc the ones my age are too immature? Hmmm idk."
All my friends have children + all of them despite trying their best to be the best parents they can be have all admitted to me at some point they regret having kids. I don’t blame them bc they are all Gen Xers + being childfree was not as common as it is now back in the day.
I don’t understand natalists who have 3-4 kids + then have a child many years later after their other children are in their late teens or early 20s. Usually those pregnancies are unplanned + natalists still go through with them.
"If we didn’t have skin covering our bones + muscle tissue, as well as our intestines + other disgusting stuff about the human body, would we still want to mate/procreate? I think not. We tend to forget who/what we are."
The highest form of evolution in any civilisation is realising procreation is a hindrance to advancement. Procreation is a basic primitive instinct that becomes more burdensome + tedious the more we advance ourselves.   #antinatalism
"The ultimate attention whores in any society are natalists. Everything revolves around their egos + their children. When you recognise procreation as narcissism, you start to lose respect for your parents."
Some people are offended by nudity. Exhibitionism is frowned upon. For some reason I’m triggered more by breeders parading their children around for attention than anything else. Perhaps it’s my autism - I always hated  being paraded around by my parents even to this day.
Renounce the world   via @ANTINATALISTO - Great message!! Normally “renouncing the world” to me means living an ascetic life for religious/spiritual reasons. This is an interesting direction where we focus on non-attachment + renounce that which is worldly.
Most people in many pronatalist societies cannot say “no” to their parents + they breed dysfunction bc they are too dysfunctional to be parents. Their parents use all types of emotional blackmail to bully them into having a family - and it’s only rooted in narcissism + their egos
The reason I wrote a book titled “Honouring the dishonourable: The Truth About Our Parents” is bc I’m sick + tired of parents using their God-given leverage to control their children + pressure them to procreate. I want to see ppl in natalist societies say “no” to their parents.
One of the reasons I’m an antinatalist is bc I’ve seen so many people unfit to be parents in my family (including my own parents + relatives) being forced into domestic life to be “normal” in front of ppl bc of societal pressure. I think ppl should be free to be what they want.
"One of my biggest pet peeves is the evil eye. People in my family keep engagements, weddings, careers, births + deaths secret for silly reasons. You always feel left out. In my case, I feel like a black sheep bc I’m so detached from this life I don’t have energy to envy anyone."
"My cousin’s wife had twin babies via an IVF procedure. She thought everyone in the family was gonna envy her. All I could think about was how those boys would turn out. My cousin is kind of a weirdo, he isn’t a strong fatherly role model + the mother is kind of a narcissist."
"I finished calculating 4 SoQ rates for my assignment. Not sure if I've done it right or not. I hope I can get this assignment done in the next few days... Its been plaguing my mind like cancer for the past couple of weeks. At this point, its about trying rather thn right or wrong"
"""All The Bright Places"" is one of the best films I've ever watched on Netflix. I like movies w mental illnesses as their main theme bc I can relate to em a lot. I'm surrounded by mentally ill ppl in my closest circles bt what infuriates me most is how the good ppl suffer the most"
I don't have many friends... my friends are few + rare gems... I cherish + treasure them greatly... but when I see all the good people around me suffering my biggest fear is losing them...
"see on Twitter to try + cheer him up. He's tried antidepressants, they make him feel worse, he can barely take care of himself + he has a family who need him. I really wish I could help him, but there's not much I can do. I hate it when people dear to me suffer + I can't help em."
My BFF has been sick for the past couple of months. He has severe bipolar disorder... last year he gave me the happiest 4 months of my life + now he can't even open an email from his workplace. He got me interested in birdwatching + every single day I send him exotic bird pics I
"I feel depressed... I want to play this song over + over again + think of my BFF   I know I bitch about Netflix being trashy, but they had this one movie on there which I really relate to its called ""All The Bright Places"""
"Rape is frowned upon by everybody bc it is about control, power, exploitation + coercion. Govts, institutions + corporations capitalise on the creation of more humans - which should be penalised somehow. Sex work is transactional, but gambling with a child's life is one-sided."
"Conquer/control/manipulate people's sexuality + you have enslaved their entire future generations. This is why every time a country is invaded, the first thing the invaders claim is the spoils of war - women + children for sex. Everything in this world is about ego + control."
The only people who have the power are asexuals bc their sexuality is in their own control + not somebody else’s who will exploit or capitalise on it. Giving someone that level of control over me + dragging innocent parties (children) into the mix is very unsettling for me.
With the exploitation of the biological nature of our species. Govts want us to have sex to create future taxpayers. Religious institutions want us to create more followers. Corporations want to more consumers. Men want to control women + vice versa. Sex is all about control
"I wouldn’t have a problem with sex if it did not result in pregnancy or spread of STDs. But the biggest problem I have with sex is it’s about conquest, power, control + exploitation. My problem isn’t with consensual, recreational sex between two adults without reproduction but"
"I was listening to a channel on YT where somebody said they’ve heard mothers brag about creating future taxpayers I don’t understand how that’s something to brag abt you mean another slave, another cog in the machine, another slave with no freewill stuck in multiple prisons!"
"The older you get, the harder it is for you to die, unless you are senile, incontinent + the quality of your life has severely deteriorated"
"Abortions are a quick, easy + painless death for most foetuses. Surely being aborted is far better than coming into existence."
Existence is spending a lifetime with a noose around my neck.   #antinatalism
"What’s worse than spreading COVID? Spreading your legs of course I can forgive someone for infecting me with a virus, but someone who has passed on the burden of existence to me.   #antinatalism"
I wouldn’t mind a relationship if human relationships were still like what monogamous animals have that makes them life partners. But humans suck. So it’s better to be alone.
"Once upon a time people needed to have kids for economic + social reasons. Now we don’t need to anymore bc we can afford to buy self-sufficiency with money. Perpetuating the myth children are a necessity only benefits govts, religious organisations + capitalism.   #antinatalism"
"Natalism is the holy doctrine that enables suffering to continue worldwide. Desire is the root of all evil, unless it is a desire to end all needless suffering.   #antinatalism"
Children are the fruit of parental rape.   #antinatalism
I love art. I used to love illustrations by Johanna Bedford I loved fantasy art by Josephine Wall I appreciate art by Hannah Dale I always loved illustrators of cottages + landscapes in old Disney stories. I fantasise about living in a small cottage in the woods somewhere.
They have extended our lockdown another 4 days - I discovered grocery shopping at night with a mask isn’t so bad. There’s no cues either. I don’t mind it bc lockdown doesn’t affect me much. I study from home + I’m a homebody who is autistic I just hate wearing a mask that’s all
"Human existence is in of itself is dystopian bc of all the needless suffering + pain. Therefore, non-existence must be utopian for both the earth, other sentient beings + humanity as well. Everybody wins, when no one can lose.   #antinatalism"
"A world without humans isn’t a dystopia, but a utopia. Most humans sadly, don’t see it that way. Non-existence can be utopian for us too.   #antinatalism"
Somebody recommended I watch this dystopian movie many years ago. I hate how dystopian movies paint humanity no longer existing as such a bad thing. I think the world would be heaven on earth without us but we are too narcissistic + arrogant to see that.
The only real estate in this world is non-existence. Estate is only of use to worldly people who desire this monstrosity of existence.
Capitalism is the “civilised” world’s cannibalism for humans.
Every live walking corpse is consumed by the cannibalism this world has to offer.
Sex is a moment of pleasure for decaying meat suits + a life sentence of needless suffering for the unfortunate byproducts of the heinous act.   #antinatalism
Every human is a shadow of their meat suit in which they are trapped
Life is too inefficient + high maintenance for most people.   #antinatalism
"I’m not a fan of cheap perfume, but Elizabeth Arden’s Green Tea perfume is among my favourites. My cousin brought it as a gift to my mum + mum gave it to me, I took it with me when I left home + my so-called friend stole it. 14 years later, I got another bottle for myself"
"My existence is exhausting + so high maintenance. I initially felt better on these meds, but I’m starting to think it was a placebo effect. I see my psychiatrist in 10 days maybe then I will know."
"Here is an official copy of my unfinished antinatalist book... its not too long, only 60 pages... if I was in better spirits I would have completed it. It's one of the last few marks of myself I will leave onto this world"
"I’m thinking of posting my unfinished AN book on my blog. I don’t know if I’ll ever finish it, but at least I can get some feedback from people if I’m still here."
Spring is just around the corner it’s making me depressed. I just might hang myself bc every year this cycle repeats itself. It’s a complete nightmare for me.
I keep having dreams of my old life in Southeast Asia
Suicidal thoughts
I heard recently that some people in Jordan are bribing vaccine administers to not take the covid jab. I hope they don’t get caught. Bribery flourishes when they make things compulsory.
"That looks like my cat, Nessie."
OMG!! We are going into a full lockdown tonight we haven’t had one of those since last year
The longest I hv held down a job is 2 years. I’m a job hopper bc I don’t respond well to routine + structure + repetitive menial jobs. The solution for me has been changing my career completely + taking a break. I dread working but perhaps a career will make work more tolerable.
The only thing that makes suffering worthwhile is knowing you can share your experience to help others. My suffering in workplaces + with mental health issues while holding down steady jobs has helped my friends going through similar situations. Working w a mental illness is hell
"My friend’s son got suspended from school for punching a person who was bullying him. I wish that as a kid I had stood up to my bullies with violence. Contrary to what they tell you at school, respect is earned when you fight for your dignity. Violence is sometimes the only way."
"I brought my first weighted stuffed animal (a sloth). Weighted toys have become a way for many people to self-soothe. This one was reasonably priced + I love it. I don’t have many stuffed toys - I gave most of them away. I only have a hedgehog my friend gave me, a doll + sloth."

"I think that’s the only happy stage in life for everybody, or most people at least."
I don’t believe in pushing things onto people forcefully. That’s the fastest way to repel them.
One of the most defining moments of my life that made me hate religion was being told stuff animals are haram by my Quran teacher. I loved my teddy bears so much + to be told I can’t have them bc they are copying God’s creations really made me mad.
It’s hard to decide which years are the best of your life when life sucks for everybody at all ages + stages.
Assuming your child will grow up to cure cancer is wishful thinking. That’s what every parent said - even those of dictators + war criminals.   #antinatalism
"I have to complete 3 assignments in the next 2-3 weeks, then finish another 3 by October 6th... then I will be free to finish my book. I might head off to the library tomorrow... I might also try aqua jogging tomorrow. I'm stuck in between reading Dawkins book + watching docos."

Sperm bank kids call for an end to the program that gave them life | 60 ...   via @YouTube
"I watched this tv show about children of sperm donors wanting to stop the conception of children via sperm donation these people are allies with the childfree, ANs + parental regret groups. I need to include a bit about them in my book."
That pretty much sums it all up
"Life is like a forest that provides you with oxygen for sustenance, but it’s so scary + mysterious you have to chop down all the trees to make life easier but by the time you’ve done that you have destroyed the umbilical cord that is your source of sustenance."
I have been mesmerised by dragonflies a lot lately this is why my latest craft project is this image
With age comes wisdom + with wisdom comes enlightenment
"Life as I was told was a clear blue mountain spring, but as I got older, I began to notice how murky the waters were. Now, they are pitch black with tonnes of phytoplankton + algae."
Fertility is the worst demon anyone can ever worship
Shopping malls are the new church alters of capitalism where we worship the Gods of money + cheap consumer goods.
I have suicidal depression again I need to stop focusing on the future
The gift of life is a decaying meatsuit that is high maintenance even for the lowest maintenance of people.   #antinatalism
My waterproof earbud Walkman finally arrived I’m excited to go to aqua jogging with my headset on when I need to exercise. I’d rather fill my ears with noise than hear other people or communicate at all with them. Sony has never let me down I have 2 Walkmans + Sony stereo.
"Existence is traumatising. Find me one person in life who isn’t traumatised by life. Everyone hides their scars, especially people who are laughing, smiling + bubbly. Their existence is the most exhausting."
Emotional affairs tend to hurt women more than men. Is it ethical to have an emotional affair when you’re counselling someone with good intentions to help them move forward + improve their family relationships if their own family don’t understand them properly but you do?
Antinatalism is such an easy concept to understand yet it’s so complicated for most people to comprehend. It’s a strange phenomena I find quite perplexing.
"My Ghanaian friend told me she’s going to buy my antinatalist children’s book + read it with her daughter. I’m kind of shocked, my friend is Catholic but she has openly told me she regrets having her daughter, not bc she doesn’t love her, but bc she chose the wrong man."
I don’t understand parents who post pictures of their newborn + write “Welcome to this World” this world is a taint of shame + abomination. I wouldn’t want to be welcomed in it bc I don’t want to be part of it. I don’t understand how a baby could ever want to be part of it.
"I was looking through my medical file I’m trying to help my friend to see a psychiatrist, get a diagnosis + start medical treatment. I’m worried about him. I’m hoping he pulls through + doesn’t destroy his career over this difficult time. Only crazy people get crazy people."
"Sad, but true"
I haven’t tried them. But my brother seems to like them. He loves his dark chocolate
"With all due respect I have never met a man worth changing my religion, diet, interests or geographical location for. He would have to be very special for me to change. I wouldn’t change for anyone, but I’m open to being influenced to change gradually over time (possibly)."
Mental + neurological disorders are society’s labels for non-conformists.
Most humans = are noise  Few humans = are like a symphony orchestra.
Misanthropy is universal acceptance of the malevolent nature of human beings.
"Misanthropy is the antidote for racism. Misanthropy doesn’t discriminate - disliking people of all colours, races + creeds equally is best. It helps you become neutral. Neutrality + indifference is where you find peace + somewhere alone, away from people."
I watched this interesting movie called Outsourced it was eyeopening on the poor work conditions in call centres third world countries endure due to outsourcing of labour jobs from the first world.
Happy Independence Day to India!
Unearthing the illusions of existence leads one to become a cynic.
"By escape plan I mean being able to leave a toxic workplace, or a place that is detrimental to your health it applies to everything from relationships to life in general."
The best life hack I recommend to everybody is to always have an escape plan. It’s better to leave gracefully than to be forced out of a place. Having an escape plan guarantees you peace of mind + an internal place of security.
Last night I watched some documentaries + did some diamond painting. I feel depressed as fuck + I don’t know what to do. My close friend has been depressed + might be bipolar too - I hope he gets the treatment he needs.
"I’m not made for this world, that’s why I resist being part of it."
"I watched a documentary on Jeffrey Epstein on The Engima Channel OMG, it was so disturbing. When I realise how much this world is ruled by perverts + creeps it makes me sick + grateful to be a non-sexual person with no creepy predatory tendencies, weird kinks or fetishes."
Everybody is a corpse in the making. Procreation is the initial stage of the carcass making life cycle.   #antinatalism
"So I'll be off Twitter for a bit. Getting assignments done + preparing for some free time to work on my book. I need to prepare for my interview with OldPhan next month (so I'm trying to get as much wrapped up as possible). Will miss you guys, take care + much love ❤️."
"I just woke up from a strange dream I had that I was reunited with one of my best friends I haven’t spoken to in nearly 10 years. We didn’t break up, we drifted apart due to the usual circumstances. I find it strange to reach out to someone after so many years. I hope she’s okay."
I despise normie hobbies..I dislike their world. I don't understand why I have to be fake-nice to people I'm indifferent to. I'd rather talk to an AI than another human being. I want my relationships to be transactional bc I don't understand ppl very well... + I just wanna be me.
One of the reasons I'm a misanthrope is bc of autism. People are intolerant. If you don't spend your time following pop culture + watching reality TV with mainstream hobbies ppl think you're weird. I want to live in a world where I don't need to fake being NT to be accepted.
It's harder to live with mental health issues than with a neurological disorder. Trauma especially is the worst bc for me it manifests in the following ways:   - Migraines - Dizziness - Seizures (I haven't had in 12 years) - Insomnia - Paranoia
My Struggles With Autism:  1) I don't understand or fit into the NT world. 2) I can't read some social cues. 3) I hv a monotonous voice sometimes. 4) I process information slowly. 5) I'm emotionally immature. 6) I'm socially awkward + get sensory overload from being around ppl.
"In a nutshell...   - Many of my skills are self-taught. - I'm relatively self-sufficient. - People either have to add value to my life or I ditch them if they hinder me in some way. - I dislike noise, children, crowds + traffic.  I'm happy being autistic... I don't want to be NT."
My Autistic Superpowers..  1) I do things the more complicated way 2) I notice patterns quite easily 3) I can watch a 5-6 hour documentary in one sitting while doing needle work or another craft 4) I'm good at reading people + sensing their energy 5) I feel alive when I'm alone
"I need to focus on health, fitness, sleeping, reading + writing my books. Writing is my passion, not this diploma I’m doing. I love to write, especially for people who read my work. But to write, you must read + research a lot. I will be back soon tho. Might take a while."
I’m thinking of taking another break from Twitter to focus on my assignments. I have started to get back to my old ways of procrastinating + oversleeping. If I can get about 4 of my assignments done that will be most of my course work over + down with
"Happy Friendship Day to my best friends online + offline... You make my world more tolerable + less lonely. You are my second family, much closer to me than people who share my DNA that I have complete no contact with. ❤️❤️❤️"
"My friend also had numbness in her head, arms + legs after the shot. Just when she started her new job... I hope she manages to get out of getting the second shot."
One of my BFFs just rung me right now. She was bullied by the doctors into taking the COVID shot. She had severe heavy menstrual bleeding as a result of it which led to her being hospitalised + needing iron injections. They r bullying her into getting the next shot. I'm worried.
"Maybe it’s just me being autistic since many autistic people don’t like small children, but I don’t understand women who work in daycare centres or early childhood teachers. I don’t have the patience for children, so I wonder how do all these ppl leave their kids w strangers?"
"Society lies to you abt many things:  - History books are propaganda full of lies or half truths - Society tells you looks don’t matter but they do - Society tells u, u have potential when in u r another cog in the machine  Why would they tell the truth abt having children?"
"Society promises you happiness + fulfilment with children but next time ask yourself, how many times has society lied to you + gotten away with it? Can you really trust their empty promises especially when it concerns someone else’s life? #antinatalism"
"Most natalists think a child will “save” their relationship or improve it, but in reality children strain every relationship. They really put your patience, tolerance + endurance to the test. #childfree"
Most people have children to maintain a false image. #antinatalism
"The truth is ugly but it will set you free + open you up to many opportunities you didn’t even know existed. So in a beautiful strange way, you need to embrace the ugly to find that which is beautiful."
"I might outline in final section of my book ways we can campaign for antinatalism + steps to lead onto it. I think best approach is baby steps + the first starts with being politically incorrect, honest + removing stigma from the truth. Once we have that, then we can talk abt AN."
Procreating is the most reckless + impulsive decision anyone can ever make. #antinatalism
"I wish we could have a campaign for antinatalism that is mainstream, but that’s difficult, we will face too much backlash. We have to play their game + infiltrate the mainstream slowly in order to really have influence on others."
"Being an autistic woman is hard. Autistic women choose comfort over style it’s hard to believe in traditional gender roles entirely when you don’t technically fit into them easily like neurotypical women. You prefer natural fibres, minimal or no make up + flat shoes."
"True masculinity does not depend on dominating women. There are still plenty of men who are masculine but channeled that energy into science, philosophy or service to others. To need to dominate something weaker than you physically is a weakness itself."
"Femininity is a luxury in this day + age. Only wealthy women who don’t need to work much can afford to be feminine. Feminism has exposed the ugly nature of man, just like antinatalism has exposed how adults scam children. The truth is never a bed of roses."
"The truth is always ugly, that's why people hate it so much. Its better to embrace the ugly than to suppress it bc it doesn't meet your beauty or comfort standards."
"Misogyny is rooted in jealousy/envy of women. Men who need to carry the ""burden"" of women to feel masculine or alive are insecure... The best solution is to be a lone wolf... everyone is a burden on somebody else... its best to carry your own weight on your shoulders."
"I'm sick + tired of my Kindle Paperwhite playing up. I've had it for almost 2 years.. hardly used it. Wish it was still under warranty, I'd exchange it another eBook reading device. I have taken a break from everything I'm reading + just reading my Autism book bc its fascinating."
"One of my best ever (IMO) blogposts.. ""The Power of Kindness""   ... contrary to what many believe... kindness is one of the most sought out virtues people look for in a partner. But in a dark world like ours, some have to suppress it to protect themselves."
"I have just finished writing ""Chapter 8: Narcissism Masked As Altruism"". Im over 17,000 words... I need about another 15,000-20,000 words... 2/3 of the book is done. Now I can take a break from it, try to submit 2 assignments before I go back to writing more of it..."
"My favourite section of my book thus, so far... is the one on parenthood + narcissism, bc I get to rip breeders apart in that section."
"The chemical castration of psychotropic drugs is one of the best inventions for the asexual, autistic, schizoid, misanthropic, easily disgusted person with abandonment anxiety."
"I think I finally found the perfect cafe for me to go to, to do my writings, research + relax"
I’m sick + tired of sex in film/tv. It gets old when that is all you see in media + you all the time + you have no interest in getting it on with somebody. The entertainment industry is basically all soft core porn designed to make people horny + dumb enough to breed.
"In about 6 weeks time, I'll be doing an antinatalist podcast about my children's book with Oldphan. I hope I can finish my other book around that time so I will have an opportunity to talk about it."
"I started my chapter on futility but I only got as far as a 1000+ words. I'm officially half way through my book. This chapter is incomplete + I feel far off from even finishing the book... Writing is hard work, but I enjoy it."
"I want to write a short book called “Life Hacks: Advice I Wish My Younger Self Knew”. I want to keep it short + sweet + discuss various issues in general related to life, kind of like a self-help book, but it’s more black-pilled for any young person to read at their own risk."
The lies of existence rely on scamming children to survive. Breeders are the lowest of the low. #antinatalism
That’s why psych wards are the best places to find friends - at least for me that’s where I found comfort in being myself RT
"I’m reading Emil Cioran “A short history of decay” + OMG, I’m head over heels in love. Trying to put down this book down will be very difficult. I have a few ideas how I’ll start my next chapter I feel a bit tired tho. I didn’t take my antihistamines, bad sleep + had a hot bath"
"Twitter, what are u into that isn’t politics?  I like: - Cats - Sleeping - Cooking for others - Hiking - Reading - Documentaries - Crafting - Road trips - Friends - Interior Design - Music - Assembling Furniture - Maps - Conspiracies/Paranormal Stuff - Trees - Scenic Photography"
"I’m thinking about my chapter in my book titled the futility of life it might be even more depressing than my last chapter which makes me wonder, should I publish my book(s) and then end my life bc it’s futile + all I seem to preach is my acceptance of futility?"
Ecclesiastes - A Teaching Series by Dr. R.C. Sproul
"""No one recovers from the disease of being born, a deadly wound if there ever was one."" -- Emil Cioran #quote #antinatalism"
Sometimes I think some men are pro-life to control a woman's fertility... at least that's the vibe I get from them... it scares me + makes me wanna run from the hills away from them.
"This year Poland made abortion illegal unless the child is conceived from rape, incest or pregnancy endangers the mother's life. Its sad to see the poor Catholics advocating Pro-Life ideas for women there that are so backwards and archaic"
How To Sell Something to Someone Like Me.
"The only time I see it as appropriate for me to ""advertise"" antinatalism is when my childfree status comes up as a topic of discussion. Otherwise, I barely mention it, unless perhaps the conversation is about existentialism or touches on it briefly."
"No one needed to sell antinatalism to me, bc I have craved death + dreamt of it since I was a kid... and being told this isn't normal led me to seek out people who validated this was what drew me to antinatalism. Many people don't understand that."
I've been looking for answers in my life since I was a kid.. I looked everywhere + then I found antinatalism which was d answer to many troubles that plagued me. When u believe in something so strongly u will do yr best to present it in the best light possible + others will c it.
"Antinatalism doesn't need people to sell it. The philosophy sells itself. I found antinatalism on my own without anybody having to try + introduce me to it. Every product, good, service, idea, belief system or philosophy can sell itself - it will always attract truth seekers."
"I watched a video by stop having kids + I’m proud of their work as Antinatalists. I would be a bit too shy or awkward to hold up signs telling people to not have kids. I’d do it with a group of people, but I don’t see myself doing it on my own."
"We have to attract people to AN by being creative, honest + witty in our propaganda campaign... so cartoons, literature, aphorisms, static imagery, artwork... that is how we draw people to the message."
"You need to put yourself in someone else's shoes. Natalism is part of the life script, the life script is the very essence + foundation of people's existence (similar to religion) that is why people get so triggered, upset or offended when someone mentions AN to them."
"When I was religious, I was against proselytism bc I believed we had to be examples of what we believed our faith was. It's the same with antinatalism. Both (ir)religion + antinatalism have one thing in common + that is they hit a strong nerve in people that triggers them."
"I wnt to write a post on my philosophy of how I think people need to spread things like religion/irreligiousness + antinatalism. I don't like the idea of proselytising people, I want to create resources for antinatalism + lead by example + naturally attract people to the message."
My country has 5G towers (finally) I think this COVID thing was a distraction to roll out 5G + they succeeded.
I want to relate to people but I can’t unless we share common emotions. I don’t think I can ever truly relate to people much bc I’m autistic. My brain functions differently.
I feel like a coward bc I don’t think I can face life without medication. It’s almost like it makes me a blue pilled normie when I’m far off from that.
It’s so weird that when I’m on medication I’m a completely different person. I feel guilty I can’t relate to the people on my timeline who are passively suicidal anymore. It’s like I can’t understand why they feel that way + I have to rely on my past memories to relate to them.
"Before America destroyed Iraq we had free education, healthcare, strong middle class, we were secular. Women had one of the highest female literacy rates in the OECD. Iraq had dignity + people respected us. Now we are a drug hole full of widows, orphans + religious freaks."
"I’m sick + tired of an Iraq ruled by militia groups from Iran w no loyalty to Iraq whatsoever. At least Saddam + Ba’ath actually loved Iraq. Everyone including Iraqis is quick to throw their country under the bus. I understand why, bt my loyalty is bc blood is thicker than water."
"When I was growing up I had a choice between Islam + nationalism, I chose nationalism. They are both dead ends that benefit corrupt people, but I still have a soft spot for nationalism only bc it saved me from the evils of religious fundamentalism."
"I’m trying to break free from nationalism bc it’s associated with procreation, but I still have my Ba’ath flag, I have so much Ba’ath merch + my love for Saddam grew when I saw what Iraqi politicians did to Iraq after Saddam. I want a sovereign, free Iraq that protects minorities"
I heard from my parents Saddam Hussein’s daughter Raghad might come to Iraq + rule again that would make me so happy. Iraq needs a strong leader. It’s time to get rid of the corrupt politicians + rebuild a better Iraq. I only love the Hussein family bc they trigger so many ppl.
"I'm up to page 49, chapter 6 in my book... I'm so happy I got this depressing chapter finished... I will need to do more reading for my next chapter... I'm enjoying this... hopefully my book won't disappoint anybody..."
"Dear Breeders...   This world is fucked up. If you can't fix it, your children certainly can't/won't. No child should have to inherit your shit with a genetic pokies machines without their consent.  Sincerely...  A Concerned Citizen.  #Antinatalism"
"Dear Breeders,   Sentient beings should not be considered investments bc it is ethically wrong + your children are wildcards. Best to take your gambles to the pokies machines than with someone else's life without their consent.   Sincerely... An #Antinatalist"
Every child is a result of somebody else's mistake. Be it contraception going wrong or some idiot deciding to have kids + then regretting it. #antinatalism #childfree
My dad wakes up in the middle of the night to work... I need a cuppa + I make myself a mochaccino in the kitchen + then he keeps me there for like 45 minutes talking about his problems or current affairs... talking is exhausting for me sometimes... I woke up to get some work done
"I have 47 pages of my book written so far + that's not even half way, I'm getting closer to the half way mark + I've been writing for just over a month with a few weeks break. When I get tired of doing assignments, I switch to writing. I hv another idea for a children's book too."
"Christianity is more antinatalist friendly. Islam is a pronatalist breeder religion that is worldly + acts obsessed with an afterlife when it clearly isn't... if I had a choice, I'd choose Christianity over Islam... at least its compatible with antinatalism (which is my life)."
"My mother was telling my philosophy (antinatalism) is anti-Islam... I told her, it doesn't have to be... if u choose to be a righteous Muslim + not procreate, u can ask Allah for as many kids as u wnt in heaven + u will have a clear conscience knowing they didn't suffer on earth."
"It's hard being an artistic person... I burn myself out, I overwork then underwork, I have to switch between school assignments, writing my book and vice-versa, my terrible sleep patterns + then oversleeping + working late. The end result is worth it, but I'm exhausted af."
"Here’s a picture of my handsome boy 😍😍😍 the Lochness Monster, named Nessie ♥️♥️♥️."
#NationalParentsDay is “let’s do nothing in life but spread our legs + have sex and get all the glory from the world for it” day. #antinatalism
#NationalParentsDay is National celebrate “let’s gamble with our kids lives without their consent” day. #antinatalism
So apparently it’s #NationalParentsDay today which means it’s “let’s breed more suffering + death day for non-consenting individuals. #antinatalism
I refuse to be a needy person in my life I only accept help when it’s offered to me bc I have way too much pride.
"Many autistic people are self-taught people who have taught themselves how to read, do math or study. Yet neurotypicals are obsessed with socialising, friendships etc bc they are threatened by people who don’t need other people."
Black and White thinking is a common trait of borderline personality disorder + also autism spectrum disorder. It is not surprising I was misdiagnosed with BPD bc ASD is much harder to spot in women than it is in men. It’s hard for my brain to see shades of grey when I think.
"There are 4 personality types for autism: aloof, passive, active but slightly odd + overly formal and stilted personality.   I feel I fall into the aloof category. I act indifferent to people and have flat effect in my expressions + am distant to most people."
"I feel tired most days... and not as productive as I'd like to be. I'm not depressed... I'm just reading, catching up on my sleep + trying to find a spark to keep going with my writing + study..."
"An old blogpost (email) I wanted to share (I wrote 9 years ago and published on my old blog)... ""I came out of the (religious) closet"" -"
My body is compensating for my months of terrible sleep. I can barely get any work done bc I’m so addicted to my sleep.
This is why I don’t date
I woke up early today - 5am. Slept okay. Decluttered + cleaned my room did 2 loads of washing. Will head home soon. Maybe I need another nap to recharge before I do more study.
"My BFF found Thai Mangosteen in our supermarket 😍😍😍. I love Mangosteen, it’s one of my favourite fruits too bad I don’t live in his city."
"No offence to neurotypicals but I find their world absolutely boring. I hate sports, pop culture + almost everything mainstream. I have no interest in dating or living similarly to them. I don’t need to socialise much with people, I find fakery + comforting lies nauseating."
I hate the neurotypical attitude of majority rules + their fascist attitude of forcing autistic ppl to conform to their standards. Imagine if neurotypicals were the minority + autistic people forced them to conform to their standards. I think people should be more accommodating.
"Started reading these books I need to know more about myself, so I can be a better advocate for autistic people, especially women since it’s a predominantly male disorder."
I’m starting to think I never had BPD. I think I always had autism but it was misdiagnosed as BPD + that’s due my black + white thinking. My early repeated suicide attempts were probably due to frustration + inability to manage my emotions. Lots of ppl w autism get misdiagnosed.
People tolerate all kinds of abusive relationships bc apparently “dying all alone is the worst thing after death” it’s bullshit. All you need is a strong community or a few good friends + you’re good to go.
"In the past, women tolerated men bc of dependency. Men tolerated nasty women out of fear of loneliness. Nowadays, no one has to tolerate anyone anymore I like it that way."
I asked my brother why he’s obsessed with buying souvenirs in a country where he was born/raised + he said it’s to show his patriotism. I thought that was kind of funny + a good way of looking at it.
"My friend taught me to cherish myself, to guard my heart + never settle for less. I have always had low self-esteem + I’ve always settled for less, bc I devalued myself a lot, but now I learnt to value myself more."
"When u meet a man who is simple, yet classy, refined, a gentleman, a kind w a good heart who knows how to treat a lady, u learn to cherish yourself more + to not settle for ppl who hurt/devalue u. Women have learnt nowadays it’s better to be a femcel than to lower your standards."
"It’s better to show a woman you hate her to her face than to be a fucking coward + pretend to be her friend. I would have been indifferent to her but now I see her as a two faced, weak, creepy, mentalcel, Jesus freak who needs a house full of cats to fill her void of loneliness."
"At least I respect his boundaries as a married man. He’s taught me to have higher standards when dating (not that I ever will do it again anytime soon) + I don’t text my friend everyday. I see some nice bird pics on my feed + send them to him from time to time, but that’s it."
Women can’t be friends bc of men. My BFF + I are family friends + our friendship will probably last til death do us part. One crazy lady in his apartment complex still texts him everyday months after he left + she tried to “befriend me” + hated the fact I spent time w him.
I love geopolitics. I miss political writing. My current chapter in my book touches on environmental geopolitics + warfare regarding natural resources. I’ll always add something related to politics in my writings especially when the context is relevant to the topic.
"Life is a candy shop laced with antifreeze the more we consume, the sicker we get, until we die from a heart attack. Don’t trust the adults who own the candy store meaning don’t trust your parents or institutions that control your existence."
Yet everybody tells us life is a fairytale no wonder we grow up so depressed. How can we trust a system full of institutional liars?
Life is either a tragic tale or a horror movie. Depends on your luck + what cards the genetic lottery deals you.
Humans have way too many flaws + imperfections in a society that demands unrealistic immaculate perfection that is almost non-existent.
Breeders be talking about censoring films that scare children but the biggest horror movie is life itself + people keep dragging more children into this average 85 year long horror movie like it’s nothing. #antinatalism
"I feel like I’ve come out of the closet many times I’ve come out of the religious closet, the political closet + now the (a)sexual closet. I will post my coming out of the closet story from old blog to help others coming out of the religious closet."
"My problem with organised religion is I can’t fully break free even 10 years after leaving. I am very much a cultural Muslim - I only drink socially, no pork, am celibate, don’t deal with usury, dress modestly, use my right hand a lot. Religion is trauma imprinted on you forever."
Life is an obstacle course full of games except you can have (what feels like) infinite lives.
"I suffered my whole life bc I never had a diagnosis for autism til I was 30. I refuse to change. I dont wnt to do anything except bare minimum to ""blend in"" to a normie world. If normies don't like tht they can kiss my ass. I dnt expect to b pandered to just treated w compassion."
Autistic people have the highest suicide rate of all disabled people. Same with unemployment rate + many end up incels or femcels... the world is cruel to us + on top of that normies try to take every last bit of what makes us happy from us. I won't stand for it.
"of disabled people. Autists are born into a normie world, we have to behave like normies + please them. Autistic people have done so much for the world in terms of music, art, STEM + they get crapped on by normies + none of them make an effort to adapt to our needs or our world."
"someone else ever again + they abuse me for not socialising with people, I will talk to my employer or HR. If they do not understand or accept the fact my autism is the reason I hate socialising + small talk I will take them to the human rights commission for intolerance + abuse"
"women. I get on better with men. I have a slightly ""male"" brain. I have non-conventional interests many people don't have. I hate socialising + small talk. I have realised the problems I had at work all were to do with other people + my disability. If I ever have to work for..."
"Today I went to the public library + I picked up 3 books on autism, 2 of which are on females with autism. I need to sit, read + learn more about myself. Getting this diagnosis has helped explain many things in my life I didn't know about myself. I have never been much like other"
"I grew up in a Muslim household so, none of those fictional figures. But I do remember my friends being gutted as kids finding out Santa isn’t real."
"I think children resent their parents for lying about Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy + the Easter Bunny. It’s almost like adults are disrespecting children + treating them condescendingly bc of their naivety. It’s morally wrong. Tell them the truth or tell it as a myth or legend."
"Tell people the truth no matter how ugly it is, but do it gently, with compassion + kindness from a place of good intention. That is my philosophy in life. I will preach antinatalism + other “dark” philosophies but my intention is honesty, truth, realism + reducing suffering."
I will only tolerate fairytales with a taste of wisdom + realism to them. I believe in preparedness for the real world. I despise fantasy that disillusions people. If I had to choose between dystopian literature I read as a kid + fairytales dystopian will win all the way.
"Fairytales are poison to the minds of children. We need a reformation around fairytales in all seriousness I think fairytales are the culprit behind my depression + misery. I prefer more realism. Realism can be ugly sometimes, but I prefer it to the lies of fairytales."
"Reality shatters the fantasy of romantic relationships. To still believe in love beyond that age is the ultimate form of naivety it’s not surprising that older women get scammed so much online by “tall, dark, handsome, Prince Charmings” online."
"Erotic novels aside, if a woman beyond high school age is still reading romance novels, she’s probably emotionally immature, childish + still living in fantasy world. It’s one thing to be a hopeless romantic, but another thing to be unrefined + childish."
"Open my mind, open my heart, enrich me, inspire me to create + my heart is forever yours ♥️."
"People don’t understand what I see in some people sometimes it’s the beauty of their heart + mind. They might not be the most attractive, wealthy or successful people but they bring out the best in me. They are rare + hard to find, that’s y I’m asexual + am happy alone on meds."
Orgasms for the mind are extremely underrated + they are the only orgasms that matter IMHO. Sexual stimulation is easy - anyone can masturbate..but intellectual stimulation is WOW I never thought of that. Intellectual stimulation promotes mind evolution. Its beautiful intimacy.
"I love the way Schopenhauer used to write essays I want to write more essays too. Sometimes you want to reiterate a point, but it’s not long enough for a book, so an essay is the next best thing."
"Last night I took my antihistamines + they gave me 5 hrs of sleep which is my sweet spot. 7 hrs I feel really good, but 5 is also good. A much better alternative to benzodiazepines or zopiclone. At least now I can focus my energy on study, projects, exercising + eating healthily."
True happiness is in a realm of nothingness. Real happiness lives in an undisturbed realm of eternal peace. #antinatalism
The meaning + purpose of my life doesn’t depend on creating another human being. #antinatalism
"The only person that will hold my lovingly + embrace me is death + nothingness at least the peace + love is unconditional + I can feel safe being intimate with death, for death liberates me from life + lovingly embraces me with my skeletons, flaws + imperfections."
Liberation from the unwanted burden of sexual desire is the greatest liberation there is to experience. But what you cannot ever liberate yourself from is the demon of fearing intimacy
"My primary diagnosis according to my psychiatrist is Autism Spectrum Disorder with the comorbidity of Bipolar Affective Disorder One. They suspected ADHD at some point... I've been diagnosed with Borderline, but I feel I no longer fit the criteria for those diagnoses."
"I want to leave behind some research, writing + literature for AN. If I'm good at something + I'm gifted in some way, why not? It's not about fame or anything other than contributing to the truth of all truths + showing people a way to partially reclaim what was stolen from them."
"Antinatalism is the best legacy to leave behind - whether its thru artwork, writing, activism, public speaking engagements... its the best way to be remembered bc it advocates for children's rights, women's rights, human rights, unborn rights, environmental rights + philosophy."
"I even told my psychiatrist I hope to die somewhere between 50-60 + I might opt for euthanasia or a painless suicide when I reach that age bc I don’t want to be under anyone else’s mercy + life is futile, pointless + meaningless + I’m only still living bc AN is worth living for."
"I’m taking my brother to preorder the PlayStation 5. I’m so happy it’s coming out so I can get him a PS5 game for his birthday. I’m not a gamer at all, but it’s my brother’s first PlayStation. Hopefully he will enjoy it. We have always been Nintendo 90s - early 2000s gamers."
I like my RBF. Hate when guys would tell me to smile all the time.
I went to my psychiatric appointment today + I got prescribed an antihistamine to help with my sleep. My new psychiatrist asked me about antinatalism + I explained it to him - he congratulated me on my book + we enjoyed chatting so much. I told him the only reason to live is AN.
"I had a dream about washing machines + losing my washing machine there + being gifted earrings I have weird, funny dreams. I do love earrings + I love doing my washing too"
"I’m thinking of buying an underwater waterproof MP3 player headset. I always exercise with music on + if I wanna take up swimming or aqua jogging again, I’ll need something waterproof."
Existence in society is a rigged monopolised game of chess. Perhaps the decay of society is a good thing bc so many social norms are actually designed for society’s best interests + not our own. I despise society for over socialisation + religious institutes.
I find the drive to have sex an unnecessary burden that is animalistic + degrading. Besides procreation + pleasure what’s the point of having sex if that person is gonna hurt you? Celibacy gives you back your sense of power over your desire + others ability to control you.
Organised religion traumatised me. It made me feel toxic emotions like shame + guilt for no good reasons + I felt massively scammed by it. Few people understand that.
"""It is better to be prepared for the worst than to hope for the best."" #Pessimism #MyQuote"
Amen! 🙏
I woke up from a nap not really wanting to do any work... so I decided to design the cover of my book... I still haven't done any writing in weeks. I need some more drive/motivation...
Tomorrow I meet my new psychiatrist. My father has met him + says he’s nice. I may need a change of medication due to the disrupted sleep + insomnia. I hope we will be compatible + he will prescribe the right medication for me. I have so much work ahead of me + I’m so tired.
Im finally reading “The Selfish Gene” by Richard Dawkins - I don’t know much about evolutionary biology but I could sure use some insights. Hopefully it will shed some light on human nature + procreation.
beings do not have our level of consciousness or intelligence + they are happy to follow their evolutionary programming + replicate suffering like its nothing. So why stop them when its not really in our place? This is probably y I will always lean towards the side of the vegans.
"I don't mind if the earth still remains while we are gone + the planet can still sustain life. The problem is suffering is part of existence + that exists for sentient beings, but our consciousness + intelligence + being aware of it is what makes our existence dreadful. Other"
"either. I think this dilemma troubling my mind can only have one stance (+ here is where my idealism comes in) + that is, I want a consciousness evolution in people's minds where they choose voluntary extinction + my main objective is a graceful exit for humanity that is peaceful"
"The other end of the spectrum is ANs who r vegan. I see validity in both stances, bt I hv always had a bias towards environmentalism + I would align more so with the vegans but I also feel some internalised anger towards this world + I wouldn't mind earth being hit by an astroid"
One of my biggest problems in life is I am an idealist. One of my recent dilemmas occupying my mind for a long time is regarding environmentalism + antinatalism. I have seen many ANs advocate for mass consumption + mass extinction of nature so earth can no longer sustain any life
I’m trying honey + lavender tea for the first time it’s amazing. I love yogi products + iHerb brought several teas to try.
My Thoughts on The Unabomber Manifesto
And he finally blocks me!! Yaaay!!!
Insomnia again... working on My Thoughts on Unabomber Manifesto blogpost... feeling a bit sleepy now. Will try to finish it when I wake up.
"Life is a cult, To which we are born, Everyday to us we are scorned, Conned by the world, In a non-consensual game, Acknowledging we hate it we are made to feel ashamed, Existence is brutal, parents fucked and gambled with our lives, Death is salvation, To which our souls dive."
"Roses are dead, Life is suffering, Everything is pain, And life is unjust, Fairness exists so they say, People commit suicide everyday, All hail the cult of existence, Curse our parents who subjected us to this life sentence, Of death, destruction, futility, And all this insanity"
“The race for death: where the winners are losers + the “losers” are winners” #antinatalism
My mother asked me about my medications + whether I'll take them for life... she's very anti-medications... I told her either I take them for life or I'm suicidal + can't leave my bed to do any normal day-to-day tasks. Functioning in this world is much harder than many ppl think.
"I'm autistic + asocial.. if the left promotes oversocialisation (which they do) according to the unabomber, then I am less tolerant of them bc I fucking hate socialising + I hate mainstream pop culture. I will only tolerate socialising if I have to or if its with ppl I'm fond of."
I would say my loved ones who are lefties are moderately left-wing or centre-left. They aren't crazy far-right lefties.
"After reading The Unabomber Manifesto, I have slightly become less tolerant of leftists... my friends + family are lefties + they usually vote left, I'm still apolitical + somewhat of a centrist, but I despise the far left... especially The Green Party."
Usually natalists end up in my mentions. Most of my followers + people I engage with on Twitter are already antinatalists or at least childfree. I come here to engage with likeminded people bc they are hard to find  IRL.
"U can disagree w someone's life choices. If they trigger you, block them or don't read their tweets. The more you hang out in their mentions, the more it reflects on your lack of dignity, self-respect + pride. I don't go around harassing natalists to become AN. I leave ppl alone."
Children from narcissistic families or families that lack emotional intelligence have skewed sexualities. Many turn out LGBT or asexual I can’t imagine what it was like to be ace or LGBT + have to be married with a kid by force bc of religious morals + conformity. It’s hell.
"Forcing marriage + children on asexuals is cruelty. I have no problem with marriage for companionship, compatibility + love that goes beyond sex, but being forced to marry + sleep with someone who is your spouse is insane. If your partner is also asexual you’re lucky then."
"My parents are asexual. They got married + had a family bc it was a cultural requirement for them. My father has never cheated on my mother - he takes religion seriously.. yet someone once accused dad of being a cheater. Now they finally acknowledge asexual marriages r real, LMAO"
"I hate playing games - I think it’s childish, immature + we shouldn’t have to do it as adults. But sometimes I have to do it - if I’m working a mainstream normie 9-5 job, if I’m forced to be around relatives or outsiders that need a normie mask. But I dread every moment of it."
"I have never really been able to adhere to societal norms bc I’m autistic - I’m honest, I have no filters, I tell it like it is, sometimes I rip ppl to shreds but it’s never from a malicious place, my intentions r always good. Sometimes I play the game to survive but I hate it."
"I’m autistic - you can say anything you want in front of me that is a taboo + I won’t judge you. Tell me you’re suicidal, you regret having your kids, you think we will get invaded by aliens or have a zombie apocalypse tomorrow. It’s all good. I appreciate your honesty."
"Society creates morals that are false to preserve itself - they aren’t necessarily right or wrong. In some ways, they can be self-destructive. I think pretending to be happy all the time, optimism bias + being dishonest about how you feel inside is wrong. I prefer authenticity."
I can guarantee a lot more ppl your life are pessimistic than you think but of course they hide it from you. This is my little corner on the internet where I can be vocal about it. I don’t socialise much + I’m the same way IRL as I am online. At least I’m free from faking the bs.
I’m not changing my views anytime soon (or ever). I’m happily single + forever alone. My tweets are brutal + sharp tongued. I like to speak the truth most people like to deny. What’s the point of following me or lurking in my mentions? It shows they have no life + they are idiots
"I don’t understand breeders who follow my account are they expecting motivational quotes with cute baby pictures + sunshines + rainbows? Even breeders who unfollow me + still hang out in my mentions, do they not have a life or anything better to do?"
"Things away + avoiding my friends. It’s hell I can imagine what it’s like for people everyday. If I wasn’t on medication, I would probably be doing the exact same thing. I ate myself to my highest weight + can barely function. Now I feel a lot better."
"My heart goes out to every suicidal person out there. I spent most of my life suicidal (2/3). I can’t get out of bed, have to force myself to do basic tasks, read my suicide manual, read suicide books, forums + buy a lot of paraphernalia. Spend my time writing letters, giving"
"Suicide is the final manifestation of desperation to cease pain + suffering that nothing or no one can truly relieve. It’s not an act of selfishness, but the only place where people can feel some sort of relief. To take it away from people is cruel + merciless."
"People are hypocrites - they act like they are anti-suicide but in actual fact they are indifferent to yr death unless u r one of their loved ones. When I used to feel suicidal everyday, I would browse r/suicidewatch + read peoples posts. It made me feel validated n less lonely."
"Liberation from colonialism, imperialism or any other form of oppression involves bloodshed. You have to sacrifice your life for freedom. That characteristic has slowly been indoctrinated out of people. I don’t like violence, but it’s inevitable when it comes to my freedoms."
A friend recommended an app to me called “Mysterious Universe” where you can listen to podcasts on a myriad of fascinating subjects. I listened to 1 on dystopia in communist China and the Muslim minorities being oppressed. It’s eye opening as our civil liberties r further eroded.
Humans take their civil liberties for granted + they are quick to sacrifice them for convenience even if the social + individual cost of that freedom is not worth it. Humans will never be free. The only way to “free” the next generation is to not create it.
"Perhaps on some level I want to protect my children from my own inner demons + flaws. I want my children to be so perfect that I don’t corrupt them, but it’s futile in a corrupt world so my choice not to have kids leaves me with a clear conscience."
We are too imperfect + flawed to raise children we destroy their spirits when they are so young we break + scar them. I acknowledge my imperfections as a human being + that puts me off of ever wanting to corrupt something so pure.
"I’m disappointed in myself. I counted I’ve only read 6 books this year. It’s more than the average person, but at least none of them were self-help books or romance novels. I will up that number + read more books. Having a bucket reading list helps keep me accountable."
I’m thinking of writing a blogpost about The Unabomber Manifesto.
"I just finished The Unabomber Manifesto. Proud to say it’s the one of the first books I’ve read this year I have read some books on my kindle, but I honestly don’t keep count of how much I’ve read I’ve always been unsatisfied with my poor reading repertoire but working on it."
I’m get the funniest ads on Instagram. Thank God I’m celibate + my antidepressants killed my sex drive for good. I’m a free woman + I’ll never have to take a pregnancy test or have an unnecessary pregnancy scare.
"I watched this tiktok where this lady was saying everyone kept telling her she would regret not having kids, years later she doesn’t regret it, she’s saved a tonne of money + she’s gonna retire in a bourgeoise style rest home, isn’t that cool?"
"I don’t need to breed. I’m happy as I am. All of my friends have children. It doesn’t bother me, to each their own path."
Hope is a major cope. It’s one of the worst destructive forces.
"They r suffering bc of somebody else’s selfishness but u don’t c it that way bc you’re too attached to them. If they wanted to die with dignity, you’d be the first person to stop them. Non-existence doesn’t harm anybody. Existence = being in harm’s way. Better to never have been."
True.
"In my early 20s I was a hardcore anarchist, then became a minarchist + now I think I’ve just given up. I’ve always preferred a primitive life to modern day life so reading the Unabomber’s Manifesto makes me feel less lonely when it comes to having views that aren’t mainstream."
"My point is, we can’t. Therefore, we leave them alone."
"Consent is the foundation of antinatalism that means consent to no longer breed, consent to continue or cease one’s existence + respecting the right for the unborn to not be able to consent. Procreation is the complete opposite. It’s all about coercion. #antinatalism"
"Suffering, mass consumption + meaninglessness do not discriminate, they are part of life for everybody people of all races, religions, colours, social classes, education levels etc the brutality of life is universal. #antinatalism"
"As an antinatalist, I don’t want to murder anybody. I want to prevent suffering, misery + pain, not for those alive, but those who could potentially come into existence. I’m not doing it by sterilising anyone, but by educating people + hoping they voluntarily choose what’s right."
"Arguing with a pronatalist, bootlicking life lover is arguing with a mass consuming, narcissistic, mindless fuck animal with no soul."
"No. It’s the angst of most people - social class doesn’t matter, my point is even the overwhelming majority of those with “good lives” prefer non-existence to this wasteland shithole of a planet with mindless mass consumption + stupid zombies."
"What sits behind this viewpoint is suffering is inherently bad, life is futile, pointless + meaningless. We spend our lives as slaves in miserable 9-5 job, we then retire + die for nothing. Our entire existence is a way to fill the empty void of boredom + mindlessly mass consume."
To assume people like suffering for life is wrong. Most people prefer a life with minimal or no suffering. Life is mostly suffering + you are rarely free from it. Life comes with strings attached + the juice isn’t always worth the squeeze.
Currently reading the Unabomber Manifesto - I can’t put it down. I’ve never read anything in my life that aligns a lot w my ideas or general over life view. Socialisation is toxic bc it promotes conformity to the herd mentality + not logic/morality. I’m also not a fan of leftism.
"Genocide? Now that’s a far fetched exaggeration, antinatalism doesn’t promote killing anybody. How precious + beautiful life is, us subjective. To assume everyone wants to experience that without their consent is arrogance. #antinatalism"
"I deleted all my shopping apps off of my phone. My shopping addiction is completely out of hand at the moment. I can’t control it. Perhaps I’m hypomanic on medications bc antidepressants are supposed to raise my serotonin levels, but from now on I’m on a tight budget."
"Indeed. We are the most destructive force on earth. Not having kids is the most effective way to lower your carbon footprint in comparison to a lifetime of reducing, reusing + recycling. Yet “eco-conscious” people still seem to have kids. 🤦‍♀️"
"I have much respect for the leaders of Tanzania, Burundi + Haiti for refusing the vaccine for their citizens + then “suddenly” dying shortly after. May they RIP. Not many leaders would stand up for their ppl. It’s no coincidence they started chaos in South Africa to distract ppl."
He told me a girl got his name tattooed on her body bc he saved her life (literally) + it’s okay to have scars + being told I’m unattractive or I should get my tattoos removed is not a nice thing for ppl to say I wept bc I didn’t expect a high class guy to say that to me.
"I got my tattoos bc I grew up in a repressive culture + religion that prohibited tattoos. My family hate them + they are sentimental to me. I love butterflies + trees. I do sometimes wish I was ink-free. Last year, I wept my eyes out for hours after my friend saw my tattoo."
"It’s #NationalTattooDay. I have 2 tattoos + I won’t be getting any more. I’m sick + tired of ppls tattoo shaming. What people do with their bodies is no one’s business. Yes, tattoo regret is a real thing, but no one really knows what lies behind the ink. Sometimes it’s deep scars"
Children will never win in this life or world. The only way they can win is by not being born. I stand for the children at all costs. #antinatalism
"Are you a misanthropic or philosophical antinatalist? I think Im a philosophical, but I see the misanthropic arguments as valid too."
The Dystopian Future
"Society tells us children are the future. We suppress children, hence, our future is one of suppression + mass enslavement. #antinatalism"
Every organised religion + govt system protects parents + throws children under the bus to maintain the status quo. If rights are given to children then the end result is a threat to the oppressive power structure we have in place.
"And the cure for overpopulation too the more educated women are, the less children they have."
"I want to write a dystopian short story I was thinking maybe for children or more mature children. I have the ideas all in my head, all I need to do is write it down. I love dystopian stories my favourites were ones I studied in high school."
"I slept for a few hours, then I woke up, I did some study, took a bath, read some Sartre + now I feel like I’m falling asleep again. I hope I can get more done later today it’s 4:30 am already"
"I would rather invest in my skills, talents, careers, hobbies or extra activities than invest in my own genetic material. It makes absolutely  no sense."
Bringing a child into a world is an investment whether we like it or not. 9 times out of 10 it’s a crappy investment that is solely for parental or state benefit. The worst thing in the world is to invest in your own genetic material. It makes no sense from an investors mindset
"Finding a partner is extremely hard for high IQ women. There is 1 in 32,000 chance they’ll find a man of the same caliber. Chances are he will be mentally ill or unstable in some way or a primary psychopath. So you can’t afford to be picky. In my case, I’m ready for a life FA."
"The life script is basically designed to domesticate both men + women bc people who are distracted with raising kids are not a threat to those in power. If they overcome their desire to not breed + they work together, men + women can tear down the system which oppresses them."
The life script has always tried to domesticate men bc incels are a threat to those in power. A man who has nothing to live for is a man who will burn the world down + watch it + savour every moment of it.
"If reincarnation is real + I have to come back to earth again. I want to reincarnate as a Turkish cat. Cats are treated well in Turkey. I love cats so much + I’ve had them since I was 13. So I wanna come back as a cat if I have to. Ideally, I want to be reunited w my star family."
I’m trying to compile a bucket list of books I want to read I have so many philosophy books on the list. I like to read about everything. So I’ll probably add some books on geopolitics + economics bc I get sick of too much of something.
"There are parts of life that give me joy things like learning, spending time with my loved ones, achieving goals + reaching milestones. But I still see tragedy + sadness in life. I try to distract myself from it + I see imposing it on someone else w/o their consent as wrong."
Any sane or responsible person who knows what the state of the world is apprehensive about having children.
"I don’t like how some ppl assume all antinatalists have been traumatised or had a bad life + decided to not have kids. I have trauma, I struggled but I also had many privileges + happy moments in life long before I found AN I was always concerned about the future for children."
"If we have a magnetic pole shift or collapse that would bring about our mass extinction + be every efilist’s dream or wish. But somewhere in the vast universe, we may re-emerge to suffer once again. Bc consciousness is one thing we can’t determine, fate wise at least for us."
Huge storm in my city in a neighbouring city we had 700 roofs come off houses.
They say the average person reads one book a year. I’m gonna try + aim to read at least one book a month if not more. I need to start educating myself more
My book finally arrived I’m excited to read this I have so much I want to read a tonne of books in my ottoman. Also my nightstand + my basket I’ve converted to a bookshelf is full of books + I have more on my kindle + in my tv cupboard I’ve repurposed for my office stuff.
I’ve decided to jump on the bullet journal bandwagon to track my moods. I only just started so I decided to estimate what my mood was like the past couple of weeks.
More evidence of climate catastrophes caused by overpopulation
I might work on my book this weekend after I finish some modules + start my assignment. I think it’s much needed bc parent worship is a real thing + we need to start seeing our parents as human beings not Gods. The culture needs a huge paradigm shift.
It’s no coincidence India + Nigeria both have large amounts of antinatalists both cultures r taught to worship their parents even if their parents are terrible people who are abusive or neglectful. It’s common sense to stop the cycle + to resist the oppression.
It doesn’t fail to surprise me how ignorant ppl can be. Filial piety + parent worship r v much real things in Asia u owe your parents your whole life for being brought into this world. For White ppl to deny this is lack of awareness go + educate yourself on other cultures.
"Humanity is not progressing, we are taking steps backwards + destroying the environment. Humanity cannot be saved or redirected, we have no choice but to go extinct so both us + nature can finally have some peace."
"There’s apparently something called inchils which means “involuntarily childless” it’s a blessing in disguise. Allegedly, these women envy other women who are mothers for what exactly? There’s nothing to envy + I think most people are childfree by choice."
"Besides some type of apocalypse or catastrophe, how do we undo millennia of intergenerational indoctrination + oppressive tradition designed to sabotage us? Any ideas?"
"I don’t understand parents who need to be worshipped by their children. I would feel very awkward, extremely uncomfortable + would suffer emotionally if I expected someone or something to worship me. I’m a flawed human being, equal to everybody else. I don’t need to be glorified."
Refusing to conform to tradition + filial piety is the key to a cultural shift. Most people have children for narcissistic reasons. Once parents aren’t glorified or worshipped by their children then less of them will be inclined to procreate. Parenthood = God status that’s why.
Filial piety in Confucianism is narcissism for parents to be worshipped as Gods by their children even long after they die.
The secret to healing the soul is beautiful fragrances + food rich in spices + a good aroma. The people of Bharat know this + this is why a lot of their food inspired other cultures to help us heal.
My family will be home in a few hours I wanna clean up the kitchen a bit + maybe make them some lentil soup
My new addiction is buying fridge magnets to decorate my whiteboard (my notice board) why am I such a shopaholic?
To truly live the “human experience” you have to live in a multidimensional prison that begins with your body being trapped in a decaying meat suit. #antinatalism
"To have a child in this day + age, you would have to be ignorant, delusional or apathetic towards the pain, suffering + oppression going on in this world.   #antinatalism"
"Just submitted my first assignment for the semester. I finished it 2 weeks before its due date... Since being on meds, I'm finally being my old self again..."
"My family went out too late to buy woollen clothing + now I have the whole house alone to myself with my cat bc they are gonna stay overnight in a motel since dad is too tired to drive back, I would have picked them up if it wasn't getting dark outside."
"So many problems prevail in this ugly world, slavery, mass consumption, ecosystem destruction and existence above all in a universe where hierarchy is corrupt, where the most vulnerable are exploited where mothers unknowingly sell their offspring to the matrix of misery."
"Roses are dead, All life ends in death, Suffering prevails in a world of struggle, Misery over happiness they they to juggle. Mass consumption and social conformity, This imperfect world full of deformity Ending replication is the only salvation we have left #Antinatalism"
"I went to a govt office to pick up a form + the lady there asked me if I was married or had kids (there are different forms for different ppl), I said no, she said that's the best decision ever made + she's single + childfree + happy too."
"If you do the opposite of what society tells you, 9 times out of 10 you will succeed better in life bc you won't be self-sabotaging or sabotaging other people."
Society is a matrix that has its own self-preservation techniques. So much advice society gave me is wrong + I ended up getting screwed over by it. I had to find the truth myself by making many mistakes. You can't trust society at all... everything they tell you is lies.
Outside my bedroom window
"The future for children is not a life script of being forced to be a parent, but to hustle, find financial freedom + live their dream lives w/o society suppressing them so their future won't b doing digital sex work or selling their organs to survive the hell we created for them."
My mission in life as an antinatalist is to be a vicegerent for antinatalism. To spread the message + enlighten children to help stop them from making their parents mistakes + to tell them the truth to free them + provide them with a better path in life towards happiness.
"Antinatalism is a child rights advocacy movement - its by people who were once children + who empathise with children. If society takes the power away from children, it is our obligation to give it back to them in the form of truth, advice to free them + a new hope."
"direction. Children should be focused on capitalising on a passion + hustling early on towards a path of financial freedom, the life script needs to leave their consciousness completely + they need to create a life they will love. That is the only way I see it."
"become disillusioned, depressed + disappointed as they get older bc what they are told is completely different to reality. Our objective should be to tell them what life is really like but to give them a bit of optimism + hope so they sail the ship of their lives in a different"
audience. Many of us get stuck in an intellectual ghetto with likeminded people + that is problematic bc we have to spread AN to the masses + our most important demographic is children + young adults. Children are programmed to be too optimistic in life + that sets them up to
I plan to continue writing my AN book soon after I have completed some more assignments. Many of you are probably wondering why I chose to publish a children's book. Many people I know have children in their late teens + early 20s. As antinatalists we are preaching to the wrong
Received a copy of my book!! Looks okay. I got it printed in matte. Maybe next time I’ll go for glossy.
It’s archaic to still associate death as something bad. The powers that believe they be created a fear of death to get humanity to control + submit to them. The only antidote is to accept death so no one can use it as leverage to control or manipulate you.
"Raphael Samuel talked about how we need a mass campaign to rebrand death. I think that is the first stepping stone towards antinatalism + legalising euthanasia. If we can create a mass change in the psyche of people regarding death, their attitude towards other things will change"
"My treat twice a week on hair washing day is a magnesium salt bath where I can enjoy a cup of tea, read, relax + compensate for my lack of sleep. I plan on buying more tea once I run out + that will help me wind down more. Baths are very underrated, great places to meditate."
"Once people accept death as an inherent part of life people will start to live life to the fullest, they will seek a quality life over the quantity + death will be embraced. It will take a while, maybe I’m a bit optimistic, but we will slowly get there"
In the next 2-3 years we will see vaccinated people suffering more health problems. We will have another pandemic + next time around less people will want to get the jab. Many people will die + slowly death will be rebranded + people will gradually accept death as part of life.
"My mum asked me if I told my cousin to not take the vaccine. I explained to mum, everybody has a brain + the ability to do basic research. I can’t go around giving people unsolicited advice, all I can say is why I’m not taking it + stand up for my decision. My prediction is"
"I had posted a story of a narcissistic aunt who was abusive to me on my blog + some random person commented that I was “obsessed” with her, which I’m not. Perhaps I might go back to writing more of those posts. Maybe they’ll help someone or entertain people at least."
I’m thinking finish off my first 3 assignments + work on my book. I need to write something. Writing is my life I’ll take a hot bath today + finish what’s left of my assignment. I also need a strong coffee bc I feel half dead from the terrible sleep. Mood wise I’m all good.
Or maybe I should continue where I left off in my book? Idk
More insomnia :(
What should my next blogpost be about?
I find it amusing when natalists refer to their children as “investments” I guess that means they are gamblers who invest in the suffering of their offspring who are cursed to share their genetics? #antinatalism
The world is like an ocean full of sharks + procreation is like a stranded boat in the middle of the ocean where you’re holding onto the remains of your boat trying not to drown being chased by sharks   #antinatalism
The state of the world is terrible. Natalists are like countries that borrow money from the IMF + World Bank they get into an insane amount of national debt + they ignore it. One day it will come to bite them in the ass + they’ll regret their irresponsibility.
Why I'm An Antinatalist
Finally... I've written my post on Why I'm An Antinatalist   enjoy...
I'm writing my blogpost on antinatalism... I figured its easy bc I know it off the top of my head with no need for research except to fact check a few things. It should get my brain working a little bit before I do a bit of study.
"If you can’t question God, then God isn’t real scepticism is natural + normally part of human nature bc we are inquisitive creatures yet it’s blasphemous bc it is threatening to the cohesion of a repressive corrupt power structure."
"The first question I asked as a teenager was “how can there be a god if there is so much suffering, I don’t believe such a god would exist?” What I said at school was so blasphemous people thought I was an atheist or communist just for asking a question at the age of 13."
"Genitals are suffering making factories. In this world, pleasure brings some form of suffering with it. Pure ecstasy with no harsh ramifications is extremely rare.   #antinatalism"
If it was not for cuteness humans wouldn’t survive I think most parents would strangle their children bc they’d go crazy hearing something cry for long hours to the point their eardrums become deaf.   #childfree
The heart of procreation is a mass orgy with billions of people fucking hard + deep in the pits of hell to add more people into their sick game.   #antinatalism
It’s hard to not hate breeders bc everybody knows how terrible this world is + they have no reasons other than those that are egotistical or selfish to add another human being into this mass orgy of suffering. #antinatalism
Nature is evil. It weaponises cuteness to promote parenthood as this adorable fruit of love. Parenthood is a nightmare from hell an 18+ year nightmare from hell that most people get burnt out from after a year of sleepless nights. #childfree
Glorifying natalism is a sucker trap most people seem to fall for. Anything cute is always used to lure people in + screw them over once they’ve taken the bait. #antinatalism
"I feel awful all I can do is lay in bed. I can’t be productive, I cant do anything bc I just feel like crap partly due to the poor sleep + the cold weather that feels like it’s snowing outside but it isn’t"
Claustrophobic even tho I have space to lay on the floor + study. I remind myself this only for the next 18 months til I finish my diploma + I’ll move out of my bedroom/office + I’ll get my own apartment where I’ll have my own space. That’s what I need when I start my new career.
Many times but I failed at it. I will always have a lot of items but I’m not as bad as everyone else in my family. Being born into a hoarding family is a huge curse - it seems to be popular amongst my friends too. I learnt how to “utilise every inch of my room” but I feel a bit
"I brought a new shoe rack I’m addicted to shoes but haven’t brought any pair for over a year. My old one was falling apart, I had to rearrange my bedroom so many times recently it’s insane. I come from a long line of people with anxiety disorders + hoarding. I tried minimalism"
Antinatalism was popular during the time of Gnosticism + paganism people didn’t have kids for spiritual reasons. It’s been prophesied by many indigenous people that era of enlightenment will make a comeback + slowly thats  unravelling with antinatalism + more people choosing CF
"I was adding more people in the world to suffer after I got my head around being childfree, she told me the signs of the rise in consciousness is more people choosing not to have kids + to be of service to humanity + care for the environment + those neglected. It’s true."
The first time I came across antinatalism briefly was when I expressed to a friend my concern about my biological clock after this lady at work had made a remark about me getting old + I remember telling my friend I had failed as a woman + she told me that not having kids meant
I went to the run some errands today + I spent 2 hours in the public library somewhere between working on my assignment + browsing the bookshelf. I noticed we have more philosophy books than what we used to have. I picked up a book by Sartre + a copy of Nexus I didn’t get to read
"SIDE REASONS:  - Environmental catastrophes (water shortages, food security) - Religious conflicts - Social unrest - Economic Collapse (austerity + inflation) - Clash of civilisations - Racism/Sexism (inevitable in a multicultural society) - Misandry/Misogyny - Statism"
"Why I’m an antinatalist (I will write a full blogpost about it)   MAIN REASONS:  - Ethics = genetic lottery, consent + uncertainty - No guarantees (except death) - Gambling/bad luck - Existentialism - Economic enslavement (state cattle) - Futility - No freewill"
"It only just occurred to me, I have never written a blogpost about why I'm an antinatalist, I've only written a post about why I refuse to pass on my genes   ... I should write a post about why I'm AN. I have many many reasons."
"When you reach a certain age, owning designer products becomes a rite of passage. Mine started at 25 after I met my cousin, I started to buy high end skincare products, then designer sunglasses, I brought my first designer tote bag last year, now a designer makeup bag + wallet."
We replicate the same suffering we are forced to endure.   #antinatalism
There is no prize to win a reality where the only winner is always futility.
"Behind beauty of nature lies brutality, at the mercy of genetic criminality, fighting for survival of the fittest, this existence is one I detest, wars of futility fought for nothingness, a victory where one still loses feeling nothing but pain, behind the veil of beauty is loss."
"Darkness is pitch black, Parts of earth continue to crack, Reality bites and reveals white lies, Behind bottles of sorrow + addiction are cries, As the dawn awakens, our lives feel more + more mistaken, When we speak of truths no one understands, til we return to death in sands."
I’ve found a very strong liking for sriracha.
The types of non-fiction library books I love to read
The only thing I find that helps me heal
"Last year I developed some of my BFF’s photographs + I framed them in this picture frame to inspire me. He saw it + fell in love, I let him have it. I’m thinking of putting some special original quotes under some of his pics + maybe making some cards or something w them."
Forgetfulness is a gift - being able to forget tragedies that plague our lives is the only way we can carry on.
"Existence is like an everlasting mechanical dildo, designed to really fuck your brains out + not in the good way.   #antinatalism"
"Life is an ever replicating, needless, purposeless, suffering making factory.   #antinatalism"
Watching a documentary on psychedelic plants they are one thing I can’t try bc I run the risk of permanent psychosis due to schizophrenia being a thing in my family. It’s hard bc I do have some psychic gifts + I’m intuitive but my problem is I don’t know how to control my gifts
So... over 60 people have been struck + killed by lightening in India. That's so rare that its more likely to happen than for you to win the lottery. Crazy when you think about it.
"friends with Americans or European Whites. The people here appear superficially friendly, but they dislike foreigners, stick to their own circles + you end up only making friends with indigenous people or with other foreigners. Americans + Europeans are much more openminded ppl."
"I find it hard to be friends with White people in my country, not bc I dislike them but bc they are closed off + only befriend other Whites who have lived here for 6+ generations. Even White Europeans cannot make friends with White people in this country. I have no problem making"
"to let friendships happen organically. Sometimes you start off as colleagues + u find camaraderie + u become friends. You will be surprised there are still good people out there, but often you find them when you least expect it, in a place where you don't think you'll find them."
"about this with my auntie + she told me ppl these days aren't normal, there is something crazy or insane about them. I think it's what Prof. Sam Vaknin refers to as narcissism. Most people you meet these days are narcissists + few are healthy. I explained to my friend its better"
"When I met up with one of my long time friends, she expressed to me her concern about how she's afraid to make friends (and she's quite likeable, a bit extroverted). She had obviously been burnt by people so badly who have taken advantage of her kindness + good nature. I talked"
"My cousin whines + complains about everything so last year, I decided to buy her a gratitude journal as a gift. She actually liked it."
I decided to go for a cup of tea. I might write my friend a letter/card so I can post her gift in the mail. She’s always sending me parcels + I’m not the best communicator. Hopefully she likes the gift.
"When you’re struck with insomnia you either watch a documentary, colour in, read or make a cup of hot herbal tea + try to get some work done."
"The average person reads one book a year or less. Usually it’s a fiction book or a self-help book. I don’t read as much as I should, but I definitely read a few books a year. When I read Nietzsche, Schopenhauer or books from that era I start to really miss good literature."
"I’m emotionally dysregulated - I freeze during traumatic events. I can’t process things easily. I’m a black + white thinker, I’m hypersensitive + my heart aches when people hurt me. I can forgive certain ppl bc I know their intentions weren’t bad or bc they did so much for me."
I refuse to forgive my aunt for shit talking me bc it’s only been 15 years since she did it. I still don’t forgive my ex friend for getting me fired - to cut off someone’s livelihood + then disrespect their boundaries is unforgivable. It would take me 30 years to forgive that.
"It takes me a long time to process emotion + to “forgive” I’m a grudge holder + that part of me is hard to change. After 25+ years I decided to forgive my toxic aunt to the point I’m indifferent to her now, but I still want no contact."
I'm half way thru an assignment... the cold weather has been making me feel uncomfortable with headaches craving sleep. A fresh pot of peppermint tea helped wake me up. Not sure whether I should make another batch of tea + watch a documentary to wind down or if I shud study more.
of their happiness + that was one of the difficult parts of my previous job. I like to keep things fully transactional when they need to be or be purely humanitarian. It's hard to look at people as commodities unless you are ruthless. I'm unstable bc of trauma not anything else.
"One of my biggest impairments is my black and white thinking. Its always been ""all or nothing"" for me. I cannot understand how humanitarianism can mix with profit. The two are completely separate to me. I do not like to profit off of other people's misery, I'd rather profit off"
"Last year I made myself some subliminal message affirmations for my subconscious mind. I’m going to try listening to them as much as I can. If they work, I will be forever grateful I hope I manage to achieve some of my goals."
"I’m very far from being left wing, but I got left wing nationalist not surprising. My parents are from the land of the Baath party, lol."
I’m driving straight at an intersection + this subhuman lowlife POS jumps into my lane from a petrol station + I almost drive into his Volvo. I have never braked so hard in my life + held my heart so closely thinking I was gonna crash. Fuck half drunk drivers like that.
"I managed to sleep some more + I had this crazy dream where I was partying, going out with friends etc. I’m not even social or a party animal. My dreams are so abstract they don’t make any sense at all."
I want to write about something... but I have writer's block...
"I was angry at God long before I was angry at my parents bc God is all powerful + the supreme ruler of justice yet this world is so unjust. I blamed God for my existence before my parents, but that was just a scapegoat. Society + conformity are my mortal enemies."
It’s better to expect the worst from people than to expect the best from them. That’s your natural way of thinking when you’ve been screwed over so many times. #misanthropy
I’m not myself lately this is what my sleep looks like most nights :(
The movie “cruel intentions” taught me what true human jealousy + backstabbing is. I used to be too naive + trusting when I was younger. My own family were the first people to turn me into a misanthrope.
"Children lose respect for their parents as they grow up, even the ones who love their parents dearly. Imperfection only breeds more imperfection + internalised resentment."
The purpose of life is to be a mindless parasitic consumer.
Your bundle of joy will be a rotting corpse infested with maggots.   #antinatalism
The root of all evil is enslavement to worldly desires of immortality + lust.   #antinatalism
Your existence is based entirely on a lie. Sorry to burst your romanticised bubble of the so-called “divine miracle” you thought you were.   #antinatalism
Sex is pleasure for your parents + eternal misery for you.   #antinatalism
You are state owned cattle domestically bred by idiotic morons.   #antinatalism
Parents are stupid enough to believe the lies they tell themselves + their children. That’s why they hate antinatalists bc they put them on the spot with skepticism.   #antinatalism
"Nothing is for free in this world, not even your existence (as much as you’re manipulated to believe it’s all free).   #antinatalism"
"I spent my day doing self-care and studying my course. I also did some cooking too I feel a bit tired + not happy with what I’ve achieved. I want to watch a documentary + take a power nap, then go out, buy coffee + study my ass off."
I want to design my own antinatalist tshirts + fridge magnets for myself I want to rock some items I think are genuinely cool.
A Tribute to Peter Wohlleben
"I've been up since half past midnight... I slept 3.5 hours... I spent some time surfing the net and reading Nietzsche and then I decided to make some coffee with some greek yoghurt w/ garlic, dried mint + olive oil on toast while I write a blogpost tribute to my fav author."
"My best friends both have parents in academia. My other BFF has a husband in academia why is it, the children of academicians end up being lifelong friends and are generally higher caliber human beings?"
My father’s colleagues in academia who were the most interesting to engage with were from Africa or Subcontinental India.
"In academia, many of the greatest minds come out of third world countries that are corrupt or don’t value their intellect so they become part of a brain drain."
"I think many overpopulated countries like India, Nigeria, Indonesia had a lot of potential to be greater had it not been for corrupt politicians, (religious tensions) as well as overpopulation. Overpopulation ruins every country’s prospects of great opportunity for its citizens."
This tree is very sentimental to me and my childhood in Southeast Asia... Adenanthera pavonina... I used to collect the seeds as a kid 😍😍😍. Take me back to Southeast Asia...
My thoughts on beauty
I’m a sucker for fridge magnets with quotes on them.
"Modern day existence is dogmatic nothingness, meaninglessness + emptiness."
I’m reading Nietzsche for the first time in my life + I’m in 😍😍😍.
When you sleep for 3-4 hours + you wake up + can’t go back to sleep what do you do?  - Read - Craft - Colour in - Go Online  I can’t even study bc my mind is half asleep still
#antinatalism is about loving your genes enough to not want them to suffer via mindless replication.
Incels + femcels should be grateful to be single it’s much better than:   - Being in an abusive relationship - Being with someone you’re incompatible with - Having children who will needlessly suffer for no good reason - Settling for less out of fear - Feeling trapped + stuck
#antinatalism is a holy grail of enlightenment for incels + femcels people are so preoccupied with relationships but it’s really genetic manipulation to pass on your genes to suffer more so realising birth is unethical frees you from that unnecessary burden.
Your genitals are created for the purpose of creating more needless suffering + cloning mindless carbon copies of yourself to burn in a world of tragedy.   #antinatalism
The fact my vessel can create sentience + sentience = suffering means I only hate my reproductive capabilities more than anything.   #childfree
Women are shamed for being ChildFree + celibate the most important form of liberty is choosing not to share your vessel with men + children yet it’s seen as an abomination unless you’re a nun or something.
Every unborn soul disturbed lives to haunt the earth with their daunting existence as a punishment for the sorcerers (parents) who summoned (created) them.   #antinatalism
Post it notes are my guilty pleasure I love organising + keeping my books all neat + tidy. It helps keep me motivated academically.
"The beneficiaries of wars + imperialism are always the ruling classes + corrupt elite, not the common people. I’m on the side of the people bc the peoples of every country on earth are always fucked over by politicians + the ruling classes collectively."
I hate the idea of critical race theory + bashing White people for no good reason. I will always acknowledge the good qualities of white people + the not so good ones just like I will with any other race including my own. For the sake of peace I let bygones be bygones.
"only men I should date (if I even date at all)... he was a real gentleman, classy, refined + had most of his shit together. Our generation will no doubt be the loneliest, full of celibate incels + femcels. He then criticised Gen Y + Z men + told them to ""man up""."
"what I don't understand is why he wants us to still breed + continue the human experiment when he knows life is futile, meaningless + parents are narcissists. We are too far gone to be saved. I do agree with him... After hanging out with my Gen Xer friend I realised those are the"
"I recently watched a video from Prof. Sam Vaknin where he basically roasted Western Millennial + Zoomer Men... he said women are now dating men in their 50s-60s, foreign/ethnic men, Muslim men + travelling to find spouses as they are more masculine. What he's saying is true but"
Many indentured servants are childfree humanity is an indentured race of servants yet our population is nearing 8 billion.   #antinatalism
Procreation is a death sentence on the innocent.   #antinatalism
Every act of conception is a death sentence.   #antinatalism
Ignorance breeds breeders.   #antinatalism
Breeders who procreate during a dystopia are the kings and queens of the hierarchy of natalist sadism.   #antinatalism
Sex is the sinful pleasure that brings upon chaos + destruction.   #antinatalism
You can’t return your kids back to the void unless you murder them. So better not to have them in the first place.  #antinatalism
"Finally in my old bed so happy + grateful to have my old bed back. Have so much cleaning + tidying to do tomorrow then have to start on my study, readings, writings etc. My mattress can enjoy its new sanctuary ☺️☺️☺️."
Another dream home for me 😍😍😍.
"Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announces strict new measure requiring people to get a vaccination, or don't bother turning up to work."
"I finally assembled my slat bed in my room now to rest for a bit then do my brother’s + slowly clean my room. I can’t believe I had enough energy to do it. I was so tired today, I left my item at home + had to drive home to get it."
"I appear as normal as they get, but when you really get to know me, it’s hard sometimes. No one gets it unless they’ve been in my place."
"And it’s true my exes had hard times with me, bc I’m stubborn + highly sensitive. Being in relationship with me is like being married to a mature child I dissociate + have alter egos a lot of the time my inner child is in the driver’s seat of my life. It’s hard."
"My parents told me that not many people would tolerate me as a partner or spouse growing up. I internalised that idea + became a femcel. It’s not as bad as I thought it would be. I learnt to find happiness + joy alone in my own weird, schizophrenic, autistic world"
"My brother is also very clingy + I’m a lone wolf I like to live alone, have little contact with people + keep to myself. My brother needs to be around ppl all the time + can’t stand to spend time alone. My alone time is as important to me as breathing or sleeping."
"I learnt early on in life ppl don’t like me much..I accepted that + learnt to be a loner + accept it. I found my own hobbies, interests + learnt to accept myself. My bro is the complete opposite..we r similar in many ways..but clash bc he’s a conformist, extroverted + self-hating"
"My brother gets on my nerves. He takes all of my stuff ruins it, turns everything into crap + then complains how I’m privileged + have it better in life than him. I worked my ass off for everything I have + I don’t whine, complain or chase fuck boys, I have high standards."
"I love the fact my feed is full of poetry + creative writing. My fellow AN tweeps are talented. I can come up with a random poem on the spot but not with their words, descriptions + language. It inspires me to work on my creative writing."
I love my local hardware store + I love buying tools. I brought myself my own folding hex set + I’m loving it. I love my mini screwdriver set too. I don’t have any handyman skills but I appreciate handymen bc their work is very underrated + highly valued.
"I love cursive handwriting. Most of my handwriting is cursive. It’s classy, refined, classical + beautiful to look at/enjoy."
I have two cousins named Adam. My ex-school mate named her son Adam + another person I know named their son that name. So tired of it.
"#UnpopularOpinions I don’t like the name Adam bc these days every Muslim in a Western country named their son Adam, just like I don’t like Sarah. Those names make life easier for us, but I wouldn’t mind an ethnic name for reflect my heritage more so."
"I’m physically exhausted can’t sleep, could barely get myself out of the house to run some errands, need to go back to the hardware store + take this bed apart + swap it over but way too tired"
"The darkness within my heart, Unknowingly shifting with no start, Delusions shatter reality embraced, I see nothingness but empty space."
"I wish poles wud shift, To wipe us all out within a rift, So we can find peace in collapse, False hopes lead to relapse, Cushions of copes gently line pain, Backward directions of trains, Hearts skip beats in panic, This world makes 1 go manic, So plead for death instead of life."
"A wasteland called heaven, Where luck is number eleven, Mindless drones roam the earth, Where virtue is suffering + so is birth, A conveyor belt of pointlessness, You fall deep into the pits of hell, Where you return to your origins of nothingness"
I’m going to take a long break from writing my book. I hope something will spark an interest for me to come back to it.
"I don’t understand people who say we need to repopulate the earth. No, we don’t. The earth doesn’t need us, our species sucks + no we don’t need to pass on our genes.   #antinatalism"
"If somebody sterilised me at birth or euthanised me if I was suffering, I wouldn’t see them as a criminal provided they convinced me what they did was humane or in my best interests."
Humans r beneath all life forms but they have the false illusion they dominate them. Do u know y? Animals have the right to euthanasia if they are suffering + many pets are sterilised shortly after birth so animals have freedoms humans don’t have + are mislabelled “unethical”.
Since Christians take “be fruitful + multiply” out of context I think it should have been “be parasitic + rodent like” instead. That’s what it means to breed and be human.   #antinatalism
We have been in the early stages of a dystopia since I was born + maybe even before (I’m 31). The worst is yet to come. I always tell my family the future ahead for the next generation is committing what we call crime or doing unethical things to survive.
Philanthropy only exists so billionaires can avoid paying taxes. Fuck their phoney charity.   #misanthropy
Most -isms are creations of the ruling classes to keep us divided. They are also the ones who encourage us to breed profusely.
Life is nothing but a plantation of indentured servants in a world of 1% ruling classes of assholes.
I miss distant learning where they send you all your course materials in books. Every semester I have to copy + paste everything in a document then have it bound at my local photocopying centre all bc ppl r trying to be cheap by claiming to want to save paper.
"I love being off work, but sooner or later I will have to go back into the workforce. Hopefully I will start working again in 2023 + I’ll enjoy the construction industry."
"My semester has finally started. I need to print out my course material + have it bound + start my assignments, get them done early so I hv no stress or need to ask for extensions + I can still work on publishing my book. I hope I’ll pass everything + get my qualification in 2023"
"Mind wide awake craving sleep feeling like crap. Damn you, insomnia!"
The future of the world is to be ruled by the jungle law. Survival of the fittest. Only the wealthy + thugs will live to pass on their genes + everybody else will return back to the void of nothingness.
"I read a sample of the ebook on Christianity + Antinatalism. Christianity could have been an antinatalist religion had people not taken “be fruitful + multiply” out of context. I still prefer Gnosticism, but any religion that promotes AN is one I’ll endorse solely for that aspect"
"I also haven’t used any injectables I’ve decided to age gracefully. It’s been ages since I’ve dyed my hair I’m thinking when I go grey, I’ll dye my whole head white/grey/silver or bleach my hair. Not sure how it will look, I’ll miss being a brunette for sure."
"My best friend + her daughter told me I still look young I’m not sure if they’re being nice or honest. I have wrinkles in my forehead, lots of grey hair but here’s my secret to staying “young” I barely smoke or drink, I don’t party hard, I refuse to take crap from ppl too."
I found this fridge magnet hilarious 😂
"Nothing is more cringe than thinking you’re hot when you have average looks or aren’t that attractive. Beauty is subjective, there are some universal features that are beautiful but it’s better to underestimate your physical attractiveness than overestimate it."
"If I lose my hair again after I lose a lot of weight, I'm gonna have to rock a pixie haircut all over again like last year. Everyone said it suited me, but I miss my long hair + my bob haircuts."
#Word #Quote #Wisdom
Psychopaths are reckless people who are impulsive. Antinatalists don’t go around gambling with other peoples lives.
"Coming from a psychopathic background, my relatives overreact to everything, every gift comes with strings attached + certain expectations, they are deceptive + usually worldly people who love money, power + are megalomaniacs. I haven’t seen those traits in many antinatalists."
Having a depressive mood is not correlated with psychopathy. Not all depressed people are mentally ill. Depression is sometimes a manifestation of realism. It’s a symptom of a larger multilayered social problem.
"From my experience with dealing with antinatalists, most have been traumatised by life or they see life for what it is. Some have had good lives, others have had it harsh. Generally they are high IQ, lone wolves + they are truthtellers who value honesty as their code of ethics."
"Being a pessimist is not psychopathic, it’s about being realistic + not being disillusioned with reality. Being pessimistic is abt proceeding with caution + being honest. Psychopaths are deceptive manipulators. They are impulsive + dishonest, they have nothing to do w pessimism."
"Im reading the research paper calling antinatalists psychopaths + I’m thinking, this guy has an optimism bias. So calling life for what it is is psychopathic? Psychopaths are supposed to prey on people. Antinatalists don’t prey on anyone. The logic behind this paper is so flawed."
Birth is degrading + existence is undignified.   #antinatalism
"When I get up early, I have to make the tough choice between going back to sleep or drinking coffee. I find drinking coffee to be good means I can start my productivity early on. I need to finish 2 chapters of my book so half the book is done since my semester has started."
"Birth is death, Existence is pain,  A world against our nature makes us go insane. Don’t bring life into this hell, “Life is good” will never sell. So save your seeds + don’t have kids, fuck what they say, ethics are what forbids.  #antinatalism"
Only stupid people breed in a dystopian era.   #antinatalism
I needed a letter so badly from my GP regarding my mental state so I can apply for a student allowance + he emailed me a letter at midnight with the clinic’s letterhead so I wouldn’t have to come into the clinic I’m so grateful. He’s one of the best doctors I’ve ever had.
"I don’t need a lot in life to be happy just lots of time alone, free time + to be away from most people. I refuse to beat myself up for status + wealth anymore I know in my heart of hearts all I want is contentment + to bring a few smiles to a few sorrow souls + I’m happy."
"Bc I can see accomplishments are futile just like everything else. I’ve stopped being hard on myself + I have decided to kickback, relax + take life easy. If I want to achieve anything, that’s to work in construction for a bit + to publish books for fun. I write bc I love it."
"So this random guy messages me out of the blue thinking I’m his ex-business partner, I tell him he has the wrong # + we chat for a bit. He asked me if I’m studying a PhD. It triggered me a little bc I’m not really an ambitious person. I think I’ve “settled” for my place in life"
I have to repeat the course I failed from last semester this semester. And apparently my semester started this week I didn’t even know bc school took so long to get back to me. I’m going to work hard this semester while I work on my books and enjoy my hobbies.
Another perfect place to live 😍😍😍.
Japan gifted Washington 2000 of the cherry blossom trees in 1912. One of the best gifts a country can give.
"The Japanese compare existence to the cherry blossom tree beautiful, short, seasonal + then death. That’s life for you in a nutshell. People who love life should learn more about the Cherry Blossom Tree (The Sakura)."
A Mental Health Update -
"iPhone 6S. Came out in like 2015, I got it for $500-$600 in 2018. It’s been with me for 3 years now. I love I still have a headphone jack."
"I want to write a book about life hacks or what things in life really mean the reality of things. I used to be so naive as a kid, I know many people are naive + if they knew those things when they were younger they’d be better off. I would recommend these to young ppl."
Freezing your eggs is the biggest scam + worst “investment” breeders can ever make. Women are abused so much by society bc of their biological clocks. Society gets away with so much. The most amusing thing is parental regret afterwards.
My great aunt is a fertility doctor specialising in IVF I have relatives who have done IVF their obsession with having children is something I don’t understand.
"I was researching Catholics +  contraception + I found myself agreeing with one Catholic author who is against IVF. He said infertile couples should adopt. While I disagree w his views on contraception it’s nice to see a pronatalist breeder encouraging adoption, discouraging IVF."
I don’t like forcefulness + pressure in general. I like to make mistakes + acknowledge when I’m wrong + make my own decisions. I cannot imagine having a friend or partner who was forceful + pressured me to do things I don’t want to do. I believe in autonomy + freedom above all.
My mum asked me to call my aunt + convince her to not get the covid jab. Not sure if she will or not. 80% of my family have taken it. We were worried about my aunt bc she has so many health problems + is on so many medications.
"Procreation is merely apes imitating other apes monkey see, monkey do.   #antinatalism"
Procreation is unnecessary.   #antinatalism
"I want to write a post on my mental health + one on psychiatry + the paranormal. I believe in the paranormal, but to some extent I also believe in psychiatry. There r gaps + limitations in modern medicine only traditional medicine + shamanism can heal. Few ppl understand this."
"To be able to write a book, you gotta be passionate about writing in general. It’s gotta be a big part of your life. I don’t see myself becoming a bestselling author, but who knows, maybe someday I will make it. I only need to look at an author like Rupi Kaur + how she made it."
"When I’m on meds, I get out of bed, I take care of myself, I’m productive, I’m cheerful, upbeat + adventurous I’m a completely different person. Suicide doesn’t even come to mind regardless of this, I know it’s artificial altho I was once like this, I’d still never procreate."
"Redoing my room was great now I have space to lie down on my tummy on my shaggy rug to do my assignments + my writings. I still need to declutter + file away my paperwork, but I can really chillax + watch my documentaries + enjoy my activities in a more spacious area."
"I’m thinking of rearranging my bedroom furniture, everything feels so cramped in this tiny room (actually it’s a double sized bedroom but my bed has swallowed most of the space)."
"If they legalised euthanasia, I’d have to cut my meds cold turkey + then opt for euthanasia. The only exception to continuing life was if my death made many people suffer or if my life actually became good to the point I don’t mind carrying on."
Finished the 1st part of my book now to start the 2nd part
I hope #antinatalism will become a word in the dictionary soon. It’s sad to see pronatalism is a word (at least on Microsoft word) but antinatalism isn’t.
On the patriarchy + reproduction. #antinatalism
"Agreed. Nationalism was the lesser of two evils for me (between religion), I’m working on breaking free from it tho."
"I miss yellow watermelon one of the hallmarks of my childhood in SEA. So many sentimental memories, but I still love red ☺️."
"Gossip is for low class people who are low IQ, as my grandmother would say."
"Antinatalism is the key to bridging the gap between the sexes. Feminism + the patriarchy have oppressed both sides. Procreation is a ponzi scheme + gigantic scam for both sides once people see that, thats the starting point of indifference rather than misogyny or misandry."
Antinatalism liberates both sexes from the burden of procreation + it unifies them against the ruling classes that seek to weaponise their fertility + enslave their offspring. #antinatalism
Pronatalist patriarchy weaponises the burden of fertility to enslave + oppress women. #antinatalism
"Imagine if we didn't have a feminist movement, antinatalism would be one of the only ways to liberate women, besides egalitarianism. Feminism has taught me if you suppress women, women will destroy men someday, so the best bet is egalitarianism where both sexes have equal rights."
"I’m reading a journal article on pronatalism + patriarchy I need to reference in my book. Even tho I come from a polygamist, patriarchal background with 2 ancestors who had 4 wives it feels strange reading how women had it. It’s important to destroy patriarchy bc it’s pronatalist"
"I might even go as far as saying #antinatalism is not only a children's rights advocacy movement, but also a women's rights movement somewhat similar to feminism, bc it frowns upon procreation + does not objectify or value women based on their fertility."
Pronatalism objectifies women + fetishes their reproductive function (and otherwise) discards them if they are infertile. Pronatalism is degrading + objectifying to women.   #antinatalism
I’ve been craving sushi a lot lately.
"I started my fourth chapter of my book I feel so tired but hope to get it done this week. Almost 10,000 words done in my book. I hate this broken sleep pattern. Really fucks me up."
"I just ordered myself this hoodie online I don’t feel like I want to die tbh, but I have felt that way most of my life. At least I will have something new to wear this winter bc it’s very cold these days."
"I am Middle Eastern + somewhat Asian (culturally altho Mid East is part of Asia). Our culture stresses the importance of status + financial success more than happiness, even at its expense. We r pressured to study, work hard + conform that breeds high IQ ppl, low EQ + psychopathy"
"Antinatalism attracts high IQ ppl. It explains why I felt so out of place in this world + I felt at home w other ANs. My brain processes things differently, I hv a lot of black + white thinking. Many ANs hv mental health issues genetic or not, this world makes ppl mentally ill."
"AN does attract high IQ people + many high IQ people are psychopaths who lack empathy... I will have to read the study thoroughly + analyse it to respond to it properly. I'm generally attracted to other psychopaths who are similar to me, but I also appreciate high IQ empaths."
"I am a secondary psychopath. I lack empathy. I can't help it. It's genetic. Most of my family lack emotional intelligence. But I don't think that antinatalism attracts psychopaths - yes, many of us are nihilistic, hedonistic + apathetic, but many ANs are also very empathic."
The Ethics of Procreation and Adoption
"I don’t understand the concept of procreation being a moral right. I know it is in reference against eugenics, xenophobia, racial/ethnic supremacy but regardless of that, I don’t understand how it’s a “moral right”."
A strong colombian coffee with marshmallows + a bit of honey + milk seemed to sort of fix my in between sleep + being lethargically awake. So gonna start the next chapter of my book + that will be the first part of my work all done.
"I feel so lethargic, having difficulty sleeping + so tired I can’t do anything, I don’t feel very productive. I feel so sick + tired + so addicted to sleep really not myself right now. What goes up, must come down sadly."
I am trying to come up with deadlines for my current AN book project. According to my estimates my book should be out in early August.
My Children’s Book Is Finally Out!
My #antinatalist children's book is finally available for purchase on Amazon   - pick up a copy for your niece or any child close to you want to educate about antinatalism.
My book has been published... but I can't order any author copies for myself bc of my location :(
"Parents who seek to control their kids too much create good manipulators. In my case, my unintentional manipulation tactics were a result of my parents overbearing helicopter parenting. I do my best not to consciously manipulate anybody."
Natural selection is cruel for those who survive + compassionate for those who don’t make it.
Orgasms that lead to conception are road trips to a lifetime of suffering.   #antinatalism
"If I could redesign the human body, I would make turn orgasms that lead to conception into high voltage electric shocks or third degree burns. We are like rats but we never seem to learn."
Existence = mass consumption. Procreation = cannibalism.   #antinatalism
Orgasms (that lead to conception) are the gateway to human suffering.   #antinatalism
Making an asexual pride bracelet bc I miss keeping my hands busy + I love to multitask while I stream my documentaries ♥️♥️♥️.
"40 tonnes of heroine are sold on the darkweb everyday. If life was so good, people wouldn’t need to take drugs to escape their pain, boredom, misery or suffering. #antinatalism"
High quality good people are worth a lot of emotional labour... most people are only worth indifference or apathy. #misanthropy
"I'm so bored with Netflix + YT, I finally brought myself a documentary streaming subscription to immerse my mind with deep knowledge on geopolitics, spirituality, the occult, conspiracies, history + other issues I am passionate about as a weirdo."
Self-Care Holidays   - I hate writing blogposts like this (short and self-centred)... I usually like to write lengthy posts on various topics in depth. I feel very fatigued... which is why I cannot write as much as I'd like to.
Peppermint tea 💚💚💚.
"My first ever children’s book that is AN themed is in the stage of being approved by Amazon. I’m so excited!!! I will get some rest + finish working on my other book for my audience. Wonder, are children’s books popular in ebook format or no? Probably not."
May he #RotInHell for destroying my country + harming my people.
Children are prey. They exist to be exploited + abused by predatory people who target them. It’s the fact they exist in a world full of creeps waiting to exploit them that is enough reason to not bring them into this world. #antinatalism
I want to finish writing a blogpost on my sort of holiday road trip later on...
Existence = non-sustainable mass consumption (in a capitalistic society). #antinatalism
Procreation is compliance with everything that goes against human sovereignty + the right to self-determination.
"There are 3 rulers in life - Religion, Finance + Government... antinatalism is a threat to religious child abusers... it is a threat to finance bc the system relies on us to be mass consumers... and its a threat to govt bc the govt needs slaves to work its plantations."
"#Antinatalism is the ultimate threat to statism. That is why its so stigmatised. Those in power shape + influence our culture, hence they make everything they deem a threat to their power structure a cultural taboo."
"I am open to meeting someone similar to me I'm compatible with when the time is right + if I don't meet anyone, its still fine by me. My medications seem to be helping me + I'm moving forward slowly in life... hopefully I will have more things start to fall in place for me."
safeguard my ego I need to be as dissociated + disengaged mentally + psychologically from intimacy as much as possible. Two of my best friends have walked away from all romantic relationships after being burnt by terrible intimate partners.. so my choice is not strange after all.
"It is nice to use my sexual energy for writing, research + my hobbies/passions. I hate the idea of objectification, but the problem is my deep fear of intimacy which is common in all Cluster B personalities - we are basically traumatised children stuck in adult bodies, so to..."
been kind of frigid + almost all normies automatically r sex objects to me + not ppl - which is why I don't engage with them. The only people I can truly love are high IQ weirdos like myself... these meds are helping realign my sexual orientation with my libido which is amazing.
"It's been about 2-3 weeks since I restarted medication, aside from sleep problems caused by Aripiprazole I feel I am starting to realign back to where I want to be... kind of a workaholic, enjoying my passions, being productive, energetic + having a no/low libido. I have always"
"I normally don't snore, but I've been so exhausted from 18 hours driving in a few days, my parents could hear me snoring so loudly in my bedroom with my laptop on so loud, they shut it off... I can't believe I was snoring so loudly everyone could hear it. Must have been so tired."
"I’m tired of Netflix, YouTube etc I wanna subscribe to a documentary streaming service so I can have some infotainment to give me some downtime + help me keep up with suppressed + censored research."
"The key to unlock contentment in life is having a positive outlook on death, to live minimally + to the fullest and #antinatalism"
"Imagine my book is gonna be read by kids all over this country, bc I have to gift copies this means kids will know about AN from a young age subconsciously. It will also help with issues around child poverty bc so many kids here grow up deprived so they might stop the cycle."
"I’ve been given an ISBN for my book, but I have to gift a copy to the national library in my country. I’m waiting on one finalised image + then I’ll launch my book. I might go to the library + look at some children’s books for inspiration in terms of format."
Procreation = social conditioning + a lifetime of indoctrination that overrides our basic logic. #antinatalism
"Parents who use their children’s achievements to put themselves on a pedestal are like ringleaders in circuses, most of the time they have to torture their kids so their kids make them “proud”. #antinatalism"
Existence is pain. Unnecessary pain. Suffering builds character so they say but needless suffering is unnecessary. #antinatalism
"#Antinatalism acknowledges our inefficiency + impurity, always reminding us of who we truly are + why we need to prevent future generations of us to come into existence."
"I’ve always been passively suicidal, right up until I restarted antidepressants again. I’m starting to see my friends have no hope in life. My presence either motivates them or (lack thereof) makes them lose hope. I know I’ve always criticised hope but they need it to carry on."
From the world. Existence even in a world with 8 billion people is very lonely. My friend told me she raised herself bc her parents didn’t care about her. My other friend felt lonely in a world full of affluent people who r fake. Kindness + tragedy seem to bring us all together.
Some people rely heavily on kindness to navigate the uncharted waters in life - bc they had nobody in their life to support them. Most of the time their strategy attracts abusers + predators who consume them. Occasionally they attract people like me who have closed themselves off
Stick together + look out for each other bc everybody will throw them under the bus the first chance they get I’ve been worried about my BFF since I had dinner w him + met his wife last week. He hasn’t been himself lately. I hope he will be okay. His wife was also v lovely too.
"Angry + upset. My friends deserve the best bc they are nice people, but this world punishes people like them while rewarding deplorable people I absolutely abhor. It’s one of the reasons why life is so unfair. The good people who are kind always suffer + that’s why they gotta"
"I worry a lot about my friends. My friendship with them is as pure as they come. Their burdens are my burdens, I care deeply for them, I celebrate their successes + victories as my own. It’s very hard to find people like them in this world + seeing anything hurt them makes me so"
"I have another idea for a children’s book. I still feel so exhausted from my holiday, but refreshed. I will work on my other book, do some crafts, try to lose weight, draft a copy of the new children’s book + also finalise my first book too. My body aches, I need a hot bath."
Japanese shops are my guilty pleasure. I found out Daiso has opened a branch in the city I visited next time I will head over there. Daiso brings me so many nostalgic memories as a child in SEA. I brought a Japanese folder from another store with some stationery.
"I don't envision myself falling in love either.. In my last relationship, I felt so unwanted, like I didn't matter + burdened with so many insecurities + triggers on both sides. High IQ love is a mixture of complication + children who are immature. It's far too exhausting for me."
"I have lost my sexual desire completely due to medication (at least I think I have) + this is a gud thing. Its one extra burden I don't need. I am almost disgusted by intimacy mainly bc I fear it.. for me sex is either fucking, procreation or making love, I don't c an in-between."
"I brought some murukku from an Indian shop + my cousin fell in love with it, I gave the rest of it to him. I got so more for my family to try. I need to focus on tidying up + getting chores done while my body is tired so I can finalise + launch my book."
"Roasted eggplant with tomato paste + mango pickle with rice is 😍😍😍. I love eggplants, among my favourite vegetables 😍."
I listened to like 5 of Alicia Keys albums on the drive home. It was fun. But I hate driving in bad weather conditions.
I brought these random dates for my parents that said Zehdi on them my mum recognised them as a date species from Iraq that has been cultivated from UAE. My parents were so happy to have them. Got them from a random Indian shop. My parents were happy with the baklava too.
"I finally made it home safely yesterday. My 6h drive turned into a 10 hour drive bc of storm, wind, granny driving, pulling over constantly to let other cars pass + sleeping in my car for over an hour bc I was so tired. I need to recover from my trip, do chores + work on my book."
I slept only 5 hours + we are supposed to have a severe thunderstorm today. I drove over half way back but I couldn’t drive fatigued  so I slept in my car for the last hour. I feel okay. I will make a move back home soon. Driving fatigued is definitely not good.
"If our parents created us + they are Gods, then that makes God evil + the devil good #antinatalism"
I agree!! Procreation is the original sin + if religious people had any brains they’d allow God to “bless” them with kids in heaven. #antinatalism
Being born into this world is like being dropped into a jungle with no ways to navigate your maze like surroundings.
"I'm a middle aged adult who finds existence a bit complex for my overactive mind... if we didn't lie to children constantly, I think more children would be wrapping nooses around their heads."
"We have adult-only spaces... I think this world is harsh even on fully mature, grown adults... how can this existence not be safe for adults, let alone children? #antinatalism"
This world eats children alive + then spits them back out again. #antinatalism
Most parents have a god complex. #antinatalism
Every soul is stolen from a realm of nothingness by selfish people who think they are gods. #antinatalism
Everyone is a literal walking sack of shit... but some sacks of shit are more tolerable than others... It takes basic decency + humility to make you tolerable.
"I'm very determined to reach many ppl with AN... bc its much needed... if there's many people in my life still with my family's outdated mindset, AN is the only hope for their black sheep kids who are kind of disenfranchised."
"I contacted some organisations in my country regarding an ISBN + copyrights for my children's book, once that's sorted, my children's book will be out very soon as my illustrator has finished the work fast. I might start a YT channel, learn some editing + try to promote my work."
#Antinatalism is about taking a long hard look at the truth the big gigantic elephant in the room everybody seems to want to ignore.
"I feel like I haven’t “succeeded” traditionally in life bc I have been a black sheep not only in my family, but in this world. I work hard but I don’t kiss ass, I refuse to let ppl degrade me, I’m not money hungry, I’m focused on serving others + I have a conscience."
"I come from a Cluster B family of highly educated narcs/psychopaths with high status... I'm the nicest one out of all of them. The sad part I hate is the fact they don't see their flaws + they breed more misery. The world doesn't need more of us, especially those w my genes."
"Being alone means I get to become comfortable in my skin... I become whole.. I learn self-love + self-care.. I value intellectualism + depth over shallowness + superficiality... many people don't get it, but mental illnesses aside... I have contentment + most ppl don't have that."
"Some people are so miserable, they have to project their insecurities onto others to feel ""alive"". #Misanthropy"
One day I will show them all up... by rising + shining as myself... + they'll see.
"there to envy? I don't get it. I'm a black sheep in my family bc I'm not racist, I'm irreligious, I speak the truth, I'm not homophobic, xenophobic, colourist or feel the need to ""show off"".. or compare myself. I have many rare qualities + I'm bold enough to stand up to my family"
"But I hate how everything is a dick-measuring competition where someone has to be the best at everything. I'm happy as I am... I'm single, I don't work a job I hate, I'm creative, I'm writing books, I have touched a lot of lives, I have real friends who r ride or die... so whats"
"And my aunt/cousin scrolled thru my cousin's pics with her hubby as if I'd be jealous of a financially abusive relationship with a control freak. In my narc/psycho family they are the only relatives I tolerate. I feel nothing but indifference towards my family's ""success""..."
"So.. I'm at my aunt/uncle's place... they are okay... My uncle wants me to be his free lawyer (I don't like law or want to follow grandad's legacy), my cousin shamed me for driving a $6000 imported car since he has a $30k secondhand hybrid car (from his soul sucking dead end job)"
Im currently reading a book on dark psychological manipulation. Much of it applies to natalism. This is gonna inspire me to touch on it more + explore it in my book. People are manipulated into procreating not just genetically but by society + state + the elite.
"“Gifts make slaves, whips make dogs.” This applies to parents + children the state + all citizens. Nothing is free in this world, especially not your existence.   #Antinatalism"
I finally made it to my aunt’s house almost 2 hours drive early hours of the morning. It was dark + raining. I feel quite relaxed. I do need some sleep later on tho. I’m still running on 3 hours.
It’s 3:30am I slept only 3 hours again. Everything is in my car + I’m ready to leave my hotel + go to my aunt + uncle’s house an hour+ away luckily they wake up for Fajr prayer + I can go chill with my aunt. I hope she will accept the gift I got her.. a nightie + some baklava
"If it was not for those people I would have been dead a long time ago. They helped me continue my life that’s why I treat them the way that I do. The world sees these people as weak, but their kindness is like cold water hitting my hot heart that yearns for coolness for relief."
"I’m a psychopath (lower tier) I can’t help it, it’s my genetics + I lack empathy. But when it comes to kind, good hearted people most people would just take advantage of, I will defend/protect those people at all costs bc I value kindness + pure intent above all things"
"Offer a man my pure + honest friendship without getting emotions involved, that is the best gift I can ever give anybody, bc I’m the best friend anyone can ever have, but I’m a terrible girlfriend/wife."
"To most men who might fall in love or lust with me; I will always be the oracle, not the wife or girlfriend. I tell them things they sometimes don’t want to hear honestly from my heart with no hidden agenda or motive. In terms of being in a relationship - it’s not for me, if I"
"To eye + even tho he’s hurt her in the past, she’s a keeper. His father chose the right woman for him. This is why I am more accepting of arranged marriages than love marriages bc (most of the time) our families know what’s best for us sometimes + they know who we will last with."
"I had a really good time with my best friends last night. We had some Indo-Chinese street food for dinner. I finally met his wife she’s so lovely - she radiates kindness, a sweet nature + wholesomeness I advised my friend to take good care of her, they may not always see eye"
There’s no escaping overpopulation except to a place like Antarctica or some place else people breeding everywhere I feel suffocated both literally + figuratively by it.
Big cities with motorways + huge malls filled with mindless zombies everywhere in what feels like small confined spaces makes my head hurt. Even in my small city (more like a town) I avoid crowds. It makes me think more about overpopulation + dream of ghost towns.
"I decided to torture myself 2day + go to a huge mall in a new city. Man did it give me sensory overload. I couldn’t find parking easily, design was confusing, it was gigantic + shortly after I left. Driving in a city w highways I realised I miss my small town. Also got my haircut"
"I brought my parents some baklava I’m gonna try + find their favourite Middle Eastern foods while I’m here. I will always love my heritage but I’m not a fan of my ppl I don’t have any Arab friends all my friends are Asians, Africans or Pacific Islanders bc I’m a black sheep"
Twitter has almost made chatrooms obsolete. I remember the days I used to kill time in chatrooms... it was so hard to find interesting ppl to have a decent conversation with. I'm put off by people who retweet porn or are looking for anything sex related.
"Sad story - unfortunately interfaith relationships are still a taboo in some parts of the world growing up in a Muslim background I see the hypocrisy their women + other women are for them, but other people can’t have their women."
"I used the reface app my face on this face I don’t suit long hair anymore as I’ve aged I guess this is as long as I’ll go. I need to lose weight, my face looks horrible."
I have been struggling with dry skin for ages now (I use Clinique skincare products for my routine). Yesterday I stopped at L’Occitane + I bought one their face mists + my skin feels so hydrated + amazing. I’m thinking of switching to their products once I finish my Clinique.
Some images from my upcoming antinatalist children’s book every cradle is a grave as Sarah Perry says that’s what happens when we gamble with someone else’s life. I can’t wait til it’s launched on Amazon.
"It makes me feel numb, indifferent or apathetic. I feel quite detached from this world, sometimes I don’t know how to feel anymore."
Some emotions are traumatic + we failed to process em properly as children so we deceive ourselves + others by hiding tht. The world is full of traumatised ppl who struggled to process emotions as children bc they were so overwhelming..or they simply weren’t allowed to by parents
"For the sadistic powers that believe they be, they enjoy seeing us suffer. It’s about harvesting that bad energy for their benefit."
I always tell my brother + my friends one word of advice... never settle for toxic friendships or relationships... its better to be alone than have bad company. My friend is starting to embrace this advice. I'm proud of her.
My gf + I went for a drive around the city + we drank some moscato rose while going through her junk jewellery bags... I found a gold pendant + an original Swiss watch that just needs a strap... its amazing how ppl donate things they don't know the value of.
Do you know why I value kindness so much + I reward it in my own way? Its bc life is futile + miserable... + those kind people out there make a conscious decision to not add more misery to other people's lives. #Misanthropy #Kindness #KindnessMatters
Energy is everything love is what draws people in that’s the good vibes. Sometimes you get unpleasant vibes from dark places you gotta always trust your gut instincts.
"Have you ever walked into a rich person’s place + felt absolutely cold energetically speaking?   Have you ever walked into a poor person’s place + felt warmth, love + happiness energetically from that place?"
I arrived at my BFFs place + met her daughters all grown up. They gave me a big hug + were so happy to see me. I’m going to introduce her to my other BFF bc they r both kind ppl w good hearts. Such ppl deserve to be bought together bc kindness is only thing of value in this world
I finally made it here this is my home for the next 2 days I might visit my aunt or take her out on a date before I head home. I can’t wait to have a fun time with my friends tomorrow. I might ask my friend if she wants to grab dinner or go out tonight.
Indeed!
I just realised I never had maternal instincts all this time it was just me being programmed as a kid. #antinatalism
#antinatalism is your best security + most effective insurance policy against major unprecedented times ahead.
On my drive this morning 😊.
"I’m on the road driving over 500km. I left the house at 5:30am it’s still dark + winter, but I’m loving it. The only thing I don’t like is sharing the road with big trucks."
All it takes is common sense + a conscience to become an antinatalist. #antinatalism
"It is strange when you find men advocating for women’s rights + celibacy over sex + walking away from relationships altogether. You realise those men have pride, self-respect + decency. You have nothing but respect for them."
Humans have made themselves obsolete. #Antinatalism
Packing my suitcase I’m going for away for the weekend to visit my BFFs 8+ hours drive away. Am I the only one who overpacks too much luggage with things I don’t need bc of my indecisiveness + worry I might need something.
"I have finished over 8000 words of my book (3 chapters starting on the 4th) I am going to aim for 40,000 bc according Jeff Goins 40-50k is a good sized non-fiction book. I hope by this chapter I reach 10,000 words. I really hope people find my book interesting."
"So I got a call from my local mental health team + my new keyworker is an Indian nurse I’m so happy. Indian nurses are the best, especially ones from Kerala. I refuse to take any benzos bc I used to be addicted to them. Hopefully I won’t need them tho."
I might add a section in this chapter about breeders who regret motherhood + also about how parenthood doesn’t guarantee happiness. I need to make antinatalism as appealing as possible in my book or at least promote the childfree lifestyle more.
I finished my third chapter of my book I will need to go back and add more citations to it. Close to 2000 words. Once I finish this next chapter. I will have finished the first part of the book. So far I have 28 pages with close to 8000 words written. So much more work to do.
Nothing is more infuriating than seeing a breeder blame a child for all their problems simply bc that child was born. Such deplorable people absolutely disgust me.   #antinatalism
"People who debate me either end up becoming my friend or they just give up. I try my best to avoid ad hominem attacks... its not classy + not good for AN, but I'm always happy to make a friend... I try to see the good in people despite being a misanthrope."
"People are cowards... They make some ad hominem, condescending remark about my AN tweets then when I respond to it or someone else does, they delete the tweet. I wish some pronatalist breeders would show up in my mentions so I can debate them... debates are always fun anyway."
"Im thinking of packing my suitcase + going for 2-3 day road trip to c my friends or just chillax in another city 2moro. It might clear my mind + inspire me to write more. I’m writing my chapter on how ppl r indoctrinated to procreate, I wish I cud find a supporting study to cite."
"#antinatalism is like a maze, a mouse + a small piece of cheese. The mouse evolves with intelligence to recognise the cheese is poisonous + decides not to eat it to die + allow future generations to escape the horrors of the maze."
#Antinatalism is about ethics. Not mindlessly giving into our biological evolutionary programming.
#Antinatalism the core truth about our existence.
I’m speaking in the context of antinatalism. When we tell people life is mostly needless suffering they get triggered + say “life is good” or they deny what we say. They have no choice but to deny it bc accepting life isn’t good means their whole reality crumbles.
Most graveyards have some type of security bc creeps excavate graves to disturb the dead. Yet everyday somebody disturbs the dead by forcing someone non-existent into existence. How is that not wrong? It’s far worse than excavating someone’s grave. #antinatalism
Insurance is a scam. Many companies will try to cheat you. The worst tragedies in life aren’t covered by insurance so the next best thing is non-existence.
#Antinatalism is the best + most effective insurance policy to protect future generations from unexpected harm that is part + parcel of life.
I used to dream of getting amnesia to forget my trauma + unpleasant memories I just watched a program about ppl who suffered amnesia + it affected their lives badly. So many terrible things can go in life + there’s no insurance policy except non-existence to protect from them.
I saw a program about children who can develop dementia due to a genetic mutation. It’s terrifying. Makes me even more sure I am making the right decision by remaining childfree.   #antinatalism
"When life for you is a burden trying to survive something you didn’t consent to, avoiding homelessness, trying to take care of your decaying meat suit it’s hard enough why add a child to that mess?"
"Denial is a major survival mechanism. We deny life is bad bc once we acknowledge it, there’s almost no reason left to live anymore."
"I can’t sleep I need to wind down somehow either taking a bath, colouring in or watching some movie or something"
"This affected some of the royal family’s revenue as they have shares in jewellery + mining companies. I remember my parents saying her interference in Africa was one of the reasons for her death. This is why I hate the commonwealth. Any country part of it, is still robbed by GB."
I found out one of the reasons the royal family murdered Princess Diana was bc they put land mines in Africa bc there was a diamond trade going on + the only way they could keep poor Africans from finding diamonds + getting rich was through mines. Princess Diana exposed this +
"You don’t need to kill yourself if you acknowledge life for what it truly is it’s more honourable to accept life for what it truly is + acknowledge it, than to keep turning a blind eye. A blind eye won’t make life any better for anyone. #antinatalism"

I don't think anyone should reproduce... but its funny reading this article anyway...  10 People Who Should Never Reproduce
"""The basic unit of evolution is the gene. Genes are selfish: all they ‘care’ about is survival; to survive is their only ‘purpose’. Biologically, a human being is merely a vehicle for genes to replicate themselves."" #Quote"
"Breeders bring helpless children into the world full of land mines, one that explodes one after the other, injuring + scarring people for life they know mines are buried beneath the ground (life sucks) + they still bring people in.   #antinatalism"
"I have a sudden urge to move back to Asia + spend my life savings on 22kt Gold. Oh, gosh! I’m turning into the women in my family I miss Asia it’s been almost a decade since I left."
Indeed.   #antinatalism
"It’s better to have a boring, predictable ending to a story (when it involves somebody else’s suffering)  Than to have an exciting, tragic ending (where your child suffers til they die)  #antinatalism"
"True contentment is knowing you will die + never leave behind a legacy of pain, misery + needless suffering.   #antinatalism"
It’s better to be a flower or tree that bears no fruit or seeds if those fruit or seeds will only replicate more needless suffering as Infinitum.   #antinatalism
Meditate about futility   And you’ll be even more non-attached to this world.   #antinatalism

Day 14: I feel okay. My sleep is pretty much broken + non-replenishing. I will talk to my doctor about this + see what can be done about it. I went for a walk today. Gonna work on my book + maybe read or do some crafting. Im grateful for the sunshine today
I’ve always wanted to write about primitivism + anti-imperialism even tho I plan to cover similar topics under futility. I may write about misanthropy. I’ve been misanthropic since I was a kid. My own extended family turned me into a misanthrope.
"I’m enjoying writing this book I’m thinking after my next book which will be more environmental focused, I might write a book on futility - futility is a topic essential to tackling worldly problems. When ppl realise something is futile they will be less inclined to cause harm."
The main reasons people procreate:  - Ego/Selfishness  - Social Pressure - Mindlessness   All are rooted in fear with the exception of mindlessness.   #antinatalism
I absolutely abhor men who are pro-life on one hand + then force their women to get abortions on the other hand. Pick one damn side you just flip flop back + forth.
"I just finished my second chapter on Natural &amp; Human Rights w regards to procreation which is just over 2000+ words. I’ll start working on my 3rd chapter which explains how ppl are indoctrinated into procreating. I’m almost 1/4 into finishing my book, but lots of editing needed."
"I’m reading an academic journal article on AN + it begins by acknowledging first step to anti-humanness is isolation, loneliness or basically being some type of incel. I have always felt isolated from the world + I find my existence very lonely - that’s not wht made me AN tho."
"I managed to take a nap + I felt a bit better I’m still exhausted I’m sitting in bed inhaling the aroma of my candle trying to be productive I did get a bit of work done, but can do better. My mood is okay, I feel a little depressed. I’m going to try + fall asleep."
I hate traffic control + road works some roads are neglected + councils waste money on roads that don’t need any road works.
I’m so tired bc of my poor sleep. I’m gonna have some vegetarian biryani + try to knock myself out so I can wake up energised enough to finish my chapter + maybe go for a long walk. I hate this 3 hour sleep every night. It drives me crazy.
"We have a Pro-Life Movement everybody perceives to be legitimate... Why can't we have an Anti-Life Movement? Oh wait, being anti-life is a mental illness (it's not)."
Imagine taking your parents to the international court for violating your human rights that would be an awesome second publicity stunt but since they aren’t absolute rights it might not work since they are constitute rights.
"My chapter on rights is probably gonna be one of the longest in my book just bc there are so many topics to cover.. I've covered natural rights, currently working on human rights, then birth rights, rights of the unborn, children's rights + shifting towards child rights advocacy."
Children are property of their guardians + the state... a child is not equal to an adult when it comes to power dynamics. Adults dominate children + children have no choice bc they are dependent on adults for their care. So children can never be equal to adults.
"The first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights""... but children aren't free, they aren't equal to adults... and their existence is basically undignified with little to no rights..."
Any #antinatalists following me (or not) religious?   #SeriousQuestion
"The more overpopulated a place gets, the more frustrated I get eventually I will end up moving to a tiny, insignificant redneck small town bc at least over there I can escape the horrors of traffic + modernity. The more isolated, the better it is"
"10 years ago, the population of my city was only 80,000 people. It has grown to 90,000 + that feels like hell already so much traffic, so hard to find parking when going shopping if you don’t come very early, hard to get appointments in general. I really hate that so much."
The womb is a manufacturer of all prisoners + slaves to be consumed by the existential meat grinder called “life”.   #antinatalism
"My mother listens to a lot of true crime stories out of the Middle East that involve dating websites.  I explained to her the fear of loneliness, the false lie of needing to procreate are a destructive combination bc they are what push women to be so desperate."
The “gift” of life is from the parents to the parents the child that is the so-called “gift” is nothing more than an object. A gift in that context is dehumanising bc it reduces a child down to a mere instrument of gratification.   #antinatalism
"Parents create children as gifts to themselves, but those “gifts” later turn into burdens + parents grow to resent their children after their novelty wears off.   #antinatalism"
This world is a wasteland + children are dumped into existence like trash. What else can you expect from sacks of shit + a shitty environment?   #antinatalism
as a kid + shamed publicly for not wanting to engage with my peers. I expand this onto indigenous ppls who I think were better off prior to colonialism. If ppl had the right to be left alone (in a specific way) so many problems would cease + this can be applied to the unborn too.
"I am writing a chapter in my book on natural/human rights for AN. Before even becoming an AN, I have always argued, that the most important right people should have before all other rights is the right to be left alone. I say this as an autistic person who was forced to socialise"
"Some ppl say they hated taking citalopram bc it numbs their emotions + they feel like zombies on it. In my case, I feel alive, happy + productive on it only downside is my poor sleep patterns. I have been facing life soberly substance free for almost a decade + I can’t do much."
Drug addiction is a key indicator that life isn’t good why would people need to alter their conscious reality if their existence wasn’t so intolerable?
"Children are a weapon of mass destruction you don’t know what kind of genes you have, you can’t predict what they will turn out like, the randomness outcome of procreation is so reckless, irresponsible + full of so much uncertainty."
The winter blues are a real thing some people get so depressed + anxious in winter - especially if they are outdoorsy people who have hobbies they enjoy out in nature + it’s hard to with shorter days + longer nights + less sunshine.
With them too. We are third worlders too - But not as simple + down to earth as the others
"a scratch on it but we couldn’t return it bc we got it online. Nigerians in academia always wrote amazing theses, my dad supervised their MBAs + I used to read their work. My brother was also v friendly with his Indian staff from Kerala + they seemed to like him. I loved working"
"I find there is something special + heartwarming about 3rd worlders. Fun fact, Nigeria is my brother’s fav country - my father was in academia + we grew up around a lot of Nigerians, they were fond of us, esp my brother. I remember buying him a globe + he complained Nigeria had"
Procreation is like stealing someone’s luxury car + taking it for a joy ride then crashing the car (beyond repair or replacement by insurance) + refusing to accept any responsibility for doing that.   #antinatalism
Alcoholics have the deepest wounds their trauma runs so deep the only way they can face another day is by having something strong enough to numb their pain
"What exhausts me isn’t the writing, but the poor sleep. With the exception of a night ago, I’ve been running on 3-4 hours of sleep every night. This is what is exhausting me. If I can get 5-6 hours of sleep every night, my life will be perfect + almost complete."
"Im too mentally exhausted to write anything except these short tweets... I hope I will get some good, deep, replenishing shut-eye tonight."
Procreation is the act of fulfilling your so-called biological needs at somebody else’s expense knowing the magnitude of suffering they will endure.   #Antinatalism
Sex is a game... Child suffering is the real shame...
"I rung my friend to see how his daughter is after her thyroid removal surgery... he said he hates seeing her suffer + wishes he didn't bring her into this world to endure the pain... I told him, suffering is part + parcel of life... Suffering is universal + inevitable."
"By high value I mean honest, hardworking, good work ethic, strong values, kind, dedicated, faithful... predators are master manipulators at sweet talking + convincing naive people of good nature to date/marry them + then the cycle of narcissistic abuse begins..."
"Every single ""high value"" man or woman I know has been fucked over by a significant other who has used/abused them."
To survive existence you need to numb yourself from all the pain... someway... somehow.
"Some men project non-existent angelic qualities onto women that aren't there. Everyone has a dark side, even the most model citizens do... these are some of the reasons why I'd rather hide under a rock than get to know anybody. It's an utter waste of time."
"The men I hv the least tolerance for r men who expect women to be wives/mothers by a certain age + men who shame women for taking antidepressants or mental health issues in general. This world drives ppl insane, u can't trust anybody + bringing a child into this world is reckless"
Every orgasm that leads to conception creates a lifetime of needless suffering. #antinatalism
Chasing prizes in life is like a dog chasing its tail.
Every birthday is another year closer to your funeral. #antinatalism
"The purpose of life is to suffer needlessly... you can only grow so much, but in the end its all futile. #antinatalism"
Life is where death begins. #antinatalism
"You life is a depreciating (so-called ""asset"") in a world of inevitable futility. #antinatalism"
Procreation is like trying to salvage a car that spends most of its time at the mechanics. Salvaging the vehicle costs more than the benefits you gain from keeping it around. #antinatalism
Antinatalism goes against natural law... we are supposed to procreate. The problem is when you reach a level of intelligence + consciousness you realise the evil of existence outweighs the good. When u really come face to face w futility you realise its pointless + not worth it.
"One of my best friends is v kind... always sending me parcels. I sent her some baklava last time. She's moving away... she congratulated me for my upcoming books. Even in this harsh world, Im thankful to blessed with decent people in this life who make existence worth tolerating."
"Children are a universal symbol of hope. The truth is there is no hope left in this world. Sentient, conscious beings do not deserve to suffer as poster children for “hope” there is nothing to be optimistic about except our slow journey towards making ourselves extinct slowly."
"I disagree with the concept of reproduction being a human right. It’s a natural desire, but it doesn’t deserve the status of a right. It is more of an impulse than a right. An impulse that is exacerbated by social engineering."
Every human being born is into this world is considered collateral damage for the price of selfishness.
I feel exhausted bc I couldn’t sleep more than 3 hours. I managed to take some notes. It doesn’t help that today’s weather is 4 seasons in one day chaotic weather.
This world is cruel bc pleasure comes at the expense of someone else’s suffering. #antinatalism
"Human rights are weaponised to protect (sabotage) the unborn via ProLife movement but the right to not be born no one cares about that, at least from a human rights angle."
Anyone with any brain cells can tell you life is mostly suffering. Knowing this + still proceeding to procreate is sadism. To sacrifice your need to be a parent to reduce suffering is on the other hand noble.
Procreation is considered a human right since progeny is part of natural law. But the person who foots the bill for it is completely dehumanised.
I failed my last assignment. Two questions on it didn’t make any sense to me so I skipped them. I hope they grade me based on overall grades bc if it’s based on that then I got 73%. My depression + suicidal tendencies really hindered my study. This is one of my worst academic yrs
Articles like this annoy me all I want to go back to is nothingness
"World Economic Forum - 8 Predictions for the World in 2030. I’ve been reading dystopian articles since I was in middle school + I always worried what life would be like. Worst time in the world to have kids, period."
Even a post-apocalyptic dystopia won’t stop people breeding. I know I’ve been reading forever a great reset is coming that will be the time we lose our civil liberties + be treated like cattle. People never think about how bad things can get even after COVID.
"Reading my favourite magazine, watching the rainfall + about to work on my next chapter I couldn’t sleep, but I managed to get myself out of the house to change the scenery. Made some hot green tea will see how long I can spend here"
Best gift I ever gave him..he saw it as me appreciating his skill + hard work. When my spirits were so broken I went out + got my degree framed + looking at it reminds me I accomplished something in the hardest of times in my life. When you’re broken you gotta life ur spirits up.
"When your bosses at work don’t acknowledge yr work, u have to acknowledge yr own work + acknowledge yr colleagues who work hard (good ones) when my friend told me his boss refused to hang his degree on wall w the others, I noticed the frame was old + I got it reframed for him."
“A scarred soul becomes on that is filled with pain.” #Quote
“When women are taught to be nice their natural instincts are overridden + they become easy targets for exploitation by predatory men.” #Quote
I can’t stand the insomnia I hope I will fall asleep again soon.
Four Cultures That Shaped My Life
Happy Winter Solstice to all my fellow Southern Hemisphere inhabitants   Happy Summer Solstice to everybody else in the Northern Hemisphere
Every child is someone else’s solution to a deeper existential problem.
"I feel this. I still don’t eat pork, rarely drink alcohol, am celibate + pretty much live almost the same way as when I was a Muslim."
"I need a road trip to clear my head maybe I don’t need to see my friends, I can visit them in a few months time maybe what I need is some alone time on the road exploring places for a day."
Children aren’t stupid. We use authority to silence them + we exploit their dependency on us to make them feel obligated.
Con-ception interesting how the prefix is con
Every child is somebody else’s prey in a world of predators.
Cat dads are better than real dads.
"Psychiatric medications bring back a lost part of me. As a child, I used to smile constantly, I was happy most of the time + had something to be excited about. It’s almost like I’m a completely different person on meds. I come off as more optimistic + actually loving life."
I’m glad I don’t dream of my first love I always fall in love with the wrong people. They are great as people but we are better off as friends almost always.
Loss of libido is a blessing if you’re single. It’s only a problem if you’re in a relationship with a high libido person. Having any kind of libido is a huge unnecessary burden - especially when you can channel that energy elsewhere.
Every child suffers in life maybe on some level they realise this and this is the only vengeance against an agonising birth. Perhaps that’s why women are punished with labour + menstrual pains.
"Beneath almost every bitter person is resentment, unfairness + being fucked over by people + the system constantly."
Every child is born a bundle of joy + dies a corpse of misery. #antinatalism
An authentic person will almost always automatically destroy a fake person right away.
Vulnerability is what makes us human but human qualities that are virtuous are always punished by a system that rewards psychopathy.
Mental health problems occur when the authentic part of you wants to stop maintaining a facade.
The truth is always (mis)labelled a mental illness. #antinatalism
"Your existence is built on a foundation of lies that is why even if you ascend, life will crumble beneath your feet bc when life is meaningless, every lack of solid foundation is doomed to collapse."
"Life is all about strife, They want you to be a drone, Refuse and you’re left all alone, Death becomes eternal bliss Until you enter the abyss."
My cousin was probably coddled by his mother she brags about how good looking he is he looks metrosexual + quite effeminate mixed in with a little bit of fuck boy. He had a mental breakdown bc his dad died of COVID my aunt didn’t teach him to accept death as part of life.
My cousin was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder I have bipolar as well mental health issues are common in children of Cluster B parents. My aunt is a complete narcissist + it’s not surprising her son turned out to be unstable like me too.
"My family is a lot of things racist, colourist, prejudice, classist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, ProLife, centrist/leftist or religious fundie (depending on where they are) I have always been a black sheep."
"Trauma + being raised in a conservative religious culture affects people’s sexuality. I think many of my relatives are asexual who had arranged marriages to look “normal” in society, there are a few I suspect are gay/bi I would say I’m almost asexual."
I used to be scared of driving long distances. Had my brother not encouraged me to drive 200km to pick up a gas heater for sale that was discontinued I never would be confident enough to drive around capital city. Being triggered (depending how so) sometimes helps you grow.
"Believe it or not, having a discussion about my religious beliefs 10 years ago when I was a devout Muslim was extremely triggering. I always tried to stay secular, openminded + not hate anybody. Had my friend not triggered that I wouldn’t have left my faith."
"I don’t understand ppl who r easily triggered I don’t think being triggered is always necessarily a bad thing. Depending on what type of trigger it is. Anything to do w sexual, psychological, medical or physical abuse triggers me + I avoid. Triggering sometimes helps me grow."
I want to go aqua jogging again one of my favourite physical activities. Sadly I have to travel over 100km to do it bc my local pool doesn’t have hydrotherapy or hot temperature pools.
In some movies they depict people using water or bowls to pour water over their bodies when they shower. It’s so underrated something is so refreshing + reenergising about water from a bucket being poured over your head + upper body.
"So this nobody puts me on their “dorks” list. Instead of trying to debate in a civil way with me or have a meaningful dialogue, they say I’m block worthy + a dork. The biggest sign of idiocracy is ad hominem attacks + calling people names instead of refuting their arguments."
Day 12: According to my watch I slept 6 hours. I finished a chapter of my book. I ate an orange + had 2 mugs of instant coffee. I went for an 8500 step walk + am taking a hot bath for meditation. I feel very happy + motivated to write my book. SSRIs hv become the air I breathe.
My dream house
I have written an introduction and a first chapter of my book. Both are around 1500 words. I need to review them after I have written more chapters + either add to them or use some statistics or supporting evidence for citations.
I'm starting to turn into my father... with all these charts and models for research/writing papers + publications.
A picture of what the upcoming illustrations for my AN children’s book will look like.
With my mum’s plants everywhere this is what chilling in my jacuzzi looks like
This world has no concept of morality or ethics. If adults use their unfair power dynamic to coerce children into existence by preying on their incapacity to make fully informed decisions + vulnerability... then this world is one place my kids won't be part of. #antinatalism
The Truth About Your Birth Certificate   via @YouTube - A document for your enslavement... made between your parents and the state.
Breeders are pimps. They consent on behalf of their children to exist (force them to exist) + then they sell their child as cattle to the state. #antinatalism
Antinatalists have compassion breeders. Breeders are repulsed + intolerant towards antinatalists. #antinatalism
"This world is in the infant stages of a dystopia. Breeders don’t know it yet, but one day they + their offspring will envy antinatalists + childfree people. #antinatalism"
"I just watched @nihilanand’s video on his future predictions. Very interesting + thought provoking. We think the world is bad now, the future will only escalate to something far worse."
Useful tools from DBT class. I’m feeling more stable on medication but these skills still help me when I’m in crisis mode.
Society treats children like circus animals rewarded for performance + punished for non-compliance + misbehaving the ultimate freak show that dehumanises children is existence. No wonder people reenact their traumas all throughout their lives.
"In all honesty, if I had an accident + I was close to death, I would prefer doctors not intervene to try + “save” me. I don’t need to be saved. If it’s my time to go, it’s my time to go. Assuming people want to be “saved” is another for consent."
"I’m researching consent for my book + so far one argument against AN in terms of consent is when doctors have to provide medical treatment to people without their consent in emergencies it’s one thing to violate a few people once, but it’s another thing to normalise it."
Having extroversion + social skills is important for our survival - natural selection was designed to wipe out people like me.
"Every person is different, but in my case as an autistic child, kindergarten scarred me for life. My dad bought me up to be a bully, I didn’t realise this until last yr. It was a defence mechanism bc I wanted to be alone all the time. I would have done better w self-study or 1-1."
"Day 11: I am still sleeping 3 hours a night, the dark circles under my eyes are really bad. I am still in good spirits - exercising, working on my book, feeling motivated. I’m going shopping with mum today. I broke my fast yesterday bc I was starving so much - had French toast."
"When I was a kid, about 3-4 years old, my mum lost me in a huge department store in Asia. I am still scarred by it over 25 years later. It triggers my anxiety + feelings of abandonment. So many ppl close to me in my adolescence abandoned me, that’s why I choose to hv few friends."
"I decided to finally buy one of these hard drives. The first time I saw my friend had one, I fell in love with it. Hopefully it will last long + motivate me to always have backup copies of my finals. I was motivated to buy it bc I noticed the price kept going up."
"OMG!!! Thank the Gods... My laptop is working!!! Now I'm gonna back up all my files to prevent this from happening again, and I can cancel my booking to go to Apple repairs store 🙏🙏🙏."
"I really hope I don’t lose my file forever + repairs help me get it back. Meanwhile, now I can either take a break + go back to writing blogposts for a bit, or I can start writing a different chapter to later combine in the book. Gosh, of all days this had to happen now 😭😭😭."
"I have the worst luck in the world I wrote about 2000 words of my book (stupidly didn’t back it up on an external hard drive or cloud), my laptop isn’t working. Luckily I have a backup laptop I can use while it’s in repairs, I just want to salvage my files."
"Life is lame, existence is pain, if it weren't for other antinatalists, I'd gone insane. #antinatalism"
"My parents gave me some money to put towards publishing my 1st book (AN children’s book) + they want me to keep writing. I guess I will. I have always been anxious about how people will perceive my work, but it seems many ppl have a lot of faith in me, so I can’t let them down."
Men &amp; High IQ Female Dating
"Being fat is a good filter to push people away from being attracted to you. Sometimes you have to fake a repulsive personality to repel people from you bc you know well, you aren't good for each other + you prefer to be alone than be in a prison w/ no solitary confinement."
"I love it when my mum reminds me my weight is an obstacle to find ""love"". Firstly, I'm not looking for love. Secondly, I hv v specific needs in a partner + hvnt met anyone who meets those needs. Thirdly, I'm happy being forever alone bc my fear of intimacy/abandonment run v deep."
"I have reached my highest weight (I think)... so I'm starting another fast since I won't be travelling to see my friends. I'm going to drink water, snake juice + tea. I hope it will help me redevelop discipline + help me cut my size down so I can have a better quality life."
My next book will be available free for anyone to download + I have dedicated it to ANs on this platform...
"Is it just me, or does it become harder to respect your parents if you are AN? You can respect your parents as people... that is how I see mine. I still feel some internal conflict bc my parents are the source of all my suffering and misery."
I'm writing the Introduction to my book + discussing Filial piety in Asian culture. I find it amusing (+ sad) Confucius convinced (what is now the most populous continent) to worship their parents even when they are dead with Ghost festivals.
I have just paid my illustrator. My AN children's book will be released in July. I can't believe I actually wrote + (am in the process of publishing a book).. I will be working on my free AN book for adults. This is my best form of charity + contribution to ANs + the AN movement.
"My AN views repels people, mainly my normie friends. My text exchange with my friend"
Twitter + Reddit are the only social media platforms where you can have intellectual discussions. All the other places are full of thirsty horn dogs who just want to talk bs.
“Parental love is nothing but the parents narcissism born again.” — Sigmund Freud #antinatalism #quote
The entire epitome of human existence is built on debt enslavement. The only way to free future generations of the burden of baring the debt of their ancestors is by not bringing them into this world. #antinatalism
Procreation is a machine for debt enslavement. Gifts are burdens when their fate is to become debts. #antinatalism
"“Life is given out as a “gift”, but the entire epitome of the existence of humankind is established on contracted debt.”"
Child suicide is the ultimate loss of hope for humanity. Children are supposed to represent hope for humanity at least to breeders.   Suicide is hated so much bc it shows the world there is no hope for humanity + people can’t handle that harsh truth.
“Antinatalism is the very opposite of eugenics; as eugenics proposes to sort the right kind of procreation from the wrong + is built on positivist thinking and rectitude of figures like Francis Galton.” — Aaron Matz #antinatalism
“Future generations are shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied.” — Thomas Hardy #antinatalism
#CurrentlyReading an academic essay on Thomas Hardy + his antinatalist themed films + novels. Very fascinating read.
The foetal position is one of defence against harm. It also resembles someone hiding their face in shame + sobbing.
"I'm obsessed with collecting notebooks for my research, writing + ideas. I didn't have anything to write in the last few pages of my notebook so I printed out some antinatalist quotes + glued them into my book. Now I will start using my first bullet journal for research/writing."
Loneliness is experienced in the same part of brain as pain.
Geniuses and intellectuals are not meant to reproduce because they are creators of human excellence and brilliance.
Day 8: I slept only 3 hours + I spent the early hours of the morning talking to my dad + loading the dishwasher. I took a bath + finished editing some work for a friend. I feel exhausted + like crap. Have been trying to sleep with no luck :(
It’s better to be an eternally “broken” person than to force a child in this world to “fix” your broken wounds (which will never happen). #antinatalism
Life is an hour glass watch your existence continue to decline as the sand slowly disappears into nothingness #antinatalism
Existence is the equivalent of being consumed by an ocean full of sharks that eat you alive. #antinatalism
Bringing a child into this world is like putting your child onto railway tracks only for them to be hit by the train + destroyed. #antinatalism
"I might have to cancel my travel plans. My friend's daughter is having surgery + needs to rest. I could always drive up next week. I really need a road trip where I can blast music, sing really loud in the car + enjoy the open road just to clear my head."
"If you believe in reincarnation, the only way to stop the cycle of rebirth is for everybody to not procreate and there we have if folks #antinatalism"
"Don’t let the innocent reap that they did not sow, Spare them the trouble of this life, Before this world decapitates them with a knife.   #antinatalism"
"Break your soul, And crush the heart, This is how we fall apart, Breed the hardship + the pain, To exist in this life will drive u insane, Slave away until you die, Smile, laugh + lie, lie, lie, Think w your brain + not down below, Children in this world will never grow"
You have to know your audience well + learn to appeal to their needs + desires. That’s the most effective way to reach AN or at least the CF lifestyle to people.
"Responsible to them.   2.) For PoC or Easterners: I focus on procreation being unethical bc these people are concerned a lot about ethics + social responsibility. I can get into geopolitics, unstable world affairs + these people will find my arguments intellectual + logical."
"In my experience when I try to explain why I’m childfree, I have different strategies for different people.   1.) For Westerners: I focus on the childfree stuff + I also mention the mental health issues in my family that I don’t wanna pass down. It makes me sound conscious +"
Bullying is part of human nature. Every child born into this world is vulnerable when the world is ruled by adults. They don’t stand a chance. The game is unfair + rigged. Their only chance for peace + success in life is non-existence. #antinatalism
Love your unborn child enough to protect them from the evil of this world. #antinatalism
"ProLifers are the most vocal brainwashed, hypocritical idiots this world has to offer. #antinatalism"
"Give a child wealth + if he’s responsible he may have a fairly good life.  Deprive a child from this mediocre existence + you’ll give him a lifetime of eternal peace, undisturbed.   #antinatalism"
This world is full of predators + children are their prey. The noble thing to do is starve the predators + deprive them of their prey. #antinatalism
The only gateway to eternal peace is through #antinatalism.
A “successful” relationship is measured by how many + how good you are at passing shit tests also your tolerance levels + how good you are at “keeping the peace”.
"I was feeling tired + couldn’t get an afternoon nap. I made some lentil soup with a magic ingredient from Sri Lanka my BFF introduced me to, I had a bit, + I feel really good. I haven’t made soup in over 6 months. The old me is coming back slowly."
My Mental Health Journey Going Forward
Today seems to be my lucky day I went to buy some clothing that I thought was on sale + it wasn’t but the sales lady gave me the sale price. Then this guy in the supermarket offered to pay for my brother’s drink bc he thought he didn’t have any money. Kindness always wins.
That is stunning 😍😍😍. I love greenery ❤️.
"I finally finished my assignment. There are two questions I skipped bc I didn't know how to do them. Now I can celebrate... go shopping, get my nails done + relax for the next 3 weeks before going back to school again. Thank God that's over. I also passed one of my courses too!"
"Day 7: According to my fitness watch, I slept 4 hours + 40 mins - I feel more refreshed than the last couple of nights. Meds seems to be keeping me in a stable mood. I went for a walk last night. Today I’ll go shopping + get my nails done to celebrate once I’ve finished my study."
End up with some very unpleasant experiences.  When you disturb people’s peace you have to endure the consequences for your actions we don’t leave anything alone the first people we violate are the unborn + look at how many people wreak havoc on the earth bc of it.
2.) Indigenous people have intergenerational trauma bc colonialists didn’t leave them alone in peace.  3.) If ecosystems were left alone flora/fauna would thrive without our interference.  4.) There are places that are haunted or cursed + people who don’t leave those places alone
I have always believed in leaving people alone if people learnt to leave others alone we would have peace on this planet this is one reason why #antinatalism resonates so strongly with me let’s see   1.) Imperialist countries have enemies bc they didn’t leave ppl alone.
"Became traumatised. She hardly goes out, doesn’t have friends, didn’t marry + decided to leave dead people alone I look at this story as a bit of a metaphor for antinatalism in some ways bc the unborn do not want to be disturbed yet we feel we are entitled to disturb them."
My mother’s cousin had Ouija board to try + contact the dead. One day after pestering them when she was walking the streets of Baghdad this bucket full of dirty water fell onto her body + she heard the words “won’t you leave us alone in peace + don’t disturb us?” After that she
"I’m grateful for my celibacy, my disinterest in 99% of people on earth, my autism that makes me awkward + repels neurotypical ppl I get annoyed with + my misanthropy that keeps me isolated from unnecessary social interactions. But what I’m most grateful for is dying some day"
"Wombs r poisonous bearers of the fruit of suffering. Few women birth geniuses who help humanity, more women birth children who end up incarcerated but all wombs birth suffering + mediocrity. Human life is not to be celebrated, but to be cursed w misfortune + bad luck."
"Most misogyny is rooted in male envy of women’s ability to “create life” at least speaking on a religious or patriarchal level. If women create life, then women are sinners but men bear the sin of desire. Women have nothing to be envied for if creating life is a curse, tbh."
"Am I the only one who showers in the dark at night with nothing but candle light or this tiny colourful plug-in night light my BFF gave me? Sometimes shower lights exhaust me, so I like to give my eyes a rest."
Im starting to feel tired after a few days of insomnia running on 3 hours of sleep. I have finished more than 3/4 of my assignment. I will probably chill a little + I can submit later tonight or tomorrow morning finally. I pray to God I get a few extra hours of sleep tonight.
"People are hard to understand sometimes:   You can reject a potential romantic interest but it doesn’t mean you have to be cruel, mean or abusive to them.   You can be nice to someone but it doesn’t mean you fancy them.   The most important things in life are class + kindness."
Why are people so offended by the word weirdo? I’ve always thought nothing is wrong with it. Just another word.
That quote is iconic!
I’m grateful to noodletools - best platform for APA + other citations 😍😍😍.
"How I do assignments:   1.) For questions - I hand write them down in a notebook + then type everything up.   2.) Essays - I copy + paste things then paraphrase them, then paste them in google translate to listen to them being read to me.   3.) Reports - Similar to essays."
I find most people to be stupid + very poor judges of character. Many people assume a lot of things about me + most of the time they are wrong. It’s better to be silent than to open your mouth + offend someone or prove your idiocy.
For future reference World Fertility Day is on November 2nd that’s the perfect day to spread awareness about AN.
"Academics have always been my strength. I will tackle natalism from an academic angle. I enjoyed Benatar’s work, but my academic background is in environmental science + media/humanities so how I would tackle AN would be slightly different."
I just realised bc I’m a uni student I get access to journals. That’s very helpful for my research for my future AN publications. I love EBSCOhost but I haven’t used it since my undergrad almost 10 years ago.
I feel I have accomplished a lot I wouldn’t have been able to do if I wasn’t on medication. I might drop the Ritalin altogether + keep it as an emergency drug. I need lots of sleep so I don’t end up manic or psychotic - the last thing I need is to be in a psych ward again.
"I’m feeling okay considering I slept only 3.5 hours last night. This morning I did 2 loads of washing, some self-care, went to laundromat + mall, picked up subway + might get a smoothie. Hopefully I can sleep more or take another bath. I plan to finish my final assignment today."
"Definitely. There needs to be a paradigm shift in people’s consciousness to accept futility as part of life + to not define success purely on evolutionary terms. Success is futile too, but is subjective + can be defined beyond passing down your genes."
"My parents asked me if I want to go to therapy, I said no. Being high IQ + a deep thinker makes it hard for me to find therapists who can help me. I found group therapy at hospital helped + I’m open to doing some parts of DBT in d future. My main problem is I’m non-neurotypical."
"Agreed. Given the fact trauma is intergenerational + passed on via DNA + epigenetics, ppl end up breeding more trauma. The sad part is most therapy is more about profit than healing. The step forward is encouraging people to heal from their trauma + reconsidering procreation."
Procreation is imposing with one hand + taking with the other. #antinatalism
The original sin of Adam + Eve was not eating from the tree of knowledge but it was choosing to procreate.
Progeny is the gateway to eternal hellfire (damnation). #antinatalism
Procreation thrives on a false illusion of power in a world where powerlessness prevails. #antinatalism
Procreation is gifting the next generation with the burden of meaninglessness. #antinatalism
The purpose of procreation is to maintain the status quo of the oppressive ruling class. #antinatalism
Real “success” in life is choosing your own happiness over mass conformity to outdated traditions that bring you nothing but misery. #MyMotivationalQuote
"What they need is therapy + to try + heal from the past, rather than have children to relive or have an illusory experience of a do-over of their own traumatic childhood."
Breeders who have children to “give them the life they never had” are traumatised people deprived with a deep emotionally scarred inner child that has always been unhappy. They basically want a do-over or to re-experience a different childhood by having kids.
What’s up with identical twins who date/marry the same man? You gotta have some type of identity outside being somebody else’s twin.
"I found out recently 1 of my ex-colleagues is a widow. His wife died in a car accident on the way to work + he refused to go back to India after his wife died, so he ended up working long night shifts + raising his daughter on his own. It’s tragic. Ppl suffer so much bc of work."
"I accept there will be many ppl who don’t agree w my decision, but I have to do what’s best for myself Idk how to handle my spiritual “gifts” + perhaps I don’t want them as much as I thought I did. I don’t plan on getting pregnant + I’m not taking too much to damage my liver."
"In difficult circumstances like during out of control psychosis, to accepting them as a necessary evil to be able to function in a world I absolutely hate. I don’t mind spending the rest of my life on em as long as I don’t have any terrible side effects that impair me too badly."
"In this world. I come off as v depressed + cynical but a long time ago, I used to be a v happy person who was always smiling + looked really happy. It wasn’t always fake. There has been some evolution in my thinking.. I went from being pro-meds, to anti-meds, to accepting em only"
Us to take him off medications. His hallucinations were terrible. I was pressured by a v close friend + my mother to come off my psych meds + I lived a fairly okay life without them for almost a whole decade. I have accepted now that I need them to be able to function “normally”
"I have always had a vendetta against pharmaceuticals + I will never forget the horrible experiences I have had on psychiatric medications, but I’m slowly shifting towards being more neutral towards them. I watched my brother experience terrible psychosis when my mother pressured"
My curiosity + love for freedom is what destroyed my anchor to sustain my existence without descending deep into existential nihilism. Nothing can anchor a mind like mine bc my mind destroys all anchors involuntarily by overanalysing + deconstructing them.
Using Microsoft Word for iPhone is like the most amazing experience I have ever had so far with technology. I love having written work read to me by it.
"Feel more like my ""old self"" again... only concerns are issues with sleep that could lead to recurring psychosis. Solution for that is increase hot baths, take time off the screen, read + try to go for another walk + wind down with a cup of yogi tea."
"Day 5: Insomnia for over 24 hours, napped for 3 hours. Exhausted + took meds as usual today, no Ritalin. A hot bath seemed to do the trick for my fatigue. Went for a walk + managed to get about 1/4 of my assignment done. Am doing better since starting antidepressants again."
Yes. It needs to be regulated to help provide a safe environment with good working conditions for sex workers to protect their basic human rights.
To each their own opinion.
I bought a few pairs of compression socks to try. I love the support they give my feet. Highly recommended. Now I know why my dad was obsessed with buying them. My friend who is a clinical orthotist also recommended them.
"Michael Franti is my guilty pleasure when I feel like I need to be optimistic, positive, hopeful + an idealistic dreamer. I’ve always had a tiny bit of an inner hippie in me. He’s probably the only upbeat artist I listen to everything else I like is depressing + melancholic."
"I used to be quite interested in matriarchy, but in some ways I have some trauma bond with the patriarchy bc I grew up in a traditionalist, patriarchal, paleo-conservative family. I want to cultivate a deeper alternative understanding of the feminine."
"#CurrentlyReading - I bought this book last year when I was psychotic. I have always self-identified as an egalitarian. Women need to be armed (w education, money + an escape plan) when they enter into relationships to protect themselves from predatory, opportunistic men."
"Be a democracy, I told them we are better off as a dictatorship. Dictatorships are to be admired for their transparency. Democracies thrive on blindly enslaving people with false illusions of freedom (their freedom is also limited). All sides are losers somehow in some way."
Many dictatorships require people to do national military service. Some dictatorships actually help advance their countries like Singapore. The worst case scenario of a dictatorship was Iraq. I believe different forms of govts suit different people. When people ask me should Iraq
One of my deepest internal conflicts is between dictatorship + democracy. There r many things abt a democratic society I appreciate but at the same time I despise fact it’s all a Ponzi scam. I hate restrictions under dictatorships but I think they r most honest than democracies.
"The most exhausting war in human history that never ends is the war between ANs + breeders. It seems like we are losing to them, but we must remember all wars are futile, we will eventually find peace again + they are the real losers bc their prize is intergenerational suffering."
"#Antinatalism is a propaganda war against the tyrants who seek to control, enslave, manipulate + murder the next generation of humans needlessly. Fertility is the most powerful card in our hands ONLY if we choose NOT to play it."
"Society is weak. They are predatory against vulnerable women who don’t fully understand life yet + the target is always their offspring, bc the one who controls children will be the master of the next generation."
The closest physical experiences to non-existence:   1.) Deep sleep 2.) A hot/warm bath (like being in the womb again) 3.) Meditation 4.) Coma
The next best thing to sleeping if you’ve had insomnia is a hot magnesium salt bath. It almost gives you the illusion of a goodnight sleep. Hopefully after this I will get back to work
"An act of compassion is allowing death to come to those who are dying. Prolonging somebody’s suffering is not compassionate but heartless, selfish + cruel."
My life/existence review. It doesn’t even deserve 1/2 a star -5 stars instead. #antinatalism
"I just woke up from a 2-3 hour sleep. It’s a blessing with you’ve been awake for more than 24 hours straight. I’m not sure if it’s the weather, the meds or caffeine that has been keeping me up. I started editing a friend’s book but my head still feels very hazy."
"I just read an article abt another govt inquiry investigating child abuse in the 70s in a mental institution that closed + is abt an hours drive from my place - it makes me sick how many people get abused, there is never any justice done + the govt is bsing ppl w these inquiries."
A lifetime of suffering + paying for the sins of our parents... to spare the unborn the burden of existence. Now that’s better than any deity dying for my sins or me being obligated to breed for my parents (or the state).
"Evolution made the bottom of the barrel breed the most, as they are the most “disposable” in this sadistic game. #antinatalism"
"We are indoctrinated with a false illusion of immortality. That is why we are horrible. If we were indoctrinated with the fact life is futile, not good + we will die, we would at least make some effort to be better quality human beings overall."
"Maybe I’m being too idealistic here, but part of AN is acknowledging futility. Once you realise riches, conquests for land, resources + women are futile + there are no children in the future to inherit (whatever people chase) there is no reason to be a POS human being anymore."
"There wouldn’t be any wars, people would do the bare minimum amount of work they need to do, they’d have all the time in the world to contemplate “what they might think the meaning of life” might be... but since most people think we are crazy it’s their loss."
"#Antinatalism is a gateway towards a utopia if it’s followed by the majority of people on a mass scale.   Think about it... ppl would stop putting pressure on themselves financially, ppl would live life to the fullest + treat each other w kindness bc hey, life is short."
#Antinatalism is the only way to right the wrongs of the sins of our forefathers.
#Antinatalism is the only justice left in an unjust world.
"I remember being abhorred at the age of 18 when I researched ethics, marketing, subliminal messaging + children. The indoctrination is almost epigenetic bc we inherit trauma from our parents. Domestication is the key weapon for control here."
Have you ever seen any of those documentaries where they show you how marketers target children when they are still babies? That’s how it is for every person on this planet. We are domesticated to become consumers + self-flagellating for corporations + govts.
"Imagine your mind is a plot of land filled with many types of overgrown  weeds, de-programming is like stripping your piece of land of all the weeds (lies you’ve been told) + deciding to start fresh."
Writing is the way I kept my sanity. I can write about 5000 words in one sitting. It runs in my family. I could spend the rest of my life doing it...
Doctors prolong people’s suffering... at least most of them. AN is about prevention rather than “cure” which is counterproductive. That is why it’s the most effective tool we have.
#Antinatalism is the only weapon we have against our oppressors.
Antinatalists are the biggest contributors to humanity. Why? Bc the philosophy seeks to reduce suffering. ANs are unfucking the world + helping undo thousands of years worth of indoctrination. So before calling us crazy... at least we have the heart to tell you the truth.
"I'm starting to feel partially alive again... But I'm hoping it's not a bad sign... I feel this strong wave of passion... I'm writing again, I'm getting study done... I'm interested in history + paranormal research which I haven't done for a while. Maybe I am becoming ""me"" again."
"of psychosis (+ potential hospitalisation) + being low functioning unable to do my study, projects or take care of myself... I guess being psychotic is a sacrifice I have to make + its the price I pay to be a ""functioning"" human being + even at that, I still fail."
I decided to take my antidepressants earlier than usual. I feel so productive + so alive. I've been going for walks. This is my second night barely able to sleep. I'm worried I may end up in a psychotic state bc of it... but if I honestly had to choose between the inconvenience
I'm a geriatric millennial when it comes to tech. I moved out of my house back home + I've been USB Printing for the past 7 months + only now hv I finally managed to change the WIFI connection on my printer so I can wirelessly print. I'm such a moron when it comes to technology.
"Every womb is cursed with a self-absorbed, consumerist, destructive, death making factory. #antinatalism"
"Breeders are like Robin Hood. They steal from the unborn to feed their own parasites + the carnivores that inhabit this world. At least Robin Hood gave to the poor, breeders steal to feed govts, corporates + the rich. #antinatalism"
Procreation is a bankrupt drone's social currency for attention. #antinatalism
There's a happy ending for everyone + its called death + nothingness. The sad part is reaching this stage can be very agonising for many people. #antinatalism
You are the demon who gives birth to the antichrist - only you don't know it yet bc every bundle of joy is supposed to cure cancer + find life on the moon. #antinatalism
"Procreation is like doing a science experiment with acid on your body parts... even tho it's someone else's life, they were once part of you. #antinatalism"
"Progenitors are gamblers, mad scientists + witches/wizards... (and I'm not talking about the good kind). #antinatalism"
"I just finished my first draft copy of my AN children's story book. I can't believe I got it done so quickly... needs some work, need an illustrator + then I will self-publish... Hopefully no insomnia tonight + I can spend several hours grinding it on my final assignment."
I just submitted my assignment on HVAC systems + transportation/accessibility in commercial buildings. I have been struggling to get anything done. Now one more assignment to go (which I haven't started yet) + I can finally go on holiday + work on projects.
"Day 4: Aripiprazole, Citalopram + Ritalin - I am starting to notice light tremors in my hand + I feel a bit hazy and light headed sensations. I'm guessing thats the Ritalin because I didn't have those symptoms before. Hopefully they ease... I really want these meds to work."
I’m a very impressionable person too... people hardly forget me when they meet me... hmmm... I’ll wait and see what happens + decide once I’m in the final stages.
I also have a very unique Middle Eastern surname very few people have + I’m related to an internationally recognised figure in the Islamic world... so it’s hard. I think I might have to take it seriously bc if AN is my life... then I must embrace it proudly.
"I’m conflicted about what name to use for my books... do I use my pen name, my legal name or my first name + middle names (or another surname). I worry about my toxic, narcissistic relatives obsessed with stalking me will find my stuff. My dad is also kind of famous so it’s hard."
"Having a High IQ as a woman is a curse... it makes dating + relationships almost impossible. You can't afford to be picky bc all your other high IQ potential suitors are rare/hard to find, so you learn to turn a blind eye to red flags or areas where you clash/conflict w suitors."
"Even tho it didn't work out, I am very grateful for the opportunities to grow + learn from my mistakes. It also helped me realise, I am better suited to friendships than relationships (which I hv trouble maintaining). Learning about my wrongs is very humbling. I have no regrets."
Today is the 13th of June... It's hard for me to ever forget this date. I'm grateful for all the happy moments in my life associated with this date. I'm very honoured + privileged to have had the opportunity to have dated a high IQ person (very rare + hard to find).
"Even when I was leaving religion, I refused to identify as a secular humanist. Ive always despised humans + preferred company of nature + animals to them.   Humans are a sinking ship + trying to 'save' our race is futile bc stupidity, ignorance+ selfishness prevail most in us."
"Humanism + Humanitarianism are euphemisms for sadists to try + virtue signal they ""care""... sometimes letting the world around you burn the best way to show you ""care"" instead of trying to play God to prolong people's suffering for no good reason."
"How do u communicate something to someone + ensure they understand what they did wrong + apologise, but then they repeat it again + it takes a toll on you. Sometimes you have to show them how much it hurts you so it sinks into their psyche somehow. Its not from a vengeful place."
"I know I always say ""an eye for an eye"" is the foundation of my culture + I come off as a vengeful person sometimes.. but when someone hurts me too much + I hv the chance to hurt them back, sometimes I take it, bc even tho they apologise... they still haven't learnt their lesson."
"Once you see the world for what it truly is + you discover #antinatalism, u have a moral obligation to spread it as a truth. When I was religious I refused to proselytise people... but AN is a much bigger message... its about/for the innocent, so I'll spread it til the day I die."
I will always help those closest to me for the sake of helping them. I hope some day we will shift towards a more ethical means of banking. My family taught me to always try to give + not be greedy.
"Altho it was traumatising + wasn’t easiest, I am eternally thankful for my Islamic upbringing. I absolutely abhor usury + loan sharks that exploit poor + vulnerable in society. I believe in eradicating usury or charging 1% for admin costs. Y add gasoline to those already burning?"
"I downloaded Fiverr + signed up for an account... I love it so much. This gives me confidence to find what I’m looking for, for my future projects."
"You can’t go wrong with Greek yoghurt, garlic, oregano, sea salt + olive oil... best quick dip to have or something to eat with bread."
"“Society is an ecosystem of fraud. We lie to ourselves + we are trained to do this by ppl impeding on our experiences when we are young, once we are stunted we are kept busy w bs missions in life + then we enter our own pity parties + complain about it.” - Raphael Samuel #Quote"
Bc I can’t sleep... I’m writing my Antinatalist children’s story book but it seems to be turning out to be more of a short story than a children’s book. I’ll try to finish it. Type it up. Refine it. Get some feedback. Maybe I might finally feel tired + fall asleep 😴😴😴.
"I have insomnia again... From now on, I’m going to try reading or writing until I get so tired I fall asleep. Can’t afford to waste anymore time... 😞."
"...some of us just don’t want children or diseases. Society thinks something is wrong with us, and maybe there is on some level, but not desiring sex is NBD bc we have a chance to find ourselves...   Society wants us to fuck bc they capitalise on these base, animalistic desires."
"...we are overloaded w pheromones due to overpopulation + we are desensitised by sex, adult entertainment industry has made masturbation an alternative to getting some, some of us have a fear of intimacy bc of the deep traumas associated with attachment styles due to our parents"
"It’s hard for some people to be interested in sex...   Some medications kill libido, our culture is so obsessed w sex we eventually get sick of it, many ppl have traumas related to sexual abuse, ppl raised by narcissists c sex as a mechanical activity for purpose of procreation."
"Society’s culture regarding sex needs some type of reformation. Women can never win - if they sleep around they are sluts, if they don’t they are prudes. If men can’t get some they are pathetic incels. Society creates these norms to shame childfree people or those who prefer FA."
"Existence is like a private prison system. W/o criminals, the cells would be empty. It’s the same w procreation. Govt, corporations, society + parents profit from your existence. Procreation is worse than murder, but being a horny fuck animal is petty + pathetic. #antinatalism"
Euthanasia + capital punishment (if it’s done humanely) are like being granted parole. Procreation creates more people to fill up the slavery industrial complex.
"The best way to repel people is to always be cold + distant. When you’re cold/distant + you go into freeze mode, people either feel uncomfortable around you or curious about you. I’m warm when I’m comfortable with ppl, but being cold/distant is my weapon to keep ppl away."
"One day a friend of mine explained to me that Prophet Muhammad was afraid of dogs or disliked them + that’s y Muslims prefer cats, over dogs. My friend was also born/raised a Muslim, he prefers dogs over cats + that’s when I realised dogs r disliked bc of one person - it’s silly."
"I usually just walk past dogs like it’s nothing + most of the time they leave me alone. If they come up to me, I end up petting them unless they catch me in a split second off guard. When you don’t make eye contact with dogs, most of the time they leave you alone."
"Dogs smell fear in a person miles away. I’ve always been a cat person - the only dogs I dislike r ones who r overly friendly to me..I’m generally a cold/distant person, bt I’m touchy when it comes to cats. Despite being born/raised Muslim, both sides of my family were dog owners."
#Antinatalism is basic logic + common sense.
One of the best frozen pizzas I have ever had. Highly recommended.
Sexual desire is evolution’s curse bestowed upon species to salvage the futility of our existence at the cost of our sanity. #antinatalism
Indoctrination is everlasting venom society infests your mind with.
"Some manosphere groups like MGTOW, PUAs are absolutely cringe - the blackpilled incels have the most self-respect out of all these men’s groups. Women with too many selfies on social media too obsessed with their appearance are cringe too. My autistic brain doesn’t get it."
Am I the only one who finds the mating game a grand performance (by the world’s greatest clowns) stupid + a waste of time bc the end result is the honeymoon period of every relationship ends between 6 months to 3 years + “starting a family” as sadistic victimisation of children?
Human indoctrination into the cult of procreation involves socially conditioning ppl to kill their conscience completely when it comes to a child’s welfare while having a moral conscience regarding asinine irrelevant BS like calling a pregnancy termination murder. #antinatalism
"It takes a lifetime to deprogram, uneducate + re-educate yourself with truth after decades of propaganda from the govt, religious institutions, society + your parents."
"Is it weird to say, I wish govts would have gas chambers for citizens it deems completely + utterly useless? Often times I feel completely useless + like a waste of space, so I’d happily go to a gas chamber + die so I’m no longer a burden on the planet."
Most of women’s problems originate or are intrinsically linked to their ability to procreate.
"I remember talking to someone many years ago abt a dystopian movie (don’t recall the name) where there was one man left after the earth is destroyed + he has to help repopulate the earth. If I was in that position, I’d probably shoot myself or enjoy a planet w no ppl for a while."
What I learnt about ppl from dealing with them is...   1.) They feel entitled to be served without basic manners.  2.) They are probably jealous or very envious of ppl who achieve things in life.  3.) Acknowledging their mistakes/wrongs is a blow to their fragile egos.
"In today’s day + age... its rare to find...   1.) People who say “please” + “thank you”.  2.) People who congratulate you on positive things in life you’ve achieved.  3.) People who will give you a genuine, heartfelt apology for when they’ve wronged you.  #misanthropy"
"When people stare at me, it makes me feel very uncomfortable, sometimes people give me dirty looks for no good reason. I try my best to avoid making eye contact with most people. I always look away, hide behind my sunglasses + do my best to disengage with ppl ASAP."
"I cringe when I hear abt ppl talking about humans colonising Mars or some other planet in our solar system. We clearly haven’t learnt our lessons from past colonial conquests here on earth. Even w technology, we still fail to recognise how insignificant we are on a grand scale."
That’s beautiful. Thanks for sharing. #antinatalism
"My local wholefoods owner passed away recently. The cause of his death was a heart attack due to stress + obesity. It’s a shame bc he was a lovely + kind gentleman. I’ll miss him, but at least he won’t be suffering much now bc whatever was troubling him is no longer there."
You can tell a lot about a man from the way he looks at you. Eye contact is the most effective tool of non-verbal communication that indicates who/what you’re dealing with. The way a man looks at you is an indication of whether you’re dealing with a gentleman or a sleaze.
The first time I realised I didn’t want to be alive was when I was 9. The first time I attempted suicide was around the age of 14 when I swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills bc that was the only language my parents could understand.
Not surprising at all...
"Procreation is the destruction of the very essence of freedom that we claim to value, ever so much. #antinatalism"
Procreation degrades women by fetishising them as baby incubators. Procreation degrades men by treating them as disposable. Procreation degrades children by enslaving them in a pointless game where everybody is a loser. #antinatalism
Procreation is a losing game of lifelong enslavement + a lifetime of trying to suppress perpetual boredom. The only players in the game are the beneficiaries + the game pieces (you) are the losers. #antinatalism
Procreation is the cowardly way of coping with the fact progenitors will one day return to non-existence. #antinatalism
Many doctors shame their female patients who r not sexually active or in relationships. Incel men are treated as creepy losers. Society (via culture) weaponises shame to control sexuality and reproduction among people. Ppls faces drop when I tell them how long I’ve been celibate.
I find most humans useless + completely unreliable + inefficient. It’s time to make us obsolete + find something else to help you maintain your status quo.
Humans are useless slaves unless their IQ is below average level...   1. We are inefficient 2. It depends on genetic determinism 3. We are freethinkers with basic knowledge + common sense so we can see the Ponzi scheme of existence 4. Some people are resistant to indoctrination
"One thing I despise about the entertainment industry is how people fetishise tragedy for clout. If my loved ones died in a terror attack, I would not want a movie made on them or their lives... I would deal with my grief in my own way + stay out of the media."
Every child is a soldier forced to fight battles for their parents + on behalf of their nation state.
Taking a bullet to protect the innocent is always worth it. #antinatalism
The only way to protect the innocent (children) is to refuse to bring them into this world. #antinatalism
The only safe space from the insanity of the world is non-existence. #antinatalism
"The only way to survive in this world is to stab your eyes, ears + tongue with daggers + numb your soul with escapism."
"I sat down w my parents talking abt security intelligence + people who are govt agents. I told my parents I’m grateful to be middle class, have savings + to be a complete loner + introvert + to never have to go down that path. I hate snitches + I despise lowlifes who spy on ppl."
"Childfree ppl contribute to the world just by being CF there’s less:  1. Consumers 2. Traffic 3. Noise 4. Pollution 5. Competition for jobs, housing + other scarce commodities  Before anyone calls them selfish or hedonistic look at how they make life more bearable for ppl."
Procreation is the mother of all injustices this world has to offer. #antinatalism
"People say birthdays are blessings bc not everyone makes it to a certain age... my question is, is death only tragic when one isn’t ready for it or they haven’t accomplished all that they want in life, or is dying young a blessing to prevent more suffering in life?"
Human existence is an accident waiting to happen.
I’m not a fan of fame in general. If I had to be famous for something it would have to be some type of community service or excellence in some way. I absolutely abhor fame + publicity in general. I don’t understand people’s obsession with fame especially parasitic fame.
"There r 3 average roads to fame:  1.) Positive publicity - great excellence as a model citizen, involved in community service.  2.) Convicted criminal - depending on crime, u will have your moments of fame on TV.  3.) Parasitic fame - where you piggy back off a tragedy for game."
"I’ve been told the following things cause infertility:   1.) Cats 2.) Plastics that leak estrogen  3.) Psychiatric medication 4.) Unhealthy diet  In all honesty, even tho I’ll probably be celibate for the rest of my life, my fertility has absolutely no value to me + I hate it."
I’ve had cats since I was 13 years old. Most selfies I took in my teens were always with cats. I used to get so much criticism from family bc cat fur can cause infertility etc. but I didn’t care. I look back now how people try to prolong + salvage their fertility which is bs.
"Day 3: Aripiprazole - I seem to be sleeping better. I had an afternoon nap + feel tired now. If it is getting me back into a stable sleep cycle + I’m still getting up in the morning, then it might be the right medication for me after all. Still early to really say that."
"I’ve heard about some interesting places to go to, to find God.   My best friend told me to go to the jungle or out into nature to find God.  Another friend told me to meditate + look within myself to find God.  Both of those places are closer to God than organised religion."
"I’ve lost count of how many Arab female SJWs who complain about White supremacy, cultural appropriation + mainstream beauty standards who are obsessed with dyeing their hair blonde + they actually think it suits them. IMHO it doesn’t suit them + they look awkward."
"Best way to get revenge on mainstream beauty standards, corporations tht profit off of ppls insecurities, beauty industry that promotes Eurocentric beauty standards is by embracing yr natural appearance proudly + being comfortable in your skin. Confidence makes u more beautiful."
"I dnt understand PoC who complain abt white supremacy + bleach their skin, dye their hair blonde + wear coloured contact lenses. Y do u wanna look like yr so-called “enemies” or ppl u dislike? I thought embracing yr natural aesthetic wud b the rebellious (or vengeful) thing to do"
"You’re onto it, a 100% my friend."
"I don’t mind conferences, seminars or workshops... the places I tend to avoid are usually full of nosy people who want to pry into my business or aren’t stimulating enough for me mentally. My autistic brain finds most events to be pointless, boring + not stimulating enough."
"I am not a fan of weddings. I declined to attend an old friend’s wedding. It isn’t anything personal. It’s the social anxiety, impatience + the fact I’m so out of shape I don’t feel like going. Weddings are toxic places where nasty women gossip + the noise is too loud."
"Being childfree is about failing biologically + evolutionarily, but not success at the expense of your pain + misery (or someone else’s)."
Unprotected sex is the most harmful activity people engage in.
Can’t wait to make Shakshouka tonight ❤️.
"For women to avoid domestic violence or abusive relationships... they need to be in control of their finances + fertility. They need to have firm boundaries + assume almost every partner they have may turn out to be abusive, unless proven otherwise + have an escape plan in place."
I hope she reclaims her power + finds an escape plan if she needs to leave. I hope her son turns out okay... I'm ready to help + take on some aunt duties. I remember talking to her abt antinatalism... I guess deep down she was insecure + decided to settle + got screwed over.
"Last year I told my cousin that she was a terrible mother bc she abandoned her child for more than 3 months with her parents, but 3 months became more than 1 year. I'm in shock to see an alpha female + strong career woman like her would end up in an abusive relationship."
The red flags to always look out for are:   1.) A rush to get married + short courtship period. 2.) Insisting on having children almost right away. 3.) A joint bank account or control of finances. 4.) A man who is enmeshed with his family.  5.) Potential clashes in relationship.
"I cannot generalise all Arab men as financially abusive, bc there are many Arab men who treat their wives like queens. I just want women to always hv an education, trade/skill ready + an escape plan ready bc nearly everyone who is close to me has been in an abusive relationship."
I wrote a post almost 10 years ago about how abusive some Arab men are financially to their wives + I remember an American woman had written to me about the horrific financial abuse from her Arab husband who would send all the money she earned from her job to her in-laws.
"Financial abuse is the most common form of narcissistic abuse. Eastern men like to take advantage of the stigma of being unwed, childfree + female biological clock + then proceed to baby trap their spouse w a child while controlling her. I don't understand y ppl give into fear."
I feel the same way abt their female counterparts..The lowest of the low r narcs who shift from the love bombing phase to the abuser almost overnight after they've locked down their partner. It's a literal nail in the coffin showing how much contempt they have for their partners.
"I have a vendetta against male gold diggers... why are they always narcissists who get off on financially abusing their alpha, go-getter career women wives? And why do their wives stay with them (aside from cultural stigma of divorce or the fact they have children with them?)"
Procreation is the biggest scam of the century. Children are state property + the cruel joke is on the children. #antinatalism
One of the biggest red flags in a relationship is when your partner asks to have a joint bank account. The motives are always financial abuse. I’d rather die alone between 4 walls than settle for a guy who has full control of my finances.
"I just found out one of my closest loved ones is in an abusive relationship. I feel v bad for her. I hope her husband has a change of heart + she breaks free. It’s better for a woman to be forever alone as female volcel than to settle for an abusive, controlling manipulative man."
I don’t think I’d ever wear an antinatalist tshirt in public or have an antinatalist bumper sticker on my car. I think ppl won’t get it. I would wear a Rick + Morty tshirt or wear something with a short quote + static image that is thought provoking + relates to AN somehow tho.
"Today there’s this craft market I go to every year... I won’t go. I have too many hand creams from my friend to last forever, I have a huge supply of bath bombs + organic tea + plenty of medicinal creams for my migraines + body aches. I love supporting local small businesses."
Childfree people have to do janitorial duties to clean up the mess of breeders either directly or indirectly + they are given absolutely no credit for it whatsoever.
"To all childfree people out their - you can sleep comfortably at night with no skeletons in your closet to haunt you bc you didn’t contribute to the misery, pain + suffering of a child who will hate you with absolute contempt when they grow up. Best gift to be grateful for."
"It’s better to do a 1000 years of time in a prison than to bring a child into this world, especially one that isn’t given all the care, love, affection + attention this child deserves."
"I don’t understand mothers who are career women working in MNCs, making good money who put their kids into daycare, dump them on their ageing parents + use an iPad as a babysitter for their kids. I love my cousin but my heart breaks for her son. You can’t have your cake + eat it."
"I remember when I was religious, I was terrified of facing these end times + I wondered how difficult it would be for children in those times. Yet religious people procreate more than their irreligious counterparts + they ostracise + abuse pro-choice ppl. I just don’t get it."
"2/3 of people on earth are followers of an Abrahamic religion - be it Judaism, Christianity or Islam. These religions reference dystopian end times + prophesise the hardship humanity is meant to endure + the signs have been there for a while... yet these people continue to breed."
"Learning about the Mark of the Beast, droughts + decline in vegetation + overall environmental + social degradation during the “end times” doesn’t sound v promising for the future. Some of these prophecies are terrifying... that definitely helps feed into accepting AN more."
"My favourite parts of religious texts growing up were about revelations + the anti-Christ. It scared me a little, but I was fascinated by how many dystopias were self-fulfilling prophecies for humankind. It’s like we were created as an experiment to self-destruct + burn."
"Dystopian short stories about the corruption of morals, decadence, rise of statism + overall degradation of life helped influence + allow me to accept AN more so than I would have if I just kept my rose coloured glasses on like everybody else."
"As a child, I loved sci fiction + dystopian genres. This was my favourite children’s novel series. I would love to explore more of this genre again + maybe write my own dystopian stories - I think many of them hold a lot of truth + will promote AN as a solution in some ways."
Humans reject things that are part + parcel of existence.
There is a difference between traditional masculinity + toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity is when a man can level up to improve himself. A lot of traditional masculinity is mislabelled “toxic” but in many ways it’s the foundation of every rock in society.
"To try + destroy classism, casteism, sectarianism etc... is like trying to remove strong, solid but rotten foundations in a building. The ramifications of removing them are far worse than the benefits. The only solution is to remove future generations from the gene pool."
Human existence is about leaving behind seeds of destruction that we continue to feed for generations beyond our own.   It’s hard to destroy corrupt social structures when what’s left of them protects us in our own way. The only solution is human extinction so we can finally RIP.
"Corruption is an inherent part of human nature. That is why the systems we adhere to are corrupt. Despite knowing this, we continue to adhere to them + become reliant on them - until the point they become indestructible."
The human psyche is fucked up. Human social structure is established based on corrupt foundations that are too strongly engrained in our consciousness. The only solution is to remove all bets on the future generations “winning” + allow the world to become a pile of ashes + dust.
Passing on your genes is like leaving behind maggots to rest on a pile of dog shit + calling it “success”. #antinatalism
"By the day, inflation rises, quality of life for humans on a social, ecological, fiscal level declines. Tensions increase betwn rich + poor, sectarianism between various ethno-religious groups + political divides + culture wars... wht a time to bring more children into all of it."
"Very much real... many people argue getting a tattoo is almost like a way to mutilate your body when you are in deep emotional pain + you need the experience to feel as though you’re alive, even though you are dead inside. My tattoos represent evolution + deep emotional pain."
One day I was getting ready to go out + my friend noticed my tattoo on my back. I told him I will never get any tattoos ever again bc they aren’t classy. My friend told me a tattoo story + said removing this tattoo would be erasing part of me. I felt relieved. Tattoo regret is...
"I’m so thankful my parents want my brother to get a vasectomy if he ever gets married. 2-3 years ago, they wanted my disabled, autistic schizophrenic brother to have kids. I’m glad my AN preaching is getting some results here. I refuse to be a caretaker for my brothers kids."
I don’t understand women who baby trap men in relationships... I suppose many do not have a fear of abandonment like I do... or they aren’t as misanthropic as I am. No human on this earth can give you the psychological security that can guarantee your child a “good life”.
"Dating a single mother, divorcé or widow with children is a dealbreaker for many guys. Many men resent caring for a child that isn’t theirs. The risks + drawbacks of having children in this day + age far outweigh the benefits."
Procreation is what makes women “damaged goods”. Society commoditises fertility + fertility is the mother of all curses... esp if relationship fails + you split up.   Society needs to find other ways to measure value of women that are unrelated to their reproductive capabilities.
One of my favourite subjects in high school English was short stories. I love the dystopian stories the most.
My main internal conflicts that I am battling these days are my Asian/Arab hard work ethic + coming to realise my worthlessness + how disposable I am in a world I never asked to be part of. My middle ground is keep saving + aim to work only 3 days a week making good money.
"Unless you are in a dire situation or the cost of living is ridiculously expensive where you live, what’s the point of hard work, especially for something that isn’t your life or passion? What’s the point of sacrificing your health + happiness for those unworthy of it?"
"The world we live in is brutal. It’s interesting to read about Chinese people having to work 12 hour days, 6 days a week. With automation + technological advancement, don’t they deserve a break? If not a break or some slack, at least a way to walk away from it all..."
What’s the point of advancing civilisation + making jobs obsolete while still promoting the concept of a strong work ethic + culture? I don’t understand it at all...
I have a high risk of schizophrenia bc I have 2 first degree schizophrenic relatives + I have had psychotic experiences in my life. Schizophrenics were considered gifted by ancient Greeks. My brother + Mum are very intuitive... but the disorder compromises their quality of life.
"One day I need to write a post about the limitations of psychiatry in a spiritual, multidimensional world. There aren’t enough shamans + healers to help those spiritually gifted to cultivate their gifts. If we can’t figure it out, the only choice is to take meds + stay sane."
"I believe in synchronicities, I know I am being watched over + I have a mission in life... but I want nothing to do with the supernatural world or the paranormal. I do not know how to keep my sanity while enjoying these gifts. I’ll keep my mind open, but embrace another path."
Taking psychiatric medication is my conscious decision to value my sanity over my spiritual development. It’s hard to embrace a spiritual world in hard economic times when u still have to participate in society in some way. I’m not ready for my “spiritual gifts” bc they’d kill me
"If someone wrongs you, the only way to defeat them is to outclass them. Class always wins."
"Men by far outclass most women I know, even the classy ones. High quality classical/jazz music, well-read, great general knowledge, plain clothes that never go out of style, great etiquette, kindness + politeness. Passion + love for art films."
"#UnpopularOpinions In today’s day + age.. there r far more classier men who are refined, than women. The class + good taste of men rubs off on women they spend time w. Always take classy ppl as your companions. P.S. Money can’t buy class, poor ppl can b classier than the rich."
I have found it’s almost impossible to buy gifts for my family... but what I can never go wrong with is exotic Middle Eastern food or sweets. Never underestimate how much people appreciate simple food gifts. I think candles + essential oils are great gifts as well.
"My friends buy too much of them for me. One day a friend asked me for gift ideas for his friend + I suggested a sentimental gift, he told me that friends turn on their friends all the time + giving someone a sentimental gift is not always a good idea. I agree with that."
"Perfume smells differently on every person bc of ppls pheromones. Some people like their bold overpowering perfumes, others like a light fragrance that makes them feel fresh. Hand creams are another gift I get too much of. I never have to buy hand cream again for a few years bc"
"Gifts are supposed to be about making sure it’s “the thought that counts”. One of the worst gifts everybody gets is perfume. Unless somebody specifically uses or likes a perfume that is hard to get or has been discontinued, getting a perfume isn’t always the best gift. Every"
The best forms of revenge against society is reclaiming agency over yourself + becoming independently wealthy so they can’t use money as a means to control + enslave you.
The best way to get revenge on the govt + on society is by not procreating. You living life for yourself + deviating away from their conformity + norms infuriates them with envy bc they want you to be a good little slave. #antinatalism
Day two of taking 5mg aripiprazole... I actually got out of bed easily today + became a bit productive. It could be placebo. In the next fortnight I can restart antidepressants. I hope it improves my quality of life over time...
Signs AN was my destiny:  1.) No high IQ partner 2.) Mental health issues + bad genes 3.) Minored in environmental science 4.) Left religion + learnt abt Gnosticism + AN 5.) I felt morally obligated to fix world before having children 6.) I wanted my child to not be a tax slave
"I believe in fate/destiny. I feel I was always meant to b AN. I didn’t know it, but I stumbled across AN multiple times + 3rd time I finally understood it. I could never find a high IQ partner (w the exception of my ex), I still fight my mental health demons. I’m grateful for AN."
Feminism is probably the main reason many of my cousins are childfree. I also have a lot of narcissists in my family so dating/marrying them would be off-putting to potential mates. And decline in quality people who are adequate spouse material is another factor.
"Class, everyone is educated with some level of credentials + a well paying career. Intelligence is average with a few high IQ ppl, but a lot of mental issues too. My family is mostly asocial with very few extroverts. I’m hoping more of us remain childfree + we eventually die out."
My maternal grandmother had 7 kids + my paternal grandmother had 4. All boomers in my family have between 1-3 kids. I have a few Gen Xer cousins with 1-3 kids. My millennial cousins with the exception of 1 are either childfree or have about 1-2 kids. My family is mostly middle
"You gotta hate how evolution checkmates us all the time when it comes to the mating game. If IQ wasn’t hereditary, increasing the IQ of ppl would mean lower population rates. The next best thing to high IQ is making sure women are educated, bc educated women have less children."
"Apparently another study states maternal urges drop 25% for every 15 extra IQ points. There is a chapter in a same book by scholar titled:  ""Why Intelligent People Are the Ultimate Losers in Life"" bc of evolution + reproduction. IMHO, smart ppl r winners bc breeders r the losers."
"High IQ women are destined to end up being volcels who are forever alone. For every 16 point deviation higher than the average IQ, their marriage prospects drop by 40%. Toppled with that, many high IQ women have mental problems. They are disadvantaged almost as much as incels."
"#Antinatalism is blasphemous, bc every single truth begins as blasphemy before it is accepted + embraced as a universal fact that cannot be refuted."
"#Antinatalism is the ultimate form of truth blasphemy against parental units, the state + the very core essence of our existence."
"Aside from my dislike of organised religions, they do give me hope. The founders of organised religions started off as tiny cults that were persecuted by ppl who rejected their message. Part of me hopes that antinatalism as a message of universal truth will have the same fate."
The truth doesn’t always set people free... there are many reasons why people hate the truth:   1.) It shatters their egos by being confrontational.  2.) It takes away their coping mechanisms.  3.) It destroys their delusions.  That is why people hate #antinatalism
It is easier to appeal to people’s egos + profit from feeding them than it is to shatter their egos with the cold hard truth to which they will react to with hostility.
"By the time a child reaches the age of 18, their soul has been murdered. There is a concept in psychology called “soul murder”. This is y ppl r so depressed, impulsive + novelty seeking... they need intense hits of dopamine to feel alive when they are a soul dead walking corpse."
If there was such a thing as intelligent design... those who try to replicate will be swallowed + eaten alive by their genitalia + those who seek sex for pleasure would be able to climax without the risk of pregnancy... but nature has to lace every source of dopamine w/ venom.
A benevolent God would punish parents for their sins + bestow mercy upon the byproducts of the sin of the parental unit. Perhaps that is the metaphor of the Adam &amp; Eve story - we will always pay the price for the sins of our parents. Only a sadistic God would punish the innocent.
"We have had so many enlightened ancient historical figures... prophets, Gods, philosophers, soothsayers, sages... while I acknowledge some apostles of God were antinatalist, if they were true disciples of God, the first commandment they would preach is “thou shalt not procreate”."
Exploiting others to try + create a “good” life for yourself is futile.  Your existence is miserable + you thrive on the misery of others to satisfy your delusional sadism.
#Antinatalism has been around since the beginning of time. There are quotes from iconic figures who have contributed it.   Everyone knows life sucks + imposing life on others is wrong. This cannot be refuted.  Those who know either enlighten or exploit ppl. Most chose to exploit.
"With all that we have accomplished (as a species), you would have thought the next evolutionary stage in our consciousness is mass extinction of our own species."
"Aromas + flavours are healers of the body, mind + soul."
"9.) Women (or their partners) who are incarcerated + refuse to terminate their pregnancy. Children who grow up in fatherless homes are at higher risk of ending up being criminals, in foster care or in the military."
"8.) Women who are smokers, drinkers + drug users who have refuse to terminate their pregnancies + smoke, drink + do drugs while they are pregnant knowing the risk of their children being born with learning, intellectual + behavioural disabilities."
"7.) Geriatric women who freeze their eggs + have children between the age of 45 + above knowing they are incapable of caring for those children. For those who don’t freeze their eggs, their kids are at higher risk of autism + Down syndrome."
"5.) Breeders from war torn countries - their offspring end up having to suffer a lot of trauma + their experience in the world is quite degrading.  6.) Breeders who exploit children + use them as tools of control to trap their spouses in miserable, abusive relationships."
"3.) Breeders who are poor + have children - they continue the cycle of poverty bc of the lack of education.  4.) Breeders who r physically unattractive + hv children - the world judges ppl based on beauty + physical attractiveness, society treats less average looking ppl poorly."
"The worst criminals out of all breeders r the following:  1.) Breeders who hv IVF or surrogacy - they waste a lot of money + refuse to accept infertility, violating nature.  2.) Breeders w genetic diseases who have children - they know there’s a chance their children will suffer."
Breeders do not care about the quality of their offspring... bc even the ones with flaws everybody can see still think their offspring will slip through the cracks + win the genetic lottery jackpot. #antinatalism
"Every insecurity is always weaponised as a tool of control, extortion or exploitation."
Every child is conceived bc of (either or both) the sins of their parents...   1.) Lust  2.) Desire for immortality  The worst desires evolution imbedded deep into the psych of humankind.   #antinatalism
You can give your children everything... but bc you are flawed in so many ways there will always be forces outside of you + too many wildcards to predict the many misfortunes that await your children. That’s why not having them guarantees they are safe.
"Every person is running different programs. Often times we are incompatible or we clash with other people bc our programs conflict with each other. All you can do is cherish the good times, honour the best of the best + accept some things aren’t meant to be + that’s okay."
Most wealthy + famous ppl who engage in charity do it for an image or for tax exemptions... it’s usually a publicity stunt. Few people do it from their hearts with pure intention. And most people can tell the difference between what’s real + what’s fake.
"The best example I can give for y virtue + etiquette increase attractiveness is Princess Diana - she was humble, kind, simple, down to earth those qualities increased people’s love for her. No one else got as much media attention as her bc her qualities were genuine + heartfelt."
I am repulsed by my attractive relatives or those who have achieved success not bc of my envy of them... but it is their lack of virtue + etiquette. Kindness + humility cost absolutely nothing. When u lack basic human decency yr presence becomes nauseating to everyone around you.
"Virtues + good etiquettes improve attractiveness. Without those, a person is not worth even a glance in their direction. Intellectualism + common values also contribute to attractiveness. Virtues + good etiquette are the foundation of basic decency in any human being."
"Physical attraction is 1 of main determining factors of mate selection. Ppl try to deny it + claim personality comes first, bt I c it differently. Almost evry person in my fam who considers themselves physically attractive is narcissistic, entitled + an asshole w no personality."
The people blessed the most are those who spend a lifetime with a partner (or family member) they love + are fortunate enough to die side by side with the person whom they love.
"The ironic thing abt murder cases are the first suspects r always intimate partners + families of the victim. Love is a disease... it can bring out the greatest sides of humanity + also the darkest + ugliest sides. After procreation, relationships are the biggest gamble ppl take."
There are selfish demons in the closet of every breeder. #antinatalism
I saw this bumper sticker on a car on the way home. #childfree
"The main life hack + advice I have for everyone/anyone is... we live in a funny world where everything is the complete opposite of what it claims to be. To thrive, succeed or be able to navigate through life... always do the opposite + never get your hopes up."
"If that fails... after another few years of trying, I will end my life for good + put myself out of my misery. At least I can say I’ve tried everything or almost everything. I can say I’ve left something of value behind for people to help them if I’m long gone."
"I am going to try + get my life together, one step at a time. I will give these antipsychotics/antidepressants a try, after 10+ yrs. I want to function normally. I hv to publish my books + accomplish something... I don’t mind taking meds for life. I can’t go on like this forever."
GP says I need to take the antipsychotic for 2 weeks before I start antidepressants again. I like feeling a bit manic + enjoy the high + productivity that comes with it. What I hate is the psychosis + delusions. I hope this drug combo will work for me + I’ll be in a better place.
There is a fine line between phobias + safe spaces designed for self-preservation from those you consider to be degenerate. Sometimes what appears to be “intolerance” is the only way to safeguard your values. Trying to infiltrate + subvert those safe spaces is it’s own violation.
"Procreation is about quantity not quality. That’s why the govt doesn’t care if the poor procreate more. They’d like to have people in higher income tax brackets, but it’s much easier to exploit the crayons in the box that aren’t exactly the sharpest. #antinatalism"
Human civilisation is only sustained by mass consumption + mindlessness. That’s why... the more the merrier.
"I scare a lot of people bc I come off sounding as vengeful... But my testimony from experience is... the best forms of revenge are the following:  1.) Success (I know its cliche) 2.) Strict no-contact, refusal to engage with them, completely ignoring them.. (that infuriates them)"
"The main determining factor between whether I forgive someone or cut them off for life is intent. People will malicious intentions who gaslight you, do not deserve to be forgiven or taken back in your life. People who hv hurt you unintentionally, deserve the benefit of the doubt."
"Some bygones will be bygones, I feel nothing bt humility + gratitude for the privilege + opportunity to grow even with some interactions I hv had with some people. If you experienced good times u cherish + never forget, no matter how much you've been hurt, you're always grateful."
"Narcissism is about preserving an image. Images aren’t real. They are false selves constructed by the ego as a survival mechanism. Always remember that. The only way to destroy narcissism is by being authentic, true to yourself, fearless + comfortable in your own skin."
"The image of happy wholesome family is unrealistic - u dnt knw what is behind those smiles. Parents try to maintain this image of happiness when they have children. It’s like walking on eggshells. Never be fooled by an image. Always dig deeper, find truth + cut urself some slack."
"I’m allergic to society bc it’s all abt preserving images + images aren’t  real, you never know what is really behind them + nobody is perfect. People prefer to b miserable for the sake of an image that isn’t even real. A real person will always defeat a false narcissistic image."
"One of my reasons for why I dislike organised religion is bc it promotes self-destructive ideas that allow abusers to thrive. Ancestrally, my culture is an eye for an eye... having to love my enemy, forgive them or take them back into my life is the worst thing I can ever do."
"Organised religions that teach you to “love your enemy”, “turn the other cheek”, “forgive + forget”, “let bygones be bygones” are designed to sabotage you. Forgiveness should be done if + when you’re ready. You should never feel pressured to accept an abuser back into your life."
"My msg to anyone in life.. is never do any harm to anybody. Most people in the world are indifferent to you + it’s better to have millions of ppl who are indifferent to you, than one person who hates you bc you hurt them in some way. Your actions will bite you in the ass someday."
Ever since last year all my parents tell me about are the misfortunes of my cousins + aunt how they’re suffering when they were responsible for a lot of abuse in my family in the past. I have no pity or sympathy for them + they’re lucky I live on the other side of the world.
"I have anger + mental issues. If I was in a dissociated state where my darker alter ego takes over + I’m in a psychotic state, I would kill. If you have harmed me in some way, consider yourself lucky if I cut you off for life, never speak to you + (disown you) if you’re “family”."
Your actions have consequences. Some things you do to people are unforgivable. Just bc God says you should forgive or repent it doesn’t mean other people are obligated to forgive you + welcome you back into their lives with open arms.
I’m not an atheist... I’m a misanthrope actually... But somewhere in my dark heart I care about the innocent who suffer needlessly bc of those who are selfish + lack compassion.
"Ever since I started following the nature + birdwatching tags on Twitter... I realised India has the nicest birds + insects. Either that... or Indians love their nature photography more than other people. Either way, it’s a classy + refined hobby, I admire."
That moment was worth a 1000 therapy sessions I never had... it was so healing. I’ll never forget it.
The most powerful form of therapy that heals the deepest of wounds is when you are listened to by someone who understands your pain + validates that which scarred you ever so deeply. To weep... that marks the release + relief from the deepest wounds imaginable.
"One of the most healing moments in my life was when my friend asked me a question + I tried to give him a full back story to answer his question. The story was so emotional, I wept my eyes for hours like an infant. I feel so much relief + a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders"
One of my favourite songs that I can play 24/7 on repeat + never get sick of ❤️❤️❤️
"Pens + paper... I wish I could take more things though, like books, craft accessories + my laptop for word processing."
Society cannot survive without artificial constructs it indoctrinates people to spend their whole lives believing are real.
My #antinatalist version of “Hush Little Baby” (The Nursery Rhyme)
My plans going forward are:   - Finish my assignments - Review some work - Finish the 1st draft of my book - Contact illustrators - Do some reading - Go on a holiday to visit my friends - Start some other writing project - Prep for my new semester
"#Antinatalism guarantees only your death which is inevitable (either way). Procreation guarantees your death, the ongoing death of your offspring + their future generations."
#Antinatalism guarantees only your dead which is inevitable. Procreation guarantees the ongoing death of your offspring + their future generations.
#Antinatalism is like a battlefield where you withdraw your troops from the war gracefully instead of allowing them to die + suffering defeats long after you are dead.
"In the information age + age of social media it is hard to conceal lies. People can only come up with so many lies about existence, the ""need"" to procreate + pro-life propaganda before people catch on to the scam."
"Reasons to not procreate... it’s a multidimensional, multilevel issue. This needs to be articulated in a pyramid style model. I decided to go upside down bc ethics are both the foundation + higher moral ground of AN. #antinatalism"
The reasons to NOT procreate far outweigh the reasons TO procreate. #antinatalism
"I grew up with abt 4-5 of these ACEs... + I have a few of these health + behaviour problems associated with them. My parents tried their best... but didn’t know any better, even that did not prevent me from being traumatised someway/somehow. I know ppl who have had it worse tho."
"ACEs cause trauma that shapes children for life. Even parents w the best of intentions, can create the worst of monsters. We repeat trauma throughout our lives + healing from them is difficult. The only true way of preventing trauma is  by not having children in the first place."
Reasons to NOT procreate:   1.) Lack of Consent 2.) Uncertainty 3.) Risk 4.) Futility 5.) Enslavement 6.) Meaninglessness 7.) Empathy 8.) Suffering 9.) No free will 10.) No guarantees except death  #antinatalism
"I finished 1000 words on HVAC systems. Now I need to rest a bit + do next 1000 words with the introduction, summary, recommendations + conclusions... I think I'll be able to submit tonight... I will need an extension for my other assignment tho + then I'll be done til next month."
"If I wanted a mini-me version of myself, I'd take an old picture of myself as a child to China + ask them to manufacture a custom made doll that resembles me. If I wanted to take it a step further, I'd go to Japan + have an AI version made. Having a child is stupid + pointless."
Society promotes procreation on one hand + then is quick to complain about more people being an economic burden on the other hand. #antinatalism
"If humans become an economic burden on their parents + society... then the only solutions are... do not force more people into existence, or offer euthanasia as an exit for people who don't consent to this shitty existence."
"Society + parents are quick to mislabel their children as ""entitled""... since society feels its their right to impose life on people + disturb the peace of the unborn... its only fair parents + society provide a relatively comfortable life for their children until they die."
Every child is an idealist + a dreamer until reality shatters their hopes.
I have always had problems with hierarchy + authority in general. I don't have problems with the law... I've only ever had one speeding ticket + a few parking fines... But I don't like being dominated by anyone or answerable to some authoritative figure above me.
"I have always been a rebel... I get into trouble at school + work, even tho I perform quite well... I don't like submissiveness to authority, if I think rules r stupid I will break them + I refuse to kiss ass or be a ""yes woman""."
"I got in trouble at school 1 day + had to go to the deputy principal's office + I will never forget his words:  ""What kind of children will you bring into this world?""  Years later, I'm childfree + my children never asked to be born + they aren't a burden on anyone in this world."
"The chances of escaping poverty, hardship, bad genetics + misfortune r v slim. Few ppl slip through those cracks + make it to where they want to be in life. Your offspring will always be worse off than you, unless you make they conscious decision to not bring em into this world."
The best years ahead of your life are when you no longer exist. #antinatalism
The main choices one is faced w when it comes survival is...   1.) Get a vanilla 9-5 job you hate to pay your bills + survive.   2.) Do sex work or find some illegal activity to make money.  3.) Or be a burden on the system.  4.) Go completely off grid.  Either way they all suck.
We have found solutions to many problems in life. Despite everything we have achieved in life as a species we still have not found a solution to the burden of existence outside of suicide or antinatalism. All we have are bandaids like addictions + delusions.
Behind the root of every social ill is the burden of existence. #antinatalism
My loss of faith + interest in conspiracies is partly bc there has been no economic collapse or zombie apocalypse. I hate this system so much that I want to see it burnt to the ground + destroyed. Enough is enough.
I have been waiting for years for a financial collapse + reset. This planet needs to purged of every deplorable  1%er who contributes to human suffering + misery. I despise people who maintain the status quo bc they never want to rock the boat. We suffer collectively bc of them.
"I rung my doctor's this morning to set up an emergency appointment with my GP + I couldn't get one bc he's sick. This is so frustrating, I need to see him ASAP to get on antidepressants. I can barely function + I hate what I've become."
"Lifecycle for average human:  1.) Cutesy mini me being whored around for attention by ppl.  2.) Years of indoctrination + brainwashing by society.  3.) Completely burnt out from existence after a few yrs in the workforce.  4.) Broken coping mechanisms for an eternity, then death."
Education is about selling your labour + priming yourself for a lifetime of work in a concentration camp.
#Antinatalism in 2 simple steps:   1.) Realise life sucks + your parents fucked you over without your consent.  2.) Make a conscious decision not to do it to somebody else.
"""Daggers, knives + swords hang over the destiny of every child."" - Inmendham #Quote"
"People like me are supposed to be killed + put out of their misery... but instead, the world keeps us alive even when it is at the expense of our happiness + a good quality life."
- I have thrown myself at people when I was younger + I wasn’t a 100% conscious of it.  - I go on trips out of town or I splurge on things not thinking about their consequences (I’m debt free with savings tho).  - I throw away valuable items not being conscious of it.
When I’m experiencing mania or psychosis... I’m not conscious of who or what I am... I have done some v crazy things in those mental states.   - I smashed a watermelon + items in a car park running almost naked.  - I withdrew money from the ATM + threw it in the streets
"Also since being off meds, I’m passively suicidal, I haven’t attempted to take my life like I used to constantly every couple of months when I was younger. I don’t know if that was related to my BPD + I’ve mellowed out since “getting older” or it’s bc I’m not on the meds anymore."
"The problems I had with citalopram was I was on a high dose which doctors think triggered severe mania + psychosis which led to me being locked up for almost 2 weeks in a psych ward. Other than that, it worked okay for me. Other ones didn’t seem to work as well for me."
"I am of no use to the govt, my family or anyone else in this life.. economically speaking there is nothing to gain frm me, I am a burden in many ways + I hv nothing to offer this world of substance. So I wish somebody would come + put me out of my misery so I can finally hv peace"
"I’m thinking of going to my doctor tomorrow + getting a script to restart citalopram. I want to be able to be productive, to function well, to hv some ambition + not b wht I am now. But it’s hard. I feel lyk a disgrace. This is y I am always ready for death bc I’ve failed at life"
"I managed to hold down steady jobs for a few years, my problems at work were more from other people bc of my hardworking, perfectionist, competitive nature. I hate what I have become, and I hold myself with more contempt bc I simply cannot go back + do something with my life."
I tried about 8-9 different antidepressants + citalopram seemed to work wonders for me one year. The downside of being on too many antidepressants was the fact I was attempting suicide every couple of months + failing. I have been off medications for almost a decade + I did okay.
"I hate myself bc I am lazy, unproductive, a procrastinator, completely useless + much better off dead. In my late teens to early 20s, I was in + out of the psych ward on meds + I still managed to complete a bachelor degree from home. I used to have drive, motivation + hope."
“The world is a mess bc smart people are busy exploiting the poor instead of educating them.” - Inmendham #Quote
Our existence is the ultimate dystopian nightmare. #antinatalism
"I hope I don’t come back to this world, but if reincarnation is real + I do come back, I wanna be a cat. Cats sleep 16 hrs a day + their lives r pretty chill. I don’t like the carnivorous part or having to hunt, but sleeping 16 hours a day is the next best thing to non-existence."
I hv hardly accomplished as much as people I know. I feel under accomplished if anything. The biggest factor in my demotivation is the fact I never wanted this existence in the first place + nothing in this world has ever made me really like anything about life or what it offers.
What finding yourself really means...
"Congratulations, you are an heir to the throne enslavement + a lifetime of needless suffering. Oh, and 4 generations later, your name will be forgotten + your legacy will be forgotten. #antinatalism"
"Everyone (to some extent) is aware life is scam. But continuing the scam against someone else makes you a mindless, lowlife scum. #antinatalism"
You are nothing but an incubator for creating livestock for the state. #antinatalism
"It’s hard for me to imagine breeders breeding human livestock for the state... that’s why they have to use words like “romance”, “love making”, “gift of life”, “miracle”... bc all procreation really is, is gambling with someone else’s life to create livestock for the state."
"Procreation is consent, compliance + approval of the status quo. #antinatalism"
"They say depression is inverted anger... after everything that’s happened to me in my life, I just want to rip + destroy what’s left of the world, not literally, but in a way in which I deconstruct life to better try to understand it."
"Although the truth is unpleasant... I still desire it, even at the cost of my sanity. Why? Bc I am sick + tired of being infantilised by the system. I’m old + mature enough to handle harsh realities.. I’ve also been hurt so much in my life I’m desensitised + numb to all the pain."
Curiosity is what creates truth seekers. A thirst for knowledge + desire for depth + meaning. Finding the truth is like shattering windows + trying to walk barefoot on a floor covered in shards of broken glass. After a while you become numb but your desire pushes you to carry on.
"We are lied to everyday about something whether it’s pandemics, war crimes, religious conflicts, history, politics etc... to some extent people can accept being lied to, but when it comes to the reality of their existence, that’s one lie most people refuse to deeply contemplate."
The only way to starve the beast is by refusing to feed it. #antinatalism
"Procreation is the only reason why oppression survives, thrives + continues. #antinatalism"
Spare a child the burden of existence + that’s one extra lifetime of unnecessary suffering you have effortlessly ended (or prevented). #antinatalism
Breeders are indoctrinated to gamble with the lives of others + spread the burden of misfortune to those who aren’t even part of the game.
"Your parents are the original sinners, let your conscience forever Rest In Peace with your unborn children. #antinatalism"
"Roses r red, Life has no winners, Those who breed r the ultimate sinners, Robbing cradles from nothingness + peace, To suffer, bleed + die until they cease, Spare the unborn the burden, Cut them some slack + show them some mercy, For all riches in this world belong only to fools."
"Roses are red, Violets are blue, Make sure you question everything they tell you, The world is upside down + those who see it are few, The system survives on using + disposing you, So guard your seeds + burn your dreams, Make the most of your freedom bc all is not what it seems."
"Yr living corpse is decaying, Never listen to what society is saying, Suffering is breeding babies, Indoctrinated to believe u had rabies, Ignoring the struggles + many cries are millennia of lies, Designed to enslave into the meat grinder + destroy,  A baby is anything but a toy"
"Roses are red, Violets are blue, Your parents screwed u, With a lustful fuck, An eternity of enslavement, With absolutely no luck. Destined to slave away from 9-5, They say b grateful for yr wonderful life, The end is miles away but still near, Lies til death you’ll forever hear."
Birthdays are a sadistic conspiracy to celebrate your enslavement + the beginning of your decay into nothingness + slow demise. #antinatalism
Your genitals (sexual desire + desire to procreate) are the masters of your own enslavement. #antinatalism
Definitely... all they do is protect the ruling class + the status quo. The only way to free the next (unborn) generation is by breaking them.
"We have nothing redeemable or worth salvaging in our race... we are greedy, cruel, sadistic, psychopathic, social climbers, asskissers, traitors, sell-outs + idiots. Even if existence wasn't hell or burdensome, the dark + negative side of humanity outweighs its virtue + goodness."
Imagine your children are royalty. This planet is a prison + slave planet. The only way for royalty to remain in the peaceful heavens of nothingness is to be unborn. Parents who pop out a cute mini me + or someone to carry their name are only creating another prisoner + slave.
"Humans are inefficient to run + manage the society we have built. Our existence has always been purposeless, meaningless + pointless. AI, automation + robotics exposes this harsh reality to us... that is why we fear those things so much."
"If the govt is gonna lecture us about ethics + morality, then I advocate investing mass resources in automation, AI + robotic technologies... + at least giving us more agency over our lives."
"Society + parents act like meeting children's basic needs is compensating them for their rape, exploitation + coercion. But its far from that... children are expected to nod their head in submission, smile + not complain when society or parents wrong them. #antinatalism"
"Child labour is free. All you have to do is have a child + if you brainwash them enough you can exploit them until they are old enough to find out they have been scammed. Child exploitation is weak, bc its an unfair game + uneven playing field. #antinatalism"
"You pay a tradie to fix your broken plumbing, u pay a dentist to fix yr teeth, you pay govt taxes to manage your infrastructure... bt what do u pay children in for forcing them into a world they don't consent to be part of + hate? Nothing but abuse, blackmail + manipulation."
"No one is obligated to serve (or service) your needs. Most relationships are transactional, but bc children are weak + dependent on us, they don't even receive any compensation for being exploited to fulfil selfish, cruel + superficial needs. #antinatalism"
"""Gold is the money of kings, silver is the money of gentlemen, barter is the money of peasants – but debt is the money of slaves.” -- Norm Franz"
"For the last couple of years... I have lost interest in a career, my health/wellbeing, most of my hobbies, romantic relationships, homeownership, travelling + life in general. I have a few things I want to get done + I hope to kick the bucket + be put out of my misery."
I have not had any suicidal thoughts for a while. I still feel depressed + anxious though. I think I have reached a point in my life where life is nauseating to me. There is absolutely nothing appealing to me about existence + I feel like a rotting corpse roaming the earth.
"Procreation + mate selection is the main reason y women can never truly b friends w other women. There is hardly any comradery + the ""female sisterhood"" are myths. Women are far more vicious than men are. It's a shame bc its over something that isn't even worth having WWIII over."
Procreation is a scheme where prosperity + (lack thereof) are both inherited by maintaining the status quo. Very few people move up socially or economically. It's all about the status quo...
Every fairytale has dark origins + has a serious moral or political message to it. Disney sensationalised fairytales + whitewashed them which is y we hv a romanticised view of them. Little red riding hood is about young girls not trusting boys + keeping their virginity.
I want to children to not procreate... but I don’t want to traumatise them or scar them for life...
I’m thinking through my head... how to make an antinatalist book for children not too mature themed...? I’ll figure it out somehow.
I stripped my expensive quilt off of my bed so my cat can come + chill with me on my bed when I try to do my assignments. I hope I get everything over + done with soon. My baby has been mad at me for a while bc I don’t play with him much.
"I see myself as inferior in many ways + a failed “experiment”... Perhaps my expectations are too high, but this is partially why I hate myself + want to die... bc I am everything I wish I wasn’t... I’ve tried to change but my flaws are so engrained in me, it’s hard to break free."
"My life has bn a struggle.. I grew up with multiple cultures many of which clash, I lived in 3 continents + even tho my parents had financial resources to do their best for me + they tried to give me a good childhood to some extent - I still ended up traumatised + forever scarred"
I am eternally grateful to feminism for liberating women from the burden of pregnancy + pressure of motherhood. Breaking free after millennia of this suffering... the next step forward is antinatalism... free women from their biological burdens + you’ll free the rest of humanity.
I feel the same way about procreation. If procreation was natural for everybody why is infertility an issue? We have been inundated with propaganda to promote procreation + parenthood since we are kindergarten aged. They depend on indoctrination + constant reinforcement.
😍😍😍
This is one reason why existence sucks so much...
How I Self-Medicate
"They say consciousness on earth is evolving + many of us incarnated on this earth to help with that process... I did my best to help educate people on many problems in the world, did some charity + tried to make a positive impact. All it turned me was avoidant + a misanthrope."
"Ever since I started following the birdwatching tag on Twitter, I keep thinking of my best friend who does wildlife action photography. I send him some pictures from time to time... going on photography adventures + road trips was so memorable for me."
Being born is a death sentence for all life. #antinatalism
"Judging by these statistics, so many parents are negligent. Children seem to be stuck between parents who are neglectful + helicopter parents. Both types of parents are detrimental to a child’s well-being."
"People act like child deaths are a tragedy... they are to some extent, but they are also a blessing in disguise bc there’s worse yet to come. Suicide is one of highest causes of death in children between 5-14. Kids to some extent know life sucks. Actions speak louder than words."
"Most ppl these days do not bring anything of substance or value into relationships. The relationship is a headache that isn’t worth all the trouble. The fact most relationships don’t actually last for what feels like an eternity like society promises us, is a buzzkill."
People like to look at those in their 20s + 30s or even older as abnormal bc they choose voluntary celibacy or decide not to enter any romantic relationships. When you find comfort in being alone with yourself it is very hard to break free + suddenly become involved with people.
I don’t get jealous of people... all I see is an opportunity for my own self-improvement or motivation to change. I am indifferent to almost everybody + I don’t have any enemies except people who have harmed me or trigger me or are triggered by me.
"but I don’t go out of my way to harm anyone. My brother spends his time stalking ppl... nearly all other autistic ppl I know hv hobbies or prefer to be alone, but he’s pathologically obsessed w ppl. He gets jealous of people + doesn’t hv any friends yet he likes to shame me."
My brother called me a sociopath with a personality disorder... it’s funny... personality disorders run in my family. I self-isolate + engage as little as possible w the outside world. I have decade long friendships that have lasted long w ppl. I’m not denying my disorders...
Everybody needs a space where they can be among their own kind...  You naturally separate + drift apart from people you no longer share anything in common with...   Part of your evolution is learning to let go of your peer group + find new foundations for your other relationships
I don’t understand people who tweet porn... porn has its place (where people can find it if they need to)... I think most mainstream social media platforms need to filter adult content or have separate platforms just for that specific content.
Both... but I guess you could say the the rich too since they use their wealth to influence the state + they end up pursuing political careers after they have made their fortunes.
"Society has to lie to everybody, from the most vulnerable to those much older bc it is the only way for society to preserve itself..."
"I’m starting to question how much of a misanthrope I really am. Part of the reason I’m an antinatalist is to free human kind from suffering, prison + help them regain their own sovereignty (at least in nothingness). Perhaps I’m not as dark as I like to think I am."
"The entire foundation of human existence is built upon selfishness, exploitation, a love of death (or prolonging life under the guise of being pro life) + a never ending list of lies so big + so deep that most adults have never ever questioned."
We exploit children’s dependency on us for survival. We exploit their naivety + silence them when they question our wrongdoings. We fill their heads with lies the minute they are old enough to think... and we have no remorse about it... bc it’s “okay to lie to children”.
"You are never born free. You are property of the state... if you’re born into a prison, what makes you think procreating in prison is a good thing? Your offsprings destiny is to be lifelong jail birds..."
"You spill your seeds to grow in a world of suffering, hardship + pain... and the sole beneficiary is the state."
"Society is like a cult standing in a circle in front of a bonfire, each person one by one throws their offspring to burn into the pits of hell."
"I’m starting to appreciate ageing gracefully... the forehead wrinkles and grey hair... I guess I’m so repulsed by looking at people on social media with filters, fillers + heavy makeup... I’m appreciating the process of naturally ageing more, at least aesthetically speaking."
True... that’s society gaslighting children.
"The only Instagram tags I’m interested in are things related to cats, other cute fluffy animals, health related facts, ChildFree, Antinatalism, natural landscapes, ancient architecture, cooking/recipes. Nothing else seems to catch my interest."
Why is my Instagram full of wedding tags? Last week I blocked + got rid of my baby + pregnancy tags. I’m a pessimist... I am not happy w myself + I’m not the person who I think would be the best partner for anyone... I don’t want to share my pain with anyone. I’d rather b alone.
Nope everything in life is futile. That’s why nothing is permanent. Nothing gold can stay - to quote Robert Frost.
This is so true...
"The system has made humans almost obsolete. It has the power to destroy us... but instead, they want us to keep pumping out more mindless carbon copies."
I think it’s true to some degree. I have female friends... I don’t see our friendships as superficial though. I have male friends but they are off bounds + untouchable to me. So Idk... I think I’m just very naive.
"“Women can’t be friends w other women, they r superficially friendly. Men + women cannot be friends bc of sexual tension. The only true friendship is btwn 2 men who hv the same goals + support e/o.” Hmm.. I feel like I’m so deluded in my idealism, I still believe in friendship 🤦‍♀️"
I found group therapy to be among the best. CBT is pretty good as well. I prefer to use a workbook + check in with one person from time to time to give me a sense of accountability.
Childhood trauma is the equivalent to acid scars on your skin. It permanent + let’s be real here most therapists are useless. Therapy is a big money making scheme + healing takes a lot of work. Most ppl go to therapy to hear positive feedback + feel false sense of accomplishment.
"My parents taught me to always blow dry my hair + cover it after I’ve showered. People here go out with wet hair + I did that for most of my life, until last year when my friend told me wet hair effects your sinuses. Now I blow dry my hair always + can’t imagine not doing it."
"I find pop culture + globalisation universally nauseating. It makes me feel sick when I come across Arabic versions of what I already find nauseating in Western culture... whether it’s pop music, film/TV. I appreciate anything older or classic."
The internet is the one place where people are free to be themselves. Being allowed to be who you are is a luxury in this world. It’s the ultimate form of liberty... but to be who you are comes with many price tags + extra strings attached bc this world is about uniformity.
Unless people discriminate against a particular group collectively - it’s most likely prejudice or tribalism. The concept of skin colour + less melanin is a status symbol - but it doesn’t excuse fetishisation. To be treated differently based on skin pigmentation is pure ignorance
"Racism + colourism are stupid. I would argue that humans are wired by evolution to be tribal + tribalism is often mistaken for racism but most humans are indifferent to each other. We are naturally attracted to familiarity, people we share similar genes with + that’s natural."
"Misanthropy will teach you human nature is universally ugly. It is the only antidote to truly liberate you from racism bc it doesn’t discriminate against anybody. Misanthropy destroys disillusion, it’s perfectly reasonable in this day + age... it’s a cautious way to examine life."
I used to think my own race was bad... then I had bad experiences w ppl of all races + it then occurred to me human nature is universally ugly. There are always exceptions. The only way to eliminate racism is to adopt misanthropy. Misanthropy doesn’t discriminate against anyone.
"I don’t understand racial fetishisation. Human nature is universally the same amongst all cultures. Some positive + negative stereotypes are more prominent among some people than others. Ultimately, you have to judge people based on their actions + your experience with them."
"Vampires are the humanoid incarnation of parasites. Most people are energy vampires especially toxic, overly extroverted sick fucks."
People are addicted to abusing others to feel alive in someway.
Last night I somehow ended up on the phone with my aunt for a few hours. She’s the ultimate truth telling pessimist. She reminded me that this world fucks most people hard in the head + everybody is psychologically messed up somehow + love sabotaging everyone around them.
The people who pretend to be the happiest are actually the most miserable people.
I feel a sense of normalcy when others describe feeling blue in the way I’ve been feeling my whole life. I like to see people I love happy. Pure happiness is so rare nowadays anyone who has it is blessed to some degree.
"A genome of destruction, Manufactured deep within the womb, Parasitic mass consumers, Forever distressed by eternal desires, Enslaved by their impulses, Chasing roads that all lead to futility, The real winners are those who don’t play the game.   #antinatalism"
"A factory of danger, A universe of uncertainty, That only guarantees death, Ruled by genetic determinism, Mass Economic tyranny, Nothingness and fruitless wombs... Are the last hopes for salvation.   #Antinatalism"
"“Antinatalism is the essence of the golden rule” - @joedan346 #Quote   Don’t force people into the world + violate their consent, if you yourself wish nobody forced you into this world."
When you understand reality from a deterministic perspective + you learn about futility + how there are no real winners in life... you learn...   1. There are some games you’d have to play.  2. There are no real prizes in the grand. 3. No stress + contentment r the real prizes.
Futility (as an inevitable reality) is an antidote to many problems we face in life. If we examine everything from a standpoint of futility we reach a state of eternal peace + acceptance so many things in life are delusions + based on false ideas we have been indoctrinated with.
"Contentment is a mental state of acceptance that all in life is futile, many things are predetermined + there’s no point in fighting to change them."
The way to defeat the state is two ways:   Mass non-compliance (refusal to go to school or work + no spending money)  Birth strike (no more giving birth)   Watch the state crumble + laugh... the problem is people are too stupid + scared to reclaim what’s rightfully theirs.
This world is one big mafia.. you develop a Stockholm Syndrome + deep trauma bonds with your parents. Your parents whore you to society then sell you to the state - like it’s nothing.
"You are born into this world wearing invisible handcuffs + shackles. The more you fight to resist them, the deeper the scars you leave behind on your skin. #antinatalism"
My enemies:   1.) Those who have betrayed me. 2.) People who misunderstand + misinterpret my actions. 3.) People who trigger me or r triggered by me.  4.) Zionists + ruling elite. 5.) Imperialists + warmongers. 6.) People who try to change me.   Everyone else I’m indifferent to.
"A woman who gets pregnant to baby trap a man in a relationship betrays her child for a man she will eventually fall out of love with, end up miserable with or broken up with."
"Every woman on earth’s mission in life should not be to become pregnant in order to be a mother... but to prevent every man from ever infesting her womb with a child. For if her womb bears a child, then the curse of suffering + death continues."
"Your womb is the incubator of destruction, suffering + cruelty. #antinatalism"
"Every child bought into this world is sacrificed to the (demonic) gods called money, capitalism, govt + lifelong enslavement. #antinatalism"
You sacrifice your child’s future by bringing them into this world to satisfy your temporary pleasures. #antinatalism
Every child you birth is a soldier for the state + a mass corporate consumer. #antinatalism
The journey to child sacrifice begins with procreation. #antinatalism
Spare your unborn child the burden of existence + you can guarantee them the gift of eternal peace. #antinatalism
The light at the end of the tunnel is the entry into hell from outside of your mother’s womb. #antinatalism
"Procreation begins with children screaming as soon as they leave the womb, bc coming into existence is everyone’s worst nightmare. #antinatalism"
Spreading your genes is like taking a piss to mark (what you perceive to be) your territory. #antinatalism
#Antinatalism is the answer to world peace bc you realise...   1.) War is futile 2.) The “winners” of war are losers 3.) The only prizes up for grabs are strokes to your ego 4.) Nobody has a future when everybody’s destiny in life is death.
One of my best friends taught me to always be considerate when I park my car. She told me that people will key my car if I am inconsiderate with my parking. So I have a habit of straightening + trying to align my car perfectly... some ppl don’t so I laughed when I saw this
"I don't trust anyone, I'm irreligious, apolitical, a lone wolf, v picky when it comes to choosing friends, not interested in relationships + a hardcore AN who consumes mostly alternative media + takes everything with a big grain of salt + doesn't care much about success anymore."
"9.) The truth about working life/meritocracy.  I'm cynical bc I'm a byproduct of many unpleasant experiences quite early on in my life... After all these experiences...   I see my parents as flawed humans. I have no contact with relatives except one cousin + immediate family,"
"5.) Finding out my religion was a lie + having to leave. 6.) Finding out the truth about news, politics + losing respect for professions, institutions + people I once respected. 7.) Finding out about the reality of my existence. 8.) Being backstabbed by friends + family."
My List of Shattered Delusions:  1.) Discovering my parents inner demons. 2.) Finding out my paternal side of the family hate me + learning about their abuse. 3.) Finding out my father has been to jail + was married before my mother. 4.) Finding out trusted adults lied to me.
"Growing up is not the most pleasant experience in life bc your entire delusions, naivety + misconceptions are all shattered one after the other, until you reach a state of nihilism, indifference + acceptance."
When you're raised in a patriarchal culture with a paleo-conservative father... you embrace feminism as a weapon to protect yourself from potential abusive relationships + financial abuse... + you find yourself naturally repulsed by the social conditioning forced onto men.
"If human sexuality is fluid, then it's possible to be straight + become so repulsed by other people that asexuality becomes your sexual orientation."
"Poverty + wealth both expose people's true nature... with poverty, the poor (and those physically unattractive) see how people really treat them. With wealth, you compare how ppl once treated you + how they treat you now. In both situations you realise who your real friends are."
"Success is futile too... It never ceases to amaze me how many people blessed with fame, fortune + a loyal fan-base end up committing suicide. The path to success is always a lonely one... once you reach the mountain top... its ""now what?"" it also shows you people's true colours."
"When the very essence + key foundation of your life is based on a lie, you will always be faced with the dilemma of confronting that lie in search of the truth, or turning a blind eye to salvage what is left of your status quo."
"Wars are an unnecessary evil in life. There is no real victory in warfare. If you lose, the spoils of war taint you with shame, cuckoldry + a loss of strength + dignity. If you win, you get to breed more suffering + you're burdened with your new found ""riches"". It's all futile."
Being alive is like being stuck in purgatory for an eternity constantly awaiting your expiration date.
"I’m always open to be wrong, happy to be corrected + happy to learn something new. It’s the only way to grow."
"Birdwatching is like a type of meditation, careful observation of creatures in the skies."
To survive in a world full of mindless drones I’m forced to engage with... I have to dissociate + enter into autopilot mode + allow my alter egos to take over my main persona to fight my battles to endure another day of life in this hell.
"The government are supposed to be our slaves... they are entrusted with the duty to serve us + manage our infrastructure, but they are puppets controlled by billionaires + corporations who have a vested interest in creating more consumers to line their pockets."
The sanctity of human life is a myth (of magical thinking + disillusion) in a world where the lives of so many people are devalued on a day-to-day basis.
The pro-life movement is an advocacy movement for the creation of more slaves (or meat) for the meat grinder.
"People who are against big govt, pro-civil liberties + sovereignty should be antinatalists... your womb + your scrotum filled with seeds of destruction are property of the govt + your offspring are subject to their tyranny. Reclaiming control is saying no to procreation!"
I experience a lot of backlash from people for being a “grudge holder”... I’m v stubborn + “letting go” isn’t easy for me. I find I tend to “forgive” people automatically when the harm they’ve caused me is a distant memory I can almost no longer recall. That’s the natural way...
"If you’re depressed + need a boost in your serotonin levels... especially if you’re a woman... there’s no harm in turning your bathroom into a spa... enjoy your face mask, pedicure + spend an hour meditating in your bath with magnesium salts, bath bombs + a dash of cologne 🥰."
The gods gifted the “gift” of fertility to the ones with more stupidity.
"If you’re famous and you’ve died young.. congratulations, you’ve found the fountain of eternal youth."
"Humans are inefficient + very deficient... the input is much more than the output + our existence has so many limitations. I wish the state would replace us with robots, but they only ever will for the duties we are inefficient to ever undertake."
Coming into existence leaves one in a permanent state of confusion that is very hard to overcome.
Mental illness (discovering the truth about reality + your existence) is considered a psychological malfunction in state owned property. They need to brainwash you back into your delusional state to regain control over your life.
Society + your parents have to feed you propaganda about the scam of your existence. Once you find out you’ve been scammed you either have to be silenced or gaslit constantly about it.
Want a solution to ageing populations? Three words: Automation + Euthanasia.
"Just what we need, more children to be born into the world to be exploited + needlessly suffer..."
"Sex is the vehicle, but procreation is the real sin... but they don’t tell you that. Instead, they paint most acts of recreational sex as hedonistic + procreation as purposeful."
"About one million people a year commit suicide... many of them are breeders still with dependent children... if that isn’t the ultimate message for rejecting life, I don’t know what is. Yet the propaganda machine continues to pump out “life is good” bs..."
The death of the soul precedes the death of the body... a dead soul only feels alive once the host is dead.
Society rejects suicide bc suicide is the ultimate statement of finite existence.
Every future leads to the return to nothingness.
"My thoughts on children...   Cute... lovely if they have manners, are well behaved + quiet..   I can handle them in occasional small doses... I hope they are protected from harm...  I feel nothing but sadness for them, bc all I see is a future of pain + struggles ahead for them."
"I’ll never understand sexual attraction to children. Even if when you’re hot + horny... the natural instinct you should have as soon as you see a child is to lose arousal, be instantly turned off + lose all desire.   When I see a child, I just wanna run 5 miles away to the hills."
"Repeat after me:  - “Life is good” - “Life is a gift” - “Parents have your best interests” - “Live the dream: 2.5 kids, big house w white picket fence” - “Everything’s gonna b alright” - “Can’t get any worse, it will get better”   Repeat enough times until u actually believe it."
I find people who chant “life is good” mantras more depressing than those under the pessimistic philosophy umbrella.
"Society has taught me my whole life that I am depressed, something is wrong with me, I’m crazy, insane + abnormal... yes, I have autism, I’m cursed with a high IQ + I have mental/mood disorders... but I’m not insane. I speak the truth + ppl can’t handle that."
"AN isn’t depressing to me. It doesn’t affect my mental state bc as a child, I mentally processed life wasn’t good... I’m not over my existential crisis or working 9-5 for the next 30+ yrs but AN is refreshing to my mental state bc it validates me, while society gaslights me."
After purchasing the AN colouring book... I splurged on some new colouring accessories since my colouring pencils aren’t that good. I can’t wait to receive it in the mail.
"I am going to write a post on my blog about ""The Dystopian Future For Your Children""... my tweets from last night seem to have triggered it. I hv some ideas. I will need to do more research + add supporting statistics. It's basic common sense, but people just don't want to c it."
"As the world seems to deteriorate for the worst, being an antinatalist becomes more of an ethical duty + basic obligation. The very basic first step to clean up the big mess we have in the world. #antinatalism"
"Part of your job description as a friend is to sometimes be people's unpaid therapist. It works both ways, its reciprocal + its worth it if your friend is a high quality person. High quality people are rare + hard to find in this world."
Every journey leads you to #antinatalism... lets look at a few examples...  - Child abuse/pedophilia solution = AN. - Politics + austerity solution = AN. - Religious salvation = AN. - Environmental problems = AN. - Statism = AN.   All rabbit holes lead to AN.
Countries that have mandatory national military service are honest. You know you are property of the state in those countries. Govts exploit your parents to create more property for the state. The govt has never had anyone's best interests but what is part of its own agenda.
I just went to a burger joint where orders are made by iPad + you just pay by card + don’t have to talk to anyone... is that just me or every introvert with social anxiety’s dream?
"I hope my next keyworker will be a male nurse from Kerala. They are among the most helpful, professional + the very best."
"I hate the mental health system so much. I’ve lost my psychiatrist who was on a temporary contract from America + now my keyworker who is moving to the psychiatric ward. I tend to get attached to people, I always stick with the same ppl I’m loyal to + I hate change/turbulence."
"I could hardly sleep last night... I’m probably gonna run on 3 hours of sleep... my mind feels exhausted + I really needed a good night sleep so I could get through my assignment. I might have to try caffeine, eye drops + just doing the damn thing."
"Rationality, common sense + realism, lol."
What’s your story?
R among their tools. Gnosticism also believes that humanity is a social experiment to c how consciousness evolves + we incarnate onto earth to grow + evolve. I’m spiritual/irreligious by not an atheist. I believe in a God + many kinds of entities (due to my cultural upbringing.)
"But overall, I believe they are closer to the truth than Abrahamic religions. At least they promote spiritual development + not conquest of others. I think Gnosticism is the closest to the truth - I believe demiurge dark forces control our planet + religion + the monetary system"
"I was born/raised a Muslim. Left when I was 21. I dislike Abrahamic religions bc they r imperialistic, have nothing to do w spiritual development + r responsible for a lot of wars/bloodshed. I am more accepting of Eastern religions (Buddhism/Hinduism), I dislike the caste system"
"The world is burning right in front of our very eyes... look at house prices, petrol prices, most jobs are low wage or temp jobs, it’s a gigging economy, most service sector jobs are being outsourced to the third world, automation is coming in... and people still have kids."
"I hate to be as pessimistic as I am now.. but the only future I see for children being born now is eating junk food bc produce is expensive, selling their bodies on OnlyFans to survive or maybe even selling their organs to pay the bills. I hate to say it, but that’s how I see it."
#Childfree + #Antinatalism are gateways towards freedom from the mass social indoctrination + pressure to procreate.
"I always feared relationships bc of my anxious attachment style + fear of abandonment, also high divorce rates + degeneracy in general... I’d want to parent correctly... so much uncertainty + having no control scares me. Realising procreation is unethical was liberating for me."
"A lot of things in this world give me anxiety... Long before I became an AN, I always believed parents had to make the world a better place before they bring children... I’m anxious about hardships, wars, famines, natural disasters, govt corruption + other social issues..."
"Maybe I’m just very old school... I don’t believe in nannies, daycare or babysitters... So many incidents in my childhood trigger my abandonment issues + anxiety traumas... I can’t imagine putting a child through that, let alone forcing them to exist."
One thing I don’t understand abt breeders is how they leave their kids in daycare when they r still babies. Don’t they budget or save for a while to not work? I found being forced to go to kindergarten v traumatising as a kid. I would not leave my kid to be raised by strangers.
"People also procreate bc of mass indoctrination + social conditioning. Little girls are given dolls to play with, made to consume propaganda to prime them into motherhood. Corporations create nice fashion + accessories for babies + small children. Pregnancy is glamourised... etc."
"The game of life is a cruel sadomasochistic joke. You’re supposed to have eternal gratitude (=servitude) for your parents, society + the govt... you’re supposed to enjoy it + be fruitful + multiply. If not, then you’re a mentally sick fuck."
People make me sick...
Life is a scam. It promises you everything but delivers nothing but death. #antinatalism
Your suffering exists for someone else’s pleasure. #antinatalism
#Antinatalism is the only path towards salvation for humankind.
Society makes you miserable bc everyone is so exhausted from maintaining a facade they have to make others who are more authentic feel shame/guilt for not being as miserable as they are. Misery always loves company.
Fertility is the ultimate seed of destruction. #antinatalism
The driving force behind slavery is misogyny bc all slaves will one day die + women are burdened with having to replace them.
"You are born to be a commodity. As soon as you rebel against being a biological robot + you resist, you will be ostracised but also envied by many who lack the courage to do what you do."
"Your body is a factory that keeps on cloning generations of suffering, misery, pain + food for the existential meat grinder of our existence. #antinatalism"
Your body is a mindless corporate slave making factory. #antinatalism
Sounds like my mother. She believes everything she reads on WhatsApp + YouTube + I have to constantly remind her about fake news + click bait titles.
Oak trees are the national tree of England. They are associated with the Celtic God of lightening. They are also very likely to be struck by lightening. Ancient soldiers from Europe decorated their garments in oak tree leaves.
"Apparently neem tree leaves are used as a snake repellant in India. It’s also a sacred tree according to Hindu texts. I knew neem was used for beauty, health + gardening... but didn’t know it was a snake repellent too."
"One of my guiltiest pleasures in life is reading books on ecology, animals, trees + nature in general. I bought this book last year when I went on holiday. I’m so in love 🥰 ... I learnt about the marula tree fruit + sausage tree fruit. Africa has some amazing tree species."
Humans destroy the very essence of what is needed to provide them + other living organisms with sustenance. Humans are for death + their love for life is phoney + superficial.
#Antinatalism unmasks the veils of human ignorance.
"Nature dominates humans + humans need technology to try + dominate nature... there are some demons they can dominate, but nature’s force is so powerful that humans cannot even conquer their own inner demons. #EveningThoughts"
"Another internal conflict we often face is how we have very limited agency over our lives. Best example of this is how we can love something so much we could dedicate our whole lives to it, but to society it means nothing + makes no money or not enough money to pay the bills."
One of my deepest internal conflicts I experience is being raised with a strong work ethic + having good self-discipline + then realising how much a scam my existence is that I feel like spending my life as a NEET or Hikikomori while going back + forth into working life.
"I finally submitted one assignment... now I have to squeeze out 2 more in the next couple of days. My grades seem to have dropped. I don’t even care at the moment tbh, I lack drive, passion + will to even live... this study is just my backup in case all fails."
If the challenges parenting were presented unbiasedly to people... If the facts of what the reality of existence were openly spoken about without taboo/stigma... Perhaps people would think twice before they bring someone into the world...
"When you no longer fear death, you become invincible bc society has nothing to control you with... not just death... but society fears people who are financially free + childfree bc no one can control those people anymore..."
"I have suffered a lot in my life... perhaps in my earlier years being an AN, that influenced my choice to be AN strongly, but now it’s not about me anymore. It’s about the children, bc it’s a children’s rights advocacy movement + someone has to stand up for the voiceless."
"I’m cut pronatalist breeders from before the new millennium some slack bc AN was not widely known about back then... but as soon as the AN philosophy is more widely publicised, parents don’t have an excuse anymore. In the Information Age you need to self-educate."
"Society is part of a grand conspiracy to enslave us, keep us alive as long as possible to benefit from our labour + then pressure us to make copies of ourselves so the suffering continues ad infinitum."
"If society didn’t somehow benefit from my existence in some way, they would give me a graceful exit + dignified death so I won’t be a “burden” on them. #FuckSociety #FuckPronatalistBreeders"
"The worst pronatalist breeders r the ones who act like I owe them just bc of existing + they actually think I benefit from being alive. How is being forced to work, pay taxes, age + die beneficial for me? Society is so entitled they force us to stay alive + act like we owe them."
Society shames you for infertility or getting an abortion. You are pressured to have children + then once those children exist you they are forced to continuously suffer + society abandons them. Society creates criminals + then proceeds to  punish + complain about them.
People procreate + don’t desire to adopt or foster bc often those children especially ones in foster homes have a lot of trauma + people don’t want to deal with that. They end up committing crime + become part of the prison population + breeders are to blame for it.
Pronatalist breeders are so triggered when anyone talks about the virtues of fostering + adopting bc they know deep down inside how selfish it is to procreate.
"The real “meaning” of life is...   - Consumption - Reproduction - Cannibalism (figuratively speaking) - Addiction  No wonder why our existence is so hopeless, miserable + meaningless... it’s better to be dead or non-existent than to exist for those things.   #antinatalism"
"I have absolutely no desire to replicate or clone myself. The world is much better off with just me + even if I’m gone, it’s not the end of the world. There is nothing about this existence I’ll miss + I don’t desire to salvage any part of my existence."
Nature is the puppet master of our reality.
"So true. Just bc we have had a projection of what “family” is supposed to look like, it doesn’t mean it’s a universal standard for all. All you need is love + connection to be family - similar genetics are overrated. Pets will always be part of the family too."
Slavery still exists today... The Arab slave trade was far worse than the transatlantic slave trade. Slavery still exists among Africans to this day. At least White people ended slavery + they taught others to acknowledge it’s wrong. Everybody makes mistakes.
"Besides, the people who benefitted from slavery + imperialism are already long gone. Children should not inherit the sins of their fathers. And every race is responsible for imperialism one way or another but only Whites are exploited for the past + made to feel guilty."
It’s not that simple... you can’t just undo the damage you’ve done without destroying what’s left of yourself. Germany still pays compensation to Israel which is ridiculous. White people are already destroying themselves with postmodernism + mass migration.
"If you cannot face the truth, you spend the rest of your life trying to preserve a lie."
"One thing to appreciate about the millennial generation is the fact that they are relatively more open to being childfree or antinatalist. Other generations automatically expect you to adhere to life scripts. Millennials r flawed in many ways, but they aren’t too bad."
"I don’t mind extroverts who are wise, good conversationalists, have a good sense of humour + are a bit knowledgeable on a range of subjects - if all people have to talk about is gossip, pop culture or what’s not right now... I’ll be very bored + they’ll lose my attention."
Human existence disrupts the delicate ecological balance in nature.
I have a lot of these birds in my garden. They love my hedges... my cat went on a killing spree catching one everyday for a whole week once. Such lovely birds.
Some good food for thought for those quick to judge the suicidal...
Of all days I decide to take a hot bath in my jacuzzi to relax my hot water is out... FML. Hot water always relaxes me + eases my pain. One of the best ways to wind down + meditate when I have sensory overload.
"Ancestry updates my results again... my pan-Arab nationalist worldview shaped my anti-imperialist views + my “dislike” for Persians... Which is amusing. I’m like half indigenous Mesopotamian + the other half the blood of the enemy, haha."
"Part of being a man is being able to stand up to a woman, even if she convinces you to do something absurd... the worst part is these women are physically attractive + they think that a baby will make someone stick around. You gotta learn to stand your ground + get a vasectomy."
"I’m shocked at the number of men who want to remain childfree... the ones who explicitly tell their gfs that they don’t want children, but then they proceed to stay with partners who baby trap them. Men who pressure women to get abortions are painted as assholes by media."
Adoption + fostering are the only ethical forms of parenting.
The next step towards #antinatalism is lobbying to make adoption + fostering an easier process while still having safeguards put in place to protect children from abusers who exploit adoption + fostering to hurt children.
Breeders tell you its selfish to be childfree... they paint parenthood like its a virtuous act of selflessness... but that only applies to adoptive parents who actually provide orphans with a good life or at least better opportunities than they would have had w/ their parents.
"This Sudanese woman who adopted him treated him like her own son, she gave him all her assets, she gave him everything + even favoured him over her biological daughter. His mother left him behind bc her fiancé refused to marry a single mum for cultural reasons."
I watch this Arabic story-telling YT Channel where there was a story abt a mother who abandoned her son to her next door neighbour who had trouble conceiving.. the son became an influential + successful doctor + when the mum found out she tried to turn him against his adopted mum
I think everybody deserves their own safe space + territory. When some subcultures try to infiltrate + subvert some cultures or spaces that are hostile to them... they are cancerous. We can’t change other people... but we can accept that we disagree with them + move on...
"I have always said that the New World countries you mentioned are good places for multicultural melting pot ""experiments"" but I am very much against displacing native peoples in their own countries."
I am. Mass migration destroys the character of countries... I didn't like London bc it doesn't feel very English to me. Humans are very tribal + multiple cultures forced to live together in one place will lead to chaos + ethnic violence. It is very unnatural too.
"Mass migration is anti-survival indoctrinated programming. U don't see anyone from non-White country importing immigrants into their countries. Take Iraq for example, Turkey committed Armenian Genocide + used Kurds for this, Kurds r indigenous to Iran + they want a Kurdish state."
"Thank you. As a PoC w an imperialist past (Islamic conquests in Africa/Asia) I can't blame others + play innocent. As an AN, I believe imperialism is stupid + futile I explain why in this post   I hope everyone learns from the past lessons in history."
"Human beings are hypocrites... I'm as anti-imperialism as I am AN... I grew up listening to everybody talk about European imperialist crimes against others + I'm by no means giving them a free pass... but my ancestors were guilty of imperialism too, bt at least I don't deny that."
"I'm a misanthrope + realist.. I dislike everybody equally + am mostly indifferent to everyone. Human history is bloodshed, war + imperialism in one form or another.. this applies to all collectively. We can't punish ppl for their ancestors sins forever. We must learn from history"
"Aren't we all guilty of imperialism at some point in history? Islamic conquests r a good example of this.  Almost every race on earth has blood on their hands, if its not against another, its tribal. White ppl displace themselves by importing the 3rd world into their countries."
"The banking cartel has always been behind the 1st World Wars, I have some skepticism abt the Holocaust, the Iraq war + Middle East conflicts are backed by Zionist banking cartel who have infiltrated US congress... I won't deny genocides of indigenous people in the New World..."
"I didn’t mean that... what I’m saying is their human rights abuses, conflicts + corruption r lower than us. It doesn’t mean those things don’t entirely exist in their society. They aren’t angels by any means... in general, I’m a misanthrope, I dislike all ppl, but I keep it real."
"I’m not saying they are superior to anybody else, they are unique but they also have problems like everyone else..."
"White ppl r guilty of imperialism in the past (like all of have been) but they don’t deserve to be punished for the sins of their forefathers. Many PoC still hv tribal wars, our countries r more corrupt + hv many human rights abuses, ethnic conflicts will escalate w/o White ppl."
"Let’s be honest here... White people are fair, honest, less racist than most PoC, more compassionate, conscious of environment/animals, they have less human rights violations than us, they have ingenuity + they ended slavery. The world will be far worse off without them."
"I don't feel comfortable making life altering decisions for others. My strategy has always been provide people with all the facts, all sides of the argument, teach them critical thinking skills + leave them to make their decision. I'm happy to disagree with their choice too."
"Am I the only one who is so lazy that when assignments are repetitive or overlap, I just copy + paste previous work I've done on another assignment related to the same subject manner?"
Cruelty + compassion are two sides of the same coin. You cannot have one without the other. I wrote a blogpost about this topic a very long time ago
I was never a fan of Friends. Many of my peers seemed to love it. I just never liked it as a series... most things that are popular don't seem to appeal to me much. #UnpopularOpinons
"Overpopulated countries suffer from environmental catastrophes including droughts, flooding and other natural disasters... if environmental catastrophes aren't enough of a wakeup call to stop breeding, I don't know what is. #antinatalism"
"If you repeat a lie enough times, you will ultimately believe it’s the truth even if all evidence points the other way. #antinatalism"
Repeat after me:   - “Life is good” - “Life is a miracle from God we must preserve” - “Worship your parents even if it makes u miserable bc they gave u the gift of life”  - “Longevity is a gift + blessing”  Maybe if u repeat these mantras enough times u might actually believe em.
The circle of life is a merry-go-round of sadism. #antinatalism
"Every child is a blank canvas for society to paint, indoctrinate + enslave to be another drone in their mass army of mindless consumers (and breeders). #antinatalism"
Children are bandaids to “fix” the deep fractured wounds of society. #antinatalism
Every human on this earth is here bc of selfish desire. #antinatalism
The best life hack for anybody is don’t have kids. #antinatalism
"The secret to happiness is accepting death is part of life, it’s the only thing guaranteed to you + you don’t have to try anymore bc your whole existence is futile... just accept it... do what makes you happy + you’ll cruise through life."
"The quest to eternal youth + eternal life is like trying to swim against the current of a major tidal wave... drowning is your destiny + nothing can ever stop that. Sooner or later, the deadly tidal wave will come to get you. #antinatalism"
Natural selection... survival of the fittest... breeders compete for it like a prize... but the prize is only more pain + suffering. The real winners remove themselves forever from the gene pool.   #antinatalism
Existence is a death sentence for all sentient life forms.   #antinatalism
You need a licence to drive + qualifications for a professional career. To be a parent you only need to be lustful with functioning genitals.  #antinatalism
We are indoctrinated with to believe children are an essential part of our existence + we are incomplete without them.
Procreation is the root of all evil. #antinatalism
Thou shall not disturb the unborn + thou shall leave them to Rest In Peace. #antinatalism
"Imagine how much happier + richer our parents would be if they invested in the right stocks, precious metals or real estate instead of bringing us into this world... society demonises childfree people who are rich, comfortable + successful... bc society envies those people."
"I think breeders who regret having children or struggle with parenthood should have a safe space to speak up about their experiences. The truth is not always pretty, but prospective parents need to hear the truth + listen to the other side of the story."
"I know about 3 girls my age on Instagram with children who have started their own clothing lines. Some even dress in matching outfits with their toddlers. Motherhood is too glamourised... they rarely show you the sides of sleep deprivation, stress + difficulties of parenting."
Many breeders come to wish they remained childfree or (at a later stage in life anitnatalist) but the problem is they fail to show others the mistake they made by having children. I understand not wanting to upset your children... but society over glamourises parenthood.
I recommend following screw_line on Instagram. They do amazing AN themed artwork! #Antinatalism #Illustration
The best thing about being bilingual is being able to listen to true crime stories in another language once you’re done listening to stories in English.
I have been brainstorming some ideas on my future AN projects. I would also like to do presentations to introduce my work to people once I’ve finished... these are drafts... I’ll go through a heap of refinement processes before I finalise anything.
The biggest scam in human history is selling people the lie that conception is a miracle when it’s nothing more than a replication of cells. #antinatalism
It’s so weird. I’ve met about 4-5 people who have told me I resemble a relative or someone they know. A friend of mine found my doppelgänger overseas + I’m shocked how we look like identical twins. I seem to look very common to people. Reminds me the world doesn’t need my genes.
I decided to go out shopping tonight. These older twin women r staring at me + I stare back. They greet me + I’m stunned trying to figure where I know em from. Then they ask me if I’m from some town. Then I realised they’ve met another one of my doppelgängers. I seem to hv many.
"When u r a byproduct of an arranged marriage + your parents both have some cerebral narcissistic traits you tend to value transactional relationships, companionship + intellectualism more than superficial relationships. At least transactional relationships r honest abt intention."
The internet is a blessing for high IQ people. You get to meet likeminded people (if you look in the right places) whereas your chances of meeting such people IRL are really slim + they require you to be somewhat lucky + a bit extroverted. Twitter gives me my intellectual fix.
"Being a childfree woman who desires intellectual stimulation + quality companionship w a lot of time alone, means u automatically weed out nearly all your potential partners. When you realise dating is a waste of time, you instinctively want to be undesirable to the opposite sex."
"Existence is life imprisonment + a death sentence, rolled into one. #Antinatalism"
We celebrate death + misery every day... they’re called birthdays + baby showers. #antinatalism
"The best gift to give a breeder at a baby shower is a coffin. If every person did this, people would be reminded of the true sadistic nature of procreation."
Lustful desire results in indentured servitude + a death sentence. #Antinatalism
"First sight of light, Marks the beginning of hell, A ceremony of agonising cries, Disillusioned with so many lies, Years of enslavement soon begin, Happiness becomes suffering, Slave labour + societal norms, The decay meat suit finally meets futility + solace finds non-existence."
The cost of liberty comes with accepting many unpleasant truths.
"Your life is full of invisible shackles that rule over you, beyond any scope of control you may think you have."
Your existence is limited by invisible constraints + variables beyond anything your mind can comprehend.
"The herd mentality + being a social species is weaponised against us. It is that very nature that forces us give into peer pressure, adhere to ridiculous social norms + tolerate abuse. The epitome of the herd mentality is ignorance, compliance with oppression + mindlessness."
"You have the illusion of dominion over other life forms, but you are at the mercy of those who consume + destroy you."
"You are a consumer, but also a consumable good to be consumed. The system gives you a number + you are cattle + a cash cow. You aren’t different to the livestock you consume. In the grand scheme of things, your existence is always part of a food chain or food web."
I have always admired people who adopt. Adoption isn't very popular in the Middle East bc everyone wants a biological child. My great grandad found a baby girl crying in a cemetery + he adopted her. One of my second/third cousins adopted two twin boys bc she couldn't conceive.
"If I had better mental health + the financial means to do so, I would consider adoption. For now, I am like an auntie to most of the children of my friends + my nephew. I will always be there for them as a God parent + that's the best way I can contribute as a childfree person."
"The system is designed to force you to breed. It deliberately makes adoption a lengthy + bureaucratic process to disincentivise it. The same with religions like Islam, where adopted children are not allowed to inherit money from their adopted parents."
"The best buzzkill is when a breeder tells u they r having kids to take care of them when they r old, then u see an 80-90 year old person looking after their 60-70 year old intellectually disabled child. They created a lifelong dependent thinking they’d be taken care of for life."
Adoption is where you find unconditional love. Most parents love their children conditionally + their love always comes with strings attached.
"Contrary to popular belief... an adopted child will love you more than one who shares your DNA. A child abandoned by their parents will honour those who took them in unconditionally. Most children grow up hating their parents. Lesson here is, your “own” child is overrated."
"Love only triumphs when you deny yourself desire + you allow yourself to conquer your needs instead of being conquered by them.  * * * By needs, I mean your basic instinct to procreate."
Beauty cannot exist without tragedy + that we deem to be grotesque.
Every life begins with the tragedy of birth + the tragic end of death (or miracle - depending how you see it).
Every fairytale begins with sadness + sorrow in the early years + ends with “happily ever after” to create disillusion. I disagree... I believe fairytales exist when we have magical thinking as children + every life ends in some form of tragedy one way or another.
"#Antinatalism is the present + the future. Progeny is so out of fashion, so outdated + so archaic. AN will leave its mark in history as a pathway of wisdom + enlightenment for other generations (who have the misfortune of being forced into existence)."
“The purpose of life is to procreate...” is an argument u often hear from breeders.   Being reduced down to a basic animalistic bodily function is degrading especially being an intelligent enough life form to know what existence entails.  Meaninglessness = no reason to procreate.
"The only good things about capitalism + hyperinflation is the rising cost of living disincentivising people from having children. When children are an economic burden, this encourages more people to embrace the childfree lifestyle."
You gotta love when people virtue signal about ending slavery...   Slavery never ended... slavery will only ever come to an end if procreation is made illegal.   Progeny is the root of all slavery...  #antinatalism
Steps to suicide prevention:   1.) Acknowledge life sucks. 2.) Acknowledge all life is a non-consensual imposition + coercion forced onto others.  3.) Acknowledge this is unethical. 4.) Be mindful + abstain from procreation.   These are most effective ways to prevent suicide.
"The only reason why suicide has so much stigma is bc it’s a taboo to acknowledge how much life sucks.   Suicide can still be a taboo, yes. But what’s the best way to prevent suicide? It’s to break the taboo about telling the truth about life + not procreating."
Every baby born into this world is sentenced to life in prison - in a rotting meat suit where they have no freewill + they are forced to slave away to make the dreams of sadists come true. #Antinatalism
Everybody pays the price for someone else’s crimes + desires. There is always someone who MUST get fucked over so you can have a “good life”.
Children going through puberty have raging hormones... they go crazy + are impulsive... nature is cruel... she makes breeding accessible to those of the least sound minds to mindlessly replicate more meat for the meat grinder...
Legalise euthanasia for all + make it easily accessible to any sound minded adult over the age of 18 + watch all suicides + mental health issues dissolve into thin air almost overnight.
"The human experience is like a conveyor belt... our existence is for mass consumption, capitalism + death. We are the livestock + our destination is + always will be the slaughterhouse. #Antinatalism"
"In a dystopian world, we would clone humans instead of having to breed them into existence. If a clone lacked the same level of sentience as a human would... people are better off cloning themselves instead of forcing someone else to come + be..."
Society promises everyone the world... but only delivers death. #Pronatalism #Breeding #Antinatalism
Adopted parents learn to love children they adopt as their own...   Parents of children switched at birth raise someone else’s child as their own...  Many women r responsible for turning their partners into cuckolds...   But only breeders care it’s not “their” child...
Truly loving children is about being honest enough to face the reality of existence + refusing to bring children into the world to experience it. #Antinatalism
Sexual desire + genitals are like a venus flytrap... they are laced with honey designed to lure + trap you for an eternity. #antinatalism
True love = sacrificing your desire to safeguard the welfare of others (AN)   Malignant self love = sacrificing others welfare for your orgasm + mediocre genetic investment (breeders)   #antinatalism
Life = a prison sentence as a prize for someone else’s orgasm. #Antinatalism
One orgasm = a life in prison sentence for someone else. #antinatalism
I hope Twitter doesn’t get banned in India. I will miss my Indian AN tweeps so much. They always tweet some good stuff. I’ll also miss reading news from India on my TL - it’s always an interesting read. I learnt a lot about India from people I follow on Twitter.
"I hv seen a lot of good things get infiltrated + corrupted. A good example is some religions - they start off w a positive message to b different from all the others, til they get infiltrated by Jesuits + destroyed from inside in. The last thing I want is to c that happen to AN."
Now I know from experience... It takes you about 6 months to grow out a pixie haircut. The worst thing about it is when it grows into a mullet + you have some layers that are still too short + require a bit more time to grow into a bob.

I ordered this ring for myself a few weeks ago after I changed my mind about suicide. I received it in the mail today... I have been feeling very suicidal again these past couple of days... I hate when my plans to die get messed up somehow... I wish it was my time to go already.
"I’ve always considered myself to be very pro-sovereignty + personal autonomy. Consent is a huge central theme in that + in AN. Being born into this world without our consent is one thing, but violating the consent of others makes us worse than those we claim to be against."
I manage my migraines with a special ointment I put on my sinuses + the back of my neck + I lock myself up alone in a dark room + sleep. That helps my migraines more than any other painkiller or preventative drug prescribed by any doctor.
One of my autistic clients used to wet his hair with water + I observed him carefully. He did this to manage + prevent his extremely violent seizures + they cut down his medication bc he hardly had any seizures. People have ways of managing their health issues without drugs.
I have my own ways of managing mental health w/o medication... I self-isolate alone in a dark room + sleep for days + nights + that cures my psychosis + stops it from escalating to crisis point. I refuse pap smears bc I’ve been celibate for 14 years. Yet doctors talk down to me.
Then she tried to tell me I have to take Ritalin everyday when my psychiatrist + I specifically said I will only take it as needed. My dad harasses me today abt my brother’s stuff. I’m going through a mental health crisis + tells me to seek treatment bc this doctor said I should.
"This doctor I went to on Friday to get a medical certificate from was all up in my business... she asked me to get a smear test, asked me if I was sexually active (I’m not), tried to bully me into taking an anti-psychotic when I manage my own psychosis episodes in my own way."
"Doctors who advocate for euthanasia + are willing to stand up for their patients + risk their livelihoods to end those suffering are heroes. They deserve to be acknowledged, recognised more. They are the only professionals who have an ounce of humanity left in them."
"Doctors more, should be grouped into two categories.   1.) Life extension therapy doctors for those who love life.   2.) Doctors that end suffering for good + advocate death for those who want it.   And people r free to seek whichever practitioner they need + both paths r valid."
I despise doctors. Many of them talk to me condescendingly. They lack empathy + assume they know what’s best for me. They are invalidating sometimes + aggressively forceful in nature.
Psychosomatic symptoms he has. I have had psychosomatic seizures + stress induced migraines. I can relate to Adam quite a lot. There are some treatment modalities I haven’t tried + they are difficult for me to access... it’s hard to find peace with all this suffering + deep pain.
"Part of me feels terrible bc I don’t want to let anybody down, but at the same time, I feel like I am very impaired by my dis-ease. When I was v suicidal, I watched some videos done by Adam Maier-Clayton who was a euthanasia advocate who killed himself. I do not hv the same"
"I want to stick around if I can. I want to make some contributions + try something new. But I have become more + more low functioning, to the point my mental health is debilitating. I have a family history of mental illness. Perhaps my fate is taking my life with my own hands."
"These girls are beautiful, but they are so insecure deep down inside. They want to lock their immature, boyish partners down with marriage + have the whole fairytale wedding + they feel they have to have a kid to baby trap these guys. It’s sad. I feel for the kids."
Young girls are so insecure. I went to visit my friend + her kids today. Her son’s gf got knocked up deliberately to baby trap my friend’s son. Same thing happened last year with another friend. Both guys are in their early 20s + didn’t want to become fathers.
I’m exactly the same. I’ve seen people who have glass houses + play classical music for their plants to help them grow. They are a lot of work. I adopted a stray kitten from someone. He’s been with me nearly 10 year now.
"I can't articulate myself w limited characters. Many ppl go to a nursery. I know of one lady who buys plants every time she gets depressed + treats them as children. The whole ""indoor/rainforest"" thing is a huge trend for millennials. I'm not really a plant person, I prefer pets."
I agree w u on the last point. People r adopting animals + plants as substitutes for children these days. Not sure that will be for everybody. In David Benatar's book he said that the last generation would suffer the most if everyone stopped breeding bc no one can care for them.
All you can do is plant the seed. Explain the point to people + leave them to make their own decisions. Most of my friends who have children have told me they regret it. AN has been around since the time of the Greeks + it has never been popular. I don't ever expect it to be.
"Are you kidding me? We live in a society where parents are glorified + worshipped automatically by everybody + childfree people are seen as hedonistic, selfish + materialistic people. Pronatalist society enables parents or condones them at the very least."
At least we agree on that. We live in the 21st Century - we have sterilisation procedures + effective contraceptive methods... now all we need is people to understand consent + the rights of the unborn + perhaps consider adoption as opposed to procreating.
It is one thing to acknowledge your parents had you against your consent. It's another thing entirely to make a conscious decision to not repeat the mistake + to point it out to others so they do not repeat the same mistake. There's nothing more to it than that.
"I grew up w parents who loved me conditionally, they were controlling, helicopter parents who to this day r disappointed I didn't turn out to be wht they wanted. Many parents are like this, especially ethnic parents + they act like we owe them everything when we owe them nothing."
"Parents, regardless of whether they are good or abusive have violated the rights of their children by forcing them AGAINST THEIR CONSENT to be born into this world. To be born is to be kidnapped, raped, enslaved + have death forced upon you by your parents."
"That has absolutely nothing to do with antinatalism. So, we are forced into a realm of existence against our consent by our parents to be state tax slaves and we are supposed to be grateful to our parents for bringing us into this world that has many problems? WTF?"
You are cherrypicking. This happens whether or not we like it. Parents have children purely for their own selfish reasons + children are expected to worship their parents like Gods.
I live in a 1st world country that has one of the highest youth suicide rates. We also have one of the highest infant mortality rates + a lot of these child grow up in poverty + are sexually/physically/mentally abused + end up in foster care.
"You r out of touch w reality. People use children to trap others in abusive relationships, children r sometimes expected to financially help their parents, many parents hv children to take care of em when they are old, some parents want their children to live their broken dreams."
I’m going to guess maybe 1/4 to 1/5th roughly. I can’t say for sure.
"There are no statistics at least to my knowledge of how many people are abusive parents. I mentioned the most overpopulated areas as a guideline, bc it is impossible to collect data on how many parents out of 8 billion people who are parents are abusive."
"A lot of ethnic parents love their children conditionally. Asians, Africans, Middle Easterners. Many come from overpopulated countries. Their populations combined would be at least more than half the world. To them children r slaves + a social status symbol."
Many parents are abusive/controlling towards their children + love them conditionally + have them for purely selfish narcissistic reasons. I’m glad your childhood wasn’t bad. Not everybody wants to become a slave to society forced to sacrifice happiness + health to be a tax slave
"You are bullied by parents as soon as you are a child, you are forced to go to school to be indoctrinated, then forced to work 9-5 for the next 60+ years. You struggle with boredom, disease, misfortunes, loss. Your body degenerates until you die. Where’s the pleasure in all that?"
"Credit card fraud + theft are considered criminal acts prosecuted by law. But it’s perfectly fine to rob the unborn of their peace in the realm of nothingness, proceed to gamble w their lives + commit fraud by calling it a selfless, noble, gift of love."
"Gambling is considered a social disease + similar to alcoholism, there is a 12 step rehabilitation program for addicts. Gambling is frowned upon by society - yet gambling with someone fate, whether genetic or any other misfortune is perfectly acceptable."
"Is it okay for me to take somebody’s belongings + gamble them without their consent? If pronatalist breeders say it’s okay to do it to the unborn, then everybody else is free to do it to others as well."
"I present to u the wheel of misfortune. It’s a good way to explain gambling with other ppls lives to those who don’t understand AN. Imagine if I could spin this wheel of misfortune to determine somebody’s else’s fate in life. It’s morally wrong, so how is breeding any different?"
"The most extreme example I can think of to show breeders how gambling with other people's lives is wrong is playing ""wheel of misfortune"" with their lives, while some random person spins the wheel on their behalf + they have to face the fate on that wheel."
"Some people either pretend not to understand #antinatalism or if they don't have enough IQ points to understand it, they will just use ad hominem attacks bc of their inability to address the points made."
"You didn't hurt me or cause me any pain. You are free to accept/reject whatever you want in life. It's all about the message, not the messenger. Ad hominem attacks are a reflection of one's internal conflict or their inability to understand basic facts."
"Do you enjoy gambling? Is it OK to consent to someone else gambling w your life + if they lose u get to be sentenced to be a slave of human trafficking? In a world of randomness + genetic determinism, u cannot guarantee your child will not have some genetic disease or disability."
"Most people mindlessly breed + most ppl are byproducts of accidental pregnancies. Being childfree gives u opportunity to focus on your career + other interests. Being an AN is abt compassion for the unborn.. wud like u to be kidnapped, raped, enslaved by someone w/o yr consent?"
"Do u enjoy ageing + watching your body deteriorate? Having to work 9-5 job for 60+ yrs? Do u enjoy misfortunes like accidents, diseases, physical pain or agony? Do you enjoy mindless mass consumption? Do you enjoy spending your life slaving away only to suffer diseases and die?"
"Antinatalism has nothing to do w fearing life. If ANs feared life, they would commit suicide or live in complete reclusion. The pain + suffering in life outweighs the pleasure + enjoyment of life. Life is mostly suffering with a few breaks in between + rare moments of happiness."
"When you procreate you are demonstrating two things to the world - you are a worldly person, with worldly desires, you desire immortality + you have absolutely no regard for those who have to suffer for your desire. #antinatalism"
"Real people who are spiritual are childfree. Most traditional priests, nuns, monks, gurus are all childfree. Procreation is a lower self bodily desire. Cultivating spirituality means detaching yourself from lower, base, bodily desires."
"True conscious evolution is about cultivating a world of compassion that values kindness over greed + seeks to reduce suffering by caring for the environment, reducing suffering + showing compassion to others. The world is so far behind achieving that when ppl mindlessly breed."
"The human experience is an experiment of consciousness by Aeons (Gods) to see how our consciousness evolves. As u can see the world is far from conscious - ppl destroy the environment, capitalism degrades human life, there r too many of us. Evolution means changing those things."
"Exactly. So Antinatalism has nothing to do w suicide. Refraining from procreation means we all return back to source (God, consciousness whatever u want to call it). Therefore procreation is cowardly bc you seek eternal life via your offspring bc u fear death which doesn’t exist."
Spirituality is about acknowledging this world is run + controlled by spiritual parasites that survive on harvesting human energy that comes from suffering. All Abrahamic religions come from spiritual parasites bc they promote progeny so parasites can survive.
"Evolution in consciousness is recognising existence is futile + only way to escape cycle of rebirth is by collectively refraining from procreation.   Even in religious texts progeny is seen as a worldly, base, lower animalistic desire. That’s y many spiritual leaders r childfree."
"Fearing death + desiring immortality is cowardly. Dragging a child without their consent into this world to suffer to satisfy your lower level desires + desire for immortality makes you an asshole + a coward. Sorry for my harsh language, but that’s the truth."
"Well, natalism is focused on immortality (which is a worldly desire) + inferiority (by living via children u leave behind to suffer to satisfy lower self desires). True conscious evolution is accepting existence is futile + the only way to escape rebirth + suffering is via AN."
"You clearly have a very poor understanding of consciousness. Antinatalism has absolutely NOTHING to do with suicide. Ppl who believe in consciousness talk abt MULTIPLE LIFETIMES to reach ENLIGHTENMENT. There is no such thing as death of consciousness, only death of physical body."
"According to spiritual people who believe in karma, reincarnation, the demiurge etc.. procreation = suffering. Human suffering = loosh (negative energy) Loosh = food for the archons (demiurge). The only way to stop creating loosh + escape the demiurge is not procreating."
"My first encounter with #antinatalism was through researching spirituality + I came across archons (the demiurge), aeons + the Dead Sea scrolls. I come from a spiritual background that is highly superstitious. I only had spiritualism to fall back on when I left religion for good."
If u r a spiritual person who believes in reincarnation + karmic cycles #antinatalism is perfectly harmonious with your belief system. You reincarnate to balance your karmic debt + the end goal is to reach enlightenment as a collective. This cannot be achieved by having children.
The ultimate form evolution in conscious is antinatalism. Realising the only way to break free from a cycle of karma + reincarnation is by everybody eventually not procreating and putting an end to suffering for good.
I don’t understand people who label #antinatalism as suicidal or cowardly... AN has nothing to do with suicide + it’s a movement of courage + bravery? Bc it takes guts to go against the masses + stand your own ground for something bigger/greater than you.
Indeed! #ThatsLife
That is ironic coming from someone who believes in metaphysics. Do you believe in the Gnostic Dead Sea Scrolls + reincarnation? Did you know they were the among the first antinatalists in history - they believed everybody not procreating would have their consciousness find peace?
"I want #antinatalism to appeal to people of all ages, cultures, religious backgrounds (lack thereof), sexual orientations, creeds, nationalities, sexes... bc its the truth + it focuses on compassion + reducing suffering to others + refusing to repeat the wrongs of our ancestors."
"Antinatalism to me is:   1.) A child/unborn rights advocacy movement - that focuses primarily on safeguarding others. 2.) Is apolitical - for everyone/anyone.  3.) Conscious movement that focuses on reducing suffering, environmental impacts. 4.) Advocates autonomy/sovereignty."
"A philosophy that promotes murdering others by trying to infiltrate another philosophy based on compassion has the power to subvert it. I want ppl to resonate w antinatalism, not be repelled by it. By aligning ourselves w extremists, we become a crazy murderous cult to outsiders."
"I'm not gonna lie, I hv an inner sadist + I am a lower tier secondary psychopath who lacks primary empathy.. bt I refuse to align myself with a bunch of ppl who promote murder + advocate violence. I want ppl to find antinatalism bc of rationality, common sense + basic compassion."
"In short, I do not have the right to impose life on people, but I also do not have the right to take other people's lives away unless they have violated me first. I have the right to kill myself + no one has the right to take that from me."
catty. I wouldn't kill them tho. I absolutely love cats + would never kill them - experiments where cats have been removed from ecosystems to preserve native bird populations have resulted in exponential increases in rodent + pest populations which is problematic.
"I advocate for murder only in self-defence. I have my own skepticisms regarding the holocaust + I think people should be free to question any historical event, bc history is always written by those in power. I dislike women in general bc its hard to find ones who aren't bitchy or"
"While progeny is worse than murder, I do not see myself senselessly murdering somebody just bc they gave birth. I know there are people who genuinely love life + living + as long as they aren't violating my right to suicide or euthanasia I would not kill them for any reason."
"I just watched an anti-efilist documentary critiquing Inmendham. I have entertained the idea of ""pushing the button to end all life"" but I find myself alienated from this niche of people. People can be holocaust deniers, misogynists, cat-haters + a whole bunch of other things..."
"Existence is like being trapped in an elevator where you can’t call out for help, there’s no wifi/data or cellphone towers around + you’re trapped for what feels like an eternity until you die."
#antinatalism is reclaiming your life from those who promoted procreation propaganda to your parents + those who claim ownership of you as a corporate tax slave on their plantation of greed + exploitation. It promotes elements of sovereignty + autonomy at least over your body.
"Being forced to focus on finding a partner, procreating, your biological clock (for women), financial success to provide for offspring + feeling like a failure bc u haven’t achieved these milestones + rites of passage is far more depressing + detrimental to your mental health."
"I would make the arguments that antinatalism isn’t dark or pessimistic but it is a message of empowerment:   It emancipates u from the burden of procreation, u learn to try + discover/develop your identity, you are less pressured to achieve success + you build skills/experience."
"Find ways to make the message seem empowering without too much optimism so as not to alienate people from it. Pessimistic philosophy + realism can be a stepping stone towards freedom, enlightenment + easing away heavy burdens society has plagued us with unnecessarily."
"I will always gravitate towards realism + pessimism. What is dark doesn’t affect my mental state, my mental state by default is one that is dark in general. Optimism is what I find toxic bc I hate disappointment. I also recognise that others are different so I try to be gentle +"
"The truth ugly or not, are the ideal messages I prefer to consume. When positivity becomes so rampant (and often much of it is propaganda) is becomes toxic, bc following it is often designed to sabotage or distract you. This is why I find myself gravitating more to realism."
"People tend to avoid messages they find depressing. I’m not affected by people who post about suicide, self-harm or death. I don’t want to avoid them or egg them on, but I’m not motivated or inspired by messages of positivity either. What I prefer is reality... people who post"
"I love cats. That’s no secret. What I’ve recently become more obsessed with is rabbits. They are so cute. There are many rabbits in my area. In 2018, I remember seeing rabbits everywhere. I fell in love."
Imagine publishing a parody version of Jordan Peterson’s “12 Rules for Life” and the first rule being “Don’t have children”. I have seen many ANs rip JP to shreds - they are amusing + his arguments are so weak.
Many vegans are still hostile towards AN + distance them from it bc they associate it with misanthropy + voluntary extinction.
"I think it took a while for antinatalism as a concept to evolve + reach the stage it’s at now. Gnostics focused on it as a spiritual + mystical concept bc that was what was popular at that time. People are more focused on ethics now, which lead to the current incarnation of AN."
"In my biased opinion, I think vegans have promoted antinatalism more effectively than VHEMT. Not many people are willing to sacrifice propagating their genes for the environment as much as ethics. VHEMT has encouraged people to have less children for environmental reasons."
"Vegans have played a vital role in helping promote antinatalism. When veganism + the digital nomad lifestyle were more popular on social media, they inspired many people to go out, get sterilised + remain childfree. Vegans touched on some ethical elements too."
People think self-sufficiency is growing your own food + learning to live off the land. That’s partially true. But many people lack self-sufficiency in terms self-validation + learning to be comfortable on their own. It gives people less ability to control or manipulate you.
"Children need a self-help, life hack book to educate them how to avoid getting screwed over. Lessons should be:   1.) Don’t have kids.  2.) Pursue financial freedom early on + adopt minimalism instead of materialism.   3.) Avoid toxic relationships, cultivate self-sufficiency."
"The rich people I know have their parents micromanage every aspect of their lives, from what they study, to what career they choose + even their spouse. They have to choose between freedom + being disowned by their parents."
People are quick to hate the rich + few ppl understand how much of their freedoms + autonomy they hv to sacrifice for approval from their parents. Rich people are obsessed with their image + they are cruel + cold towards their children. Existence is a burden even for the wealthy.
"You be surrounded by so many people you love who are your family + friends while still being lonely. When your mind works differently + you have no shame walking away from life scripts, you learn to enjoy your own company + appreciate likeminded people more."
"All of my closest friends have children. My cousin joined the club last year so I’m an aunt. It makes my existence feel kind of lonely. Most of my friends have told me they regret having their kids. If they weren’t decent people, I would not have any friends at all."
One of my best friends is coming from out of town to visit me this weekend with her daughter. Her son is accidentally got his crazy gf pregnant + my friend is going to become a grandmother at age 42. I’m looking forward to seeing her... it feels like forever.
"Humans cannot leave other humans alone. They have to find a way to harass, provoke or exploit them somehow. The first step to prosperity is to not procreate + leave people alone. If ppl learn to find peace alone then all conflicts would finally come to an end."
"Toilets for nomadic tribes in North Africa + Westerners got angry at why these ppl refused to use their toilets... they said they found it unsanitary + preferred to dig holes + squat. Bottom line is... learning to leave people alone is important, but some ppl refuse to do that."
Charity is often times a disservice to many people. Best eg is young Westerners who go to villages in Africa to build homes for people... they have no experience + their work is a hindrance to local villagers who need the money... it’s the same when they tried to build composting
"True charity is unconditional, blind, comes with no strings attached, no agenda (except one of pure compassion + kindness)... it knows no greed or clout.   Bc the concept of charity has been exploited + subverted for so long, it’s entire concept needs to be redefined altogether."
The concept of charity needs a paradigm shift... We need to redefine charity altogether... by   1.) Promoting adoption as charity 2.) Starting up charities that provide free sterilisation or incentivise it 3.) Promoting #antinatalism as the highest form of charity
"I think people should boycott charities like The Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Goodwill, Save the Children, UNICEF - not only do their CEOs make $500k a year + they exploit ppl who work for them, they also extend + promote more suffering for ppl in 3rd World Countries."
"Gifting is a sign of psychopathy, accord to Prof. Sam Vaknin. Psychopathy disguised as humanitarian altruism is worse than poisoning someone with their favourite sweets. You are exploiting their misfortune for your own sick sadistic benefit. Charities like this need to be outed."
"Is either destroy my country completely leaving behind no spoils of war to suffer, or to deny immigration so the sectarian  wars continue in my country + we just kill e/o off. Instead I had to deal with more unnecessary bullshit that scarred me for life, in one way or another."
It’s hard for me to vote bc politicians supported warfare + destruction of my motherland on my own flesh + blood... they also offered my family immigration + enabled their abuse + my suffering while expecting me to vote for them. The most humanitarian thing they could have done
Humanitarianism to 3rd worlders + spoils of war torn countries is like putting a terminally ill person who is incontinent on life support... behind the pathological altruism is pure sadism + blind evil. This is one reason I don’t vote + I loath the West as a Westernised person.
"The process of immigration, culture shock, integration into a new society, moving constantly, being estranged from loved one’s, being isolated in a toxic community.. it’s all traumatising. Yet immigrant parents think their children should be grateful they bought them to the west."
"If you are a 3rd worlder or person from a politically unstable war torn country, even if you have money + connections your kids are still fucked. U can birth them in a western country but they will always feel like a stranger + they will have other struggles they have to endure."
"As a person from a war torn country + to my fellow third worlders... even those fortunate to be born in middle class + affluent families... our parents force us to exist for blind conformity, adoration/adulation + with blind ignorance + hope we will appreciate the burden of life."
This book has inspired me to touch on elements of govt exploitation + social engineering my future work.
"I just finished reading this wonderful book by the man who decided to sue his parents. The book is straightforward, easy to understand + is presented w lighthearted humour touching on culture, environment + how govts have weaponised fertility against us. Highly recommended!"

"I love the fact I can email pdf files to my kindle (I've never done it before)... since there's nothing to watch, I feel like crap + I need to consume something, I might read some read some antinatalist ebooks in one sitting. They will help inspire me a little with my writing."
"You need time away from the world to be able to heal + go back into the world to restart another cycle of enduring existence. When your timeout period exceeds your level of endurance, you know then + there existence is beyond a burden to you."
"To be able to publish books on the side + do research is an outlet for my frustration. The more I get antinatalist msg out there to ppl, the more ppl will be more conscious before they decide to procreate. The last thing I want is more ppl like me forced to endure existence."
My existence is forced. I don’t even really want to live + having to force myself to work full time to be able to afford to live makes my existence that much harder. It would be the main driving force behind ending my life. My capabilities are limited.
"Consideration. My registrar informed me today, I hv to submit the assignment by midnight tonight which is impossible. I think going forward I will enrol in 3 classes only ever semester + it’s okay if I graduate like 6+ months later. At this point, I can only study/work part time."
My school pressured me to take 4 subjects to qualify to be a full-time student. I have only ever managed to study 3 courses at once. Studying was my way out of the workforce + an opportunity to retrain + enter a new career pathway. I applied for an extension twice + a special
"deconstruct, extrapolate + dissect the concept of parenthood. Challenging parenthood w the aim of removing it as a status symbol of glory is the first step. Opening people's eyes is the first step to undo years of brainwashing + pronatalist indoctrination."
"I'm thinking of taking my plans to write an AN book seriously. I emailed myself a copy of my previous book outline from last year. I will try to aim for 60,000 words + I'll probably self-publish. I will try to make the ebook free as my charitable contribution. My objective is to"
The world is a wasteland dominated by shortsighted + narrow-minded idiots.
The only way to safeguard your genes is to refrain from replicating them. #Antinatalism
Removing yourself from the gene pool is the only way to ensure whatever remains of you does not endure anymore unnecessary suffering + pain. #Antinatalism
Incels r not missing out on anything special. Being denied the opportunity to pass down yr genes is a blessing in disguise. Being a cash cow in a miserable relationship where u lose your autonomy is also another blessing in disguise... the only thing that hurts is the loneliness.
I hate this insomnia... sometimes I miss the days when I experienced psychosis + slept almost day/night for 3 months straight. Sleep is one of few things in life that make existence bearable.
"Our existence is not needed, but existing comes with a list of never ending needs. #Antinatalism"
"Our lives were made to be disposable + our existence futile bc the earth doesn’t need us, it never did... but we will always need the earth for sustenance as long as we continue to breed more people into existence."
"The most unpleasant fact most people don’t want to hear is...  “The earth has an independent self-sustaining system that does not require our existence to maintain itself.”  For some reason hearing this basic fact seems to trigger people a lot, bc it can’t be refuted."
Salvaging + extending human life for all is like killing off cats + wolves to “protect” populations of native birds + other species. When civilisation makes life cushy for everybody the parasites thrive at the expense of others + the earth is thrown out of harmony + balance.
"Nature made human life disposable. It’s about survival of the fittest + natural selection. When humans interfere + try to salvage + prolong everybody’s life, there will always be catastrophic consequences."
"Peoples actions influence others. I have seen so many people who have chosen to have kids bc their friend had kids or bc other people made the same choice. The more being childfree is normalised, the more others will start to follow suit. Humans are “monkey see, monkey do”."
"You are born a parasite + your body is also a host for many other types of parasites. When you die, the last left of your remains will be consumed by other parasites."
My Reddit feed is always filled with many posts like this makes me realise so many people continue living for their pets.
The need to procreate is a sign of fear + inferiority complex.
"Everybody leaves their mark on this planet in some way... if you minimise suffering, pain + harm to others, you conduct yourself well + try to be kind in a world where kindness is punished + cruelty is rewarded... you’ve lived to be a descent human being. That’s all that matters."
My ancestors have left their marks everywhere in the world... I don’t need to continue their legacy... I fail to live up to some of the great accomplishments.. they will always be remembered... they don’t need inferior carbon copies such as myself to ensure their legacy lives on.
"Aside from both being invaded by the US in lengthy imperialist wars, Afghanistan + Iraq both had one thing in common.. despite hardships endured by both nations they had growing populations with people having on average 3-4 children. It’s better to die fighting than breed more..."

I am as anti-imperialist as they get... but I don’t want to exist for the sake of my race to survive... my culture + people are mentioned in history books + have left their mark of existence everywhere... I’m tired of this legacy of war + turmoil. It’s time for my ppl to RIP.
"I was criticising how Palestinians in Palestine have many kids to my mother... my mum said to me, you know why they have kids, they need people to fight for their land.. then I said..  “Why would somebody consent to be born for nationalism to exist to die for someone else’s war?”"
You were once a child... remember those feelings of helplessness + that innocent naivety you once had that everybody exploited...   How can you look me straight in the eye with no shame + tell me another child wants to go through with that...
"Do you enjoy having to choose between being a slave + homelessness?   Do you enjoy experiencing misfortunes such as diseases + having doctors contribute to your suffering by extending your life?   Do you enjoy slaving your life away for a mediocre prize?   If no, don’t have kids."
"Do you enjoy having no free will?  Do you enjoy being a biological robot enslaved to debilitating impulses + desires?   Do you enjoy being screwed over + lied to + being inundated with propaganda designed to sabotage you?   If u answered no, to any of the above. Don’t procreate."

There is nothing worth fighting to live for or a legacy to leave behind if your existence is in this realm is only temporary. #Antinatalism
"To many ppl Israel is the lesser of two evils in comparison to a Muslim populous that is against their own interests. As much as I dislike imperialism in all forms, the only solution is to do nothing, let people destroy themselves + hope those left behind learn something from it."

"#Antinatalism often receives a reaction of hostility from people bc of those peoples own internal conflicts. They may appear to be triggered + they may get angry at you, but in reality encountering someone who is different to them forces them to face their own demons."
You can’t have your cake + eat it. The human experience is one that is painful + degrading. You can’t expect people to believe life is good + sacred while they allow those who continue to suffer to be continuously degraded until they die. Lies crack under the pressure of truth.
"All you need to do is go outside + take a look around + recognise that life is not good. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist or a genius to see we have been lied to our whole lives. Your ears + those who love you may deceive, but your eyes + reality will show you the truth."
I went to the laundromat to do my washing + these two missionaries were trying to harass me. I told them “do you want me to leave?” And I said I would if they do not leave me alone. Trying to forcefully proselytise people minding their own business will result in hostility.
"We have to keep spreading the word to people. No matter how hard we try to salvage what’s left of life + believe it’s good like they tell us, the facts + harsh reality speak for themselves. #Antinatalism"
I found out a major publicised double murder happened just around the block from where I live. I went to see the house. The lady that lives there say it feels eerie when she’s all alone.
"Society is a disease that will make you sick (both literally + figuratively). The only solution is quarantine, self-isolation + low contact. Being alone is the closest thing to nothingness. It gives you a sense of peace + healing most people won’t seem to understand."
A child destroys the solid foundation of any happy relationship. How ppl fail to recognise that + focus think a baby will complete their picture perfect little family is beyond me. Adoption is wholesome... plants + animals are less work + stress.
The best charity for any antinatalist is contributing financially or intellectually to spreading the message. Most charities are corrupt + promote prolonging the suffering + pain of the unfortunate.
Recognising your insignificance as a bacterium in the universal grand scheme of things + knowing you will one day be forgotten is another road that leads you to embrace #antinatalism. Focus on the people who are already alive to remember you right now. Who cares about the future.
Imagine a carbon copy of yourself that is a doll or action figure is given sentience + comes to life to haunt you as your own worst nightmare.. and then only people spared + shown mercy are those who leave the unborn forever in peace undisturbed. Another good AN themed storyline.
The prize rewarded to us by mother nature in the grand scheme of things is a mini me carbon copy of ourselves... the real winner knows the real prize is a bloodline that vanishes into a peaceful realm of nothingness...
My needs are unusual + non-conventional. I prioritise things differently to most neurotypicals + tend to value qualities most people do not seem to care for much. The road less travelled has always been my destiny... it’s lonely but I feel some level of contentment.
"It seems like 95% of my peers have married + had kids. I don’t envy them at all, but I wonder to myself at what point did I stray away from the life script + why does my path lead to more loneliness? I guess it’s the day I realised I don’t want to play the game anymore..."
"If I went blind tomorrow, I could recognise my parents + relatives clean clothing items easily from their scent. The best way to compare it is to going into a shop + spraying too many perfumes on your skin. U begin to confuse them. Too many ppl make me confused so I self-isolate."
"Being autistic, I lack part of the drive to breed. Part of it is sensory overload. I am hypersensitive w a highly developed sense of smell. Being sensorily overloaded with too many pheromones from too many people confuses my sensory system - pushing me further away from people."
Being shortsighted + living in the now is good sometimes. It becomes detrimental is when u hv poor impulse control + make life altering decisions u can’t unmake. Shortsightedness is part of grand scheme tht makes ppl procreate. Longsightedness is seeing all roads leading to death
"AN is stigmatised bc of the indigestible truths it offers ppl. Promoting AN to children needs to be gentle, lighthearted, humorous + focus on being a message of truth, liberty + an alternative to the life script. I would not want to burden a child w an echo chamber of negativity."
Anti-life script propaganda is the only solution to spread the message of #antinatalism to children. Children are slowly breaking free (you see that with zoomers choosing live-streaming games over a 9-5 office job).
The only time you can afford to be carefree is when you’re still a child. But that slowly dwindles away when grown ups dictate how you live your life. Society should be every child’s nightmare bc you go from being carefree to caring what everybody else thinks.
The 1st step towards #antinatalism is realism + acknowledging the basic facts + universal truth. That’s often the hardest step. It’s the 1st step towards some level of emancipation for you + the sentient lives of little ones u’ve spared the unnecessary burden of the meat grinder.
The only biological value you have is when the last of your remains becomes fertiliser for the crops.
"If all roads in life lead to death, then you’ll always be going nowhere in life. #antinatalism"
Death is the only real key + hope people have. There are no other guarantees or warranties promised by life. The hell many people endure when they are alive makes death a place of salvation + hope for them. #antinatalism
"I absolutely abhor the instagram algorithm for spamming my explore page with pictures of pregnant women, positive pregnancy tests + newborn babies. I need to find a way to block the stuff.. it infuriates me bc I have no interest or desire to have children or glamourise pregnancy."
"The justice system is a joke, bc our entire existence is built on a foundation of injustice that we are taught to embrace in various forms of Stockholm syndrome + trauma bonding. We perpetuate the cycle of injustice when we repeat the same abuse imposed on us by our parents."
"Lust is a parasitic impulse, breeders are the incubators + the hosts. We resemble larvae + once we are born, the whole entirety of our existence relies on being parasitic for the sustenance of our survival."
Pronatalist culture is social engineering. The antidote is to debunk the myths + destroy the social engineering. Brainwashing minds (clean) is the only way to break the cycle of life scripts.
I did 12 hours of studying + coming back to Twitter to publish antinatalist tweets was the only break I could have for the sake of my sanity...
If hellfire had a gateway it would be through the lustful desires that fuel the frustration in our genitals... #Antinatalism
The chambers + incubators of death lie therein between our legs... #Antinatalism
"Procreation is the antichrist wherein lies promises of eternal life (via your offspring)... and antinatalism is the salvationist saviour of mankind, Jesus Christ... where few people accept + embrace the ugly truth to safeguard the next generations (that won't come) of mankind."
The plantation where the next 70 decades of your enslavement begins as a lustful tadpole swimming into an incubator of death + destruction... 9 months later after your birth begins your demise. #Antinatalism
"Your existence is built on a web of lies perpetuated by your parents, govts + educators... all it takes is one person to ask the wrong questions for this web of lies to slowly unravel exposing with it, many ugly truths."
Life promises you the world (so they tell you) but guarantees you absolutely nothing except the fact that you will one day die. #Antinatalism
"Its finally starting to sink in how alienated I feel in comparison to my peers + other acquaintances who r all pronatalist breeders. It used to be one of my insecurities when I was younger, but now, its one more thing to add to the list of freedoms I hv tht many people don't hv."
"Society is a meat grinder + children r the fresh meat ready to be grounded. When u do not hv children, u no longer provide society with any sustenance besides the taxes you pay. Thats why society hates people who are childfree... they are starving the meat grinder of its prey."
"Children are instruments of gratification used as a (temporary but permanent) bandaid solution to satisfy a myriad of selfish, mindless, animalistic cravings that have no end. #Antinatalism"
"I come from a background of generational wealth from plantation owners from tradesmen + merchants. Even if I had inherited their wealth, I wud still be miserable + unhappy. No matter what cards I'm dealt, I wud choose non-existence over the lives of the wealthiest of the wealthy."
There are very wealthy people in the Middle East who remain single + childfree. I assume their relatives inherit their wealth or some have a charitable trust they use their wealth to finance. Generational wealth incentivises + pressures ppl to breed thats why I hate it.
"I have nothing against generational wealth. I come from quite a background of generational wealth on both sides of my family. My concern is when people feel they have to breed children to inherit their wealth. I was born Muslim, in Islam, adopted children cannot inherit wealth."
"House prices are out of control. Most young ppl can't afford them. The only ones who don't have to stress much about the rat race are children who will inherit property from their parents. Everybody else has to get a mortgage, make a bid + pray the offer they make wins the home."
"If there was no such thing as wealth ownership, we had no economic system in place + instead were born free to do as we please + live off the land, we could live like there's no tomorrow. We could live for ourselves + having to breed wouldn't be such a big deal to ppl anymore."
"If marriage + families were social constructs designed to pass on wealth from generation to generation... but they bring us misery.  Indigenous cultures believe we cannot own land, but we are custodians who safeguard it for future generations.   The latter makes more sense."
"As much as I dislike breeders, the more responsible ones knw better than to bring children into poverty. #Antinatalists + #childfree ppl pay price for their choice - they r ostracised + drift apart from the herd + eventually find friends who make similar life choices to them."
in a Western country costs about $250k from birth to 18 years old. The cycle of poverty is intergenerational + hard to break - few children become better off financially than their parents. Sexual desire + religion are traps to designed to destroy + enslave people.
"married + had kids. His twin brother copied him but luckily didn't have kids, but his marriages failed. Its better to masturbate, pay for sex or engage in hookup culture (provided you're safe) than to bring children into a world where they have to endure poverty. Having a child"
"As a person born into an Arab/Muslim family, I see so many young men who can't afford to get married, marry + have children bc of pressure from family, friends + religion. A friend of my brother's could not find a job in his field, works a minimum wage job for his dad + still got"
"Everything is predestined for a child before it's born. Most predestined outcomes are cruel, oppressive + repressive. #Antinatalism"
I have absolutely no sympathy or empathy for women who complain about fertility issues + miscarriages. They know bad this life can be + they spend their time seeking attention + sympathy from people to exploit the unborn to satisfy their selfishness + cruel desires. #Antinatalism
"""There is nothing to achieve in life, you are going to die. Change your definition of progress. Everything you do in life is progress."" - Raphael Samuel #Quote #Wisdom #Truth"
"There is no religion higher than the truth + #antinatalism is the truth of all truths - it can be seen, demonstrated + proven without any doubts whatsoever. I don't have a religion... but gnosticism resonates the most w/ me bc its the only religion that promotes #antinatalism."
"If children are taught #antinatalism from a young age + they learn to recognise they have been exploited + violated by adults, then they'll thick twice before repeating the same cycle. AN needs to infiltrate the psyches of the masses to ensure more ppl r saved from this hellhole."
"Progeny thrives on intergenerational indoctrination that pressures children to follow life scripts. A culture that glorifies parents thrives on stockholm syndrome, trauma bonding, narcissism enforced by a herd mentality is the root of all our suffering. #Antinatalism"
"Religion is one of the main driving forces behind life extension therapies, pro-life movements, denying the terminally ill (+ others the right to die). Religion is covertly controlled by the elite. Progeny thrives on intergenerational indoctrination of children. #Antinatalism"
"life can only be bearable is you can sit on your ass + do nothing while everybody is slaving away + waiting on you hand + foot. The powers that be can only maintain their place in the totem pole by convincing everybody life is good, they should breed + fear death."
"Notice how the only people who desire eternal life (at all costs) are the rich + powerful. People born into royal bloodlines + aristocracy, as well as your billionaires like Soros (who had 5 heart transplants go figure). These people try to convince everybody life is good bc..."
"Childhood = happiest yrs of life (to indoctrinate + teach enslavement)  Adolescence = best yrs of your life (unless u win the genetic lottery + r popular)  Adulthood = the world is your oyster (u start your slave job til you turn 65+  Golden yrs = dementia, incontinence + decline"
"People r afraid of #antinatalism bc of its deep + powerful truth. I influenced somebody to remain #childfree, they were against AN, bt I think somewhere deep down, they believe AN is the truth, the idea seems so radical to them, they can't embrace it w/o feeling like an outcast."
"Unless they support euthanasia, doctors r our enemies. Salvaging human life is extending period of suffering + pain. Life extension is a curse. Pandemics r nature's way of purging us when our population is out of control. Inability to accept + death is the root of all suffering."
I watched Nihil Anand's video lecture on #antinatalism. I really enjoyed it. I'm very happy that ANs in India are having these type of get togethers. I would love to do a presentation on AN some day.
"The thing I hate the most about imperialists is the fact they always leave behind spoils of war + traumatised native peoples to enslave, exploit + suffer. If land + resources are up for grabs, kill everybody, take everything, but they won't do it bc the joke is on them."
"Life in Gaza or any other place that is politically or economically unstable is more reason for ppl to refrain from having children. People who experience the worst that life has to offer, still breed children to experience the horror of war crimes for their own selfish reasons."
"My parents being Middle Eastern have been talking a lot about the tragedies in Gaza. I am internally conflicted on this topic. Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth, even with scarcity + political instability, people still breed like crazy."
"Idc, wht ppl say, I'll always hv tools w me to end my life, easily just like tht in an instant. Knowing a quick, easy + painless way to die is right under my bed where I can get to it, gives me a sense of peace, security + comfort. Otherwise, my mental state wud be far worse off."
"If ppl could exit life as easy as they enter it w/o enduring rites of passage that r unpleasant including ageing, disease, misfortune, degradation, degenerative diseases + terminal illnesses, then perhaps mental illness wud b far less common bc there's an easy accessible way out."
"Life is effortless to create when you have drive + desire (lust)... but you are denied the right to exit the oppressive realm of existence without the rites of passage called ageing, disease, misfortune + degradation."
"happily give my time, money + skills for. Among my ideas are AN story books for children, book geared towards teens + possible two small books for adults. If I can find the passion + drive to work on these projects, surely that's the only thing worth suffering for in this world."
"is too much for me. If I could afford to do it, I would be a Hikikomori for a while. I need to find some motivation to work on my books for antinatalism. I feel bad having loyal followers who like my work + then disappointing them. AN continues to grow + it is one cause I would"
"another 5 more due.. I managed to get back into writing for a bit + uploaded some more posts onto my blog. I'm sorry for my lack of response to comments, I may get back to that soon. I have realised that too much work gives me sensory overload... whether its work or study, 40 hrs"
"I would like to apologise to my loyal followers for worrying or causing anybody any form of unnecessary distress. My biggest stress has been my study + trying to come to terms with having to go back to work again. In this time off, I managed to complete 3 more assignments + I hv"
"I never expected I would find my way back to Twitter... For the past couple of weeks I have been struggling with my mental health + I had quite a few people intervene, so I decided if I do end my life in the future, I will just do it + not tell anybody anything about it."
I saw two praying mantises on my window making love... there’s gonna be a funeral tonight. The male will get killed by his lady tonight. The price of pussy always comes with death...
I have this strange dream I get into a long physical fight with a reality TV star + I actually win. Then this gangster girl takes over this place + I develop some type of relationship with her... my dreams are so weird + difficult to decipher/explain.
"If on average, you sleep away 1/3 of your life, that means the rest of the 2/3 you are in hell. Sleep is the gateway to heaven when life is hell."
If we could have a generic cause of death on a birth certificate it should be breeders. They are the universal cause of all deaths. #Antinatalism
Having a child for many people is like cloning yourself + basically having a brand new canvas to paint a picture of yourself. Instead of self-development breeders want to create another image of themselves bc it’s supposedly “easier” than unlearning old habits + learning new ones
"Reality TV is an opportunity for people who are nobodies to become famous almost overnight, obtain a following on social media + then become semi-retired doing sponsorships. Not always the best way to get famous."
"A normie who will always stick with me through thick + thin, who will accept me as I am, treat me with kindness + respect + try to understand me will always be far more superior to a High IQ person who will misunderstand, hurt, trigger + abandon me even if something is missing."
"While High IQ people fulfil my intellectual + autistic needs, I don't value them as much as I used to. Normies have stuck with me longer... while I can't enjoy my hobbies with them, they are less likely to trigger me + my relationships w them are healthier + more stable."
"I feel a bit guilty for being hard on normies... I finally updated my blog w my 31 Life Lessons... I want to write a post on why I appreciate normies. My relationships with most High IQ ppl are complicated. Meanwhile, I have maintained decade long relationships w normies."
I’m really loving this Moodily Daily Mood Tracking App to help me keep track of my mental health... my moods are mostly sad or meh.
"I despise multilevel marketing + marketing in general. A good product, good or service can sell itself. Word of mouth is still the most popular tool for marketing. Trying to sell things to consumers they don't want or need just makes you a pest + you irritate people."
"Addictions are a mechanism for our survival. This is why Prof. Sam Vaknin said we shouldn’t demonise addictions + instead accept them, bc there is a high recidivism rate among addicts (i.e. alcoholics)."
"I’m sceptical abt “mental health”... a mental health problem is a natural response to tht which compromises our safety, security + tht which is natural to us. If how society is constructed is against our nature, then tht makes mental health problems a natural response to ailments"
"I have a strange urge to listen to Eminem while doing my assignment. Nostalgia. I used to love Eminem growing up... Brings back so many memories from my adolescence. Damn, I feel old."
"When basic human rights + stating facts becomes blasphemous, you know that you have no real freedom of speech. Free speech means being able to discuss + challenge societal norms on taboo topics."
"Antinatalism is the ultimate form of blasphemy against blind progenitors + their extortion of the unborn from realms of peace, safety + eternal security."
"Questioning our existence + the role of our parents violating our peace is blasphemy. It’s just as bad as questioning God, if not worse. Anyone who challenges that which shall not ever be challenged is committing blasphemy + the punishment for blasphemy is being ostracised."
"The only ppl in life who can be happy r the intellectually disabled, the ignorant + uneducated w lack of critical thinking skills. If you have enough copes in life maybe you can find enough satisfaction to convince yourself you're happy, but deep down inside you know you're not."
Who in their right mind can be happy with being trapped in this cruel game of life run by nature knowing everything that happens in existence? It is extremely difficult for a person w a higher IQ to be happy bc they see the world through lens tainted in sadness.
One of the reasons I think I will remain single for life is bc I am impossible to please. I find it v difficult to be happy in life. Happiness = full control + perfection + adhering to unrealistic standards. No one can make me happy + I don't want anyone to feel guilty abt that.
"folklore, superstition + belief in the paranormal as well as in all kinds of entities. I'll always acknowledge that + not dismiss it entirely. Some things u learn from childhood will always be part of u + trying to unlearn, erase, challenge or refine those beliefs is challenging."
"Even though I find myself agnostic more than anything at this stage. I cannot fully embrace being an atheist bc I find it hard to break free from believing in a God, psychologically, I like to feel watched over + protected by someone/something. My native culture has a lot of"
"to balance the two. Your sanity is always under scrutiny + yr psychiatrist assumes u have some form of schizophrenia. A shaman validates the experience w the paranormal without scrutinising your sanity. Insanity exists to some extent, but the paranormal has some truth to it too."
One of the biggest challenges I experience is balancing what many people call paranormal superstitions with modern day psychiatry. When you are raised to believe in entities + your native culture has entire folklore based on real life stories people have experienced its hard
With housing shortages everywhere + since we have spiritual cleansing rituals to remove entities + we also have exorcisms for demonic possession... a suicide or murder in a property is still one of the fastest ways for the value of real estate to decline.
"My mother was telling me I probably get irritable bc even in the cold weather, I still sleep with a fan on. I like to be covered in many layers of blankets to feel comfortable... this makes me get hot + sweaty, so I need a fan to balance everything out."
"Humans have to degrade one another to feel alive + to forget the vile, disgusting cesspool of parasitic infested filth they are. #Misanthropy"
"Despite all of this, we claim divine dominion over all other life forms + we claim a status of superiority to other entities. Humans r conceived in an undignified animalistic manner  thru bodily secretions from rotting corpses in lust + we die in a cesspool of our own excrement."
Being human being is an undignified experience. Our bodily secretions + excrements are degrading enough. Having no freewill means we are slaves to our biological + physiological responses. Having to pay to be alive means we are slaves to a monetary system.
"There are three gateways to a world of peace... through solitude, through sleep + through death."
"Such people are low class, unrefined, disrespectful + people you cannot help but dislike. People who leave you alone + give you that space + know when to reach out to you, are those worth keeping in your circle of friends."
"Solitude + salvaging ones dignity are intrinsically linked. When you have fallen from grace or you are riddled with misfortunes, you retain your dignity by isolating yourself. The people I have low tolerance for are those who violate this solitude for their own narcissism."
"When you’re forced to do things... somewhere down the line, you start to burn out."
"“Mental suicide is worse than physical suicide. In physical suicide, you die once. In mental suicide, you die every minute, of every hour of everyday.” - Prof. Sam Vaknin"
"At some point in my life, I used to have drive, motivation, strength, a strong work ethic + a desire to succeed + take on the world. Somewhere down the line, my depression got worse, my nihilism got stronger + all my desire evaporated into thin air. Now I’m a wake walking corpse."
The company. Basic tasks are a huge effort for me. I’m doing okay in my studies but I hv no motivation or enthusiasm at this point. I detest the fact I hv to work when functioning normally is challenging for me. I can’t sustain forcing myself to do things for the rest of my life.
"Their reputation. If you have been unfairly dismissed, some employers will ask for a reference from your last employer + want to know why you were dismissed. Once you disclose that information, it becomes harder for you to be employed bc hiring you is considered a liability to"
"One of the reasons I hate my existence is bc I have to work. I know what workplaces are like. You have to tolerate all kinds of abuse + even if you take your employer for a personal grievance + you win, they refuse to go to court or mediation, they pay u out the money to protect"
"A conversation about God with me is like trying to talking to me about a subject I’m completely disinterested + indifferent to. I am indifferent to Gods + religion in general, but I become intolerant when my I’m pushed beyond my limits to accept a religious narrative."
"My mother gets mad if I engage in any form of blasphemy. I told her, if she didn’t constantly make every conversation we had about God, I wouldn’t even think to take God’s name in vain, or commit any blasphemy."
The God that punishes people for worshipping other deities is extremely insecure. A God that thrives on micromanaging the lives of insignificant irrelevant beings (like us) is far from a real God. A real God doesn’t care who ppl worship + doesn’t desire to micromanage his slaves.
"It never ceases to amaze me, that we wear white wedding dresses + black clothes for funerals... all taken from Queen Victoria. In many cultures, white is the colour for funerals + wedding dresses are expected to be colourful. Most people blindly follow + are oblivious to this."
Social media is the ultimate incarnation of existential escapism everybody seems to deny.
"Everything in my life feels so forced. I want to do something bc I want to do it, not bc I have to do it. Life is forced onto me + carrying on with life is also forced. I want to be able to do things bc they come naturally to me. I despise everything I have become bc of coercion."
“I hope you find happiness”... those words seem to trigger me so much bc I have heard them so many times from so many different people who have tried to make me happy in this life. I feel a sense of guilt + shame for disappointing them. It really makes me hate myself...
"The elite seem to always promote ideologies where people are automatically born into privilege based on their physical appearance, wealth + status, most of which are things they didn’t work for. This is why we despise them bc we spend our lifetimes working for nothing."
"If mothers are made in the image of nature, that makes mothers who birth children into this world sadistic psychopaths. Women who adopt, foster or care for plants + animals instead r at least trying to help those already plagued with the burden of existence."
"Men hv higher standards for women bc men project angelic qualities onto women + bc women have the burden of motherhood, they are expected to represent virtue + wholesomeness. The truth is.. we aren’t always angels + some of us do not want to create another generation of children."
If I don’t think you have anything of substance to offer the world (and I think few people in this world have substance):   - Nothing you do will ever make me like you - I prefer my time alone to being with you - I won’t even acknowledge your existence - I expect nothing from you
My boundaries:  - Don’t speak unless spoken to - Prefer machines to people - Prefer to do things alone - Like to keep my life private - Hate small talk + nosy ppl - Prefer to be left ignored - Don’t show interest in me unless it’s genuine + we actually have something in common.
"“You can never hate someone who makes you laugh” ... it’s so true. You can despise them as a person, but if they can make you laugh, you can never hate them."
Am I the only one who likes to go shopping + do trips alone so I can quickly grab what I need from a store + quickly get out? I dislike going out with my bro + one of my friends bc they like to take their time to browse. I think being in public places triggers my social anxiety.
"Part of me doesn’t want to commit suicide bc I still have some part of resilience in me to fight, a small sliver of hope that I can pull through. Another part of me is ready to give up + just leave. It’s hard to decide. I need a catalyst + a strong driving force to decide."
"If I could invent a machine to cope with my existence, I would invent a machine that would take my consciousness into pure euphoria, followed by rest, recuperation + motivation to do my best in life + get things done. Nothing I have found seems to erase the pain of existence."
"The countries that need more antinatalism + childfree people... It’s fortunate there are antinatalists from some of these countries, but the overwhelming majority are religious or have some pronatalist culture that encourages procreation."
"We are a parasitic cancer on this planet, but we are too blind to see it. It’s almost like everyone who pops out another human deserves a trophy for doing so. It’s worse than a certificate of participation."
Avocado on toast is 😍😍😍. I wouldn’t pay $20 for it... but it is underrated + really good.
"You gotta have some level of respect for someone who has a strong work ethic, studied hard to obtain a higher credential + has experience in their field. Unless they are arrogant + an asshole.. they should motivate u to work harder, develop urself or accept they r better than you"
"Actual psychiatrists, bc every psychiatrist we have is an Indian man. Some people who think high of themselves resent working under people they perceive as being beneath them. Sometimes people resent working under people of colour. Regardless of what race or colour a person maybe"
So my brother has this psychiatric nurse he hates who claims to have the same scope as a psychiatrist but can’t prescribe anything for psychosis or hallucinations. She doesn’t want to help my brother bc if she makes a mistake she could lose her job. She doesn’t want to consult
Being fake is exhausting bc you have to constantly maintain a facade in front of people... when that facade starts to crumble that’s the real you... but in today’s world we call it a “mental health crisis”.
Every 3 seconds someone gives birth somewhere in the world. Every 40 seconds somewhere in the world someone commits suicide... the statistics in this world are really disturbing...
“Severe major depression is probably most unbearable pain a human being can withstand for any protracted period of time. Many people who died of cancer have written eloquently about how the crushing pain from their tumors paled in comparison to the pain they felt when depressed.”
Apparently men can still have erections after they die + women can also give birth if they are pregnant. It troubles me to think that breeders are comfortable imposing this type of fate on all of their offspring. Every soul shall taste death... there’s no escaping it.
"While you decompose + your corpse is infested with maggots, parasites + other tiny creatures that will eat the last remains of you away... even when we die, our bodies still betray us, reminding us of who/what we truly are."
"Finding the courage to commit suicide is all abt learning to take a step, close your eyes, take a deep breath + just do it... that’s it, there’s no going back, you’ll be medically dead, biologically dead, your muscles will relax + you’ll shit yourself + smell worse than 5 sewers"
We really are parasites. #Antinatalism
No amount of trying to glamourise pregnancy will ever make me want to join the cult. I struggle to carry on living another day... everyday of life is another day of hell for me. I don’t need to pass on my sexually transmitted existential crap onto someone else. It’s just cruel.
"I’m sick + tired of my Instagram account suggested images being saturated with pregnant women, posts on natal care etc... I follow a lot of antinatalist accounts on Instagram + despite this everything is still saturated with images glorify pregnancy + childbearing."
"For me... acting up at school was my cry for help. I was suffering at school + at home... all I wanted was to get away from it all. Even back then, I fantasised about my own death + used to write suicidal poetry in class."
"My friend told me his son was caught w a vape at school + might get suspended. I wasn’t expecting that, his son is a sweetheart. When I was 12-13, I was up to no good.. ditched school, almost got kicked out + got caught smoking at school. Going to school in Asia was better for me"
Im so tired today.. asked for another extension on my assignment. Passed two assignments I did with a B+ and B. Had my free insurance eye exam + found out I won’t need glasses for another 5 or so years. Took my brother to see the movie Ascendant - I can’t wait to go home + sleep.
Things I don’t want in life:  - Children - Friends - Religion - Relationships - Dead end job - Longevity - Socialising - 10 year + mortgage - Television - Lack of authenticity
"My body will only terrorise me once a month w a menstrual cycle which is a price I’m willing to pay. No matter how much trouble my lady bits put me in, nothing justifies destroying my womanhood to pop out a child. The female anatomy is the gateway + incinerator that leads to hell"
- People who pretend to be interested in me just to find out things about me when I don’t even care to disclose anything to them or to socialise with them. - People who try to change me for the “better”.
"My biggest pet peeves are:  - People who pretend to be my friend thinking I care about them when I find my wallpaper more interesting than them.  - People who deliberately violate my asocial, unfriendly + autistic boundaries by trying to “socialise with me”."
"The fastest way to become a misanthrope is to binge watch a bunch of real life crime murder stories. The way some ppl brutally murder people in cold blood with no guilt, conscience + remorse shows you what human nature really is. The funny part is when they try to plea insanity."
"My favourite pick-me-up when I need a boost of energy + some motivation for work or study is always a large BP Mochachino with marshmallows. It sounds like a sugar cocktail, but that’s one way to reenergise + motivate me to keep going until I finish what needs to be done."
"like there is a way out. Making a plan, buying paraphernalia + preparing for your last days is another cope. Its almost like selling yourself an illusion that everything will be okay even when it doesn't feel like it. For me its a protection mechanism."
"bit angry with me. I also realised how much I enjoy reading books on my kindle. But I bought so many in print. I feel a sense of safety + security knowing when I can no longer tolerate distress there is a way out for me. Sometimes its not about suicide itself, but its feeling"
"I purchased a suicide book on my kindle + spent a lot of money on items for my death. Then I messaged my keyworker + told him I was feeling suicidal. He asked me to come to the CMH office + maybe see the doctor + get some meds, I told him I will be fine + postponed it. He got a"
"There is absolutely no benefit for a child to exist. Their existence is everybody else's gain + their suffering comes at the sadistic cost of somebody else's selfish desire + satisfaction. Children have nothing to gain when they exist, and everything to lose. #Antinatalism"
"The ppl who benefit from children r:   - Parents - Govt - Society - Pedophiles - Religious institutions - Rich + powerful corporate slave masters - Professionals w careers focused on children (teachers, psychologists, caregivers)  Children hv nothing to gain from these entities."
"People should do a cost/benefit analysis before deciding to have children. Even w that, the cost of having children far outweighs the benefits of having children... the ones who carry the real burden r the children + there is absolutely no benefit for them. #ChildFree"
"A pronatalist breeder society dehumanises, oppresses, objectifies, abuses, coerces + fetishises children for selfish gains + personal gratification. #Antinatalism"
I just received a lovely parcel from one of my best friends from overseas for my birthday. I have great friends... my family isn’t too bad. These little things make me feel guilty about being suicidal. But what other choice do I have? I think I need so much just to endure life.
"People think about robbing banks. If I had superpowers to be invisible I would rob a veterinary clinic. I’d steal their Nembutal. It’s the only valuable thing in this world that is worth committing petty crime for... nothing else brings any happiness, peace or joy to me."
High functioning autistic people also have very high suicide rates bc they feel they have no place in this world + they get frustrated having to constantly change + adapt to a neurotypical world.
"I’m interested to know how much of my depression is psychological + how much of it is autism? About 75% of high functioning autists r unemployed, single + live quite isolated. Even ones with high IQ, able to hold down jobs burn out at some stage. Maybe my peak was in high school."
"If science acknowledges natural selection as part of our biological existence, why is it so hard for pronatalist, prolife people to accept that depressed, suicidal + unhappy people were not meant to pass on their genes + had ways in the past of discontinuing their existence."
Most people are terrified of non-existence + nothingness. That is why they need to be bribed by a fictitious deity with a superficial heaven. The creators of organised religions failed to consider those who do not want that kind of heaven + understand non-existence is peace.
Depression isolates people from their loved ones. Many people fall out of love with their partners who appear to become lazy with no goals or aspirations in life. I have nothing left in me to inspire anyone... so being locked up alone with limited engagement with ppl makes sense.
"If I’m honest, the only reasons I think I ever studied or entered workforce was my fear of not following herd. I am a strong non-conformist, but I also crave a sense of achievement + accomplishment... All I know now is how much I hate myself + this world, I don’t want to be here."
"Keyworker tomorrow + talk to him. There is no way out for me... I can’t envision myself enjoying my hobbies, time with my friends, a career, a relationship or achieving anymore milestones or rites of passage into adulthood. I wish I could change but my case is hopeless."
"Things. I know I talk about suicide all the time, but I think maybe it’s my time to go. I don’t want to be a burden on anybody... Nothing about life really excites me. I can barely take care of myself... maybe it’s my time to go? Nothing else seems to help. I might call my"
"I decided to study something different so I can start a new career not bc I want to, but bc I refuse to go back to a dead end job I hate working with low IQ people who have accomplished nothing of substance in life. I am not sure how much longer I can sustain forcing myself to do"
"For the past 6 months (maybe even longer), I have been feeling suicidal. I can literally sit all day in bed just watching YouTube or rewatching South Park. I find it hard to function everyday in my normal day-to-day life + I absolutely despise laziness + lack of productivity."
"""Patience is a powerful tool for success."" – Aristotle #Quote"
"My cat is very terrified of going to the vet. He cries when he is in the cage, in the car on the way to the vet. But for some reason, he is calm, relaxed and comfortable around the vets we have taken him to. I think it is their energy. Animals are more intuitive than humans."
"People take vets for granted. I have heard many stories of people who are rough with animals. I have been lucky to have had very compassionate, kind + gentle vets who have been very good to my cat. Some people naturally have a magnetism that makes animals feel safe + comfortable."
"Life feels like an overrated amusement park ride that is both lengthy, horrific + a nuisance. If I can use one word to sum up what I think of life, I would say it is “waste”. Life and waste are synonymous with each other."
I have read almost every antinatalist book out there... but I found some new books I still need to read. Still want to read Cioran too.
"Something very nice... I’ve been spoiled by my family. Got a chocolate cake. I took my brother to Wendy’s.. might get my nails done + go home... have a break, clean up + start actually working on my assignment I asked an extension for 😑. I’ll take my bro to the movies next week."
"My brother gave me a large amount of money for my birthday... I feel bad accepting it. He told me it was unconditional, with no strings attached + I can’t return some of it. So I promised when I finish my qualification + start working, I’ll let him come stay with me + get him"
"I'm 31 today. Every year, I have this tradition where I write abt life lessons I've learnt. Some lessons may contradict others I've acknowledged. It's hard to celebrate life when all u want to do is die..I didn't think I'd make it this far, bt for whatever reason, I'm still here."
My new obsession has been with real life crime storytelling channels. It seems so many murderers + serial killers plead insanity or are diagnosed by psychiatrists with some form of schizophrenia. As a person with a history of schizophrenic symptoms it terrifies me a little...
I'm on the fence about whether monarchies should be abolished to become republics or not. My mother also pointed out to me politicians in republic countries are also money hungry megalomaniacs who pursue intergenerational careers in politics.
I couldn't care less abt the death of Prince Philip. I have never really been a fan of the royal family. I see them as untouchable criminals with a status symbol who are nothing bt moochers off of British taxpayers + common wealth countries. I'm not a fan of hierarchy in general.
RIP DMX... I love your music... death is better than suffering in vegetative state forever. You will never be forgotten.🌹
I absolutely despise sensationalised tabloids. It only appeals to lowlifes + people with low IQs who have nothing better to do than follow people around who they deem to be status symbols assuming we would all worship the ground they walk on too.
"There are real-life journalists who have integrity, honesty + good research, writing + news reporting skills... then there's failed so-called journalists who need to sensationalise everything + create drama + bullshit for a tabloid assuming that's newsworthy."
I’d rather end up a dead clump of human waste (sperm/egg cells) than become a full functioning sentient human being. #antinatalism
"I hate when things like this happen bc then I don’t feel like ending my life all of a sudden... damn. If I actually end up passing this qualification + actually end up relatively okay at a high paying job, I will be so shocked. Sometimes I feel like I just wanna quit right ahead."
"I have been feeling v suicidal + blue as usual... I asked for an extension on my assignment + the assignment I was extremely worried I had failed, I got an A- on. I’m in shock. I was not expecting to get 80% bc I struggled so much with it + could barely understand it..."
Children are nothing but a transactional bargaining chip for both men + women to get what they want. Children enable men to get access to pussy from women + women to gain access to resources from men. The child is nothing but a commodity exploited by both for selfish gain.
"As weird as it sounds, I’m actually enjoying doing basic maths in unit conversions for construction. As someone who hated maths in my adolescence, I’m finding myself enjoying it ☺️ weirdly enough."
"My psychiatrist prescribed me 60 10mg Ritalin tablets almost a month ago. I have only taken about 17 of them. I take them as needed. Not consistently. I have found them to be helpful at times, but when my depression is really bad, I can take one tablet + still sleep like nothing."
"I cannot stress enough how important it is to use a night mask a few times a week + hydrating face masks when you can. As you get older, your skin needs more hydration. Face masks + drinking lots of water become your holy grail. I’ve found Korean face masks to be among the best."
Society’s parasites only continue to function by preaching self-destructive dogma like:  - forgiveness - turn the other cheek - righteousness  You can’t have FairPlay when the whole entire game of life is rigged.
"Society has only ever continued to exist + thrive by convincing children that their parents have done them a favour by bringing them into existence + telling them they owe them something for it. Only blind, ignorant people who can’t think freely never question this bullshit."
"The first step to justice is telling the truth. That is why so many ppl hate free speech. If u r denied the right to free speech, u r allowed to lie + spew propaganda endlessly. The truth will set you free + being denied free is speech is being denied the right to tell the truth."
"The first step of taking away parents leverage over their children is by acknowledging life sucks, life is a coerced, unwanted imposition by parents + a burden... then watch all the rights parents have rightfully return to the children."
"Life is like being pressured to go on a roller coaster ride for a cynical person with severe motion sickness...  you hop on with reluctance, you feel queasy the whole time + the end result is puking everywhere."
Procreation = kidnapping someone with your genetic material from the realm of non-existence + forcefully holding them as a hostage long after your death. #antinatalism
"Best pick me up for self care - jacuzzi with magnesium salts, bath bombs, a dash of 4711 cologne... + face masks, skincare routine + body scrub to exfoliate...  a great way to relax, study + get started on a project."
It’s strange but not surprising that designer brands like Hugo Boss + Chanel have ties to the Nazis.
"One of my best friends gifted me a clock radio + it’s definitely one of the best gifts I’ve ever received. I usually prefer intellectual podcasts, but sometimes I do miss listening to FM radio, especially in workplaces. It’s also nice to plug my Walkman to a stereo system too."
It’s hard for me to value human life when I realise how cruel nature is + how disposable we are in this sadistic game of randomness + uncertainty.
Stockholm Syndrome is an evolutionary survival mechanism. The parent-child relationship is the archetype of such relationship. Nature sacrifices us (as the future) for a game where we are losers no matter the outcome.
I strongly recommend the app moodily for tracking moods daily. It’s free + great for keeping track of your moods if you have bipolar disorder or any other mental illness.

Happy Autism Awareness Day - I hope more neurotypicals will become more tolerant + accepting of non-neurotypicals. I was diagnosed at age 30. I have struggled social interactions with people my whole life. I refuse to change myself for other people.
"I was hanging my clothes on the line + my cat + I hear the sound of a creature in mum’s parsley. My cat chases him, I c this terrified mouse running around. He hides behind the garden shed + my cat tries to get in but he’s too big. My cat is waiting to feast on him. What a show."
"Life is a game of selfishness, denial + gaslighting people so they constantly have to validate you bc you are uncomfortable + afraid of the truth."
"As much as I hate birthdays... Happy Birthday to one of my best friends.. Ppl like u make this world tolerable. I wish u a year of happiness, prosperity, fortune + good health. Thank u for taking care of me + showing me a few good things about this world I can sort of live for ❤️"
And to make sure you pass it onto some non-consenting victim before you rot away...
"Scandinavian countries were incentivising procreation by offering govt paid honeymoons + travel abroad so people would breed more. Either way, society will always find a way to punish childfree people."
Imagine if more millennials + zoomers decided to not procreate. Our govts would be outraged. I think some of them will even punish us by imposing an extra tax on people who r childfree by choice. A few some countries previously imposed bachelor/ette taxes on single childfree ppl.
"Today I finished my assignment + submitted it. Then I realised last week I didn't upload last week's assignment correctly, so I emailed my lecturer + to apply for a special consideration. I'll make sure to double check again. It was so stressful... now I hv one more due next week"
"A world ruled by mindlessness, Replicating existence of hell, Consumed by flesh + lust, Driven by purposelessness, Mass consumption + whoredom, Asskissing + bootlicking to reach an egotistic pyramid of loneliness, There lies nothing only flesh crushing meat grinding claws to kill"
"The darkness is light, Tainted in delusions,  Forced to fight, Shackles of enslavement, Remain out of sight,  Empires built on sand, With us perish into dust,  For immortality they lust,  Forever punishing generations, Needless suffering for nothingness Peace comes when we cease"
I can’t help but think many unborns would do the same.
"Breeders remind me of people trying to disturb deceased spirits by trying to contact them via Ouija board. My mum’s cousin did that + a bucket full of dirty water fell onto her head + she heard a voice scream “we are dead, won’t you fucking leave us alone”..."
"Being born is a v traumatic experience. You go from being safe in the womb, to crying + screaming constantly. Its not surprising many people find baths + swimming quite self-soothing. Bc being surrounded by water in a foetal position is safe default mode. Baths sooth my senses."
"We live in a world where people project + advocate ""rights"" for non-sentient foetuses to not be aborted, yet in the same universe, we prohibit those who want to end their lives safely from the right to do so."
"The human experience is all about one generation inheriting the burden of existence of another. Besides genes, the only thing parents are guaranteed to leave behind for their offspring is the same existential burden their predecessors once had. #Antinatalism"
"I went out to buy some oud essential oil + a candle today, then went to therapy, my friend called me + we talked for a bit. I finished almost half my assignment.. will take a long break + try to finish + submit it. Then I need to start more coursework to prep for next assignment."
"In a few days time, it will be Easter. The pagan festival that celebrates fertility as a gift + a blessing. In many ways, I am a pagan to some extent, but to me, fertility will always be a burden to bare + a curse I have carried over with the burden of existence."
"I will always validate peoples concerns about life/existence. At least, I have enough intellectual honesty to tell them the truth rather than gaslight them like the rest of society."
"I am against gaslighting ppl. Yes, I will not shatter people's delusions abt life if they genuinely believe life is good... but if asked to provide honest + truthful opinions abt how I c life, I will tell ppl the truth + they will always have a safe space by me to be listened to."
"Society gaslights everybody about life + existence. Labelling somebody who acknowledges life for what it truly is as mentally ill is gaslighting. Along with the ""gift"" of life comes psychological abuse towards those ungrateful for the ""so-called"" gift. #Antinatalism"
"I feel ashamed to burden people with my troubles, even those I love who I consider very close to me. Yet breeders have no shame creating other humans to bare their burdens. #Antinatalism"
"Living with existential burden is a lifelong challenge imposed on us solely by breeders who are unable to deal with this challenge, so they constantly outsource non-consenting parties to meet those needs who eternally bare burdens. #Antinatalism"
"My plan going forward is to try + find self-help books that deal existential-nihilism + accepting existence, trying to enjoy what I can of it + moving forward. Nothing motivates me in life when I feel this way. Few ppl in my life understand existential dread I experience everyday"
I finished my last session of group therapy today. We had to fill out a plan for our goals moving forward. My depression + dysregulation are strongly correlated with my existentialism. I cannot seem to make peace with the fact I exist in a world I absolutely hate.
"It takes a lot of effort to resist the urge to procreate, most people end up giving into it when they meet the right partner. Procreation is about following the herd — which is why it doesn’t deserve as much praise as refraining from it. #antinatalism"
manager + he actually gets it back. My parents are so embarrassed 😂😂😂. I would have considered it water under the bridge + just let it go but my brother is the type of person who never forgets...
"My brother is funny... 5 years ago, my brother guessed the amount of lollies in a lollie jar + won the prize. His carer took the jar + kept it for himself. 5 years later my brother writes 2 emails to his rep in the ministry asking for his jolly jar back + his rep emails the..."
"I don't know why I found it so hilarious. ""The way to a father-in-law's heart is through a Rolex watch"" - it is so original + classic."
My friend's father sent my friend's sister a letter complaining abt how my friend's sister's husband was a gold-digger after their family fortune (when he chose him for her - it was an arranged marriage) + in the letter he complained about how one son-in-law got his F-I-L a Rolex
"of my existence - the material makes life more tolerable + provides an escapism from the hell I experience on a day-to-day basis. I will continue keeping all my interpersonal relationships cordial for ""stability"". Maybe I will find passion + pleasure in my hobbies again."
"Therapy has given me better regulation skills + has taught me how to enter into a ""wise mind"" state. But therapy hasn't fixed my existential nihilism. Since I do not have a partner or children, I hv no other choice but to indulge + make material + finer luxuries the focus/purpose"
"the autism. I am very flat, cold + distant. I will try my best to utilise + apply the skills I have learnt + I will reference my book of modules given to me by my therapists. Therapy is the only social interaction I have outside of my family bc I study online + don't work."
"My experiences are not as intense as the ppl in my group. Almost every session, somebody has to cry or is triggered or upset over something. I cannot relate bc I have the quiet type of BPD. I seem more regulated than most people, I look stable + appear more normal... maybe thats"
Tomorrow is my last day of group therapy. I am gonna miss my group - then I'll have to meet with my therapists to see where to go next. I might do a full on DBT therapy.. last year I was considering residential treatment for BPD bc my moods were straining my relationship w my ex.

"No amount of skyscrapers, luxury items + glossy images can hide the dark + tragically painful side of our existence. We can fool ourselves into believing we have escaped the horror, but things are very far from that."
"As unpleasant as menstruation can be for women, it’s a very unpleasant celebration that reminds us of another cell in our body that has been spared the burden of existence."
"The only way I can ever envision myself being happy in this world, aside from being dead, is if I could be brainwashed into believing life is good + if someone decided to knock me out so I hv enough of a concussion to kill some of my brain cells enough to believe my own bullshit."
Progenitors dump their mediocre genes into a cum-dumpster world that is a literal shit-hole where they need to clone themselves to feel like their lives mean something. It’s pathetic. #Antinatalism
Having offspring in this world is like dumping a part of yourself into a cum-dumper of a hellish eternity. #Antinatalism
Breeders are the ultimate cowards + their biggest fear in life is realising their own insignificance + morality. #Antinatalism
Breeders are the kings + queens of peer pressure + weaponising ostracism to control others. My parents like many weren’t a 100% keen on children but had them more so to fit in bc of peer pressure from pronatalist breeder cult-ures. #Antinatalism
"One of my most unpleasant experiences is motion sickness. As much as I love boats/ships, I can’t enjoy them. I end up getting very sick afterwards. Long drives also trigger my motion sickness + travel on planes. My worst cases were on this one flight + on this boat trip 🤢."
“Life is a very sadistic horror game.” - Inmendham #Antinatalism
How does somebody go from being an agnostic-atheist to an Judeo-Christian theist? How can somebody wholeheartedly believe in the Abrahamic religions - are they void of any logic? It makes no sense to me.
things just keep getting worse everywhere. The thing which shocked me the most is how there are million dollar properties in third world countries that are war torn bc of housing shortages. Even in shit hole places (i.e. my parents home country) housing is still very expensive.
"the West is almost a joke bc you have to pay council rates til the day you die, whereas in second + third world countries, once you buy a property all you have to pay for is services like rubbish collection etc which are relatively cheap. I would love to see the bubble burst bc"
"The real problem behind housing shortages, aside frm the gap between the rich + the poor, is population growth + UN Agenda 21 + Agenda 30 which basically want people to live in crowded smart cities, in apartment complexes kind of like Soviet style communism. Property ownership in"
"Singapore had the best solution in terms of housing - there is a price cap on property, all apartments r ethnically diverse to prevent sectarianism + you cannot  easily buy multiple investment properties. Other countries in the West didn't think far ahead + we have this problem."
countries where buying a home is a dream now. Many houses here get multiple offers + the highest offer gets the house + most homes purchased are 5th + 6th homes that are investment properties - many of whom are either purchased by baby boomers with a lot of money or foreigners.
"I watched this documentary on China's housing crisis last night. It was about how there are many apartments + houses that are empty bc homeownership rates are so high, since Chinese people are good savers + invest in property. It's strange when you see the paradox in other"
"Your other child orphaned + you still want another one. Life isn’t worth it... it seems like loving life is a spell cast on many people, but I’m immune to it. Sometimes I wish I could see life as a special gift that is good, but all I see is darkness, sorrow + pain."
"Surprised me. I really don’t know what to say.. I don’t c life as anything good, even when you’re a good person in life, you still suffer + have shit thrown at you. The sad part is having a child assuming they will enjoy life too... then you have a chance of dying early + leaving"
"An ex-colleague’s daughter got cancer + had to begin treatment right away. She talked about not being able to freeze her eggs to give her son a brother or sister... She seemed to really love life + she seems to always be happy + smiling, she was also very fit + healthy which..."
"I finally submitted my dreadful assignment. I have a strong feeling I will probably fail, but this will teach me to make sure I take studying full time seriously. I need to really study hard, review assignments weeks before they are due + keep in touch with my lecturers."
That’s the only reason why it’s good 😋
The hardest essay topic anyone can ever give me to write about is “Why life is good” or “Why I should procreate”... I only have a million reasons to explain why life isn’t good + why I’ll never impose it on anybody by force against their will.
"No amount of propaganda or indoctrination from pronatalist organised religion, parents, society or friends cud ever convince me life is a wonderful miracle + gift I should be eternally grateful for.. nor cud any of these entities convince me to impose it on others. #Antinatalism"
"Existence is part + parcel of our enslavement, that is why we are indoctrinated to believe life is a sacred gift we all should be thankful for. #Antinatalism"
Only a narcissist believes in procreation (life) being a miracle. #Antinatalism
"Procreation is a biological function that can only be tamed with self-control, self-awareness, logic, basic observation of our surroundings + basic ethics. Yet most people seem oblivious to those things."
"Replication of our species is absolutely abhorrent bc nothing about our species is worth replicating. The fact we believe otherwise, despite our consciousness + awareness of our own self-destructiveness shows how blind, stupid + egotistical we really are. #Antinatalism"
"Procreation is like having an appendix, just bc it’s there in our bodies, it doesn’t mean it has much use. An appendix bursting inside ones body is the equivalent of pregnancy + giving birth. #Antinatalism"
"It’s hard to do anything in life when you barely even want to live. The answer is desiring to live in life.. but if you have never desired life, then what’s the point of fighting for something you never wanted in the first place. It’s times likes these, I really want out of here."
I have absolutely no idea wtf I’m doing with my assignment. I don’t quite understand what the assessor is requesting from their choice of language required. I’m just going to submit any bullshit I can complete in a short span + hope to God I pass.
That quote is classic! 😂 #Antinatalism

Taking our fertility into our own hands is the most important ethical decision of our lives. #Antinatalism
"Getting pregnant is the worst nightmare for most people unless they weaponise it for their own gain. Pregnancy + procreation are never a good thing, even for breeders who become accidentally pregnant."
"It’s weird, bc I hv been celibate for well over a decade. I’d never try to baby trap someone. My parents wud disown me if I got pregnant IRL outside of wedlock. Thank goodness it was a dream. Id rather die than ever get pregnant, in my life. This makes me wanna run for the hills."
"I had this dream I fell pregnant + became a solo mother + I didn’t know who the father was, like I got pregnant but the father was not in the picture. Becoming a mother to a little girl was so exhausting + my parents somehow supported me. And I felt like the ultimate hypocrite."
Don’t people who use Tinder or OnlyFans worry about their safety? There are stories of international organ traffickers who use attractive handsome men to lure women to meet them only for them to be dismembered. Trusting people is actually terrifying + some ppl are too naive.

Children are instruments of gratification for their parents. They will always be tools used + abused by their legal guardians. As long as we live in such a world..I will always hate being part of this world.
"When a parent values narcissistic supply over their own children, that parent is a nasty POS. The ones who are even worse are those who have children for lifelong narcissistic supply."
"As a parent, if you act in your own best interests, against the interests of your children + then life with them becomes insufferable, it’s your fault. As long as you put your own selfish needs before theirs, you deserve no sympathy."
"Getting really mad. If anything happens to my brother, I will call them out on what they did to screw him over. This entire world that we live in is designed to screw people over and then perpetrators scream victimhood + everyone showers them with toxic sympathy + attention."
"I outright told him, Old Boys Clubs are intergenerational + exclusively for White men. We aren’t White, none of our family members are in any of these clubs + being part of these clubs isn’t what it’s cracked out to be. My parents have been pushing me as their enabler + I am"
I am terrified of losing my brother to suicide. I think I would end my life if he does the deed. My parents screwed him over + he made mistakes in life + cannot turn back the clock. His desperation to be accepted into an Old Boys Club is very nauseating to me.
"When I was a child + til now, my parents wanted to know who my friends are so they can recruit them as enablers of their control/abuse. My friends who r loyal to me refused this. I hate the fact ppl r so obsessed with controlling others when they don’t have their lives together."
"Parents have an eternal status of victimhood they carry, even when they screw over their own children for their own selfish benefits."
That's the sad reality of capitalism.
I went to a cafe with my brother + I chose to sit on this seat only bc of the cat. Cats bring me so much happiness + joy. I’d love to go to a cat cafe someday ❤️❤️❤️.
"The price we pay for the comforts that comes with a concrete jungle are higher life expectancy (longer age), experiencing more decay with long age, overpopulation + dementia. I think dying young was an act of compassion on the part of nature for us, but we failed to realise that."
I like to think every human being knows the truth about the reality of our existence. But a small part of me thinks that I am guilty of projecting those ideas onto people ~ and some people still think the gift of life is a good thing.
Existence + life + death are like descending from heaven into a hellish form of purgatory only to experience a little bit of hell before finally returning back into the realms of peace.
World peace is impossible bc peace comes from within + it’s v hard to maintain a state of peace in realm of existence designed to disturb the peace. Parents r the ultimate violators + thieves who rob + deprive their children of the right to peace. Thats y we will always wage war.
I’m going through a phase of buying sensory toys for my sensory bag which I was encouraged to create by my therapists. It seems to help. My brother told me that he thinks fidget toys are stupid. I don’t think so. Sometimes our fingers need relief + sensory toys r good for that.
shoulders. That was more healing than any therapy session I ever had. My friend understood exactly what I was talking abt + he explained to me how in some cultures (his included) that ppl show more love to material objects than to their own children. I felt well understood then.
"mentioned to him something very emotional + traumatic about my past + how that relates to my family. For some reason, I burst into tears + I was weeping + crying insanely in front of someone I barely knew for a week. I felt this huge sense of relief + this burden lifted off of my"
"One of the most memorable moments in my life, that I found more therapeutic than anything I have ever experienced in my life, was having my friend ask me a question about a relative who died of covid, right after I got out of the shower, I told him a long story in detail + then I"
"This world is hostile to people who refuse to play games, non-conformists, ppl who don't care about hierarchy or social climbing, ppl without connections + anyone with any type of virtue that is considered a weakness in a psychopathic world."
"When you make a conscious choice to force someone into existence + they do not meet your expectations, you have absolutely no right to complain about them. #Antinatalism"
"My mother was complaining about my brother again this morning... I told her that she’s worse than a gambler bc she forced him to come into existence expecting something from him + when he didn’t deliver on it + disappointed her, she whines about it. Arghhh breeders r so entitled."
"The gateway to hell is in between your legs... it is a dark place of pleasure, pain covered with disgusting bodily fluids. That’s why you cry when you’re first born + you never find peace when you are alive."
"I’m starting to believe that heaven really does exist, but not in the way we have been told. Heaven is nothingness + non-existence, which means parents are the gateway to hell. #Antinatalism"
"God is the narcissistic centre point of the human ego, that needs to be worshipped + validated constantly bc of its own inferiority complex."
"God is made in man’s image, bc man created God as an artificial construct to give life meaning + prevent existential crises in humankind. #Irreligious"
Breeders can never compensate their children for the hell they put them in by bringing them into this world. #Antinatalism
"If life is supposed to be temporary + we all know this, why do people act like it’s eternal + here to stay forever? It’s bc of our ego. We can’t accept that one day we will vanish into oblivion."
Sell people an illusion that one partner can fulfil or meet all your needs which isn’t true + when your needs aren’t being met sometimes you have to outsource them elsewhere. I think we have to have some level of compassion for people trapped bc often we see it as a betrayal.
"Emotional intelligence + some men are quite emotional. When people in your culture are cold, distant + lack understanding towards difficulties you face in life, you seek emotional support elsewhere + that leads to emotional affairs. The problem with society these days is they"
"It might strike some people as a bit surprising, but many men who go to brothels do not actually end up having sex with the prostitute, they end up talking with them for ages + asking for their advice/opinions. Saving face is a real thing in many cultures + some ppl lack"
True enlightenment involves accepting the darkness that comes with reality. Most people choose to be wilfully ignorant bc the darkness is too unpleasant + uncomfortable for them.
#Antinatalism is about acknowledging the fact you will never have peace in this life bc you have needs + desires that can only truly be satiated by death or non-existence + accepting that instead of disturbing somebody else’s peace under the false delusion u have attained peace.
It is almost impossible to achieve peace unless you are no longer here. So what is most people’s response to their inability to achieve inner peace? They disturb somebody else’s inner peace to satisfy their insatiable never-ending desires. #Antinatalism
We live in a funny world where we celebrate death + we mourn life. Every birthday is a celebration of death or getting one step closer to death + every funeral is one more person being emancipated from life...perhaps funerals r our subconscious way of envying those who move on.
"Real darkness is coming out of your mother’s womb into what appears to be the light, but the light is the hellfire + the real peace + light are in the darkness. Don’t let people tell you otherwise. #Antinatalism"
Life is a conveyor belt + the final destination is always death. #Antinatalism
"I’m having a good time in group therapy. I just realised that I spend a lot of my time in freeze mode, rather than fight or flight mode. That is why I am unconscious of danger, I don’t respond to earthquakes, car accidents + other catastrophes like other people do."
This is so cringe 🤮
"the most self-conscious + insecure people I have ever met. It is emotionally exhausting to have to constantly reassure someone that you find them attractive. This is why, you should never settle for someone who has low self-esteem, bc the emotional labour will really exhaust you."
"value personality more than looks. I have always valued personality + intelligence over looks, but I need some level of mild physical attractiveness to somebody alongside it. The sad part I realised is that the men with average looks + the highest IQs + greatest personalities are"
"When society tells you personality matters more than looks, they are trying to sabotage you. How many people who learnt to develop their personality ended up revealing who they really are when they tried to catfish someone, only to scare them away? As you get older, you start to"
"A physically attractive man who looks in a woman's direction or hits on her is warmly welcomed. Whereas, a less attractive man is labelled a creep + a pervert. A physically attractive bimbo is far more valued by society than an intelligent but less attractive woman."
"Looks r everything in life, bc we are all nature's pawns in the mating game. People who are physically attractive are more likely to be successful, have better mate selection + career opportunities + are generally more trusted, liked + forgiven by people for their wrongdoings."
"Kindness is criminalised + punished by the establishment, bc kindness is the key to peace + prosperity. Kindness is the antidote to many problems that plague our hearts + our minds."
Almost every person I know who has received a marriage proposal quickly with some pressure to hurry up + get hitched has almost always ended up marrying an abusive narcissist. One of the best ways to drive away a narcissist is by pressuring them to have a long courtship period.
"When there is so much unresolved trauma associated with intimacy + so many it triggers, it’s a risk definitely not worth taking."
"Friends are definitely closer to me than my family, bc I’ve always been a black sheep. I am estranged from most of my family + I have many twisted psychos. I don’t see myself entering into any relationship, but I wouldn’t mind a strong platonic friendship with a person I trust."
"When my parents die, I will end up more reliant on my friends to keep an eye on me. I will definitely end up moving with my brother to another country to be close to my BFFs or my cousin + renting out their estates. Coming from a Cluster B family, I can’t trust most relatives."
"You are born into a rotting flesh prison that reeks of repulsive excrements that is subject to torture, death + hormonal fascism . #Antinatalism"
No matter how ugly + unpleasant childbirth is + how difficult parenthood can be... it never fails to surprise me the great lengths people are willing to go to just to have a child. I'll never understand it. #Antinatalism
"Nature + sexual desire are malevolent forces that appear to be in the best interests of survival for our species, when in actual fact, nothing can be further from the truth. #Antinatalism"
Dealing with traumatised ppl who have been victims of abuse is very draining. Becoming attached to clients + then having to readjust + move is stressful. It's hard to practice detachment for your self-care. My biggest fear was getting comfortable w the salary + never leaving.
"+ bc u're ""disposable"" managers become bullies or enablers of abuse in this industry. Many companies cut corners + provide less opportunities for their staff to save money + the job is very draining. I learnt many things working in that industry bt I also found it very triggering"
"The caregiving industry is in high demand due to ageing population, mental health + disability services + it pays better than most other dead end jobs. The problem is its a female dominated industry w a lot of bullying, you are pressured to do overtime + ridiculously long hours"
"What you study, demand for it + how much it pays is the most important. Many people end up doing honours, a masters or a PhD with no employment prospects. From my experience, a National Certificate or Diploma can actually land you a better job than a PhD. Funny world we live in."
"My biggest mistake was “settling” for a dead end job. I always tell ppl my biggest fear is to turn 50 + still b doing a menial job. They can have pay equities, wage increases, more opportunities + high demand, but a menial job will slowly kill + destroy your life, esp shift work."
I have come to realise that so many people do their bachelors degree + struggle to find a job. Many often end up doing a diploma in something else + they end up working a better paying job. I’m not ashamed of that. A few of my peers did that + I ended up following suit.
"Yesterday was a good day. I got my nails done, did laundry, cleaned up, finished a chunk of my assignment + had a productive day. I’m heading to bed at 2:30am. I have been writing everything on my whiteboard. Got so much to do tomorrow. I hope I can always be like this..."
"Being extroverted only works well in individualistic societies. Being introverted works better in collectivist societies. In the West, u need to be extroverted to really fend for urself. In the East, you can afford the luxury of being introverted if u have the right connections."
"Professor Sam Vaknin says that truth tellers are sadists. I agree to that. If truth tellers are sadists, does that make pessimists, nihilists + antinatalists sadists too, but with an underlying layer of compassion + idealism?"
How to force yourself to have a drive to live when you do not even want to be here? #EternalQuestion
"Day 2 of Ritalin - I felt a bit more focused, no nausea, headaches or unpleasant symptoms. I think my problem is the lack of drive + motivation. I feel like everything in the reality of my existence is a forced experience. Sometimes I contemplate whether it’s worth it or not."
"Famous antinatalist breakdown:   1.) Benatar - for logical arguments.  2.) Schopenhauer - for philosophical arguments.  3.) Doug Stanhope - for more comedic arguments.  4.) Thomas Ligotti - for gruesome, comedic + more cynical arguments.  5.) Sarah Perry - references gud studies."
"Last week at group therapy I made a comment about us being biological robots w no freewill who are shaped by the first 7 years of our lives by our guardians, environment + genetics + this girl in my group just looked at me funny. I try not to trigger ppl or hit sensitive nerves."
"If the human mind wasn’t so complex, wud we need to create God to explain our existence? Wud we hv philosophy to delve into deeper questions? Wud we keep searching for more? Being human is exhausting + other creatures who aren’t cursed w our complexities r more fortunate than us."
"You can argue that we are biological organisms + procreating is part of our lifecycle + this does not make it unethical. The problem is the human mind is so complex, it is always seeking more answers to deeper questions. This makes our existence more difficult than other species."
"Religious people will always give you a reason to have to procreate. Atheists will give you more leeway + justify keeping rights to your civil liberties, but few atheists understand antinatalism, even tho the majority of antinatalists are atheists or irreligious people."
Idk how to oversimplify the human experience to us being biological organisms designed to replicate with no purpose in life. Take away religion from the human experience + we are left with the facts - the human experience is full of suffering so what’s the point in continuing?
"In the mating game, we think there are winners + losers. All of us are losers. Your chance of being born beautiful in a 1% percent family is slimmer than the odds of you winning the actual jackpot in the lottery. The game is rigged + your safest bet is not to play."
"The human “experiment” is like the titanic sinking deep. We are too far gone. We cannot be “saved”. The only rational thing left to do is pull the plug for good. Even if humanity had any redeemable qualities, life is futile + existence is meaningless so better to not be."
"Not only do breeders violate consent by disturbing the unborn + forcing them into the hell of existence, they also restrict their rights to contraception, sterilisation, abortions + euthanasia to enforce their sick narrative on others. Fuck breeders. #Antinatalism"
"My mother told me she thinks one reason why Prince Charles continued to cheat on Princess Diana was bc most of the media + paparazzi were focused on Diana + he was forgotten about. Camilla was not attractive as Diana, which allowed Charles to have more attention in the media."
"In the relationship. Many misogynistic men love to abuse women they marry bc of their deep seated hatred for women, starting with their own mother or bc of jealousy that their sister or other women in their family got more attention than they did. Those men are extremely toxic."
"I was naive when I used to think you can marry people of different races, social classes, religions etc, but often times those unions don’t work bc one partner may envy the partner who is better off than them + may sadistically punish them or be invalidating or passive aggressive"
Two of my closest friends were scammed by people who married them for passports. Usually men who marry insecure women who are out of their league treat them like shit once they have what they want. One of the biggest signs of a narcissist is one who pushes to marry ASAP.
True compassion is learning not to love something so much that you become attached to it. It’s about understanding what you admire + keeping 6 degrees of separation apart. Bc love only leads to more suffering + pain bc of attachment.
"It’s hard for me to trust myself to truly love someone ever again. I have hurt people + have been hurt. I carry some shame/guilt about this. Im emotionally immature + unstable. I’m really not a good candidate for a relationship, bc I’m far from ever being at my best ever again."
"Some people have sham marriages for a green card in exchange for money + this transaction is agreed upon by both parties in advance. I think that is more honest than deceiving somebody into falling in love with you. But I guess for broke ppl, they have to break hearts to survive."
"When you’re done with life, you’re done with love too."
90 Day Fiancé is one of my guilty pleasures. Arab men love embarrassing themselves on these shows for a green card. This show is pretty much the bottom of the barrel Americans dating 3rd Worlders some of whom are of higher sexual market value than them. It’s a trade off I guess.
"The future of the world will be similar to Singapore, Japan + other industrial nations. We will recycle our sewerage water + drink it. We will burn our rubbish to produce electricity + we will live in Soviet style apartments. The future doesn’t look too good."
"When you hear from official govt sources that they are concerned about population growth, it’s about future taxpayers. Places that have less people are prosperous, unless they are dominated by ageing populations. Everything you’re fed about existence is all fear based propaganda."
"I like the idea of a mass decline in population. When people don’t reproduce the only people who suffer are govts + the wealthy who profit off of the suffering of poor people. A mass population decline means less pollution, crowds, noise + more peace."
"any other substances + I think bc of the fact I have 2 first degree relatives with schizophrenia + a history of psychosis, I will probably never touch any psychedelics bc in my experience, it takes me months of sleeping a lot (or being hospitalised) to recover from an episode."
"just drink a little bit of wine/cider very rarely + usually with my friends. Even with CBD oil + THC, I used those only for social anxiety at work + I stopped them cold turkey with no issues bc of my parents + I barely needed them anymore since I quit my job. I have never tried"
"I feel like Ritalin won't work for me. I just have to try + pull myself by my bootstraps + get things done. Aside from having a history of addiction to benzos which I haven't touched in like a decade, I seem to be less prone than other people to addictions. Even with alcohol, I"
"Today is my first day trying Ritalin. So far I feel hyper focused, but I’m still not very productive at all. The side effects that I find unstable are the watery eyes + the blurred vision. I’ll give it a try for a few days, if it doesn’t work out, I’ll text my key worker."
"Having thoughts of #antinatalism is often perceived by many people as one being, blue, depressed or mentally ill. The truth is so unpleasant, that we have to sugarcoat our very existence in order to accept + deal with it."
"Human existence can be summed up with the following three words: fucking, joke + gambling. That’s all there really is to our existence. #Antinatalism"
Procreation is having a (sad + cruel) joke + gamble at somebody else’s expense. #Antinatalism
Procreation has the status of being a guilt-free activity we are free to indulge in since we are inundated with countless propaganda bias that equates breeding with a false narrative of morality + virtue.
Humans created the ethics of “the sanctity of life” to program people to deny the irrefutable fact that procreation is unethical bc it is consensual + inherently harmful. #Antinatalism
"We are filthy fuck animals infested with all kinds of parasites + we ourselves are parasites designed to be parasites to survive. Our body is a host + breeding ground for lice, fungi, worms. Even our eyelashes have microscopic insects that roam between those tiny hairs."
"The gods have a good sense of humour to make someone like me with 50% Persian DNA to be born into a Pan-Arab nationalist family that extremely dislikes Persians. It explains why some Iraqis think I’m Kurdish. If Kurds are originally from Iran too, then it makes perfect sense."
Conquest is pointless + meaningless. It’s all about human ego + more spoils of war. Conquest is an attempt at attaining immortality in history books that can easily be rewritten by the next tyrant who takes over. The juice is never worth the squeeze + most idiots can’t see that.
"The scars of colonialism are never forgotten. Everybody has a story to tell about how one group oppressed, exploited, plundered + raped their land, resources + people. Colonialism + imperialism are futile + they change both parties involved forever."
"My father told me never be fooled by civilisation, politeness, political correctness + glossy image of the West. I knew early what their true nature is, but I always learnt to differentiate between regular Americans + their corporate slave masters."
Do it as he made an oath to be honourable to his professional services. He lasted 4 months in the country before he broke down + had to have his father rescue him. He told me then + there he saw right thru the US facade + it’s ugly reality behind the glossy image of capitalism.
"My friend told me he had a mental breakdown when he first moved to the US. As soon as he got on US soil, he was ripped off by the taxi driver. His employers were paying him a v good salary but he realised he had to rip off insurance companies in order to do his job. He couldn’t"
"I find it a complete turn off when somebody acts like they “know-it-all”, when they claim to have knowledge + expertise they do not have. I like people who are confident in themselves, but are also accepting of making mistakes or being wrong. It’s a sign of humility + maturity."
More by placing me in a more high risk work environment since it costs more to pay me.   *Sorry for my long rant*
"Qualified + experienced professionals + people are reluctant to pay professionals the rate they deserve. Even with my old job, my ex-employer refused to verify my study for my certification bc they didn’t want to pay me more + if I did get a higher qualification they’d degrade me"
Technicians are being authorised to make clinical decisions for patients using orthotics + prosthetics while he had to study 4 years + do a one year internship to qualify + these businesses keep overprescribing braces to people. It all comes down to pay. It costs more to pay
Doctor + you have to do quite a bit of intensive clinical training before you can practice medicine. It takes 11 years to become a psychiatrist + only 4 years to become a nurse. My friend who is a UK certified clinical orthotist with 25 years experience is concerned about how
"It makes people sick if they have any ounce of humanity or normalcy in them. Yet, people continue to breed like it’s nothing. Idky, but it irks me when nurses claim to be on the same level as doctors + we are expected to accept subpar services. It takes 6 years to study to be a"
"We have such a major shortage of professionals in mental health, with high demand for services that our district health board has to import psychiatrists for 3 month contracts from overseas to fill in for the shortage of services. This whole system we live in is so broken that"
Our mental health system is so broken that we have nurses claiming to have the same “authority” as psychiatrists when it comes to prescribing/reviewing psych meds. I pushed my father to get rid of the cocky nurse taking care of my brother bc he hates her.
"If existing means we hv a chance to go to hell if we disbelieve or disobey God, than that makes religions that claim to promote progeny, antinatalist, bc not procreating is the only way to guarantee yr child won’t go to hell. It shows how flawed the arguments for procreating are."
I have a problem w this. Abrahamic religions dominate the world + as long as we exist we r supposed to either go to heaven or hell. Heaven isn’t necessarily something that is appealing to some of us. I don’t need palaces + eternal life with infinite worldly desires to feel happy.
I love the fact two of the most populous countries like India + Nigeria have a growing community of antinatalists. It’s nice to see this movement attracts people from all over the world from all different walks of life.
"It’s hard to tolerate life when you didn’t consent to it + you’re cursed with being a workaholic + a perfectionist. If stimulant medication can help that, then why not? Psychotropic drugs were designed to “correct” the flaws of those who can’t be cogs in the machine. So be it."
"My psychiatrist wrote me a script for Ritalin. I hate life so much + I’ve always been apprehensive about taking meds, but I’m gonna take it. If it’s gonna push me to be more productive + that will pull me out of depression, then why not? I’m sad my psychiatrist is leaving tho :("
"Humanity has no future. We just pointlessly replicate. We solve one problem + create a million along with it. We have pretty much accomplished everything + no matter how ""great"" our achievements are, the end result is more futility + pointlessness. #Antinatalism #Efilism"
"Children are burdened with not only existence, but being the ""future"" of our species. It is such a huge burden to carry + none of us consented to carry it. #Antinatalism"
Breeders have absolutely no right to discuss or advocate for the welfare of children. The only way to truly safeguard children is by not bringing them into this world. #Antinatalism
Even royals are trapped. Existence is a prison planet for all... even more so for many of the privileged classes. #Antinatalism
Perhaps this technocracy will finally make human existence obsolete?
"You are born to be a slave. You are born to be a cog in the machine. If you stray away from this, you will be ostracised + society will punish you as if your biology + existence aren’t aren’t enough punishments. #Antinatalism"
Your existence never comes with no strings attached. You are a servant to the cult of meat grinder progenitors. #Antinatalism
"People seem to desire youth for the aesthetics more so than the decline that comes with old age. For me, its not the aesthetics or superficiality... I just don't want to ever be dependent on anybody else or watch my body decline day after day."
"If people loved life so much as they claim to do so... do you think there would be so many alcoholics, drug addicts, obese people + people living unhealthy lifestyles? Those people are miserable + on some subconscious level, they wish they wouldn't live long + would die soon."
One way to insult somebody is to wish they are blessed with longevity.
"Life extension, longevity + immortality r sadistic desires that should only be desired by stupid ppl or the 1% in positions of power who can afford to ""enjoy"" life. To assume the rest of society want these things is arrogant/ignorant. Most people who live long see it as a curse."
I think it is v arrogant + ignorant to collectively assume that all humans want to live long + longevity is some kind of blessing that we should be eternally grateful for. Not every human desires longevity or immortality. Many people are perfectly happy with a shorter lifespan
"My biggest problem w modern science + expansion of human civilisation is the vast increase in life extension therapies. When we were less civilised our life expectancy was much shorter. This was not a bad thing, but a blessing in disguise, bc old age in many ways is a curse."
I watched the interview with Prince Harry + Meghan Markle. I found it ironic they decided to have children despite being their union being frowned upon + the lack of safety/security for their children. That's the problem with breeders. They are so shortsighted.
"Breeders promise their offspring the world only to deliver on a series of disappointments + inevitable tragedy in their long, sad, existence."
The strongest argument in support of #antinatalism is the fact that gambling with the life an unborn sentient being is unethical + there is no moral justification for it.
Gambling is a taboo that is stigmatised in many areas of our lives. We cannot gamble peoples assets on their behalf without their consent... but we can play the losing genetic lottery + gamble away the lives of the unborn without their consent. #Antinatalism
Basic common sense most people fail to see...   1.) Life is futile/meaningless 2.) Suffering + pain prevail 3.) Life is a game of randomness + cruelty is an inevitable byproduct of that   If people can recognise these things + insist on spreading their seed. Something is wrong.
The real “meaning” of life... or so we are told...
How to endure a life you detest +  didn’t ask for? #EternalQuestion #Antinatalism
"There is a difference between biological urges + intimacy. Many people fear intimacy, which is why sex work will always exist. Sex work enables one to fulfil their biological urges without the fears of abandonment, pain, suffering + emotional anxiety that come with intimacy."
I've never been a social climber who befriends people to gain something from them. I learnt to be quite self-sufficient + to not really need people that much. The only reasons I would befriend anybody is bc I share similar values to them or we actually have similar interests.
"I value authenticity... being there for people during hard times, the occasional meet up, the odd text message asking how I'm doing. I don't like fakeness. I don't make time for other people, unless I feel those people are worth my time of day."
"Another thing I don't understand is how my doctors, psychiatrists + nurses always have to comment on me having flattened expressions on my face. I can't be smiling all the time or have a lot of expressions. I've always been this way + its the autism. I guess it scares people."
"to not be my friend than to pretend they like me for whatever reason. No one is obligated to do anything for me or to be ""nice"" to me. This is one reason why I am happy being friendless.. at least I get all the time in the world to be alone + I don't have to suffer ppls bullshit."
"when people text everyday. I like to keep some space + distance in my relationships with other people. Another thing I detest is people who ""collect"" friends for whatever reason. When people blow me off continuously or stand me down I find it insulting. I would rather they choose"
"asked for my number + I gave it to them + they almost felt ""obligated"" to pretend to be my friend. It's stupid. I wud rather be ignored + left alone than have people try to be friendly with me, pry into my life, insist on being friends with me only to ditch me. I also get annoyed"
"I have trouble understanding people, which is why I prefer to avoid them. I don't like people bc they are so hard to read sometimes. I had two women who lived in my friend's apartment building constantly come up to me, try to be ""friendly"" even tho we had nothing in common + they"
"Nature has designed us to be destructive, lifelong consuming parasites in order to survive. #Antinatalism"
Existence is being forcefully shackled against your own will by selfish people who feed you lies along with a society that enables that under the false guise of being a “sacred gift”. #Antinatalism
"Existence is the worst nightmare ever imaginable, bc you are held as a hostage in a hell of inevitable misery + futility against your own will. #Antinatalism"
"The internet is every asocial, lone wolf + aspie's heaven. Mine included."
The best thing about the internet is...  1.) You can work/study from home 2.) There are infinite ways to entertain yourself 3.) You can learn anything 4.) You can order food from an app 5.) You can maximise your self-sufficiency + reduce your reliance on other people.
Society wants ppl to be dependent on others. Thats why society demonises single ppl who r childfree. Society also demonises lone wolves. Cluster B families r usually self-sufficient.. so ppl from those backgrounds + those w Aspie traits tend to be self-sufficient + independent.
I miss the days when self-study or online study actually gave you your course work in print including relevant research papers. It's exhausting copying + pasting everything to print out + read at your own pace. I might need some glasses + my eyes checked too :(
"I love Enya. My love for her grew when I found out she's a recluse. Aside from her performances + a few failed relationships, she remained single, she lives in a beautiful castle in Ireland + she's a recluse her relatives hardly see. She's an inspiration to the recluse lifestyle."
"I resent myself more + more when I am lazy, unproductive + I can't bring myself to enjoy anything. I really need to force myself to study somehow + grind it out. I haven't touched any learning materials for a few days now :("
"There is no such thing as heaven with no free will, mindless replication + mass enslavement."
People sell you a false illusion of a light at the end of the tunnel. There is no such thing. You will only find rabbit holes + an abyss of eternal darkness. One darkness will be full of a series of nightmares + the other will be of non-existence + eternal peace.
Going to DBT therapy has taught me to enjoy playing with kinetic sand + play doh as an adult. It is actually quite soothing + relaxing. I always love to keep my hands busy doing something. I suppose there’s no shame in having some guilty pleasures.
"Existence is the underground realm of destruction + humans are the hellfire... what happens to hellfire? If it’s not contained or controlled, the fire grows... it’s no different to human population growth..."
"When some people drown, they drag others along with them. When people are bred into this world, they breed more people to suffer with them. Drowning + breeding are not that different. Humans are born to screw each other over, bc misery always loves company. #Antinatalism"
"85% of ppl in the world r religious. Many of them believe in a heaven or nirvana. If they realised that the only heaven we have is the one of non-existence that would change the world forever. Abortions, contraception + sterilisation will be readily available to everyone."
"The only realm of peacefulness + eternal bliss is nothingness. If breeders had any basic understanding of respect, they would go to great lengths to respect the sacred boundaries of the unborn - but you can't really expect much from mindless, filthy, fuck selfish animals."
"If spirits + ghosts that haunt people forever really exist + I could be one of them, I would haunt every progenitor in their dreams + while they are alive. If death is the only way for them to escape my curse, at least then they'd finally leave the unborn to rest in nothingness."
"My desires are... to not need to consume constantly, to escape my putrid bodily functions that disgust me, to escape from the cycle of slavery + paying to live in a world I absolutely despise, to be free from boredom, existentialism + sheeple. Non-existence is my only salvation."
"Being nothingness, rotting away + my remains decomposing into fertiliser.. undisturbed. No mammalian or reptilian brain to dictate my needs. No need to be held hostage, forced to work, pay money to b alive.. just non-existence. That is real heaven + that is home of eternal peace."
"Im finally talking to my mother again after 5 months of no contact. She asked me today about my desire for heaven. I told her that God wrongly assumes everybody desires immortality, saffron soil + golden palaces when some of us only desire non-existence bc that's the true heaven."
"Behind civilisation + our existence is a pit of darkness, we try to conceal + deny. But it is the inevitable, each + everyone of us shall one day taste + face. #Antinatalism"
"Every human being is a live walking corpse that is constantly rotting + slowly degrading, withering + dying away. We are zombies from the past longing for the darkest fate that long awaits us."
"People. I hardly take any selfies, I don’t post many picture of myself or let people take many pictures of me... I’m kind of camera shy. But I’ll never get bored of taking pictures of trees and capturing landscapes. That’s one way to escape the ugliness of life in some way."
"Realise that people have different eyes when they take photos + an image captures what you see. Watching my friend take pictures all day, observing his eye, the angles, lighting... I found some joy in photography, but I find landscapes, trees + free wildlife more interesting than"
"The world is very narcissistic. Apparently the most popular photography is usually of people + events. Landscape + wildlife photography aren’t popular or in high demand. I have never been a fan of taking pictures of people or landmarks much, but I love my landscapes. I didn’t..."
My friend helped me diversify my interests into a range of activities I never thought I’d ever b interested in. I observed him fly fishing + spin fishing... we usually put the fish back in the water. I’ve enjoyed bird watching + landscape photography + adventures on scenic roads.
"When you “tolerate” existence, u don’t hv much of an incentive to truly invest in a life you don’t really want. You only do the bare minimum which take a ridiculous amount of effort, to carry on you’re ready to cease existence when time comes. U hope it’s quick, easy + painless."
I am a volcel. Sometimes the loneliness is painful. But my lack of normalcy + weirdness has stopped me from procreating long before I even found out about AN. I find it difficult to emotionally invest a lot in a life I never wanted. I have nothing to lose if I die tomorrow.
Being an incel is probably both a blessing + a curse. The downside is loneliness + free markets capitalise on men with a lot of disposable income. The best part is that procreation + parenthood aren’t really as great as what we are told. So being an incel isn’t so bad tbh.
What black pilled incels talk abt is reality. The mating game is all abt looks. 80% of women reproduce + 40% of men pass down their genes. Men hv always been disposable. Nature treats women w cruelty as well. Nature is cruel to all sentient beings in the replication game we play.
"Imagine we had a gigantic casino where we had a human sized meat grinder with a few consolation prizes like good looks, good genes, wealth, status etc + a whole lot of misfortunes, but everybody ends up dying + crushed into a meat grinder. That’s our existential reality TV show."
We have just enough pleasure for our lives to be satisfactory with enough distractions so we can at least learn to tolerate the burden of existence.
"We require just enough intelligence to have basic survival skills, to blindly follow/obey authority + to replicate mindlessly without asking any questions. The game is stupid, mindless + pointless... I never asked to be part of it. #Antinatalism"
"Life is about randomness. There is no sense of morality + justice in a world of mindless replication at all costs. Existence is a gambling meat grinder, constantly bidding on which genes are going to win. #Antinatalism"
The world is a dangerous place. Breeders know this. Yet they still choose to create children who will always be in harm’s way. #Antinatalism
"Accepting the goodness in the world, is the equivalent of telling yourself the lies you were taught by your parents + educators were real, even when you know deep down inside they are only exceptions to the rules."
"I have a very pessimistic worldview tainted in with strong elements of misanthropy. That is my personal bias. Which is why I value that which pure + good, bc it proves me wrong + it reminds me that there are always exceptions to the rules."
"hurting those people + rewarding those who lack goodness, kindness, genuine purity of the human spirit that gives people like me some kind of hope... bc when these kind of people are seen as prey, I lose hope. I want to die with them bc everything about them is redeeming."
"costs when I can afford to do so. My problem is how I see these people get repeatedly fucked over, abused + suffering to the point of suicide or extreme levels of distress. It infuriates me with a deep sense of anger + invokes a protective instinct in me. I hate this world for"
I am attracted to people who have a good nature to them who constantly get screwed over + abused by predators. I value the goodness of these people + I always pay it back in magnitude bc I reward these kind of people. I feel obligated to care for + protect them when I can at all
"One reason I hold existence in contempt is bc I hv a rescuer complex. I grew up in a Cluster B family, with my parents being ""the nice ones"" out of the crazies. Many people took advantage of their kindness + good will + my family being religious allowed it to happen. So naturally"
"Older men taught me to appreciate knowledge, philosophy + instrumental jazz music. Older men have refined taste, class + timeless elegance you only come to appreciate when you are in their company. My friend has left me behind with a collection of good music I can really enjoy."
I feel you. They were my worst nightmare in college. That’s why I opted to do all my study online via distant learning. It’s the only way I can escape all of this.
We live in a world where cloning is perceived as narcissism. Plastering your wall or social media with your photos is seen as narcissistic. But procreation is celebrated. Oh the irony. #Antinatalism
"The curse of existence is worse than any STD. It infests our bodies with hormones, desires + cells that want to replicate at any + all costs. Few people can escape the nightmare of creating a carbon copy of themselves. #Antinatalism"
"We are born to die, but we are forced to live. #Antinatalism"
"The gift of life comes w a bundle of troubles. The gift of non-existence comes with a bundle of no worries + infinite peace. If pleasures are limited + are only represented by an absence of pain, then non-existence is worth it, bc the pleasure is not worth the pain. #Antinatalism"
People are afraid of terminating pregnancies. Not many people truly live up to being pro-choice. I have heard of + know many people who have had accidental pregnancies who ended up going through with the pregnancy despite the fact they felt apprehensive about having the child.
"When you have an unstable sense of self intimacy + family become things you don't value anymore. To occupy your time + to be comfortable, you start to value wealth, knowledge, non-conformity, solitude + (distantly) contributing to society. You learn to do without those things."
"We had this exercise in therapy today, where we had lists of values important to us + what isn't. Intimacy, family, love, sexuality, relationships, romance were all on my list of things I don't value. Autonomy, wealth, contribution, knowledge, non-conformity where my main values."
It's better to look like you have your shit together than to look like you are a hot mess + you don't know where to begin when it comes to your life.
"I do not wish to be the object of anybody's desire. Although I do get lonely sometimes, I find being single + alone to be my comfort zone. I just want to just look presentable enough to feel good about taking care of myself or the very least, give that illusion to others."
"I tend to wear more makeup when I'm depressed. I get complimented on it by many people. Its like part of me trying to say, I'm doing fine, even when I'm not. As much as it saddens me, I feel makeup will have to force itself to become part of my ""uniform"" when I am around others."
"Wearing makeup is part of wearing a mask. It gives people an illusion that you like to take care of yourself + be well presented. Makeup is not about being attractive to the opposite sex or improving your appearance, but its about looking like you're doing okay even when u r not."
"In my family, the women are very introverted, but extremely toxic, the men are more extroverted + many of them do the socialising on behalf of the women. It's not such a bad thing tbh. Many relationships have one introverted person married to an extrovert + everything works well."
Even the people in my social circle who are extroverted have a sense of pride + self-worth. They don't kiss ass or are social climbers. I like to distance myself as much as possible from those kind of people.
"I have always felt alien to this world bc the one's who succeed at life are either lucky, they are good asslickers or they are extroverted + good social climbers. I don't like to kiss/lick ass. I'm an introvert + I'm not really a fan of social hierarchy. I go my own way."
I agree. It’s insinuating sexual desire for somebody else. That’s hardly a compliment unless you desire the person as well.
"#Antinatalism is in your face wherever you go. There’s no escaping it, you can only deny it."
"Since hanging out w my friend almost everyday for the last 4 months until he left last weekend, I hv come to appreciate classical/jazz music, a bit of extravagance + overall class + elegance. My circle of friends are all classy people. But... money can't buy class."
I find reality TV shows really boring. The only interesting ones I think r 90 Day Fiancé + Extreme Cheapskates. I think ppl going on the Bachelor or Bachelorette is really embarrassing - I can't help but think many of those relationships don't last. I hate reality TV in general.
"I'm thinking of cancelling my Netflix subscription... I don't really watch any movies, they don't have anything I like + I'm not really into series that much."
"In my group therapy, we were asked to make a sensory box for therapeutic reasons. I ordered a lot of fidget type toys online + I have yet to add more items to it. I recommend it. It's nice to have a box of items you can play with while watching something."
"I started my first module of one of my construction course. It looks like the next 3 months are going to b full on for me. Hopefully, I understand everything, I complete my assignments on time + I graduate. When you want a break from the workforce, study is a great way to escape."
"If you're going to suffer at a job where you are degraded for pay (like most jobs), it might as well be a job that pays good. At least you will have the security of a savings account + the luxury of buying nice things to help you forget the existential misery you must endure."
"My lack of direction in life stems from my difficulty to find the will to live. When life is a chore, burden + imposition you feel a lack of motivation + inspiration to truly do anything constructive."
"Call me weird, but I love the fact that Harry Styles wrote a love song for a pet fish. Our love for animals is purer than our love for human beings, even though the concept of love can be selfish in so many ways."
"My mother expected my brother + I to be... Religious + conformists, Doctors/engineers she can brag about in front of people, To make a lot of money, buy fancy houses, To be her slaves left, right + centre, To get married + have kids. When we didn’t do those things we are “evil”."
Every breeder expects something in return from their children + those who say they don’t are lying. #Antinatalism
"Let’s be honest... most children are retirement plans. In many cultures, rest homes do not exist + many  children take care of their parents when they get old. We don’t need to lie or sugarcoat it."
"I woke up from a crazy dream wanting to suicide, on suicide watch + throwing a tantrum over something so small + insignificant. It’s insane. Today is the first day of school... wow, I can’t believe it. The things I force myself to do to escape other things... this shit is crazy."
Therapists need their own therapists + I find most of them pretty useless.
"There are no prizes when it comes to existence, only burdens, impositions + false illusions of so-called “prizes”. Everybody is a loser. #Antinatalism"
"Breeders drag children into their problems... nobody likes to be dragged into other peoples problems. A baby won’t fix your relationship, existential crisis or fulfil your parental instincts... a baby can only take you so far..."
What makes breeders frustrating is the fact they assume everybody wants to exist. #Antinatalism
"That’s hilarious... eugenics is involuntarily sterilising undesirables so they don’t procreate... the higher ones intelligence is, the less they are likely to procreate or they breed less... when you are cursed with a high IQ, you see life for what it really is."
"I helped my friend finish packing, we had a farewell dinner together + I told him I will never see him again. It upset him a bit, but I explained to him my outlook in life is very pessimistic + I taught myself to expect less from people otherwise I’ll always be disillusioned."
"I have never loved life... at best, I can say I endured it + I hv a whole bunch of copes to try to continue forcing upon myself to endure it bc if I don’t, I will hv to face the demons of my insanity + I’ll end up ending my life. I rely on distractions to carry on. #Antinatalism"
"Life + the burden of existence are the biggest curses + misfortunes anybody can ever truly be burdened with. Life can never truly be a gift bc it is a burden, it’s unsolicited, it’s forced + it comes with many limitations + strings attached I don’t like dealing with."
"People tell you to go to therapy if you acknowledge life is shit, therapy isn’t going to change reality... why waste money talking about something you can’t change. Yes, therapy can fix some things, but it’s never going to undo the wrongs done to you."
"White collar criminals + greedy corrupt people who r exploitative r the real thieves + they rarely get caught or penalised for their crimes. We have enough resources for every human on earth to have their basic needs met, but it’s the small amount of ppl who hoard most resources."
"When it comes to ppl stealing, there is a line between ppl who steal bc they have to in order to survive + we should seek to help those people. Then there’s people who steal bc they are kleptomaniacs + it’s a thrill of them. But the real thieves r usually white collar criminals."
My friend was telling me about how when Brunei decided to implement Shariah Law they were gonna send orthopaedic surgeons to train them in how to amputate arms if people steal. Apparently the surgeons used medical ethics as a reason to refuse to comply w this religious tyranny.
"I want to find a natural way to embrace my grey hair stylishly without having to resort to dying my roots. Im a brunette, so I’m not sure how grey hair would look on me. Maybe I’ll start when I hit my mid 30s..."

"Meanwhile, the purchase of the business in capital city may be finalised + I may have to move to work w my BFF. I enjoyed the second to last day of our farewell. Not sure what will happen at this stage, perhaps we are meant to have a future together, but either way I’ll have..."
"Meanwhile in good news today... I received an email from my university + they want me to enrol in an extra course to qualify as a full time QS student. I think I might start next week. It will be full on, but in 18 months I’ll be a qualified QS + I will be earning a high income."
"I had spent some time watching political analyst videos from pundits in the Middle East predicting more violence, unrest + death once Biden comes into office. It’s not surprising. There will be more terror attacks + car bombs in Iraq too..."
"I think I have. My parents gave me conditional love, as a result I didn’t know how to love myself + I still have trouble trying. Love is a foreign language to me. I wouldn’t know what true love is if it came knocking on my door with flowers. I can’t value what I don’t understand."
The gateway to hellfire is between your legs. #Antinatalism
If humans were born asexual without social needs perhaps we would not procreate as much... so many people have children to trap others in miserable relationships or they have a fear of loneliness... if loneliness wasn’t an issue I guess maybe we wouldn’t replicate as much...
"Procreation is a curse, but luckily the gestation period is 9 months, imagine if we had quicker pregnancies that were painless + we had no menopause... then our species would really be curse. So, we are cursed, but it could always be worse..."
"Humans are meat/flesh sacks of shit, unfortunately bc they don’t come out of the rear end, they forget who + what they actually are. #Antinatalism"

Sexual pleasure is nature’s booby trap to force more of us into existence. #Antinatalism
#Antinatalism is unpopular bc it unmasks the reality of our existence.
"Every Pro-Life Jesus Freak should watch this video. There are many Biblical accounts of infanticide in the Bible. So next time a Pro-Life screams abortion is murder, they need a friendly reminder of what their God did.   God VS Abortion   via @YouTube"
"Poor people who procreate are creating more cattle for the rich slave masters to enslave + exploit. If poor people stopped breeding, rich people would spend millions on campaigns just to get them to breed more slaves for them to exploit + profit off of."
Breeding is gateway for those in concentration camps + gulags to drag more people in to enable the oligarchs in power to continue their rein.
I would argue that breeders who have children bc they love kids is hedonistic bc creating those children is purely for their selfish pleasure. Even someone who is indifferent to life but recognises suffering + futility being inevitable will think twice before they breed.
"It makes absolutely no sense when a pronatalist breeder accuses a childfree person of being nihilistic + hedonistic. Children are tools of gratification for parents. If life is existence is hell, being childfree is anything but being a selfish hedonist."
"Getting married + having children is an act of compliance w the herd mentality + so-called “normalcy” as dictated to us by society. The ultimate form of rebellion is not having children. A person who is voluntarily childfree will be attacked left, right + centre for not breeding."
"In honour based cultures, death + killing in some situations is an act of mercy + compassion. For a culture to at the very least slightly acknowledge this fact is something rare + taboo elsewhere."
"There r Iraqi female prisoners gang raped constantly by thugs + their fellow female inmates murdered them inside prisons. They did this as an act of compassion, love + mercy for those women who would prefer to die than endure the PTSD, shame + stigma that comes w torture + rape."
"If I reach a point where the quality of my life would severely deteriorate, I would want someone to end my suffering out of mercy + compassion. When the Native American chief killed the protagonist in One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest - that was true love + real friendship."
You can be in a coma that lasts months or years w no hope of ever regaining consciousness + people would try to keep u alive in case you wake up..  You can have a stroke + end up in a vegetative state + the “sanctity of life” bullshit argument will be justified to keep you alive.
"It’s funny...   Many doctors refuse to sterilise women who have never had children in case they change their minds.   Euthanasia is not really legally for mentally ill people, but more so for the elderly + terminally ill people.   Sometimes the only solutions are permanent."
"When you impose life on another human being you subject them to ageing, becoming demented, suffering from degenerative diseases, being dependent on others for their care/support. Every old person who has lived over 100 years has wished they didn’t live for so long. #Antinatalism"
"Such a movie basically makes one who is childfree + single/widowed during old age want to advocate for euthanasia + having a robot carer. Rest homes + institutions that r supposed to “care” for the elderly are predatory, abusive + only see dollar signs when they see you."
"I recently watched the movie “I care a lot” on Netflix. It’s very eye-opening about how you have to be morally corrupt, exploitative + ruthless to succeed in this world. It resonated a lot with me bc I worked in healthcare + I have watched my father experience inheritance theft."
"At some point, one of my guilty pleasures was watching videos on YouTube of people roasting 5 minute crafts. I feel like life is similar to a 5 minute crafts video, many of the life hacks are fake, unnecessary + full of myths ppl have debunked. That’s life for you."

"I took my brother to doctor + I found out one major supermarket chain is giving out free medications to ppl just so ppl will shop at their supermarket. Govt subsidised drugs cost $5 here, I feel bad for ppl who live in countries where the costs of their medication r exorbitant."
"I don’t understand how people can sleep on their back or stomach. I’ve always been a side sleeper. I love sleeping on my sides so much, I have face wrinkles between my cheek, nose + eye just from sleeping in that position + I wondered where on earth they came from."

"#Antinatalism attracts people from all walks of life for different walks of life. The same message presented from different angles to people will appeal to different audiences. Personally, what appeals most to me about AN is definitely the philosophical arguments."
Does experiencing nirvana resemble the peace of nothingness?
"Being told that when I die the last remains of my meat suit will turn into fertiliser is probably one of the most joyful things to ever happen while my consciousness will return to nothingness. It’s better than heaven, hell + reincarnation."
"Humans have a lot in common with spiders... women kill the men slowly after they harvest their sperm, then the children kill the mother. The spider web is so delicately crafted to be torn down but rebuilt once it’s broken. That again is another manifestation of futility for you."
"Existence is like being gifted an old beach house in an area that has tsunamis almost daily. At first you think you can renovate the house + take it as a fun DIY project you will enjoy, until the deadly tidal wave washes it down + you rebuild. That’s futility for you."
"When I was 18, I woke up to many harsh realities abt life, bt I also realised I burnt out, I lost my self-discipline, focus + will to really live... I think on a subconscious level when u realise life isn’t wht you’re told it is + you didn’t sign up for it, you live on autopilot."
"As an #antinatalist, I find it hard to believe:  1.) Organised religion 2.) Politics 3.) Life scripts 4.) Political correctness  5.) Censorship of free speech 6.) MSM + education (indoctrination)   Its hard to hv an active role in life when u aren’t wholeheartedly invested in it."
I’m so happy to finally have my brand new mattress after suffering for almost a month with my 9 year old $800 mattress. I was seriously contemplating buying a $2000+ mattress but I’m unemployed atm so I got something much cheaper since I may be moving out again soon.
"of a doctor... I want to feel connectivity, bliss + euphoria but I'm terrified of having another psychosis episode. Losing control of my behaviour, giving things away, being very impulsive + crazy terrifies me, bc I can't differentiate between reality + fantasy. Life is hell."

"These have nothing to do with my friend, but they are me battling with my own demons. I will keep our relationship cordial + I will do my best to try never to get close with any human being, whether they are a friend or romantic partner. It always ends with one hurting the other"
"In the next couple of days, I will farewell my best friend, bt from this friendship, I will take many lessons. I foresee that I will b battling between striving for excellence + self-improvement, educational development + my frequent thoughts of suicide ideation + existentialism."
The juice is definitely not worth the squeeze baring in mind that we will all experience futility + cease to be for nothing.

"In my parent's culture a child is a slave to their parents, they r objectified + whored around in front of ppl for attention. They r conceived to ""fit in"" to a narcissistic society pathologically obsessed w fertility + an age old insurance policy. It's a miserable existence."
"Mental illness is a natural response to a degrading, non-consensual existence + lifelong coercion into indentured  servitude. #Antinatalism"

"Is being photogenic rare nowadays? Does every photo have to be airbrushed + edited with the right filters, lighting + heavy layers of make up? I don’t like to give my attention to that which is unrealistic. Reality might not be so glamorous, but at least it’s relatable."
"I have never seen children as a source of “comfort” for me... they are more of a burden, an inconvenience to my lifestyle. I find more comfort in things actually made to make people comfortable as opposed to people. #PreviousTweet"
I’d like to think that my purpose in life isn’t to make other people comfortable. I resent people who expect things from me that I did not consent to be part of.

I don’t like to getting attached to people. I don’t mind being attached to objects - they tend to disappoint me less in life.
"Is it normal to feel intense amounts of sadness, grief + depression when somebody close to you moves far away? This is one reason why I hate platonic intimacy... dealing with loss is excruciating. When there isn’t much to live for, loved ones make tolerating the shit worth it."

I have come across two incidents in my country of ppl putting their babies in a washing machine or tumble dryer only for their child to die. We hv severe cases of child abuse - even with free or very cheap state funded contraception people still have unwanted babies + abuse them.
Breeders like to use “my kid might cure cancer someday” as a reason to procreate. Guess what? The real cancer on this planet is humankind + the real cure for cancer is antinatalism or a massive catastrophe that wipes us out into oblivion. #Antinatalism
"At least people who have had abortions acknowledge that they are unsuitable candidates for parenthood, they lack the resources, physical, mental + emotional labour of parenting + instead of promoting suffering, they choose to terminate their pregnancies."
"I have a deep disdain for pro-lifers who guilt trip, abuse, bully + shame people who have had abortions as murderers. Aside from abstinence + sterilisation, sex always has a risk of pregnancy. Breeders create death like it’s nothing + they glorify it yet we praise + reward them."
If intentionally terminating a pregnancy leads to death + the act is perceived by pro-lifers to be an act of murder. Yet progenitors who “create” death are “givers” of life. Pro-lifers conveniently forget one cannot exist without the other.
"Cemeteries are supposed to serve as a reminder of the fate that awaits us, but instead people perceive them as a place to remember their loved ones who have passed on."
"I’ve always believed cemeteries are a waste of space + cremation is more practicable, however, even with the many cemeteries we have people can’t seem to make the connection between procreation being the inevitable catalyst leading to death."
"A person once said they like to buy animals from breeders instead of adopting from animal shelters bc the latter are traumatised animals who are harsher to handle. Same goes for breeders, they don’t want to adopt or foster bc those kids come with extra baggage."
The irony about hospitals is they have a delivery unit + they also have cancer patients + other units  filled with people on their deathbeds in the same building yet nobody giving birth seems to notice the connection. #Antinatalism
"Every fertility clinic, baby clothing shop or pronatalist establishment should be lined with graphic photographs of corpses + tragic deaths... any place that invokes sexual desire should be targeted just like how govts put graphic pictures of cancer patients on cigarette packets."
Please read the ebook from @NatalistAnti   - it is focused on how dopamine addiction is the root of our addiction to progeny. Basic + easy to understand + a good read for anyone new to #antinatalism.

"From an evolutionary perspective, addiction serves in aiding our survival... from a rational standpoint, addiction reminds us of our lack of free will + our dependence on substances to endure our existential hardship."
Celebrating fertility is our attempt at glorifying our insignificance + our narcissism in an attempt to glorify that which is not worth glorifying...
"Why do we celebrate fertility if all it leads to is mass consumption, degradation of natural resources + existential meaninglessness?"
"Fertility is glorified + celebrated when it is land providing sustenance for farmers to cultivate crops. Fertility in mammals is a curse, bc it requires an ongoing mass consumption of resources - while providing no need or necessity for its existence."
"It’s interesting to observe how pregnancy is perceived among people. On one hand, it’s perceived as a miracle, on the other it is perceived as a disease. I agree w the latter... the fact contraception has existed all throughout history demonstrates the power of fertility cults."
"For the sake of self-care + our sanity, we need to escape from our daily routines + day to day work by taking long drives on countryside roads in nature. When you r alone + you have time all the time in the world to observe ecosystems - you find a small inner place of salvation."
"At best, I am indifferent to this world. My resentment is mostly towards my parents + all other breeder who drag people like me into a world that no sane person would wish to impose on their worst enemy."
"This world is a sewer infested w rats, cockroaches + diseases in humanoid + establishment forms. I do not wish to be remembered or honoured by this world. I wish to engage as little w it as possible + I wish to be forever forgotten when I enter the peaceful realm of nothingness."
"Children are a bandaid solution to an everlasting existential problem, that magnifies the problem on an even grander scale by dragging more people into it."
Nature is cruel. We r created w sexual desires we seek to satisfy + gratify. After satisfying these animalistic urges for moments we are back to the state eternal existential dread. The child conceived distracts us only for so long before we realise our own stupidity. #Facepalm
From this world. I sometimes feel like living as a free person is only an illusion in my mind. I am in a much larger prison only w the illusion of freedom. Sometimes places where we are ostracised from normal people we consider crazy + vice versa is our only beacon of salvation.
"Function normally, I would probably rather have lived permanently in a mental institution, provided it was audited regularly + had to be managed ethically under a strict Code of Conduct. Surely, I’d find more stimulating interaction there. Id find a way to stay busy + I’d be safe"
"Confession: Although mental asylums carry a legacy of torture, suffering + abuse to their name, sometimes I feel as though these institutions have some elements of mercy + compassion to them. If this world drives me insane, sometimes to the point of psychosis with an inability to"
"Many ppl are critical of monarchies. Some people praise them. Some countries were better off as monarchies. I’m not a fan of castes, hierarchy + royalty, but I’m not a fan of big govts in general either. Minarchies r probably a good idea since ppl aren’t ready for anarchy."
"I find it amusing my newsfeed refers to Meghan Markle + Prince Harry as ""working members"" of the Royal Family. Aside from PR, photoshoots, interviews, events + travel, royals don't work, they sit on the throne of common wealth countries + taxpayers having mainly a ceremonial role"
"Mindless breeding = slaves, consumers, cattle to profit from, people to control, manipulate + abuse endlessly. Antinatalism is a solution that eradicates problems from the root, that is why it is so unpopular."
"Even if #antinatalism was easy to market, explain + sell to the masses, it would face a lot of backlash from the elite + powers believe they be... Antinatalism is the ultimate threat to mass consumption, oppressive, elitist, corrupt power structures."
"I’m contemplating buying a lego landmark set with thousands of pieces. I figure the nostalgia I had of lego as a child, plus a lot of downtime with much demotivation is a good reason to get something to keep me busy until I start my study if I get accepted into my course."
My friend asked me to watch the movie Instinct (1999) + I did. The film’s message strongly resonated with me bc I have always believed a civilisation that requires mass destruction + mass consumption for our survival is unsustainable.
It’s no coincidence that gifted + highly intelligent people commit suicide. They are bombarded with idiocracy + desire a one way express ticket out of this hell of an existence bc caring on is pointless.
Humans are so afraid of extinction that they have to create a superficial afterlife to cope with the fact they will die someday. #Religion
"Humans living unsustainably is catastrophic, suicide via ecological disasters. Humans refraining from procreation is a more peaceful route towards non-existence that only affects the last generation that remains alive. #Antinatalism"
You never have to worry about the future of your children + the future of the world if your genes aren’t invested in the human experiment. #Antinatalism
"Our egos create illusions of significance in a world where we fight for significance + recognition in a universe where these things are non-existent. As long as these things are non-existent, we will always experience a deep void within us. #Existentialism"
You ego fears nothingness bc you cannot bring yourself to acknowledge your insignificance to this world.
"If life is pointless, meaningless + everything is destined to wither away into dust, forever forgotten, why do people strive so hard to salvage the unsalvageable? #Antinatalism"
"People r threatened by the mere idea of human extinction, whether voluntary or involuntary. The idea of existence brings onto em uneasy feelings of indifference, bt non-existence invokes feelings of insignificance. The ego is the enemy in all this bc it desires to b acknowledged."
What You Should Never Say To Childfree Women   via @YouTube
I think they all are... in the midst of tragedy these life lovers still paint their faces with big fake smiles + happy positivity bc they don’t want their delusion to crumble.
My friend was telling me about the crown prince in a country found his future wife. He went to a girls school + picked a girl to be his wife + she wasn’t allowed to say no to his marriage proposal. I have always disliked too much extravagance + royalty. I prefer being a commoner.
"According to the logic of breeders, parenthood is rewarding bc you get to have a mini me who’s life you can control. I don’t see how that can be a prize. I don’t need a clone + I don’t need to control anybody’s life. #Antinatalism"
There is no justice in an unjust world. The justice system in most countries is a joke. I have some respect for countries that still have capital punishment + allow ownership of firearms. Harsh punishments is one way to ensure people do not commit crimes.
Cat videos always make me smile + cheer me up. What else could be better? Cats are the real bundle of joy in this life 😍😍😍.
The #childfree movement is a stepping stone towards removing parenthood from being a rite of passage when one reaches adulthood. That’s the first step to creating a world that accepts people who choose not breed.
"Society + the world of psychology treats people who are over the age of 30, single + childfree as dysfunctional. Relationships + parenthood are a rite of passage within a time frame. Instability in childhood creates fear of intimacy, so it’s better to be safe alone than sorry."
"The beauty of psychosis is experiencing a sense of oneness + feeling connected to a higher form of divinity. Unfortunately, I’m not strong enough to handle such experiences. Maybe it just wasn’t meant to happen for me in this lifetime."
"Hoarding is a manifestation of anxiety. Even when one tries to be a minimalist, if one was surrounded by hoarders for most of their life, it’s very hard to break free from that cycle. Minimalism is much harder than what we give it credit for."
"Starting a business means, you build it from the ground up, it’s based on your values + vision of the world + it is about living up to your expectations... instead of having children, people are better off starting businesses. #ChildFree"
"Starting a business is just like having a baby, except one meaninglessly consumes, and the other provides a much needed service creating more opportunities in the community. What’s better than a marriage proposal for an unstable person? A business partnership proposal!"
"Always being about energy... energy is everything... I rarely have any energetic connection with most people, at best I might be attracted to their work ethics or some of their personal qualities. Trauma, your family, environment + childhood shape you for the rest of your life."
"+ I was there for him thru thick + thin, now I’m gonna help him fight a lawsuit against his ex-employer, I will help him fight for justice in his industry + I’ll be his right hand woman once the purchase of our business is finalised. He deserves nothing bt the best. For me it’s"
Family. I knew my ex wouldn’t understand + not many ppl would understand our connection. I have had many miracles + synchronicities happen in my life that I can’t explain... this being one of them. He took care of me + never abandoned me while I was going through severe psychosis
"Adventures with this man. I have never invited a complete stranger to crash at my place before... I have never accepted a proposal for a business partnership with someone I just met on the spot, but it was his energy. His aura felt so familiar to me + he reminded me so much of my"
"I invite him back to my place + I let him crash in my room on my shaggy rug. I gave him the full 5-star treatment bc he’s from out of town. We became BFFs. I end my relationship w my partner, quit my job, I experience severe psychosis + I spend months travelling + going on crazy"
had come back frm a country where I lived. I told him my father used to work there + he told me his father worked in the same institution. Then I find out our fathers r FB friends + were backstabbed by the same person at work. He insists on buying me dessert + we spnt hrs talking
"Him to finish his phone call + when he didn’t, I walked up to him + handed him a note with no name or phone number + I walked away back to my car. He ended in his phone call + he followed me back to my car + we introduced ourselves to each other + within 5 minutes he mentioned he"
"I’m still in awe by the fact I was instantly attracted to an older man who was screaming on the phone distressed + walking around in circles. There was nothing about him that was physically attractive. It was his energy... he reminded me so much of my father, I waited 30 mins for"
"Some people radiate a long lost aura of familiarity one craves. You feel as though you’ve known them forever + the energetic spark feels magical, while simultaneously being eerie at the same time. You feel unprepared to handle such a connection bc it feels so out of this world."
"People think attraction to the opposite sex is always physical, in 95% of cases, that’s true... but in some rare instances, attraction is energetic. Sometimes ppls energetic blueprint is so strong, you can’t help but be drawn to it even if you have no physical attraction to them."
"I’m easily triggered by so many things. Voices, their tone, body language, behaviour and mannerisms that resemble my family always attract me. I feel drawn to what shaped me. I will always be attracted to dysfunction bc I never had healthy functional relationships in my life."
I’ll never understand the novelty of solid pure gold toilets... of all things Arab leaders can waste their money on... gold toilets 🤮🤮🤮
The truth of #antinatalism is like taking a bullet to your (delusional) head. Most people can’t handle it.
Life is all about selling people illusions + making empty promises.
"Having autism is like being a human computer with many programs downloaded into your hard drive, except social skills + difficulty reading people. #ASD"
"Is it possible to go from being suicidal, attempting to end your life every couple of months to fearing death?"
Eternal life is eternal death minus your replicated genes still in the gene pool. #Antinatalism
"The idea of dying one day, being ostracised by your peer group, giving into hormonal fears + conformities warrants contributing your genes to a meat grinder to suffer eternally until their time is up. #antinatalism"
Procreation is meaningless replication ad Infinitum. #antinatalism
A mass army of slaves that keep mindlessly replicating. #Breeders
Procreating is a temporary solution to a permanent existential problem. #Antinatalism
"You would think refraining from procreation is basic logic + common sense. Since it is unpopular, I think #antinatalism requires some level of consciousness. Common sense is non-existent when your meat suit is running on hormones + irrational fears."
"If everything in this world that we live in is upside down or back to front, that means that procreation is indeed evil + breeders are malevolent whether they are conscious of it or not. #Antinatalism"
Why have I been dreaming of cigarettes + suddenly craving them? I haven’t smoked a cigarette in about 9 months... it’s so weird to be dreaming of them all of a sudden.
"The thing I dread the most about flying, road trips + sailing is motion sickness. That and migraines can really ruin my adventures leading me to take a day or two to sleep and recover from the exhaustion."
"For the past 5 months I have taken a liking to watch my friends go fishing, long road trips to the middle of nowhere observing exotic birds I rarely see where I live + landscape photography. A crazy woman like me values an impulsive man who is childlike + hyper + adventurous."
Capitalism creates a world of snake oil salesmen looking for an easy way to make money + exploit the masses. #RandomThoughts
My dear friend told me that he believes kindness is the only antidote to heal the world. To this I agree. Notice how policies in the corporate world criminalise + punish kindness + reward cruelty. When we r denied the right to be kind bc of bureaucracy we end up w mental illness.
"The story ended tragically..but she made it out. She doesn’t have to work in a brothel anymore, she was reunited with her family + she got a job at a nail salon. To have someone risk so much to salvage kindness in another human being is so moving. It makes me value kindness more."
"I’m astonished by how kindness is overvalued by some people. To put it this way, I know someone who decided to put his marriage, family, reputation on the line to rescue a lady he met in a brothel who was a victim of human trafficking all bc she was a kind lady."
"In the last year or so, I am convinced that one of the most underrated qualities often overlooked is kindness. Kindness is not incentivised bc it’s perceived as a weakness in a predatory world. You have to conceal your kindness as a survival mechanism."
"One of the underrated advantages of coming from a narcissistic family is, most narcissistic families are quite isolated, schizoid, avoidant + self-sufficient. It’s nice to open up to people, but not needing most people + being okay on your own important as a survival mechanism."
"In Islamic societies, many parents who are obsessed w wealth, status + maintaining a perfect family image, pressure their children to get married + have families. This is used as a strategy to “tame” them. Often times, those families end up dysfunctional + everyone is miserable."
"Happiness alone, is d better option. Finding ways to keep stable, healthy, reciprocal relationships w ppl who will accept u as u r, helps w healing. If u can take care of pets, companionship from an animal is healing too. Children cannot create stability for dysfunctional adults."
The problem with most people who have Cluster B disorders is they want to be loved. They decide to baby trap a spouse in (often times an abusive relationship) + the children are used as mere instruments of gratification. Learning to accept the road less travelled + trying to find
"When u r emotionally immature + on some level you know u r unhealthy + u were denied a healthy stable upbringing, how can you expect to raise happy healthy children? Accepting you are in a permanent state of childhood on some level means acknowledging you’re unfit to raise kids."
"Traditionally collectivist societies that are stuck in their ways + are obsessed with status + wealth tend to be more narcissistic. Parents deny their children a childhood, they view their children as extensions of themselves + they see their children as competition."
Narcissistic men tend to feel the most alive with borderline women. These people create dysfunctional children especially if those children do not have healthy adults around to care + mentor them. Children cannot raise other children - chaos only creates more dysfunction.
"Childlike people are exhausting to be around, but they are the most loyal, the people with the biggest hearts + the people who get hurt the most."
"Creative people who are inventors tend to be extremely childlike + a bit impulsive. People with high levels of intelligence tend to be very naive, trusting + gullible. The worst people around are those who perceive kindness as a weakness."
"People with Cluster B personality disorders are essential emotionally immature children stuck in adult bodies. Psychologically speaking, I have always feared emotionally mature adults + I have only ever felt safe with people who have a childlike nature to them. #selfawareness"
I did everything right in life... it got me nowhere... it took falling down on my face several times to realise the game is rigged + you can never win when the ruling elites + your parents are narcissists or psychopaths. #ThursdayThoughts
"I am eternally grateful to feminists + the medical community who have alleviated women from the burdens of menstruation, pregnancy + childbirth. #Gratitude"
Antinatalist society on Instagram posted a video of a vagina torn apart by child birth getting stitched back up. I remember having a conversation with mum about this years ago... the idea of having a gaping wound near my areas of secreting excrements terrifies me 😵. #ChildFree
"Who would have thought, one man who ripped apart peoples family’s could bring two families closer together?"
"Most people who I have seen have “good” lives inherit them. It’s about who their parents are + who they know. Meritocracy is the ultimate joke. Perhaps if more people could realise the illusion of meritocracy, less people would breed bc they’d acknowledge they are nobodies."
"Nepotism is determining factor of success in life. Most breeders r nobodies + children born are less likely to become better off than their parents. Aside from the unborn, who yr parents are + what they have matters. It determines a lot more outcomes of your life than you think."
You r involuntarily dragged into play games u never signed up for. The first is life... then at work/school u r forced to play games to survive for the sake of yr livelihood even when u don’t want to play... I’m tired of playing games. I hate when ppl drag me into their bullshit.
There is no winner takes all in the futilitarian game of life. The real winners take nothing and the losers have nothing to lose. #Antinatalism
My psychiatrist seemed to be understanding of my views on euthanasia + my lifelong existential dread. He said he wasn’t looking to change who I am. He wrote me a script for medication + said I didn’t have to take it if I didn’t want to. I felt fortunate to have a shrink like him.
There are no prizes worth winning in this life. The real winners rest in a peaceful realm of non-existence. You don’t need to leave behind yr genes to feel immortal. The way to wisdom is to recognise your parents mistakes + to not repeat them. Immortality is a futilitarian anyway
"Everybody is trying to look for a ticket out of this nightmare of an existence, but humans are so selfish, they deny future generations true freedom + salvation by ruthlessly imposing life on them. #Antinatalism"
The only way to avoid death (for future sentient beings) is by not creating life. #Antinatalism
Advocating for human extinction is advocating for compassion... giving into our survival instincts by passing down our genes is a one way ticket to hell with no return. #Antinatalism
"The only thing all breeders give their children, in terms of inheritance, is inheriting the burden of existence. #Antinatalism"
Growing out a pixie haircut is hard work. I’m not getting a pixie haircut again unless my hair gets very thin + I can pull off the hairstyle again...
"What would you do if you had free will? For me, I would cultivate extreme self-discipline, a stronger work ethic + I would fight against all my feelings of hopelessness + helplessness + try to do better in life. I didn’t sign up for the shit, but I’m better than this dark void."
"I think of human as similar to those in the dystopia film, Brave New World - when u hv a mental breakdown, it is like a biological robot malfunctioning + going to mental health services is like being reprogrammed or being indoctrinated again to be quiet + not question the system."
"Mental illness is most probably caused by humans being denied their right to have any form of reality pressured to conform to a robotic corporate world. Humans need true purpose, a strong support system, connection, to be valued... modern existence denies these things."
"Mental illness is rampant, common + most people have suffered from it at least at some point in their life. In a sense, the powers that believe they be make it very difficult for people not to get mentally ill. Then pharmaceuticals profit from the mental illness."
I found it flattering that some right wing pronatalist breeder had featured my tweet in one of their videos critiquing antinatalism calling many people in our philosophy mentally ill. Modern day existence makes it hard for someone to stay healthy + not become mentally ill.
"The murder of James Bulger is a good example of this... that story is tragic. Children create a lot of controversy, bc on one hand they are protected in some way by society bc they are underaged + on the other hand they themselves suffer at the hands of society."
One thing that makes me despise children that is a taboo nobody talks about is child on child sexual abuse. Children abuse + traumatise other children particularly those younger + weaker than them. Inability to 100% safeguard your offspring is enough reason to not breed.
"Incels are correct about many claims they make about female nature, what I find the most off putting about them is their misogyny - although I understand it to some extent. Humans are superficial - looks, money + status are everything in life. The breeding game is shallow."
"In a world where the game of privilege is rigged + meritocracy is a lie, it’s better to be born with average intelligence or to be intellectually disabled bc at least you can still find joy in the simple things in life. The price of intelligence is misery, pain + loneliness."
"I have met abt 3 guys w IQs in the 140 range - they seem to have good careers, earn a lot of money r enterprising + still more stimulating to me than the average normie. People with higher intelligence than that (at least the ones I engaged with) r dysfunctional w mental issues."
Sometimes be difficult for you. Intelligent people are undesirable bc they are a threat to those in power + normies also feel threatened by them. This why many commit suicide or become addicted to substances easily. Their existence is exhausting + they become lazy.
"Intelligence is a curse in an idiocratic world. It’s hard to find friends, people to socialise with + you’re hypersensitive. Your brain processes information differently to neurotypicals + you have too much going on inside at once. You create masterpieces but simple tasks can..."
"Ppl w IQs around 140 r lucky bc they are intelligent but can still function in society. People w IQs above 140 close to 150 + above tend to be mentally ill, have difficulty functioning in society. Their intelligence is a handicap + an impairment which is why many commit suicide."
I resent the fact I need to have friends in life. The good ones always move far away + I barely see or hear from them again + I get attached to them... I hate the idea of getting attached to people only to experience losing them all over again.
"If there is anything I thank my parents for is educating me not to buy things I cannot afford, to make cash only purchases, to try + save most of what I make + be frugal. I cannot understand people (besides those who have mortgages) who pay for things by instalments."
"is one of the Popes in the Catholic Church. The Vatican murdered him bc he was against usury. Some say that globalists fight wars against Islamic countries bc Islam is against usury, but the funny part is that many Islamic banks actually deal with interest."
"If there's anything I take from my religious upbringing, that is being against usury. I am not a big fan of profiting off of people struggling financially. Usury is enslaving people + creating money out of thin air. Powerful ppl who opposed usury were often killed. Best example.."
"1.) They convince themselves their communities will grow stronger if there is more of them.   2.) Hormones, pheromones, charm + a fear of loneliness.   3.) They convince themselves they will indoctrinate their kids to be eco-conscious environmental warriors.  Its all delusion."
"When you have children committing suicide, its a reflection of a much bigger problem. When progenitors decide to procreate without at least trying to improve the situation in their communities, children can see the world is shit + death is the only way out."
"When you have friends who are breeders, you only congratulate them for having a child as a formality. Deep down inside you wish they could understand antinatalism, but the AN philosophy is so uncomfortable + so deep, they will never get it. Better to have childfree friends."
"Today at group therapy, a girl close to my age told our group she had a miscarriage last week. She started crying + some of the other ppl in the group cried too. I felt absolutely emotionless. When u realise how evil existence is, u can’t sympathise with the loss of their child."
"I’m not as friendly or approachable even when I try to be nice bc I’m autistic. Having a lack of expression, feeling uncomfortable initiating interactions w other people makes you kind of awkward... it doesn’t bother me much bc I don’t have much to talk abt w normies anyway."
"I found out that Singapore recycles + purifies it’s sewerage water + people are comfortable with drinking it. I like they fact they recycle their waste + sewerage water, but doesn’t drinking water that was once sewerage water gross people out? #RandomThoughts"
"People who are abused, take on characteristic traits of their abusers. Those who have been abused can either become abusers or they can heal + become healers. Often times, the cycle of abuse continues..."
"Fortunately, there are religious people who believe in contraception + do not see it as wrong, but many times contraception fails... + when that happens, the ProLife mindset kicks in + people still have the child anyway. The opinion on contraception divides religious ppl."
"This exact mindset is why you will see people in Muslim countries who have 5-7+ kids, living on one salary or struggling financially still being happy they have many children even when they acknowledge their pregnancies are unplanned. Bc God will always provide for their kids."
"Religious people procreate more than irreligious people. Even when they cannot afford to have children, religious people are convinced that God will provide sustenance for their children + having an abortion is showing lack of gratitude towards God + rejecting his “gift”."
"Everything in life is about other people. Unconditional love is non-existent. You are expected to serve others, gratify them, please them, to dress nicely for others, to tell others what they want to hear, to blend in with others. Living for others can only satisfy you so much."
"Originating frm an authoritarian dictatorship is v eyeopening. When hunger, social climbing, backstabbing, war + economic hardship r the norm, u see what human nature for wht it really is. Democratic countries r better at hiding it, bt human nature is still the same. #Misanthropy"
"You are a biological robot who is not in control, you have no free will, you are shaped by the first 7 years of your life, your genes, environmental, social + physiological factors. Existence is not empowering but overbearing. Sad few people see it that way. #Antinatalism"
"You are born into this world as a human, yet the system that is in control in this world is anti-human. Humanity is penalised if it does not play a role in helping the gigantic machine function. Being human in today’s world means being a machine that is dead."
"If you lack ruthlessness, it’s hard to survive in this world..."
"Many of us have to kill the humanity within ourselves just to be able to function normally in this world. Frankly, Idk how to do that while still feeling good about myself. The only way I see myself materially succeeding or thriving is by being reliant on some substances."
"I watched the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street” - in order to succeed financially as a stock trading broker  the protagonist was heavily reliant on cocaine, adderall, alcohol, prostitutes + ruthlessness to kill the humanity inside him. It’s very eyeopening..."
How is it possible to remain prolife in a capitalist world rampant with overpopulation? How does human life remain “sacred” when commodification cheapens human existence?
Existence is like being a small helpless animal on a terrifying conveyor belt that eventually leads you to fall deeply into a flaming pit of hellfire into the jaws of death. #Antinatalism
"Nationalism, religion + control of demographics is one of the reasons why some people have children. They are idiots - continuing your existence via your offspring is not a prize... ongoing suffering of your offspring makes you the real loser. #Antinatalism"
"Trying to show you can dominate animals or vulnerable humans by being abusive is disturbing. These people crave to be respected, but such behaviour doesn’t warrant any respect IMHO. It’s better to be feared than to be loved, but being an abuser isn’t always the solution."
"I hold animals to a high level of respect + reverence, more so than humans. I still remember when this girl I used to work with told me she saw a man abusively yelling at a dog + she wanted to call someone + report him for animal abuse bc she was concerned for the dog’s safety."
"My friend’s ex-boss bought his dog into work one day + decided to spit in the dog’s face in front of his employees in staff room during their tea break. He talks abt shooting rabbits w a gun on his lifestyle property for fun. For some reason, I found his behaviour v disturbing."
Your parents are rarely interested in seeing you happy. Everything is mostly about them preserving their image in front of others. When you fail to conform to that image you are a failure. #Narcissism
"Children are instruments of gratification for their parents, until they become overbearing, difficult to control or parents just get sick of them. #ChildFree #Antinatalism"
"People work hard to try + get ahead in life. Those who become wealthy + successful find prize at the top is loneliness. Every journey’s final destination leads to loneliness. It’s better to be worry-free, comfortable + lonely than to have worries, be uncomfortable + among a herd."
"People think antinatalists are mentally ill, just bc the philosophy is very pessimistic. I guess anything that doesn’t give you a hit of dopamine, escapism or fails to align with the mainstream narrative is a mental illness."
"Civilisation has solved basic problems, but created a myriad of new problems to replace the old ones it “resolved”... we have reached many developments + advancements, but there is still no real prize at the top. The real prize is non-existence + escaping meaninglessness."
Civilisation + technological advancement can only get you so far in life... the problems humans can never resolve are...  1.) Futility 2.) Meaninglessness  #Antinatalism
"Life is a cult of endless + meaningless suffering. Since misery loves company, there’s always a reason for breeders to bring more people into this world. #Antinatalism"
"Many yrs ago, I joined a dating site as an experiment to try + find a friend who can keep me intellectually stimulated. I met this guy who told me he was autistic + he asked me if I’m autistic. He had an IQ of 140. He was the first to assume I’m autistic before anyone else."
"If I am penalised for my disability, I can take legal action on the grounds of discrimination against me for my disability. I’m sick + tired of people trying to change me or punish me for being myself. This makes me feel better about pissing off my employer + flatmate last year."
"I’m happy to have been diagnosed with autism is bc..  1.) I finally have an excuse/reason to not be forced to be in crowded places.   2.) I have a justification for my introversion, lack of social skills + unwillingness to engage with people.   This disability works in my favour."
"There r ppl who believe in eugenics + advocate for autistic people to be aborted. Being recently diagnosed as autistic, I have always found it hard to function in a neurotypical world... I’m not for eugenics, but if my mother had aborted me, I’d be much better off. #JustSaying"
This is the second time I have used my Dyson vacuum stick to vacuum scary creepy crawlie bugs to remove them from my room +  discard them outside. The idea of dealing with some insects terrifies me a little. I’m happy they still get to live without terrorising me.
"The more society cannot control you, the more they fear you + the happier (but much lonelier) you will be."
"pays v well, is scarce + in high demand so you will always have the upper hand. One of my biggest regrets in my 20s was studying something I'm passionate about instead of something that pays a lot of money. Financial freedom + living comfortably is more important than you think."

"Last week my friend got unfairly dismissed from his job bc of a misunderstanding + an ex-colleague who hated him + fabricated lies as an excuse to fire him. I picked him up from work + we went home, I took him to see a lawyer + I'm in the process of helping him build up a case..."
What infuriates me is the fact that people make bad financial decisions or they waste their money on unnecessary extravagance + then they complain that they are constantly broke or cant buy food. Poor management of financial resources is ones own fault.
"When I was on holiday, I saw a shop owner restraining + attacking a man who had stolen a drink from his shop. He was threatening to call the police. If I was in his position, I would have turned a blind eye to it."
People r starting to show more empathy towards those enduring hardships. There r shop owners who will have a fridge w free food + drinks poor ppl can help themselves to. A child who is punished for trying to meet their unmet needs grows up to hv problems in life caused by society
Last year I watched a movie based on real life stories of children abused in state care. There were children locked up in boys homes who were badly abused simply for being born poor + stealing something like a loaf of bread. How society treats children says a lot about its nature
"You would think after the industrial revolution, people would have less children... but the opposite happened... we experienced modernity, technology + vaccines. Children became an economic burden on their families, yet more people seem to procreate. It makes no sense."
"Being alone in a jacuzzi makes me feel as tho I’m in a heavenly sanctuary of eternal peace. Especially w relaxing music, silence, the birds singing + a book to read with my favourite bath bombs. It’s sad we have polluted our natural waters so baths are the closest thing to peace."
"It’s interesting autistic ppl love water bc it stimulates their senses. Before I left my apartment, I started to find joy taking long baths everyday w bath bombs. Water reminds us of once feeling safe in womb + we strive to emulate that peacefulness + return back to nothingness."
I find it amusing when business owners who are much older men hire young inexperienced women in their late teens + early twenties who are incompetent. The lose productivity for the price of eye candy.
Religion thrives on magical thinking. Magical thinking is a symptom of narcissism + is a characteristic common among people with Cluster B traits. Religion glorifies procreation as a sacred miraculous gift + thats magical thinking. #Antinatalism
This young girl who accidentally got pregnant + was a newly wed w a baby came to stay w him. I was concerned for her safety. I gave her a lift to her mother’s place + I dropped a hint to her that she should leave the place ASAP. Luckily she had her husband around to protect her.
Would pretend to train them. He would ask these women to invite younger men to come so things would not look suspicious. He would pick arguments over petty things + take ppls belongings. My friend caught on he didn’t charge these women any rent. He was v creepy.
"Last year, a friend of mine had rented a room at this funeral home run by a shady war veteran. This man had rented rooms in his house only to younger tenants who were in their late teens or early 20s. The bedrooms had no locks on them, he rented specifically to younger women +"
"The people who benefit from spoils of war, including children who become orphaned are pedophiles. Corrupted dictators who protect children from predators are the enemies of politicians who are pedophiles. The primary beneficiaries of warfare are always pedophiles."
I never thought I wud quit my job. During my experience of psychosis I began to carefully observe my clients + I noticed behaviour signs they had that were correlated w sexual abuse. It drove me insane + it terrified me. I couldn’t deal w it. That straw tht broke the camels back.
When somebody chooses not to reach out to you for the sake of fake sympathy + with an agenda to extract information from you - you respect them. Narcissism manifests differently in men + women. The most cowardice people who are those who are passive aggressive.
"There is a huge difference between schadenfraude in men + in women. When I lost my job many yrs ago, women kept harassing me for the sake of gossiping and abusing me. When I worked with mostly men, none of them harassed me or indulged in suffering I endured that led me to resign."
Keeping people infantilised well into adulthood is profitable for those in power.
"Keeping people mentally distressed people in a permanent state of distressed childhood makes it easier for abusers to continue their abuse into adulthood, or to at least profit from other people suffering."
"Happy Valentines Day to everybody. If you decide to spend some time with your significant other, please be careful + do not procreate. The world does not need any more human beings. #childfree #antinatalism"
Biden is essentially a puppet of the Chinese and part of the Deep State. Trump was being demonised bc he was against the Deep State and was fighting it. That is why there is this big smear campaign against him.
When Trump took office it was indirectly a victory for them bc the democrats (+ Clinton Foundation) had sponsored terrorist groups in their respective countries. People are concerned about American politics bc of how US foreign policy affects their countries.
"It’s very rare to have a US President in office who avoids warfare in the Middle East. Many political commentators warned people in the Middle East, that when Biden takes office we should expect to see more unrest in the Middle East. People in other regions had also told me that"
#UnpopularOpinions Trump was the best president since JFK. Bc there were no wars or conflicts in the Middle East or other places during his presidency + he got rid of General Qassem Sulaimani who was responsible for many bloodbaths in Iraq by Iranian militia groups.
Being diagnosed with autism explains my lack of emotional intelligence + need for personal space + lots of alone time. It also explains my lack of desire for relationships (or non-conventional ones). My poor social skills + sensitivity make holding a high stress job difficult.
"The ultimate myth we have been sold is that one person can meet all our needs. This is not true. This is why arranged marriages are more practical + more functional than love marriages, bc both parties know the relationship is transactional from the beginning early on."
"Are actually happy. When you come to realise your tastes are non-conventional bc you’re autistic + you prefer to be alone or have lots of space in a relationship, you happily turn a blind eye to your partner cheating, but you yourself don’t cheat, bc you can’t meet their needs."
"Feelings for another man in order to cheat. Prof. Sam Vaknin, proposed we have marriage contracts that r renewed every 3 years for childfree couples + every 7 years for couples with children. I think this is a good idea. People fall out of love all the time. Only 5% of marriages"
"In the past, male infidelity was socially accepted, and women turned blind eyes to their unfaithful husbands whose needs they could not meet. Male infidelity is forgivable bc a man could still cheat + love his wife, yet female infidelity was unforgivable bc a woman had to have..."
"He did everything right... he pursued the career his parents wanted, he married the woman they chose for him, he was a clean, honest man of integrity + all he did was get punished for it. This is the world we live in, everything is inverted + you can’t please narcissists."
Procreation is inarguably the ultimate form of narcissism...   The need to clone urself for immortality gambling w a sentient life form w/o their consent... someone you see as an extension of yourself with no independence or free will... it’s depressing as hell.   #Antinatalism
"Perhaps, we got to stage of being dominated by narcissism + that’s not such a bad thing, bc children cannot raise other children. Maybe we are supposed to get sick w this mind virus to begin end of our demise. If being healthy leads to narcissism then narcissism is inevitable."
"It’s ironic when you listen to the world leading expert on narcissism who on one hand tells you life is meaningless + you’re not better off than your parents + procreation is narcissism, yet criticises a society where people don’t procreate + delay adulthood milestones as sick."
"As long as we r part of nature, we will always have Stockholm syndrome.. It was nature + people’s inability to control their biological instincts that created us, but even when we want to isolate from nature somehow we find ourselves indulging in her beauty to recharge ourselves."
"For the past couple of months, I have been going on nature trips with my friend to remote places. He’s into action nature photography... I have witnessed many natural miracles which puts me at a crossroads between my concern for our ecosystems + the idea efilism is better for us."
Procreation is a deceptive trap designed to create lifelong interdependent connections with people by dragging + gambling with lives of innocent non-consenting individuals deceived into lifelong worshipping + reverence of those who oppressed them. #Antinatalism
"Life is a series of...   1.) Ongoing, time consuming menial tasks required for our survival.  2.) Wage slavery to be able to afford the luxury of survival in a coerced existence. 3.) Constant series of distractions to mentally escape + avoid contemplating the burden of existence."
"Survival involves self-deception + belief in many lies to distract people from uncomfortable truths. The more rabbit holes there are, the busier + more distracted we become + this enables us to continue our prolonged survival."
"Loneliness + intelligence go hand in hand. Being intelligent is very lonely, bc it is much better to be alone than to have to dumb yourself down to become more desirable to other people you have little to nothing in common with."
I watched a couple of videos from Inmendham during my hiatus... I need to rewatch + take some notes for future reference...
"Procreation opens a fascist pandora's box of sexism, eugenics, classism, nationalism... so many problems that prescribe procreation as a solution to many so-called ""social problems"" that are in actual fact stupid, retarded + meaningless."
Sexism + eugenics r not that different. India + China are both projected to have a high population of incels due to the # of female foetuses aborted. Single men have always been perceived as a threat historically to the state. Procreation seems to have elements of fascism in it.
"I once heard an argument that organised religion is about collectively sacrificing freedoms and autonomy for the sake of a better society... I won't deny some religions promote some ideals beneficial to society, but I still don't like the idea of sacrificing some freedoms."
Organised religion is the ultimate cope. You have to be dirtier than the rigged game to win. Religion is there to create more losers + ppl who actually convince themselves bad guys will be punished + goodness is rewarded..religion is a bandaid solution to existentialism + coping.
"A technocracy where we hv limited interaction with human beings is a dream for many people on the spectrum, myself included. My concern is the greed of tech companies + planned obsolescence + the e-waste generated by our gadgets..being isolated is good but there is always a cost."
"One of the biggest scams in the 21st Century is recycling in 1st world countries. The majority of plastic waste is shipped to developing and third world countries to deal with our waste, and we are stuck buying all these products that come in plastic packaging contributing to it."
"Someone once pointed out to me how dirty streets have become in comparison to a decade ago... nothing can be further from the truth. l see city councils everywhere funding rubbish bins, yet people still litter in the streets like its nothing. I find it very disturbing."
"Autism + High IQ make life 10x more difficult. High IQ people tend to be more depressed bc they see life for what it is. Autistic people are honest, with no filters + they struggle with social norms. When they speak truths no one dares to speak, they realise how lonely they are."
"In the past, people accepted that one day they would die. Now we see a resistance towards something we know is inevitable. All these quarantines, vaccines... people's love of cosmetic surgery + anti-aging products... its an addiction to immortality... just as procreation is too."
"Pedophiles are among the most heinous people who have ever walked the earth. Breeders gamble with the lives of children. Antinatalism is the only antidote to pedophilia, and pedophilia is a rampant cancer that thrives among many circles... this is one reason AN is under attack."
"In the past year, I have tried to explain  #antinatalism to many people in my life. They still do not get it. It goes to show how much procreation is deeply ingrained in us. Even when life has given us shit, we still justify replicating more sacks of shit like its nothing."
"It's been a year since I left Twitter... so much in my life has changed. I think maybe I found a reason to continue living... its a cycle, you get depressed, you try something new and you try to distract yourself from dying, right?"
"Two days ago, my psychiatrist officially diagnosed me with Autism Spectrum Disorder - that's one more thing for me to add as a reason to not procreate. #Antinatalism"
