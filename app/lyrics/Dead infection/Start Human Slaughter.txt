Start human slaughter till the very end
Blessing of bloody God comes to grief
In the dead of night helpless bodies
Excrete their souls, it's a sin of life
Tumour of rancid minds
Ungrateful destiny
Defective form of life
Carbonized bones
Prayers of holy priests are a swinish stuff
Here comes the evil to take human flesh
Vomited out rotten remains, it's a question of the present days
Eclipse of moon has come, night of dead despair
Nobody lives, slaughter has come
Holy ghost takes their minds
Nobody has believed in this nightmare
It's time to start human slaughter

Crush your f**king mind, you don't see your own face
Horror of your life is a sign of truthEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
