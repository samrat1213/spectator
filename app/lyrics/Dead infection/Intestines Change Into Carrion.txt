Helpless limb, silent minds
Vulgar mass, eats your flesh
Putrid carrion, lasting pain
Eaten life, death is certain
Pain, scream, groan
Your blood is like a
Pus which is gore
Your flesh is full of
Biles, pus and scurfs
Repulsive stench of
Dead, sordid flesh
Your death is brutal
Biles, pus and scurfs
Your flesh is like a dead, stinking dog you
Change into remains
Which are dead, last chance
Is gone, but burnt
Dead flesh is blent
With black carbonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
