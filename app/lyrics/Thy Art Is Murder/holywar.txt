Die for Christ
Die for Allah
Die for Jerusalem
Die for Torah

Father and son
Marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through
The skulls of the children

Holy war
Mortars and martyrs
Holy war
Unholy followers
Holy war
Brainwashed with death
Holy war
Unholy mess

I reject the laws of the misguided
False prophets imprison nations
Fueling self annihilation
I reject pocket lined political demons
Who arm the ignorant for election season

The empires burned in sand
The history of the failures of man
Armies of guardians servants of bibles
Reciting verses as they stand before rifles

Millions of lives erased
Hatred marked as madness
Violence in leaves of scriptures
A world a flame with malice

We will all die for nothing

There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of hell

There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of hell

Holy war
Mortars and martyrs
Holy war
Unholy followers
Holy war
Brainwashed with death
Holy war
Unholy mess

Die for Christ
Die for Allah
Die for Jerusalem
Die for Torah

Father and son
Marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through
The skulls of the children

Holy war

Holy war

We will all die for nothing

We will all die for nothing
