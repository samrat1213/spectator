Officinal - immiscible compounds are mixed,
A gagging expectorate, of lysergic acids,
Premensely emerced, consciousness slowly sips,
Peculated, in an ebriat(i?)ng narcocis...

...Cataleptic,
Imbibe...neurotripsick...

Neurally numbed, a narcosis so trans-lucid,
So pernicious, halluciagenics,
Procreating, ocular contorting,
Your idiosyncrassy, is now expropriated...

...Extirpation,
Mind...termination...
