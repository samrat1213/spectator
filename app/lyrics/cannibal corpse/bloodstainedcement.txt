Stalking his prey
He prepares for the ambush
I hear his steps
But without trepidation
Hyper aware
I will strike back

When he brandished the blade
Gave his intentions away

Back to the wall, I have no choice
It's time to fight or die
I will respond with overwhelming force
A switch turns on and I must survive

Fearless resolve
As I spring into action

Quickly disarm
And remove his advantage
Only one thing on my mind
Stop his attack

Now he's on the defense
Momentum is shifting my way

A savage brawl, I hear his voice
Pure terror in his cries
Break his balance, slam him to the ground
Following through to stay alive

Landing multiple bowls
The blood is starting to spray

Will not stop till I am sure
The threat has been put down
Raining with forearm thrusts
Torrents of blood flow from his eyes
Bloodstained cement

No weakness to exploit
His ambush failed
Hammer fists break facial bones
Knuckles bleed from shards of teeth

Smash his skull onto pavement
Make the bastard pay
Don't stop until it cracks
And spills out his brain

Bloodstained cement

When he chose me as prey
A fatal mistake was made
