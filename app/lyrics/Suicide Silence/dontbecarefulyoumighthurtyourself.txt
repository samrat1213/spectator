I have seen all your faces
Wherever the lights get dim it all feels the same to me

You expect me to fail
So go ahead and choke me on down

What are these fucking restrictions
What are these fucking attempts on my soul
We were always meant to circle
It is the only thing we know
It is the only thing we know

So go ahead and choke me on down
I am such a goddamned failure
Choke on this motherfucker, choke
Choke on this motherfucker

Somehow it is safe to fail
Somehow it's so safe to fail
Somehow it is safe to fail
Somehow it's so safe to fail

You must really love to hope this face will fail
I don't want to watch you doubt this place to death

Let
Let time
Let time stand still
Lower me 
Lower me
Lower me down

Somehow it is safe to fail
Somehow it's so safe to fail

You must really love to hope this face will fail
Let time stand still
I don't want to watch you doubt this place to death
Lower me down

Somehow it is safe to fail
Somehow it's so safe to fail

Lower me down
Lower me down
