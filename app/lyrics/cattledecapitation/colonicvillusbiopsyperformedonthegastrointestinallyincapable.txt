Obese pathetic creature
Exaggerated, consuming anatomical features
Years of sloth and unfit diet have created this gastrointestinal nightmare
Biopsy performed
1,000 strains of cancer
Goiters, tumors, rectal decay
Anally emaciate

Dire need for colonics
Advanced restructure now gives way
Pressurized antibacterial spray
Excess remains for a dish to saute
Inept of happiness and incapable of a normal existence
Ever ingesting abscess
Malignant offal-cavern of human cess
Biopsy performed
1,000 brains no answer
Superceding our knowledge of anatomy with the ferocious virulence of pathology

All attempts have failed
We're losing him
Last ditch effort for preservation
The remains are felched or munged and spat out into a jar of formaldehyde

Ever ingesting abscess
7 years of fecal decay--eaten from inside and withered away--cauterized rectum of colonic waste
You are the victim and embarrassingly, you die
Exposed blackened innards of digestion
Closed casket funeral time

Biopsy hypothesis: subject neglected by life
Superceding our knowledge of anatomy with the ferocious virulence of pathology
Ever ingesting abscess
Malignant offal-cavern of human cess
Goiters, tumors, rectal decay
Anally emaciate

Culinary...
Scatology...
Disease....
On feces, I feed

Dire need for colonics
Advanced restructure now gives way and emptied into the hands of a physician
A gastrointestinal plague survives
