Inborn, lack of conscience
I think but cannot feel
Affectations
Manipulations
Victims bend to my will

Passed through generations
Murderous ways
Proclivity for violence
No remorse of shame

Murder, a fascination
Dispatching those who trust
My compulsion

Fleeting fulfillment
No joywill ever last

The soulless walk among you
Concealed by deceit
Smiling when I face you
Slashing when I turn

This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation
Driving me

Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain

This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weaking

Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die

Legacy, abnormality
The ladder twists, and the rungs are broken
Impregnate, and the vector spreads

Momentum shifts, and I start controlling
Parasite, of morality
Malevolent, eyes are empty
Merciless, I cannot care

This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation driving me

Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain

This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weaking

Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die
