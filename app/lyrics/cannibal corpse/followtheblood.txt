Poised and ready to strike
Anticipation of the hunt drawing near
Fueled by hatred and spite
If this don't kill them it will fill them with fear
Opposing forces now retreat on the run
They got their asses handed to them hours ago
Now in pursuit of the survivors who fled
Closing the gap soon many more will be dead

Attrition breaking the enemy
Detecting tracks, begin the hunt

Where is their savior now?
Where do they hide? Follow the blood
Nothing can save them now
They will be found, follow the blood

Enemy spotted, converge, fire at will
Fire at will

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one
Fire at will

Where is their savior now?
Where do they hide? Follow the blood
Nothing can save them now
They will be found, follow the blood

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one

Fire at will
