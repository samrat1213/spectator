Sticking to the walls of your insides
A corrosive enzyme lives and breathes
Only to be excreted
With help of fiber and balanced diet
Tilting equilibrium
Makes way for nausea
Rectal muscle gives way
Flooding down your leg
Enhanced nutrition
Sliding right through the body
No time to digest
Colon bursts out the chest
Sickening stench
Of methane and bile
Colon blows like a rubber hose
The sweet odor invades your nose
Trying to grab your gasmask
Sometimes an uneasy task
When your pubis is dismembered from your abdomen
