We're born to be the corpses
We're here for love and happiness
Our power is in our own hands
Watch as we dance smiling
Dancing corpse
Rulers of the universe
Here they belong
Happy and strong
Here we are, corpses of the universe
Dancing on your guts
Full of energy, in love and proud
But with rotten legsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
