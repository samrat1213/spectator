Home laboratory turned mortuary
Experimental transplants and surgery
Using bleach and corrosives to make zombies
Gaping cranium sutured with epoxy
Homemade walking dead
Bumbling retard with scab for a head
Chained to its own crib
Bits of food and pus line its bib
Serum made of bleach and nail polish remover
Tested for speech skills, cognitive, and motor
Mutant strain of human brain dead
My hands-red with curiosity
