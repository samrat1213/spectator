Burglary took place in our city Bialystok
The victim was Mr. Rwiesiek of Otrzewna Street
The burglars were able to work undisturbed
And got away with a large number of valuable articles
Blood burglars, they broke all the windows
They even eviscerated a cat, and they ate it
After that Mr. Rwiesiek thought to himself
That he needs to put a new lock on his front door
But the lock reminded him of something else
The his front door needs a new coat of paint
During lock exchanging
Mr. Rwiesiek cit himself with a screwdriver
Awhile he started painting
The paint got into his wound and soon he died...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
