Drawn out
The fires black the sky above
As I conspire in sanctums below
Its true form released spewing out through the
Molten earth and stone
Relentless agony reborn into the soul

Departed from my mortal host
My inner chaos unleashed
I watch from this throne
Through gates of untold misery

Run if you think it will save you
As you are hunted one by one
Pray if you think it will save you
As this hatred blacks out the sun

Relinquish your faith in your dying breath
As this evil infects your own
Pathetic lives spent oppressed by his lies
A disease spills on the world

Reborn from the flames I arise
Reborn to black out the light

Drawn out
The fires black the sky above
As I conspire in sanctums below
Its true form released spewing out through the
Molten earth and stone
Relentless agony reborn into the soul

Pure evil
Has no remorse
The darkest days of earth
Are yet to run their course

Departed from my mortal host
My inner chaos unleashed
I watch from this throne
Through gates of untold misery

Crucified in fire and gloom
Let their children burn
Suffer as you are buried alive
Within the earth
