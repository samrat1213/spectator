Bring out your dead
Herald the waning hours
Extinction level event
Heaven sent or hell-bent
No act of god
Catastrophic force majeure

There will be flood!
There will be fire!
There will be death!

Exfoliation brings new life
Extermination and re-genesis
All hail the new dawn

All hail extinction!
All hail revenge!
All hail destruction!
All hail death!

Organisms by the trillions
Extinct in an instant
Flushing the scum returning to ruin...

Cataclysmic upheaval of every scar left by man
Payback is a bitch and we call her "mother earth"
She shivers we fall, she vomits - we drown
We are the cancer and in turn we are killers

All hail extinction!
All hail revenge!
All hail destruction!
All hail death!

A blip on the screen.
A grain of sand in the hourglass.
Never to see the new dawn.
...FAILURES.
