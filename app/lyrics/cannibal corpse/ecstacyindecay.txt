Immense oceans of gore
Rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth, abnormal wealth
Immenced in a world of decadence

Ecstacy in decay, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure, pervading of viscera
Rejoice in gristly disgust, exorbitant reality
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates

Ecstacy in decay, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure, pervading of viscera
Rejoice in gristly disgust, exuberant castigation
Wading in bile, soaking in guts, ancient innards

Immense oceans of gore
Rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth
Abnormal wealth immenced in a world of decadence

Mind altered, eternally fetid cadaverous empire, squelched domain
Swamped ruins, dismal necrotic incarnate metropolis
Lost dwelling, exorbitant reality, obfuscated ossuary
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates
