I don't need a lot, but there's one thing love has taught me
It's to never expect too much
Don't need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you

Don't need mine, I found mine
Why should we be wasting time?

You don't know what you missed
I looked into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer's eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing
You walk in a room
In the light or in the dark
Well, nothing shadows who you are

And you don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Everyday, see something new
But all I ever wanted was a window looking at you
At you

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view
