Everything Lyrics
CDs ain't selling no more anyways, man
Look at SoundScan
I really don't think it matters if

Everything I do
Is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut
At number two, so why do you?
If we make money, then why can't you
Be satisfied with what you do?

It's like our legacy's pregnant, we're planting eggs every record
They're beggin' me to release a CD every other second
But don't expect it, 'cause every time I get hit with that question
I just deflect it, get Ca$his or 50's record and check it
And Buck is out, like get these motherfuckers out 'fore I smack 'em
Plus T.I. just dropped an album now, go out and get that one
And I got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
Of holdin' a label 'til I figure out when I'm ready to drop
Or maybe not, Shady, look how hot,  you were on top
You were pop, you were so popular, now you're not
You're a washed up entrepreneur, how's it possible?
Well, it's not, if your little fickle minds would've caught on, but you didn't
See, I don't rap for the green, I mean, I ain't greedy
But I also know what it's like to be needy, and I will never
Go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy to try to step
Away from entertainment, separate it from CDs
And every day it just seems like we're beefin', even the media's
Meat eaters, they gotta give you something to read
Or you won't buy it, believe what you wanna believe
Let 'em feed to you, the BS, P.S., peace to T.I
You gon be 'aight and we out
Everything I do
Is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut
At number two, so why do you?
If we make money, then why can't you
Be satisfied with what you do?

Peace
Hold a head up, partner
You know how we do what we gonna do
When we do it and we don't give a fuck what you're doin'
We gon' touchdown, back up in the private charter plane
We gon' touchdown, you know we gon' get it crackin' man
We gon' touchdown, I told you ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby, they gon' make a bigger riot
When we touchdown4Embed
