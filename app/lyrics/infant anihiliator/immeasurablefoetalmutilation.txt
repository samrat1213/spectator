Father, forgive me, for I have sinned; my flesh has tempted me and I
gave in. My body craves lust, pleasure and a constant need to sever. I
am a priest; a holy servant of the Lord. Now Cleanse me of the sins
that I have I committed. I bow my head and whisper, silently, a prayer
of penance. Now that I am forgiven I make my way to the Vatican - the
place in which Iâ€™ll act in sin again. Behind these closed doors I
practice torture and sodomy. Wounds are made and then singed to keep
the children alive while I dissect them. Anatomy: the structure of
their flesh; disassembled then raped while being logged on tape. The
records are then sent to the Pope where he masturbates to them and
injects his dope. Hordes of countless archives reach the roof caked in
holy semen. This temple of debauchery is veiled from the public eye.
The enigmatic loom continuously weaves a religious swoon. Rape then
murder; then find forgiveness. Kill in homage to Christ our fucking
lord. Drain the sacrificial blood of children upon the altar of God.
Rape then murder; then find forgiveness. Kill in homage to Christ our
fucking lord. Blood canals irrigate in the shape of cruciform. Divide
the foetal remnants into pieces.
