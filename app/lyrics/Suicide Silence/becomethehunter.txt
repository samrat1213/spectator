Murderous urges have
Rotted my conscience
Poisoned life pushes me
Am I going to do this?
Am I going to do this?

Take a look at yourself
What will you become?
Don't lose hope, don't lose sight
There's no dark without the light
Cross this bridge, there's no way back
There's no dark without the light

All this hate eclipses light
There's no hope, there's no sight

Become the hunter
Become the hunter
Become the hunter
Become the hunter

Follow close, don't look back
Tie the knot, both your hands
Let it go, you still have time
Don't lose hope, don't lose sight
Sharpened blade cuts just right
There's no hope, there's no sight
Cross this bridge, there's no way back
There's no dark without the light

Become the hunter
Become the hunter
Become the hunter
Become the hunter

Once hunted, now hunter

Become the hunter
