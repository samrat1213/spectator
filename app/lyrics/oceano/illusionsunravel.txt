Locked in a stasis of distraction
Taking advantage
Of your brain dead habits!
Your masters want to keep you in the dark
In fear of facing questions
Oblivious to overhead
Still you're kept blinded
Expand your sights, gaze above
Watch the illusions unravel
Contours of strange craft are exposed
What is their purpose?
Expand your sights, gaze above
Watch the illusions unravel
Cloaked within the cloud formations
To remain evasive unnoticed
The planet has long been occupied by a distant presence
Still you're kept blinded
Your masters keep you in the dark
Reflective technology manipulates light
Invisible and out of sight
For continued observation of their flawed creation
True gods invested in your progress
Your masters keep you in the dark
