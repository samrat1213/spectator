"We kill ourselves slowly because a sudden death is too absurd. A lifetime of pain, released in an instant? Inconceivable..."
Ill in the head—ready to be dead.
"To exist, in any capacity whatsoever—is madness. And still we drag ourselves through these days, pretending that we’re sane..."
"Look at the old man, rotting away. Inject him with painkillers, silence his deathbed groans. Give him a taste of that final nothing—where pain ends and oblivion begins..."
"This body serves no purpose but to feel pain. To let us know what hurts. To absorb the violence life inflicts upon us—then slowly decay. All these bodies, all these frayed and battered nerves..."
"Justice—the myth we needed to believe, despite all the evidence otherwise. No justice in reality, just the random brutality of an indifferent world."
What more is there to see with these eyes? What more is there to feel with this heart?
Nothing left to do—but rot...
"Time will destroy all of us. Watch as it breaks down everything you hold dear—your looks, your love, your wonder. Nothing is exempt from its crawling, inevitable destruction. Without remorse, it crushes everything that stands into dust."
This world has never been worth the price we pay just to exist—and it never will be...
"You sell your soul just to survive. And for what reason? To endure the same struggle, day after day? For a moment of catharsis, here or there?"
Take a peak amongst the trees to remember what has been lost. But that is all you can do. The comfort of a soft bed and a glowing screen are all you have now. Constant reminders of how unfit you are for her kingdom...
"Go into the forests—you are but an infant, a helpless child lost in the wild. Feel the threat her power poses against you. Too much knowledge of her cruelty! Too far removed from her indifference. Man, comfortable in his own world, cannot return to what he has relinquished."
"Cast off from nature by the scope of our knowledge, we cannot live amongst it. The butterfly floats in the garden, oblivious to its fate. We see our fate, and it moves us out of nature—into a world of myth and meaning. The price we pay for our compromised instinct..."
"Trapped between four walls, begging dead dreams to give you life. Such a futile effort, to fill an endless void with fantasy..."
"And so we shall be cursed with ourselves, forever.  Or until the sun burns out, for good..."
"To laugh at life, or to mourn it... In the end it all amounts to the same thing—a world too absurd to accept. An existence that can only be decried—in shrieks or in sighs."
"Why weep for the dead? Their problems are all solved. If there is anyone you should weep for, it is the living. Stuck in this meaningless cycle, in a cold indifferent world..."
"Duped by hope again, as you always are. Your realizations do not eradicate the pain, merely diagnose the cause. But the cause is life itself—in all it demands of us, in all it forces us to endure."
"Dream of your escape, from all that isn't you. A wish you will pine for until your dying breath.   No exit from the confines of this world. No promise of some grand omnipotence. So high you think you are, above it all! But the world reduces you—to a speck within the sea."
"Infected by the pursuit of greatness, we bow our heads in shame. Too mediocre, too human to achieve such lofty goals. Demanding miracles but delivering disappointments—time and time again."
"How useless to write these words—how useless to do anything at all. Worn out by frivolous ways to pass time, we sit and expire in the nothing. Every action exhausted, every meaning nullified."
"So many plans that fail. Set the future before it’s even here. This moment begs otherwise; demands not what we planned, but what we must..."
"I remember those days when time seemed to be moving towards something—some end goal, some final triumph which would make all our efforts worth it.  But time did not crown us; it destroyed us. Exposing this life for what it really is—a series of incomprehensible fragments."
"Unsatisfied by their lies, I choose my own. Equally unsatisfying..."
"We all grow tired of ourselves, in time. To confine yourself to a single notion of who you are...seems so unreal."
"How desperate we are for something besides our lonely selves. How sick we become of everyone else. No remedy for our curse. Torn between two miseries, always lost.   How can we keep going on? How much longer shall we play this stupid game?"
"All alone, for all of time. She’s always outside of me. I have no idea what my purpose is here..."
"Sick of ourselves and this world of make believe. This lucid aloneness. This buried yearning for another. In dreams we see a face, beautiful and radiant. Still we wake up alone."
"Bound to the world of man, and his infinite book of law. Those who said judgment awaited us in death lied—the saints and sinners all occupy oblivion. Our judgment lies not in death but in every moment of this life."
"Hiding my true face, I fake my way through these days, begrudgingly. Burying my darkness and repressing my solitary desire—to be no one, to get away from everyone."
"We only get so many chances, and then they're gone. So much pressure to make something of this life—as the moment slips away..."
"To live in this word like a visitor from another one. The permanent outsider, alien to everyone. In every tribe we see a little of ourselves—but not enough of ourselves to truly *belong*."
"You destroy yourself to become someone—and in the end, you are no one. A lifetime dedicated to lies. A soul ravaged by the transience of its triumphs."
"Time and time again you invested all you had, in everything you did. And what was your reward? It was nothing. Surely not the grand salvation promised in their sermon of success..."
The moment you start asking *why* things are the way they are is the moment you go mad.   Because really there is no reason...
"Beyond caring. Beyond wanting anything. The world moves, but I might as well be gone. With vacant eyes I stare—into a void supreme."
"Worn down by all this motion. Obligatory, compulsive motion—the madness of all that breathes. Moving forever onward, towards nothing in particular. Expending every ounce of energy just to exist.   And for what? To be greeted once again, by the burden of tomorrow?"
Bandage your wounds but that’s all you can do—they’ll keep bleeding.
"How much more time shall we waste, searching for the cure to our discontent? By now we should know—it does not exist. Oh, how blind we’ve been, stumbling in the dark for a remedy which was never there..."
You spent an entire lifetime chasing the phantom of perfection and the only one who cared—was you.
"Someone lied to you when they said you were special. They filled your head with big dreams, impossible visions of success.   But you—you liked to dream. Too young to see how hard it would be, too naive to see a future well out of reach."
Doomed from the start. Chained to a world destined to frustrate...
"Give all you have—what’s the use? You still don’t get what you want, not even what you *deserve*...  But no one deserves anything. The world spins blindly and we hurt—for no reason at all."
"Haunted by all these hollow words. These thoughts, they shall never cease—not so long as we breathe."
"The horror of knowing that so long as we exist, we will hurt not only ourselves but so many others. Pretend to love them all you want, but in the end the only one you love is yourself. In time they will find that out, every last one of them..."
"A history of memories, adding up to nothing. Stubborn reminders of things long gone..."
You live like you’re already dead. Like there’s nothing else to do but forget. And you made a believer out of me. A true believer.
"Love cannot redeem. It won’t make life this perfect, painless thing. A greater lie has never been told. Enjoy your solitude, for it’s all you really have."
"I’ve heard all the arguments and I can’t deny—the demons are more convincing than the angels. They’re all liars, but in the end—the darkness feels more true, more real..."
"I exist, but my life itself—is over."
They can never understand how pointless this all feels to me. How I suffer so much—for so little. For nothing really...
Life requires me to endure but really I’d just rather expire...as soon as possible.
To be conscious of so much yet know so little...
What may seem vain to you is the impetus of another’s entire existence. Who are we to sit from afar and dissect the illusions of another—or even ourselves!
We only throw stones out of jealousy—for all who find meaning in life’s vanities.
"Oh, to see the reality beyond dead dreams. This universe, conspiring to destroy us, to release us from ourselves.  And this we run from?"
You look to the future and all you see are sighs. Trapped in a reality that will not change. Bound to conditions beyond your control. A dreadful fate...
Don’t mind me—I’m just contemplating my skeleton.
"If, by some miracle, there is an escape, it will only come with our last breath—that final moment when consciousness fades and the body rots into the same muddy hole which imprisoned it for life."
Repetition has rendered your existence meaningless—a series of wasted breaths which can only be endured.
"Cursed by a dead-end future, our only reprieve now is the past."
"When old fictions are discarded, all that's left is a blank page. And still, something must be written...  Another story, destined to go nowhere. Another character, doomed to the grave."
"His mind, having traversed every possibility, concedes defeat. Exhausted by every potential, bored with every result."
"Life passes, from one empty moment to the next. And in the end, it’s useless—we’re all just ghosts of time."
"Try to run from it, try to repress it from you consciousness—the myth lives forever. Stamped and inscribed into the psyche of youths, it shaped an entire law, order and culture. The crucified flesh. The dead and rotting martyr. Oh, how his flesh stinks!"
"No will, no power, no life. Their sanity creates asylums."
"I run from everyone because it's the only way to feel free. Too many laws, too many rules, too much judgment."
"This world, a mere reflection of all I love and loathe within myself. Viewing everyone and everything, relative to me.   Yes, I am the dark center of the universe. And this world is my dream. The delusion that one day, will mercifully end..."
"Everything I thought I was—lies, all lies."
"The empty page, terrifying in its meaninglessness, begs to be filled with something, anything. When a writer fails to do so he concedes to the nullity of every word—that to say nothing is just the same as saying anything."
"Tired of myself, tired of taking my place amongst the human race. Surrounded by all these faces, day in and day out. Suffocating in close proximity, I yearn for a distance unattainable."
"A will crushed by the weight of the world. Simply nothing left to give—and no reason to. This world compels us to move—but oh, how sweet the taste of oblivion..."
"No redemption in the future, only more of the same. Trapped in this meaningless tedium, with no end in sight. To think we once believed in tomorrow! But tomorrow came, and it wasn’t worth the wait."
"All that you sacrifice for a mere taste of her affection.  You split yourself in half, chasing pretty phantoms."
"You say she isn’t worth it, you swear never again. But you’ll be back, soon enough, begging for her touch—if only for a little while..."
"Don’t you know by now? I can only hurt you—just like I always have. And still you insist, on meeting these weary eyes..."
"Close proximity provides no guarantee of self-transcendence. Look at all of the lonely lovers, stuck with each other—and stuck with themselves."
God is laughing as we chase our bliss—in this pit of misery guaranteed.
I can’t hold on to heaven. And I can’t get rid of hell.  This moment deceives us all...
"In the end, there is no *cure* for our woes. And the day we think we’ve found it is the day we deceive ourselves again—just like we always do."
"I try to run. I try to escape from myself. This cold, dead feeling inside of me. No, it won't go. And no, you can't just laugh it all away..."
All those dreams were ghosts anyways—from the start.
Irreparable damage. A ruined life. No turning back the clock. A future that once seemed so bright—has dimmed. So let the darkness in...
How long until the sun burns out? How long before we return to our true source? That black nothing which the sun stole away...
"“Dream big” is the motto of starry-eyed fools, unable to accept their general place beneath the stars."
"We put so much faith in hope, as if a simple change of scenery will cure us of our woes. As if all of the pain and stress will simply evaporate in a different place and time. Wait for the future to come, wait for your hope to reveal itself..."
"Oh, how much I wanted this world to mean something—only to find peace in the nothing. Traversing a stream of fragmented dreams. Filling the empty hollow I call ‘my life’..."
People who exhibit no trace of sadness are mutants to me...
Innate aloneness—the birthright of all that breathes.
"Masses of millions, all rushing towards the same nothing. All this useless motion, hailed as virtue. Modern life—the madness of flesh multiplied."
"There’s no such thing as wasting time. It’s meant to be killed, as it slowly kills us. Soon enough we’ll all be gone—and surely forgotten.  Your time here isn’t worth anything. And it never will be..."
"We kill ourselves slowly because a sudden death is too absurd. A lifetime of pain, released in an instant? Inconceivable..."
Ill in the head—ready to be dead.
"To exist, in any capacity whatsoever—is madness. And still we drag ourselves through these days, pretending that we’re sane..."
"Look at the old man, rotting away. Inject him with painkillers, silence his deathbed groans. Give him a taste of that final nothing—where pain ends and oblivion begins..."
"This body serves no purpose but to feel pain. To let us know what hurts. To absorb the violence life inflicts upon us—then slowly decay. All these bodies, all these frayed and battered nerves..."
"Justice—the myth we needed to believe, despite all the evidence otherwise. No justice in reality, just the random brutality of an indifferent world."
What more is there to see with these eyes? What more is there to feel with this heart?
Nothing left to do—but rot...
"Time will destroy all of us. Watch as it breaks down everything you hold dear—your looks, your love, your wonder. Nothing is exempt from its crawling, inevitable destruction. Without remorse, it crushes everything that stands into dust."

"There’s no such thing as wasting time. It’s meant to be killed, as it slowly kills us. Soon enough we’ll all be gone—and surely forgotten.  Your time here isn’t worth anything. And it never will be..."
"No matter what I do, I cannot escape them. I cannot escape their demands. They will haunt me until my final breath. Day after day after day after day... Giving myself away—for nothing. There is no other choice."
"Brutalized and fucked. Not even human anymore. Just another body to be used. Mind pulled apart from every angle. Pulverized by cruel, indifferent forces. The pain you feel, irrelevant. The profit you bring, paramount. So bow down. Submit. You know that’s all you’re good for..."
World peace is possible. All people have to do—is avoid each other entirely.
"Love, hate—it’s all the same. Twist the knife, gently."
"One day I will vomit on the judge, and he shall sentence me for life. Follow or don’t follow—either way you’re a prisoner."
“Normal” people scare me. What sort of dark secret are they hiding?
"So much buried rage, hidden under the pretense of ‘acceptance.’ A world that is inherently unfair and indifferent to your struggle. If you don’t think life’s a compromise, then you’re a liar. We compromise everything for a mere place in this cesspool."
“One more taste” she says. “It cannot hurt.” I know she will fill my soul with bliss. I know she will erase the pain. But only for today. Tomorrow will hurt even more without her touch. And you know she’ll be calling again.  “One more taste” she says. “One more taste.”
"I know I am nothing. I know my life is of no consequence. My existence, utterly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. And still I am left with no choice but to obsess over myself. Every moment spent fretting over this single bundle of flesh, blood and bones."
"And so we are moved, from moment to moment, just as the script demands—mere marionettes in the theatre of life."
"What am I, but a puppet of the past and future? What are these feelings, but the result of what came before, and the apprehension of what shall come next?   The past is out of my hands—and so is this moment—a mere *reaction* to that, which by now, is well beyond my control."
"Breaking mirrors is too dangerous. Everybody needs to see you, exactly how they expect you. Even if the face in the mirror—is entirely unreal."
"Our friendship has died—still you insist it’s alive. And every time we meet again, I feel like a liar. Re-playing a version of me, that’s nothing more than a memory."
"All my friends are gone—I had to let them go. To find myself. That thing I’m still searching for, somewhere..."
"All I can do is wait for the nightmare to end, for death to release me from this self-obsession—back into the dirt, back into the nothing from which this awful illusion sprung..."
"In all your dreams, you destroy. Consumed by an overwhelming passion. Stay in control. Prove your sanity. Beneath the facade lies a madman..."
"Hide behind the cozy lie of normalcy. You know what's been concealed—and you will never escape from it. Buried in the depths of your psyche, it lurks—ready to possess."
"Why believe that things will ever change? The days ahead promise nothing but a burden—and still we must face those days, with eyes too heavy to care..."
"We retreat within ourselves because there’s nowhere else to go. We give ourselves to phantoms because there’s nothing real *out there*. No one to share these awful secrets with, except these ghosts—the apparitions of our underworld."
You are just a selfish animal in a flesh suit who will hurt everyone around you to get what you want—and probably not even get it.
"No true friend in a world where everyone is out for themselves. Every smile was deception. I thought you’d be there forever, but you were never there to begin with.  In the end we just use each other, to get where we want to be."
"In dealing with others, honesty might as well be social suicide. Long live the art of *deceiving* one another..."
"Man, just an ape in disguise—hiding behind his civilized facade. The sole goal of his “progress”? To defy nature to the furthest extent. An operation doomed from the start."
"It’s getting away from me again. I can feel myself drifting further and further...into anonymity.   Maybe in the end that’s all I want—to vanish, to disappear, to be done with the whole business of being anything at all."
"Woe to this fleeting freedom, tied to the hands of a clock. Smothered by tomorrow, choked by the dread of every passing hour."
Technology did not bring us closer together—it merely exposed our malignancy.
"Technology advances and humanity shrinks—further and further from its origins. The human world, consuming everything. The new God. The idol on the screen. Laughing, crying, killing.  Tomorrow his world will be gone. His narcissistic dream—just a speck in time."
Perhaps time has no value at all. Perhaps the only solution to its game—is to let it tick away. Surrendering finally to its singular mission—to reduce us all to nothing.
"With nothing to do and no-one to be, we return to our original home—drifting nowhere, in the void."
"Life moves forward, as I move in reverse. Negating myself. Returning to my origins—as nothing. An empty vessel."
"Living on the fringes of this world, barely holding on. There’s not much left to see, but still we cling..."
"I drift aimlessly, never knowing where I’m going. Wandering through this world until death. A lifetime of fragments, destined for oblivion."
"Traversing the entire spectrum of sensory experience—in a world that could care less what I feel. Just me, all alone—sailing through heavens and hells, occupying voids..."
All that we must do to preserve our existence... But why?
"Every time I try to become something I am reminded of how unnecessary it is to be anything at all—of how little it really matters, whether you do or you don’t. And so I don’t"
I tried to find my purpose but all I found was an emptiness that can never be filled. Not by these words. Not by anything
Only a fanatic could choose life over oblivion. I guess we’re all fanatics then.
"Why wallow in guilt as you stuff your soul with pride? Burn your cross down, away with such pretense! In the ashes of our guilt we shall rise—to greater heights, to realms without shame..."
"I am sick. I am deranged. And that’s all I can really be. Anything else would be an aberration, a lie, a perversion of the flesh..."
"All the rules and regulations of the civilized world—merely lies to disguise the madness that lurks beneath. Let us repress our insanities, for to expose them, would expose everything—what we really are, beneath this facade of inhibition."
To run from these words is to run from all we really are...one empty sentiment after another.
Shall we bury the past and remove these masks? Or keep on playing pretend...
"Sure, let's resurrect a relationship that's been dead for 5 years now. We can abuse each other’s corpses for fun..."
We bleed and nothing in the world will ever heal these wounds. So let us bleed until the very end—until there’s nothing left to lose.
"Purpose, meaning. Noble words for the self-obsessed."
Today this emptiness will not be filled. Today this emptiness will be accepted. In all of its hurt and all of its lack.
And still we persist—sigh after sigh after sigh...
"Please God, kill me now.  No, I take it back—let me gape with my mouth wide open, staring into this stupid sun for all eternity."
"Where have yesterday's convictions gone? Time has worn them out, as it does everything. The new has arrived, the past is dead and gone. Look at your old self—it seems foreign now. Nothing you ever become, will ever stand. A constantly shifting mirage, that is you..."
"Oh, how much we want to believe in love—that invisible thing designed to save us from all the pain and hurt. The greatest lie ever told. I love with all my heart, and still I bleed. Left here all alone. No one to save me, not even myself."
"Nostalgia, our final hope—in the certainty of all that seemed good."
I laughed. I cried. And now I feel cold again...
"Without the madness of our love, life would be...nothing."
Words fail. The heart prevails.
The problem with the heart—is that it's selfish...
"Beyond hedonism, beyond escape—into pure sensation. That strange admixture of pleasure and pain..."
Laughter and tears both spring from the same source—intuition of life's vanity.
Pictures renew memories of things long gone. Pixellated ghosts.
"Pine for that perfect someone, to save you from yourself.  But you will always be alone. And that other person will always be—just another body.  But cling to that other body, oh lonely one! Someone, anyone, to cover up that solitude, to make you feel—substantial."
"The hardest part of life is not the wound itself, but the hiding of it. Keeping the blood off everyone else..."
"We spend our entire existence writing a life story, only to have Death burn the book at the end. Dedicating oneself to a masterwork that will ultimately be turned to ash."
Paradox always wins...
Life leaves us no option but to inject ourselves with bliss and merely endure everything in between. A suffering sublime.
"These days, these weeks, these months of endless resolution pile up and leave us weary. So weary that when the time comes to finally choose, we are left with just one option—to lay ourselves down for good. Our horizontal fate."
"There’s nothing left to explore, nothing left to do. And so we rot with the old, with the things we’ve already found—digging up skeletons of the past."
"If ignorance is bliss, it’s easy to understand our new nightmare. We know too much. We’ve seen too much. And nothing we do can ever restore us to that innocence, to that state of not knowing, of wanting to know more..."
"This life has never been yours—and it never will be. Made by others, shaped by others, bound to others..."
"Dear Parents,  You committed the ultimate sin—of perverting the nothingness, of wanting more than what was. It will never be more than what it is, even with me here. I am just an ornament for you. Born to suffer and die, all so you don’t feel so hollow. Do you still feel hollow?"
So far away from the life you always dreamed. Stuck instead in this nightmare unexpected.
In life we can only choose between so many useless things. It’s hard to choose...
"The meaning you manufactured begins to unravel—there's nothing there, just another fiction, just another stab at purpose."
"There is nothing more to become. The road ahead seems long—and unavoidably painful. He could be anything in the world. But would this heartache go away?  Doubtful. He'd have to hide it behind a happy-faced mask, just like all the rest."
"They say life is short. But it doesn't seem short when there's no clear end in sight, when every moment seems like a moment that's already happened a million times over; perhaps in some other age, perhaps in a future time..."
"Love doesn’t kill the pain, it denies its existence—in ignorance."
"The goal of our relations should not be to love others—but to not cause them unnecessary pain. Love—too much of a burden to ask of anyone, including ourselves!"
Infatuated with her gaze—but you’ll destroy her world before she can save yours.
I do not know how much longer I can take this solitary confinement which keeps me lodged firmly within my own illusions. But to infect the life of another—how dare I!
"She spoke to you with such bright eyes. In those eyes she offered you a hope—that you'd never have to dream alone, ever again. What a fool to believe in those eyes! As if the light would never go out, as if the dream might last forever..."
"Every man and woman, so alone. Beneath every love lies a quiet desperation to abolish one’s solitude.  Lose yourself in another, let them remedy your self-obsession. To become whole for all of time, to leave our loneliness behind—impossible."
I like to celebrate Valentine's Day—by alienating anyone who gets near me.
"Aspirations obsess me. But gravity weighs them down. The laws of physics, always more real than dreams..."
"I've always said that nothing matters. But to feel it to this extent, to know this apathy without end...Am I finally liberated—or doomed?"
"Faced with the boring vacuity of reality, we cling to impossible dreams. Something, anything that can take us far away from here."
"You could blast your brain with euphoric chemicals—and for one glorious moment you’d be fulfilled. Just to crash back into the emptiness, even deeper than before..."
I will spend the rest of my life trying to escape from myself—to no avail.
You want to keep the human facade going? Go ahead. I’ll keep digging this grave...
"These needs, they never end—consuming the very life we try to live."
This heart pumps so much blood it's heavy...
"All of our experiments fail. There is no promised land at the end of our desire—only disappointment after disappointment. And still we must continue! Making these frivolous plans, hoping for a resolution which is always out of reach."
"Raised on a dead dream, in a century destined for new agonies.  Oh, I’ve found my purpose now—to revel in the taste of all these modern hells..."
"Is this world really better than that of the dead? They have no concerns—we fret over everything. Is this love worth the price of admission—in pain? Feel yourself disappear, if only for a moment—and tell me that is not eternally preferable to the agony of being anything."
"Go through the motions but what is the use? All the good in life just a series of fleeting ecstasies. Joy evaporates into emptiness. The void prevails. We dream of a cure that will never come. And on our darkest days the truth reveals itself—that black, immaculate fate."
"You sacrifice yourself in pursuit of the all-good. You torture yourself for the approval of the undeserved. Not out of altruism, but fear. You quake in terror at the power of their judgment..."
"It cares. It tries. It wants the best outcomes—and it kills me trying to obtain them. It saps me, it bleeds me, it stabs me right in the chest and drains me. And for what? For approval from others? To feel self-assured?"
All these tiny little deaths are insufficient...
"You cannot give it up—your addiction to the phantom other. How could a real person, in all their flaws and limitations, live up to this wispy, omnipotent ideal? We make love to ghosts and airy abstractions, stuck within ourselves."
"The only tolerable role in the human theatre—is that of the spectator. Baffled, shocked and awed by the inanity of the race—but always from afar."
"Oh wondrous chemical, trick my brain into feeling no pain! Caress me with your artificial bliss. Take me to the heavens this world will never know. If only for a moment, let me feel—euphoria unreal."
"Burnt out by the pleasure, worn out by the pain, we rot away in our emptiness. To feel everything—yet still become a victim of the void..."
"I look at my life and what has it been? Just a stream of sensation, little fragments in time. Pleasures and pains, euphorias and miseries—and all those empty limbos in-between."
"Time renders life incomprehensible. Why did I end up here? What was the point of my past? It’s all dead and gone, and it added up to nothing. It all seemed so important, so meaningful—and now it’s just a ghost.  Memories that haunt, of times long gone..."
"All I see is a world full of meaningless motions, of routines that never end. All I feel is the pain of this body, the constant burden of its needs. And this is why I cling—to fantasies, to fictions, to any world but *this* one."
"Laughter lessens life’s gravity—but like every painkiller, it brings only short-term relief."
There was a time when I could laugh at the vapidity of human existence—mocking it from a distance. But then one day I admitted I was human—and my laughter was replaced with tears.
"Incapable of twisting my face into a staged smile, I leave my true expression for all to see—blank, vacuous, unsatisfied.  And when they see this face, they look away, unable to bear the ugliness of its honesty."
"Nowhere to go. No future to behold. All I see are the ruined days ahead, products of a shattered hope. Desperate voices fill my skull, seeking resolution. But there is none. My existence—a problem that cannot be solved, a nightmare that will not end."
Frayed by the light of another waking day. Feel the weight of expectations as they worm into your brain.
Sleep seems like such an easy way to kill the pain—then tomorrow comes.
"This world has left us no choice but to take our place amongst the masses. Just another cog in this useless, ever-turning wheel. Bow down, contribute, obey. Freedom, the ideal which never was and never will be. Each and every one of us bound—to this sick and lifeless order."
"What am I, but a puppet of their rules? Of every expectation that’s been set, of every law that’s been written. Try to rebel. Try to resist authority. See how long you last..."
"Choose, yes, but how does that make you free? Confined to the limits of our choices, our only escape is to destroy all that we’ve chosen. All in vain, for we will choose again..."
"Forces beyond your will—they move you, they make you what you are. Your struggle against them, an exercise in futility. All of this resistance, how it amplifies the pain! Carving out your wounds, ensuring your infirmities."
"Time, the most cruel and torturous murderer—and no one is exempt from its mission..."
"Chasing our demons away, through the struggles of others; fictional people whose dramas seem more real than our own. But not anymore—not when our own horrors are too haunting to ignore..."
"This moment will never be anything but a void that needs to be filled. And oh, how tired I am of filling it! Everything we do feels so...useless in the end. The need never satisfied, the boredom never cured."
I still haven’t found any reason to exist. But the pain still reminds me that I’m here...
"Expelled from the void, I scream in terror at the first trauma of my days. Destined now to stumble, in a world of pleasure and pain. A sickening fate that I never requested—justified by their love of this world."
We turn a blind eye to the facts because they expose our fictions. Nor do they correspond to our wishes.
"Cling to your optimism, never lose hope in what this world *could* be! But it will never be what you wish, because it is what it is. All of your hope is just a fantasy."
See what happens when you try to kill the pain? It just makes it stronger...
Virtue is the mask you wear to disguise what you really are—a control freak.
How embarrassing it is to record thoughts as if they were treasures! Better to let them die the quick natural death they were destined for...
What is the point? I’m tired of everyone. I’m tired of myself. Yet forced to endure both...
"Conned again by Euphoria’s game. Her touch can never be anything but a fleeting bliss. Watch her float away as you crash back down to earth. Hurting now, even more than before."
"Even if you found your love—it would not last. And your glory? It would fade in time, into irrelevance. Every triumph short-lived, every passion, extinguishable."
"There are moments when I am so close to death—that I could see the reaper approaching and I wouldn't even flinch. I'd let him take me, right there. Just another skeleton in its flesh suit..."
"From what nothing did I come? Hurled from the void and into this world, I long to crawl back into that vast, oblivious darkness. The light of the sun is too much for my soul to bear."
"With his head in the clouds, the world pulls him back down into the physical—limited, determined, set to expire.  Reality: that one possibility his dreams could never account for..."
"What are we to do, but let time drag us through this desert of being? Into the world and out of it. No home here nor there. Rot in your solitude or let the world mock you—either way, it is not enough, it is never enough."
"As you drift, a voice invades your consciousness. You ignore it, drifting further and further into oblivion. So far from the world now, you feel as if you might be vanishing..."
"Perhaps it is not natural to be at peace, to be free of all our concerns. Perhaps the only thing that keeps us moving in this world—is a fear—of the vacuous boredom of our own contentment."
"To feel good—for once—only to grow weary of our own contentment! The relief of peace quickly fades into a tiresome sort of emptiness. What are we without our dramas, without our agitations of mind?"
"What you need is a dose of complete apathy. Inject it into your veins, feel the tranquilizing release of not giving a single fuck. Now you will understand sanity. Now you will understand the futility of all your concerns."
"Your heart pumps urgent blood. Your breath is heavy yet shallow. The terror in your eyes is unmistakable—this is a creature, horrified by its lack of control."
Look in the mirror—you are just as sick as all the rest. The revolting reflection of a world defined by greed...
"Billions of humans walk this Earth, every one of them utterly selfish. Behind the veil of altruism lies the black heart of a being—concerned solely with itself."
"How awful it would be if reincarnation were true. Above the stars, the Creator is laughing, his eyes fire red, his mouth twisted into a psychotic grin. Mere puppets we are for him!"
Better to admit you have no purpose and everything you do is of no consequence than to pretend any of this matters at all. Life is easier that way.
"The absurdity of existence makes it difficult to envision the universe as anything but the work of a trickster. Yet even if you see through its facade, what are you to be, other than what you've always been? Such awareness changes nothing..."
"You smile and laugh for them, putting on a good face. If they only knew the darkness that lurked beneath! Behind that air of benevolence lies a monster—allergic to the sun, scorched by the light of day. Now every new morning becomes an exercise—in sheer dishonesty."
"Some days are over before they begin. You crawl out of bed and a vision consumes you: today has already happened—yesterday. And the day before that. In fact, you've lived this day hundreds of times. The same basic movements and motions, over and over again."
"To wake up and feel...nothing. The cold birth of a new day, nerveless, senseless. Graveyard souls, drifting aimlessly among the living."
"Disillusioned by the ideals of the species, I crawl through life, dreading the grim *reality* of it all."
"Something strange about the man who always smiles. Where does his pain go? What is his secret?  He must be a liar, his perpetual smirk unreal. Behind closed doors, his true identity is revealed: a face without features, a room full of ghosts."
Do not be fooled by the thrill of your new engagements—tomorrow you will be just as bored with yourself as you were before.
"Why hope for anything, when so much can go wrong? And will..."
What compels man to keep bringing more of his kind into the world? All of his dramas have already been played out. The new blood inherits an old world. A nightmare on a loop.
And the meek shall be trampled...
"You bleed out the hope of a better day. And life is drained from you, in all these moments of dread. Let it pass away. Forget yourself. Forget the end result. Fate will have its way—it always does."
"As you quake in fear of the disaster, life passes you by. Force it all into place, strain for your reward. There are no guarantees. Things will be what they will be—despite a surplus of your effort."
"Everything we do is for nothing. We will continue to be what we have always been—mere puppets of biology, slaves to this will to live, at any cost.  So much blood shed, so many tears spilt—for a world that doesn’t mean anything..."
Tomorrow—all those nightmares waiting to afflict.
"You fill your moments with fictions, hoping that the illusions you concoct will dwarf the immensity of the void itself. But it follows you—towards every escape, towards every dash at purpose."
"Optimism isn't sustainable. For every thing we look forward to, there is something to dread."
We are all fictional characters in a story which makes no sense.
"All of that love she gave to you. Maybe she thought it could kill the pain...forever. A nice, warm wish—ungranted."
The only way to fill this empty loneliness: with abstraction after abstraction until the world we love is a world that is wholly unreal; a sublime specter which we can only taste in passing.
"The old gets used up until it can no longer excite. The familiar grows stale so quickly. And so we turn to something new, over and over again—until the old returns.  Call desire a fickle thing—but what else is there to guide us? The flaw of our wanting is all we'll ever have."
"So hard to choose, when every choice comes at the exclusion of all others. What I pick is my final fate, there is no going back."
I’m trying to escape from so many different things—and I’m stuck with *all* of them.
"We will never do, all that we hope to do. We will never see, all that we hope to see. This race against time—rigged from the start. And still we run like fools, thinking we can win..."
"I ask too much of this world, it doesn’t give enough. I ask too little of this world, it still doesn’t live up..."
"Such a cruel sun, casting its light on all these fleeting forms! Entropy will have its way with all of them, reducing them to dust. The sun has lied to us again! Tempting us with things which cannot last, enticing us to stay."
"Drifting through this life, never knowing why. All this knowledge, adding up to nothing. History, inexplicable nonsense; the present, sheer absurdity. And the future? I’d prefer not to know..."
"To observe the human race from a distance—in books, in songs, on screens. But never getting *too* close. The faraway life..."
Consuming the planet before it consumes us—the ultimate exercise in futility.
"Flood your life with things outside yourself, until you no longer are yourself. You think you are the creator of your own world, but you've been defined—by all that you've consumed."
I would weep for anyone born in this century—but I’ve run out of tears.
"Unlike them you have no pride to cling to, no notion of your relevance beyond what nature assigned. Life has stripped you of your pride and left you as you are—a naked, helpless creature, a zero in the eyes of eternity."
"Another meaningless moment, devoid of purpose. Absence fills the space around you. Time ticks, without direction. An immense eternity—of nothingness."
Flashes of euphoria in a dream defined by hurt.
Everyone’s upset because a virus has disturbed our way of life? Our entire way of life *is* a virus...
"Child of the Internet, raised on *too much* information. Reaching the limit point of knowledge. Stuck in an infinite web—of contradiction."
"Forced to make sense of a character, who plays his part on a stage that doesn't make sense to begin with. This we call ‘life.’"
"In the ashes of his disillusion, a single fact remains: He *is* human and therefore, must be human—in all of its ignorance, in all of its pride."
"Who is this freak who lives outside of nature, the outcast of the animal kingdom? He is the human being, mutant species of the earth!   He floats beyond death for he has conquered it through myth. His nature is sin but he shall be saved! All he must do is believe—in his own lie."
"Highs fade fast, but some wounds last for life. What sort of Creator could be so biased towards pain? Where is the pleasure that does not fade? Where is the bliss that cannot be extinguished? And yet—look at all these pains which endure!"
The only words I want on my gravestone: “Life can’t hurt you anymore.”
"Believe in love, oh lonely one—a mere taste of paradise is all you will ever have..."
Even the brightest sun fades out. Even the purest heart stops beating.
So much pain for such basic pleasures. A bleeding heart for a fleeting euphoria. Today he gorges on the fruit of the sublime. Tomorrow that fruit is rotten.
You think you know where you're heading. You believe that the destination will be ideal. But you know nothing—and hope is meaningless when every road leads to nowhere.
"Some days it feels like there's no escape from the others. Like you're an actor, trapped on this human stage."
"I sit in this dead nocturnal silence, afraid to move, afraid to exist. An entire year I've lived like this! Cut off from life by the black of night—while sleeping through my days."
"The moment it began, the end was sealed, in time. Minutes, hours, days, years—either way, there was no holding on. Yet still you held on—even as the light went out. Even when the dream was over.  If you meet an angel, run. No such thing exists."
"The world spins with or without you. Things happen as they will, without your intervention. There is nothing you can do, there is nothing in the world which will go exactly how you wish."
"Our self-fantasy must hold weight, our life *must* have meaning—or else. God forbid we could ever see things as they truly are."
"We're all smothered by the expectations of others, no exception. Everyone's the judge, and this lifetime is our trial.  Our only escape? A death sentence..."
We bleed for nothing and no medicine will ever cure our wounds. Ascension is temporary. Gravity is permanent.
"You curse the world, but it will not change. It merely shows you what you are—weak, powerless, insignificant. A creature with no choice but to bow his head in defeat—to everything beyond him, to all that makes him small..."
To not exist at all. To have no worries. To feel nothing. To think nothing. So much envy for the dead...
"Somehow we've managed to develop our very own painkiller—the anesthesia of apathy. And if our feeling can't get us through these days, our numbness certainly will."
"Life loses its luster when every day is just another checklist, when every action is just a means to an end. Our ability to choose drifts away from us, until there is no choice—simply that which we must."
"The sands of time will destroy every vestige of hope, just as it always has. Expend every ounce of effort you have, to no avail. All this striving, in vain. All this endless wanting, for nothing. No better life in sight, no final reward to come."
"This life I must endure, for reasons I will never know—until that last useless breath."
Yesterday's dream is dead and gone—tomorrow is a graveyard. There's nothing left to do but wait until the end...
"Repetition solidifies our image, molds us into this precise, predictable thing. And we grow sick of that thing, sick of being stuck with this one-dimensional self, repeating its role in life day after day."
"Others are not interested in your pain, only how much you can relieve them of their own."
"If you could suffer alone, perhaps you could stand it. Like a dog slinking off to its hiding place moments before death. But for you there is no hiding place, no escape from the publicity of your pain. Forced to face the masses, you endure your suffering in silence."
So tired of what you’ve become—but there’s nowhere left to run.
"In your world you can be anything, you can see it anyway you want. But in *their* world..."
The world you dreamed of seemed so out of reach—so you chose theirs. You could survive—all you had to do was fall in line.
"What is the use of nullifying our desire when the world has a will of its own? A will it mercilessly imposes upon us, time and time again..."
"Torn between two worlds, we can never find true solace. There’s too much or there’s not enough. Overburdened by the everything and desensitized by the nothing, we cannot find our home. It is nowhere to be found."
"The masses shall worship the thrones of leaders, always hoping a solution is in their hands. Money is the only thing in their hands—printed with lies and covered in blood."
"God is not dead, even if that’s what you want to believe. His commandments cannot simply be brushed away by an atheistic conversion—for his law is the law of man.  Discard the idea of a judgment in the afterlife but face the facts—the real judgment is right here, right now."
"Burdened with assumptions of our worth, we are haunted by ourselves until the very end. To uphold an image for all of time—such an impossible task! Our illusion cannot bear the weight of a single day, let alone eternity."
"Whore. Shameless. Every orifice wide open. What we all are, in the end..."
You’ll never be free. It doesn’t matter what you want because they make you...
We never asked for this life nor the incessant demands it places upon us—it was life which forced us into *it*.
"Nothing we do shall ever renew us, for all that is new is gone and dead forever..."
"We fill our days with novel dreams. We play pretend. And that is all we will ever do, for it is all we have ever done. This world will never be anything more than what it is. You will never be anything more than what you are—a victim of a limiting fate."
"We shall roam this world like ghosts—floating here and there, perpetually sinking into dead time."
"To feel the bliss of your complete and utter insignificance. To see the reality of all of your troubles—as completely and entirely meaningless. All of this motion, rushing towards the same nothing, that final end point."
"Surrender to the dissatisfaction that permeates this existence. Every ache, every sigh. Tomorrow will be the same as yesterday. It always has been."
"We might believe that hope offers a chance for a better future—but all it really offers is a chance to be disappointed, time and time again."
"Want has led me nowhere. So sick and tired of choosing. I see the future—and every path is pointless. Every option, disappointing..."
"Visions of future hells fill the mind, inescapable. Tomorrow has invaded today—and all that’s left now, is the horror of what’s to come..."
"These distractions from the pain no longer work. Far too aware now, of the fact we’re trying to run. Stare at the screen, but it doesn’t satisfy—merely reminds us of the hollow inside."
We survive but we don’t live. We rot—slowly—in a world too boring to bear.
Who are you to think this condition has a cure? Pinpoint the cause of your woes. Swear you will change your mind—as if the suffering is all in your head.
"Subject to the perpetual need to feed and fuck, man will never be anything more than what he is—a delusional, pride-filled ape."
"We dream of freedom, but why bother? No such thing will ever exist. Strip away your obligations to the world and you are still a slave—to yourself. To your own wants and wishes, to needs beyond your control."
"Let the truth of your mediocrity wash over you! Bath in the solace of your insignificance—your birthright, your sanity, your home..."
"All alone—with so much time to kill. Fill it with all your fantasies and disgusts. You are no-one and nobody cares. Outside the world is waiting...a chance to be someone. So put on their mask, leave your loneliness behind. All you need to be—is just like everyone else."
"If relation to others is all that can define us, then to life at large we are already gone..."
"In the other lies a sublimity which can only be tasted. For a mere moment we are gone, only to be thrust back into our pitiful selves."
We aim to forget ourselves because the knowledge is too much to bear.
"Banished from Eden, our only hope is to imagine our pale imitation of it. In all our dreams God mocks us—for all that we’ve lost and all we pretend to have."
You look in the mirror and it reflects a ghost—the best of you is already dead.
"No matter where we are in life, something feels off, something is missing. But the pursuit of it never provides the solution—just a different flavor of dissatisfaction."
"Some days it feels like you're the only creature in the universe with nerves. The last one, destined for an eternity of loneliness."
"I try to fight death and the meaninglessness it renders to all life. But it haunts me, right here, even as I breathe."
There is an emptiness that is vast and impossible to fill. When all of our illusions burn themselves out—what remains?
Sometimes it all just feels like distractions. Killing time. Desperate stabs at purpose. I don't know if anything you do really matters.
"Desire has cursed us and left us in the pit of wanting. Our birthright, our home."
"Damn this body and all of its pain! To hell with the agonizing motions of life! I am sick of this bondage, of being nothing more than a mess of sensations. It hurts so much to feel anything at all..."
"Feel the fleeting nature of this moment—feel the weight of it, pressing down on you to make the most of it. Dead time, slipping further and further into the future. Wasted hours, sliding away from you, forever."
"The days ahead of us are long, their purpose, undefined. By what delusion shall we carry on, to deceive ourselves with meaning?"
"We grasp for purpose, but it eludes us. Chase after love—it will leave you alone. Strive for glory—it will leave you anonymous. How choose anything when every pursuit is filled with such false promise?"
"Your 'self' is nothing original, merely the sum of outside influence. Planting seeds in your consciousness until all you can really be—is another cultural product."
"We dream of Eden but find ourselves...in a wasteland. A machine which crushes dreams and deflates humanity—reducing us to this mechanized pile of flesh. Useless yet infinitely usable. Worn down and crushed by time, we will die—a mere shell of what we could have been."
"Confined to this predictable order, limited by law. So many boundaries, so many restrictions placed upon us. Does freedom exist anywhere but in our minds? Look at reality—is this what you dreamed of? Is this what anyone dreamed of?"
"To pine for the infinite, in a world marked by limitation."
"Steeped in fantasy, unreality becomes his only world. His life, nothing more than a hallucinatory whirlpool, a constant push towards some great beyond. Always imagined but never real. His meaning, complete fiction, his ideal always out of reach."
"Look at yourself in the mirror. That is all you'll ever be. Burdened by dreams, we are driven towards the impossible. It is never enough. We are never enough. Who put these ideas in our head? Who infected us with guilt?"
"I give everything I have—I get nothing. What is the point? My destiny is oblivion, this graveyard of self."
"The wearier we become with our self, the greater our urge to destroy it. But what is the use? Cast back into the depths of oblivion, our only choice is to become someone again. To create another self, ripe for its own decay..."
"Contentment eludes us because we are creatures of novelty. Only the new can give us meaning. And oh, how it all fades so fast! Time wears the new down so quickly, turns the thrill of the unknown into another familiar bore."
"The moralist pushes on, obsessed by his hope in charity and benevolence. Ashamed of his own nature, he rots—in the prison of an impossible ideal."
"The Cross has run its course, so they say. But every one of them is blind! Its shame-ridden morality still infects their souls—every last one of them."
"Trapped in this gallery of faces—grinning mouths and fearful eyes. Who is anyone, who am I? Fear of the other side blinds our eyes. Time to run, time to hide."
"Travel the world to find your place—it is nowhere to be found. Every person you try to become, so unreal. With no place or identity you drift through this world—a mere visitor."
He is a man who can see through everything in the world—everything but himself.
"Your ‘choices’ do not alter the fabric of reality—reality alters you. Forced to endure a world entirely indifferent to our wishes, it is us it bends. Every choice, arbitrary. Every result, meaningless."
To see the future ahead of you and know how much easier it would be in your grave.
"Look in the mirror, your face is contorted. But you're the same thing you were yesterday and your heart pumps the exact same blood—only the direction has changed."
Your days are filled with meaningless dreams of love and hate. And in the end the worms will turn in your flesh.
"Behind our facade of normalcy lies a destructive impulse that will never fully be tamed. Forgotten at times, buried at times, but never fully exorcised from the self. And it never will be, ever."
"It is madness that I fear, and yet it is madness which makes me real—more real than I could ever be hiding beyond the anonymous wall of sanity. Discreet and for the most part...dead."
"No God, only man—the blind idiot who would like to think he is God."
"In every choice, the seeds of regret are sown..."
"Civilization, the product of control freaks. Obsessive compulsive madmen terrified of uncertainty. Set down all the rules, make it as predictable as possible, make us feel safe. A cold mechanical order, preserving life while destroying its essence."
"Pale rotting flesh, let it fall off. Let the earth taste the decadence—of your skeletal remains."
"Cursed by a madness reserved solely for the species, we cannot escape these voices—filling our head with meaningless nothings. A life sentence—in the prison of our skull."
"Thrash all you want but there’s no escape. Trapped in this web of suffering, as life slowly eats us alive."
"It’s too much to feel anything, let alone think. What is the point of all this motion, of all this sensation? We shall never know. Still, we are bound to it, unwillingly flung into a mad, chaotic existence—for reasons we will never understand."
"There is no war between pain and pleasure, for pain has already won. The mark of a Creator who loves to watch His creatures suffer—struggling against their agonies in vain."
"Pain breaks our illusions down, exposes them as the fictions they are—leaving us no other option but to endure the reality of our suffering."
"Every time he looks in the mirror, he sees it—his undeniable humanity, that awful imperfection he simply cannot shed."
"Disgusted by the nature of his own being, he denies himself, burying all that he cannot tolerate, like a corpse. But that corpse won't stay dead..."
"Admit the absurdity of your life story, the futility of every tale you’ve ever told. Strip every page of its significance, before the reaper can. What a relief—to disown your story, to regret it even began!"
