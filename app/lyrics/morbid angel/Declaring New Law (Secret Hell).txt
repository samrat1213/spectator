Declaring New Law (Secret Hell) LyricsBring before me anyone who opposes my name
Bring before me any voice that speaks in disdain of me
Bring before me any force that would challenge my will
Bring before me every vessel that is filled with doubt
Erase them from my kingdom
We have no way to feed them
Burn down every home that keeps them safe at night
Rape them as you wish their daughters
Feed the wolves their mothers, erase them
Make sure that every father sees his son die, before he bleeds
Erase them and let the kingdom see it
Erase them
Take the gold and burn the rest
Torture any fool that does not submit
Erase them
Have them swear devotion, then cut out their tongue
Torture any fool that does not submit
Make them believe in thisEmbed
