Indigestible stench of menudo
Honeycomb fanfare of stomach lining
Cured in pepsin and enzymes
Pickled and stored in jars with pigs feet
Tool of digestion-eaten
Raw gizzard dripping with chyme
Extracted-preserved in lyme
Stirred in with crab legs, seafood, and brine
Nauseating delight
Carnivorous delicacies done right
Convulsions-spastic
Human cuisine-turned gastric
