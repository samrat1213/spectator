Hunger calling, stomach growling
No food around to feast
Haven't eaten for so long
Tastebuds no longer in need
Looking upon mirages
Of piles of infested grain
Bellies bloated beyond their limit
They're only filled with air and pain
The smell of rotting flesh
Fill the air from the dead
Utter madness
Eyes glazed over with
A blank stare, nothing said
Mind destinized
Extinction and sickness
Hovering clouds of stench
The weak ones will vanish
Human jaws taste human flesh
Now they're Dropping Like Flies
One by one
Dropping Like Flies
Dropping Like Flies
Constant moaning and crying
Very hard to think
Only filthy water to consume
Famine pushing you to the brink
No one even helping
UNICEF, what a joke!
Must eat the insects
Fell them crawl up your throat
Excruciating pain
Amputate limbs for food
Convulsing stomach
Drinking blood to quench the thirst
Now they're Dropping Like Flies
One by one
Dropping Like Flies
Dropping Like Flies
Stomach growling, hunger calling
No food around to feast
Haven't eaten for so long
Tastebuds no longer in need
Looking upon mirages
Of piles of infested grain
Bellies bloated beyond their limit
They're only filled with air and pain
Now they're Dropping Like Flies
One by one
