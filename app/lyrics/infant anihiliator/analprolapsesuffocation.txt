Nails pin the hands and the feet of the infant children to the
telephone poles. The crows feed upon their carrion. Their empty eyes
stare through the swarms of malignant flies as their blood sweats
through the soil. Mothers weep at their childrenâ€™s bloody feet; the
cries of every mother blend in with each other creating a mass hum
that reverberates around the world. The families that resisted were
soaked in gasoline then burnt alive - all burnt inside their own
homes. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I cast my
eyes upon a mother weeping at the feet of her murdered family. I grab
her by her hair then I drag her into an alley where I sodomize her. As
I fuck her, I smash her face into the bricks. Choking, pounding, I
fuck and strangle her until I cum onto her deconstructed face. Once my
dick pulls out her intestines hit the floor. Her ass tears then her
bowls began to pour. I watch her bleed out.
