He got into an organism
Injected embryos into intestines
He's preparing the reproduction
Incubation period is near
Death at the moment of birth
The body is caught in severe convulsions
Horrid scream, sinews are broken
Pungent reek of the open body
Xenomorph is free
Ideal biological structure
The first phase is complete
The carrier has its task
The next phase of evolution
The full-grown form
Led by killing instinct
Collect its toll
Quintescence of evil, full of cruelty
Gives beginning for new lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
