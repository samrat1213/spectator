Decorated in war
A.U.S. ambassador
Caught in selling secrets
To a foreign conspirator
Pledged his allegiance to
The red, white and the blue
As government secrets turn to revenue
He shredded documents
Restricted and confident
Then he got caught
The proof was evident
Traitor to the cause
He broke our highest laws
So why is he still greeted
With the big applause?
Chorus
American disgrace
Patriot gone to waste
He took a little taste
And had to have it all
Betrayed the fatherland
The flag and all for which it stands
Desertion was the plan he chose to call
American disgrace
Patriot gone to waste
Greed was his demise when he took
The fall
Betrayed the fatherland
The flag and all for which it stands
Traitor to the cause
A.W.O.L.!
Now a media star
The whole thing is so bizarre
How this turncoat's rich from seminars
Paying out their ass to see
A man who sold out to greed
A Benedict Arnold who made the
Nation bleed
New book's a bestseller
T.V. movie in the cellar
Unpatriotic asshole
Should be a prison dweller
Iron clad alibi
Nothing but a pack of lies
Just another felon
Wearing a disguise!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
