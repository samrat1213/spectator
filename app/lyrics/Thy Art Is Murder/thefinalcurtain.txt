Eternal light of creation
Conjurer of the great dynasty
Radiate upon the universe
As it was now, and shall ever be

Hurl down rays of the benevolent catalyst
Blistering glow give rise to the seed of existence
As the sun brings dawn
And shadows the dusk, darkness enthralls
So man will move on
And continue to suffer the rise and the fall

Grand tormentor
Hope in reality
Prolonged, suffering insanity
Nonbeliever
No fear born of faith
No endless future
No soul to save

See through the eye of the sun
Visions of birth and deay
Peer back into space in time
And all that was crooked will now right its way

Burst into flame
The fire of the urn ignites
Suffocating all
A global suicide
Forged by a celestial blaze
The flare in the spirit now withers in pain

Extinguish, the light of the living
The final curtain, so unforgiving

So unforgiving

Eternal light of creation
Conjurer of the great dynasty
Radiate forever upon the universe
As it was now and shall ever be
Unforgiving
