Fingers missing from hands,
Ready to snap bones and necks,
Pieced together from dead tissue
Body parts crudely sewn,
Face is smashed to pulp
Drooling from an empty socket
Brain half dead, hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence

My body alive,
I defy the life I've been given
I should have remained dead

Experimenting on dead tissue,
Convulsing bodies on the table
Reanimation of the dead,
Rusty scalpels cutting skin
Pieced together parts and parts
Transplanting human life
Rotten organs, rectal pus
Spitting up your gallbladder

Donation of bodily organs carved from broken bodies
Eyes melting, skin exploding
Every body bleeding
Meat inter-changed from the mutilated stiffs
Parts of the dead are never to rest
Lymphatic nodes Implode,
While the brain corrodes
Bodies sold to science, profiting from the dead
Creation of a being never known to man

Heart pumping pus through the body,
Sliced in sections, the putrid infection
Regaining life from beyond
To rip the flesh from your bones

Stripped of flesh, unsightly
Torn in two, slicing through you
Live organs needed to be reanimated

Pathologist sawing the skull of the donor,
Now he lies dead
Awaiting a new brain
Re-cycling the bodies, parts of the dead
Exposing their insides,
Slitting their necks

Finding a way, bringing life to the corpse,
Once dead on my table soon to walk again

Fingers missing from hands
Ready to snap bones and necks
Pieced together from dead tissue
Face is smashed to pulp,
Drooling from an empty socket
Brain half-dead, hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence,
My body alive, I defy the life I've been given
I should have remain dead
