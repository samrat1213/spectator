Wrap the wire round the neck,
pull it tight to suffocate
His mouth is spewing steaming blood
Hang the body with a cord, gag his mouth
with shards of steel
He doesn't know the pain he'll feel
Interwoven deadly spikes, tightening cables
lacerate
Assorted gashes open wide
Ruptured veins are gushing blood, scraps of
skin are flying off
The body of the helpless prey

Jagged cable binds, you scream, No escape
Metal barbs tearing at you, Rend your flesh

Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Rip the tissue from the body, Rend your flesh

Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin

Mummified in barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in barbed wire
Metal binds as you die

Tangled in a web of pain, No escape
Blood seeps through the metal sheath,
Saw-like noose

Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Gleaming cords encase the corpse, No escape

Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin

Mummified in barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in barbed wire
Metal binds as you die

Steel wraps your face, blood soaks the steel
Bound in wire, soon to die, life choked out,
bleed to death
