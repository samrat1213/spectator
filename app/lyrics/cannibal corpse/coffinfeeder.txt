Exhume the rotted casket
Robbing graves but not for wealth
Cloaked in moldy rags, hunting dead
Decrepit things from hell

Invade the sacred tombs, search for food
Embalmed five days before
Ancient body stealers raid again
A fresh corpse beyond the door

From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
It's them not God they meet

Consume the rotted body and hunt more
Craving maws ooze blood
Gray skinned coffinfeeders seeking carrion
Eat the old ones last

Fiendish ghouls are chewing scraps of meat
Found inside the tomb
Roy veiled messengers from beyond
Bring the parish doom

From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
It's them, not God they meet

Unholy creatures swarming the coffin
Fighting for mouthfuls of flesh
Invading the tombs of the recently buried, to feast

Starvation of aeons sated tonight
Foraging ghouls consume
Ancient hunger awakened again

Strengthened by blood, the undead attack
Septic beats from the grave
If living approach they are devoured too

Fragments of corpses nourish the pack
Fresh entrails they crave
The coffin is torn open
The zombies start to consume

From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
It's them, not God they meet
