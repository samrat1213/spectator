we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
there is another world there is a better world there must be
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"

when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there's too many bad memories too many memories there

when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
there is another world there is a better world there must be
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"

i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am

we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does

"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down

gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"

a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight

"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"

i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race

"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"

shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
there is another world there is a better world there must be
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
there's too many bad memories too many memories there

"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"

"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"

if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down

we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now

"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?

"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"

"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"

"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"

"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
there is another world there is a better world there must be
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am

"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"

take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?

"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
there is another world there is a better world there must be
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"

if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?

this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now

when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you

all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"

"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time

i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"

there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"

if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight

i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me

"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"

"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"

i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
there is another world there is a better world there must be
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind

"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine

"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over

i would love to go back to the old house but i never will

"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time

there's too many bad memories too many memories there

i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life

a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over

gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
there is another world there is a better world there must be

there's too many bad memories too many memories there
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"

if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"

"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often

"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame

"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"

how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?

"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"

"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns

if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will

"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"

"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"

so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
there is another world there is a better world there must be
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine

"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there is another world there is a better world there must be
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am

"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life

if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does

"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there is another world there is a better world there must be
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?

shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am

i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"

i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
there is another world there is a better world there must be
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?

"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"

"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am

"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame

"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"

a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"

shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

i've got no right to take my place with the human race
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
there's more to life than books you know but not much more

take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"

shoplifters of the world unite and take over
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die

i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"

i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
there is another world there is a better world there must be
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care

as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there is another world there is a better world there must be
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does

"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often

"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life

"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
there is another world there is a better world there must be
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
there is another world there is a better world there must be
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame

all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
there is another world there is a better world there must be
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"

shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now

this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"

gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does

i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"

shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"

i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am

"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"

when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die

i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
there is another world there is a better world there must be
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh

"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"

i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am

"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"

take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight

shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"

"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time

when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean

i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me

all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame

"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"

"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there is another world there is a better world there must be
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"

there's too many bad memories too many memories there

this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"

i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"

"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"

we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life

how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"

i've got no right to take my place with the human race
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"

"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore

"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"

"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to

someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"

i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now

"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns

so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life

"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
there is another world there is a better world there must be
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh

"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
there is another world there is a better world there must be
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"

heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"

if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"

all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me

"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"

i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does

"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
there is another world there is a better world there must be
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"

my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down

when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die

"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"

"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"

i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
there is another world there is a better world there must be

"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

do you think you've made the right decision this time?
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"

"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
i've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them

there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
i am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"so please, please, please let me, let me, let me let me get what i want this time"
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
"my only weakness is a listed crime my only weakness is - well, never mind"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
there's too many bad memories too many memories there
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
heavy words are so lightly thrown but still i'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
i once had a dream and it never came true and time is against me now
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"in my life, why do i give valuable time to people who don't care if i live or die?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body?

"so, what difference does it make? it makes none"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight

someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
"i need advice, i need advice nobody ever looks at me twice"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
i've got no right to take my place with the human race
i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
i've seen you smile but i've never really heard you laugh

"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no, we cannot cling to those dreams"
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
gasping - but somehow still alive this is the fierce last stand of all i am
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
so rattle my bones all over the stones i'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
"i stole and i lied, and why? because you asked me to!"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
i wonder to myself... could life ever be sane again?
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
there are brighter sides to life and i should know because i've seen them but not very often
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"but did i ever tell you, by the way? i never did like your face"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
but i can't believe that you'd ever care and this is why you will never care
"nothing's changed i still love you, oh, i still love you"
a piano plays in an empty room there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
all the lies that you make up what's at the back of your mind?
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
"so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die"
the rain falls hard on a humdrum town this town has dragged you down
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
i would love to go back to the old house but i never will
all too soon i did return just like a moth to a flame
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
there's more to life than books you know but not much more
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
i could have been wild and i could have been free but nature played this trick on me
"it's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle and kind"
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
do you think you've made the right decision this time?
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"no, it's not like any other love this one is different - because it's us"
"oh, people said that you were easily led and they were half-right"
"i'm going to meet the one i love at last, at last, at last"
"yes, i know my luck too well and i'll probably never see you again"
"force emotions to the fore but not for me of course, of course i keep mine hidden"
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
"oh, your face i can see and it's desperately kind but what's at the back of your mind?"
shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to
"if there's something you'd like to try ask me, i won't say no how could i?"
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does
"oh, people see no worth in you oh, but i do"
"to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine"
"you shut your mouth, how can you say i go about things the wrong way?"
"what a terrible mess i've made of my life oh, what a mess i've made of my life"
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
"i had a really bad dream it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days i never, i'm alone"
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
i was looking for a job and then i found a job and heaven knows i'm miserable now
how can they look into my eyes and still they don't believe me?
and if they don't believe me now will they ever believe me?
so let it be known for we have been through hell and high tide i think i can rely on you
"oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do and time is against me now"
the dark nights are drawing in and your humour is as black as them
"oh, people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong"
as merry as the days were long i was right and you were wrong
shoplifters of the world unite and take over
"gasping, dying - but somehow still alive this is the final stand of all i am"
take me out tonight because i want to see people and i want to see life
"well, it suddenly struck me i just might die with a smile on my face after all"
see i've already waited too long and all my hope is gone
"driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's their home and i'm welcome no more"
"i have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong"
my life down i shall lie should restless spirits try to play tricks on your sacred mind
when darkness lifts and the room is bright i'll still be by your side for you are all that matters and i'll love you to till the day i die
"in my life, why do i smile at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?"
when i'm lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me
if you stay i'll stay right beside you
two lovers entwined pass me by and heaven knows i'm miserable now
we can go wherever we please and everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"haven't had a dream in a long time see, the life i've had can make a good man bad"
i'm just a country-mile behind the whole world
i'll see you somewhere i'll see you sometime darling
"sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life that's the story of my life"
"how dearly i'd love to get carried away oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true and time is against me now"
this night has opened my eyes and i will never sleep again
"i never, never want to go home because i haven't got one anymore"
if you have five seconds to spare then i'll tell you the story of my life
if the day came when i felt a natural emotion i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump in the ocean
"good times for a change see, the luck i've had can make a good man turn bad"
so for once in my life let me get what i want lord knows it would be the first time
i know i'm unloveable you don't have to tell me i don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
shoplifters of the world unite and take over

i'm not the man you think i am i'm not the man you think i am
"you never knew how much i really liked you because i never even told you oh, and i meant to"
there is another world there is a better world there must be
someone falls in love and someone's beaten up and the senses being dulled are mine
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
"and if the people stare then the people stare oh, i really don't know and i really don't care"
