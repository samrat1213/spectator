My deep aversions
Building for years
Smoldering contempt internally burns
Dark introspection
Memories of scorn
Every slight an element of my simmering mind
Conflicting modules dictate my course
Feed me violence and my hatred will gorge
Resolve is growing
It must be done
And to this fury I'll be forced to succumb
Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life I abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my head
Seethe
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Congealed revulsion
Benign fa√ßade
Roiling dreams of murder coursing through my skull
Savage visions
Nearing the brim
How long can contain this murderous rage
The mental picture
Becoming clear
Execration too extreme to bear
An execution
My plan of action
Advent of the day of blood no longer imagination
Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now
Bleed
Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Terrorize
Realization that your final day has come
Your demise
Torturing you to death brings satisfaction to my livid brain
Die
I carve your flesh
Tear off your face
Retribution
This death your fate

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life is abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my mind
Seethe
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now
Bleed
Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate
