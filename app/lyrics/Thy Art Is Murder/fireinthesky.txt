Arrive in spite
Arise in war
Blood and bone
Through earth they bore

Fountains of wealth
Spring forth to life
Ark of the ancients
Sacrificed

Fire in the sky
Illuminating
Never-ending lies
Infiltrating

Burn through my veins
Malignancy of blood
Alight the catacombs
Drowned by the flood

When the skin and flesh turn into dust
When the poisoned water tastes of rust
Dissect the artery, let it spill
Spirits swallowed by the swill

Raise their obelisk
Violent design
Daggers that pierce the vessel's shell
Through root and vine
Impurity swells up from the wells within
Fractured remains
Spewing out the carbon sin

Fire in the sky
Illuminating
Never-ending lies
Infiltrating
Burn through my veins
Malignancy of blood
Alight the catacombs
Drowned by the flood

Burn, in the fires of perdition
In the swallow of submission
Hellfire, rains from above
The bodies pile up

When the skin and flesh turn into dust
When the poisoned water tastes of rust
Dissect the artery, let it spill
Spirits swallowed by the swill

Raise their obelisk
Violent design
Daggers that pierce the vessel's shell
Through root and vine
Impurity swells up from the wells within
Fractured remains
Spewing out the carbon sin

River of life, tribe of old
Depart this life into the cold
The faintest glow brings shadows forth
If not ours now, then no one's more
