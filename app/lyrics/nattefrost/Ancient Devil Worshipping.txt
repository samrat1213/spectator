Ancient Devil Worshipping LyricsCold, cold suicide winds
From the misty mountains
Eternally trapped in this frozen hell
In this grim black forest
Cold winds, cruel winter
Heathen earth, black blood
A guest from a haunting wind
From the lands of phantoms
The order of the elder ones
Who travel with death
Root of evil from the past
Timeless memories becomes dust
Black eternal f**king sin
Ancient Devil worshipping
Cold sleeping bottomless lakes
Waiting to be discovered
All paths lead to certain death
The spirit of malignant glory
Silent watcher, evil eye
Silent watcher in the cold...
...unholy black demon soil
Awakes the animal inside
Made strong by the sacrifice
Blood of holy, blood of Christ !!!
Black eternal f**king sin
Ancient Devil worshipping...
