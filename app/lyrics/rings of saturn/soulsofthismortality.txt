Incubate the specimen until the transformation turning human to the wretched, tantalizing entity will finally be complete
Intrigued by the complex and interwoven veins
A pathway to the core, to the souls of this mortality
A cognizant autopsy will now be in the making
Reverse engineer the flaws that we have once bestowed

A fault in our design, and to your heavens you must go until the next species in evolution can thrive and grow
They buried this body in the name of my enemy, and it now belongs to me

You are mine to do with as I please
Come with me, and just ascend into the stars
I can show you things your mind cannot conceive
The endlessness and relentlessness of what you call space
Is it in you that you now believe

Intrigued by the complex and interwoven veins
A pathway to the core, to the souls of this mortality
A cognizant autopsy will now be in the making
Reverse engineer the flaws that we have once bestowed

A fault in our design, and to your heavens you must go until the next species in evolution can thrive and grow GROWWWWWWW

They buried this body in the name of my enemy, it now belongs to me

You are mine to do with as I please
Come with me, and just ascend into the stars
I can show you things your mind cannot conceive
The endlessness and relentlessness of what you call space
Is it in you that you now believe

Spanning through the millennia, manipulating the articles of a dim witted race

Intrigued by the complex and interwoven veins
A pathway to the core, to the souls of this mortality
A cognizant autopsy will now be in the making
Reverse engineer the flaws that we have once bestowed

A fault in our design, and to your heavens you must go until the next species in evolution can thrive and grow
