Politicians, they're all on the take
Toxic polluters, leave cancer in their wake
Campaign contributions are nothing more than bribes
Pockets growing fatter at the expense of all our lives

Now we'll grab 'em by their white collar
And throw them in the waste
Look at them floating in the cess
They're such a fuckin' disgrace!

They just want to make another buck
They couldn't care what happens
They wouldn't give a fuck
Their big house way up on a hill
Was paid for in death
It's chemi-kill!

[Instrumental Break]

They don't know what to do with it
They don't want to keep it around
So they pull behind my back door
And bury it underground
We scream and yell as they just laugh
On the way to make a withdrawal
But we've got to ram it down their throats
Make them eat it all
Now we'll grab 'em by their white collar
And throw them in the waste
Look at them floating in the cess
They're such a fuckin' disgrace!

They just want to make another buck
They couldn't care what happens
They wouldn't give a fuck
Their big house way up on a hill
Was paid for in death
It's chemi-kill!

Babies are lying in their womb
Dying in their private tomb
Born retarded, crippled, and lame
But they say they're not to blame
Tumours are growing in my spleen
The children are turning green
We're dropping one by one
Is this the end of all our fun?

How can they get
Away with this?
We take 'em to court
But it gets dismissed
They've bought off the judge
So he threw out the case
There goes the human race!
