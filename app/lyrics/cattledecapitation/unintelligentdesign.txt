Goddamn humans and their stupid ideas
Moronic morality for the weak and full of hope
We're supposed to think we're created to serve - when domination is in our nature?
What kind of god is this?

A design full of faults or lab rats in "god's" maze?
This is the joke we're supposed to believe: Adam and
Eve.
Deceived.

A complex, but fallible "design"
Waste of energy
Non-beneficial waste of intelligence
Waste of time.

WHY?
Your "good book" castrates instinct
A fairy tale glorified
Deprivation of nature
A blindfold to the true heart of man
Unintelligently designed

Idiots
Backwards
Self-serving
Self-righteous
All-consuming
Bastards

Ignorant
Irrelevant
Pernicious
Poisonous
Ever destroying
Juggernauts.

A brilliant, but defective "design"
Anti-environmental
waste of intelligence,
waste of energy,
waste of time.

A design full of faults; an invention - damned by god!
This is the joke we're supposed to believe: Adam and Eve.
Deceived.
