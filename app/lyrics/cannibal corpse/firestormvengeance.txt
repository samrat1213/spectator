Venomous blood courses through our veins
Poisoned by indignation
So much blood on their callous hands
Cruelty their ruination

Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance

They sought to oppress under duress
Never thinking of this day
No cheeks were turned, now the bodies burn
And the tyrants writhe in pain
No mercy for the merciless
The time for that has passed
Flagellate before they burn
They scream with every lash

Ravaging their halls of torture and death
Craving retribution
Winds of hatred fan the flames
Reprisal's conflagration

Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance

Searing heat chars their flesh
Burning judgment
Punish them

Furious inferno
They cry in pain
No mercy

Firestorm
Payback for their crimes

No escape from this hell
They will burn here
Flames consume

Bodies burnt to the bone
Reduced to coals
The oppressors pay

Firestorm
Persecution ends
Firestorm
Despot burn in hell

Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance
