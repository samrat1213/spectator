Viral contagion unleashed upon the earth
Billions of infected dead soon rise
Stalking the living to feast upon the flesh
Its fight or flee to survive

Living out the days and nights in absolute fear
Never knowing when and where the
threat of the undead draws near
Toughts of those left behind
Are slowly tormenting your mind

Killing is essential to survive
The world you once knew forever changed
Scavenging just to stay alive
Time to release your inner rage

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off

If you want to live you have to kill or become
There´s no other way you have to kill or become
If you want to live you have to kill or become
There´s no other way you have to kill or become

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off
