From the Hand of Kings LyricsEmpires and nations fall, caesars were men not gods
Idols change as needed through time
Generals are irrelevant without war
Kings mean nothing without fools
To master
To feed their manic ego
To win their lusted plights
To follow with no caution
To follow to demise
Mad men are praised and worshipped
Enslavers victimize
Torture, always their answer
To teach incessant hatred
The hand of God became filled with riches for only kings
The hand of kings became the will of men enslavedEmbed
