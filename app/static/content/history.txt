Now, a trophy to remember my first, a sense of completion, the stench of her rotting organs now linger for eternity.

"The nights are unenjoyable for the people, for they are chilled with the huddles of snow, and further chilled by moonbeams of the moon, besides, these nights are ornamented very whitish clusters of cluttered and lacklustre stars...
"On taking betel leaves and their enclosing material like lime and areca-nut parings, and other fragrant material for chewing, and even handling body creams and tassels of flowers, for it is cool to wear them on, and with their lotus-like faces that are fragranced with delightful recreational drinks, the women are enthusiastically entering their bedchambers, that are desirably fragranced with the fumigation of aloe vera resin...
"On entering bedchambers seen are the irritant husbands irritating for the arrival of their wives, but once these husbands were at fault and they were daunted repeatedly earlier, hence they are now wavery, for their hearts are ciphered by their hesitation, and on looking at such husbands, who are now longing for lovemaking, the lustful women are overlooking their faults, lest time and opportunity fritters away... thus this season unites couples, though they are at loggerheads...
"The women that are new to adulthood are relentlessly gratified for a long time in longish nights, by young men who are muchly impassioned and lusting for their women, thus these young women after the end of night are moving about sluggishly in the morning, with their aching busts that are strained during last night's escapade...

But now the album has dropped, and I must commend Eminem being able to give Slim Shady justice and portray him better than done in MMLP2. But I am also fairly disappointed, with Eminem's desperate attempt to grasp mainstream appeal. Though Eminem's punchlines and way with words has improved since MMLP2, the other Shady Records artists don't bring much to the table. I was excited with D12 being back, but their song, "Bane" is simply alright. Not to great, not too bad. A very typical Bizzare verse was included too, bringing back memories from their album Devil's Night. Yelawolf's song "Down" is slightly odd and doesn't make Yelawolf sound anything more than a boy from Alabama that wants to rap. However, I must say that I am impressed by Slaughterhouse. Though I haven't spent much time listening to their music, I enjoyed their right to the point, fearless & "I don't give a fuck" attitude when rapping.
Here is a track by track review :
1. Eminem - Shady XV
2. Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf & Eminem- Psychopath Killer
