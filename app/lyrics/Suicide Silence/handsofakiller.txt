A fucking murderous son of a gun

Look down at your hands
Look what you have done
You've taken the life of your own son
Because you've taken the life of
your own son 

You've got the hands of a killer
just like me 

The lowest form of human life 
This world breeds killers just
like you and me 

So look down at your hands now
How does it feel to take a life?

And yes they'll be more of your
family's dead by tomorrow 

So rip these hands away from me
Rip these hands from my sleeve
So take these hands away from me
Please take these hands from my sleeve

This is what we do and have
done forever 
More of your family's
Dead by tomorrow 
End.
