[Verse 1]
Awakened in ice near dead in a tub
Organs are cut out and gone
You pay the price
Phone and note... call 911

Startled and scared
What to do next?
Who must be called?
Or will it be death

[Pre-Chorus]
Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

[Chorus]
This is no law (body harvest)
Left there to rot (body harvest)
More organs sought (body harvest)
For sale for all

[Verse 2]
The meat wagon greets you and speeds to a thrust
Hurry to sew on the patch
Strapped to the table and cut to the bone
The blood type is just not a match
Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death

[Pre-Chorus]
Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

[Chorus]
This is no law (body harvest)
Left there to rot (body harvest)
More organs sought (body harvest)
For sale for all

[Solo: Lee]
[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Gary & Lee]

[Verse 3]
Awake in a room dripping with blood
The hunted has turned to the hunt
Attention is turning from me onto you
You have the parts that I want

Startled and scared
What do you do next?
Who must you call?
The way to your death
[Pre-Chorus]
Removed, they take your spleen
Your heart is sold left there to bleed

[Chorus]
This is no law (body harvest)
Left there to rot (body harvest)
More organs sought (body harvest)
For sale for allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
