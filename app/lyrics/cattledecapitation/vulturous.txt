Encircling, enclosing
A population growing
Convening, congregating
Enveloping, enslacing

The carcass beckons to the buzzards
Entitled to its pound of flesh
The wake picks clean the remnants of once fertile lands
Cleaned by corporations, distressed by the fucking shit-stain "Man"

Living only for ourselves
Anything at any time
As if tomorrow we will die
We are vulturous

Scavenging shit-breeder
Ravaging globe bleeder
Damaging world eater
Ravishing the delights of demise

All life on the line
There's no contingency
Future predators determining how you will die
Annihilation designed

A horrible, ghastly proclamation
That profits dominate what's right
A natural quality of our civilization
Our wings fold calmly in the night

I need to see our species burning
I need to taste the world erased
Death is pale from ashes smoldering
We need to feel his cold embrace

Ave Genocide
This is an emergency
Present-day predators now electing generations to die
Extermination defined
