You, the epicenter of my contempt
I, the emperor of sweet revenge
Stripped of all sovereignty, left in the ditch
Devoid of a soul, evil with eyes of pitch

Opportunistic, parasitic bottom feeder
A plastic imitation of confidence, optimism, and competence
The unknowing host now falls prey to your sociopathy
Your predatory bullshit and your disgusting parasitoidism

It's dark upstairs
In your eyes there's nothing there
Vacuous and hollow
Like the relationships you hold

An execration of your being
A detestation of your entirety
Antagonistic waste of time, a lesion on the soul and mind
Self-cannibalistic and sadistic yet self-eulogistic

Can you hear the end coming?
The hunted now does the hunting
Do you know you are worth nothing?
Simply worth nothing to me

Your blood, it flows with failure
Can't help it, it's in your nature
Do you know you're the enemy?
And enemies we delete

Can you hear the end coming?
The hunted now does the hunting
And now we bring home the meat

There's only one way that this could ever end
Sooner or later to me you would be dead

Narcissistic, self-flatulent inhaler
A laughable charade of confidence, optimism, and opulence
The unknowing host now falls prey to your sociopathy
Your predatory bullshit and your disgusting parasitoidism
Psychrolutes Marcidus
Faccibus Hominum
Cymothoa Exiguas
Faccibus Hominum

Can you hear the end coming?
The hunted now does the hunting
Do you know you are worth nothing?
Simply worth nothing to me

Your blood, it flows with failure
Can't help it, it's in your nature
Do you know you're the enemy?
And enemies we delete

The hunted now does the hunting
And now we bring home the meat
