Shards of scorched flesh descend from the skies
Those who attempt to flee are instantly vaporized
We will breed with your kind, constantly creating a new form of killer

Our minions impose the submission of less significant souls
They must pay their dues with the proper sacrifice
Isolate the populace, begin total obliteration of this atrocity of nature

Behold Earth, the epitome of life
Once flourishing now a nuisance in our eyes
Carelessly slaughtering all, dismembered bodies free floating
Helpless screams to stop, music to our fucking ears

Pray to god as we strip your flesh, you'll see that we are your creators
Pray to god as we strip your flesh, you'll see that we are your creators

You dug for the answers, uncovered a nightmare
This land now a bloodbath, we feast upon the frail
The horrific truth revealed, we fucking exist
Thought as a conspiracy, we make our presence known

Behold Earth, the epitome of life
Once flourishing now a nuisance in our eyes
Carelessly slaughtering all, dismembered bodies free floating
Helpless screams to stop, music to our fucking ears

Shards of scorched flesh descend from the skies
Those who attempt to flee are instantly vaporized
We will breed with your kind, constantly creating a new form of killer

Useless attempts made to bring your salvation
Strapped to the table, there is no escape now
Demonic grasp free to do what it will
The blood of man, spilled to find out the answers

Pray to god as we strip your flesh, you'll see that we are your creators
Pray to god as we strip your flesh, you'll see that we are your creators

You dug for the answers, uncovered a nightmare
This land now a bloodbath, we feast upon the frail
The horrific truth revealed, we fucking exist
