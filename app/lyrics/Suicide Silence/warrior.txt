Up from the shadows a hero emerged

A hero’s journey
A hero’s journey never
A hero’s journey never ends

Taken away from all the things that I’ve known
Familiar hand took me away to the unknown
Learned to be a key in a world
Full of locked doors

To destroy myself
Never to be the same again
I take these vows
To take this will and live up to it
I take these vows
A warrior bound by fate

Fighting to figure out the truth inside
The lie I led before this time remained unsaid
I would kill you just to save our name

To destroy myself
Never to be the same again
I take these vows
To take this will and live up to it
I take these vows
A warrior bound by fate

Up from the shadows
A villain emerged
A father abandoned you
The price of power
A father abandoned
The price of power

A hero’s journey never ends
Ends
A hero’s journey never ends
Up from the shadows a villain emerged
