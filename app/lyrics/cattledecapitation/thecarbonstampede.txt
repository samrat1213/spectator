Disaster comes in waves
Time in hunting us, running us down
With a smoking gun pointed at our faces
Predators of the self and ecologically homicidal maniacs
Killing machines
Transfixed on ruining everything

Pale horse on the horizon
the blood of billions staining the scythe
manufactured eventuality
Decreasing quality of life

Death emissions
Born dead only to suffocate

Mass depletions
Karmic, modern day extinctions

Life less meaning
Equals nothingness
Never was

Keep on dreaming
we are, always were... the problem

Dam the embracers of neutrality... fellow future fossils

Vine-like tentacles like insidious weeds
Ensnaring the earth, enacting the deeds
Of utter virulence of disregard of consequence
The vainest organism on the fucking coffin earth

Death emissions
Born only to suffocate

Mass depletions
Karmic modern day extinctions

Here they come, the ones we've been waiting for
Here they come, the ones that will destroy the earth
Here they come, the ones that bring pestilence and war
Here they come, the ones that bring famine and death
