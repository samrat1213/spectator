Millions of years before the apocalyptic age soon coming
Intelligent life forms may evolve to destroy all over again
This inherent trait in the strands of our DNA
Transcending race, retaining order of man's sole purpose
Destroyer of the self and anything in its path

Human remains - fossilized - in feces
Human remains - extracted DNA - cloning the slaves

Like insects in amber. Suspended in time. Fecal blood-line.

Anthropological goldmine
Suspended in coprolite

Thousands of years of bipedal mammalian hierarchy!
Swept clean by the neolith - the war to end all whores of earth
...of all things. What it touches it turns to death
No more. Never again. The world now rid of humans
De-evolution.

Human remains - fossilized - suspended in coprolite
Human remains - ancient DNA - intolerable vertebrate

We are the dregs
We are humans

Never again.
Never again.

Like insects in amber. Suspended in time. Fecal blood-line.

Ardipithecus Ramidus Apocalypticus
Suspended in coprolite

Embedded in the earth, never to destroy it again.
Never Again.
