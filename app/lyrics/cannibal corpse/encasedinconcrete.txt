Bound blindfolded
Thickened liquid soaks my feet it's rising upward
Shrieks of panic
Hardened liquid traps my feet insanity is closer

I don't want to die
No one hears my cries
Liquid to my knees
Encased in concrete
Come to realize
My life won't last long
Hardened to my knees
Encased in concrete

Can't break free immobilized
Thinning air asphyxiates
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over

Almost covered
Thickened liquid to my chest it's rising upward
Silent panic
Hardened liquid to my chest insanity is here

Gag
A tube is forced down my throat to breathe
Air
Convulsions from the oxygen intake
Lungs
Are barely expanding slow suffocation
Choke
Ice cold cement is poured over my head

Massive pressure as it sets
Never to be seen again
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over

Wanted to survive
No one heard my cries
Liquid transforming
Encased in concrete
Come to realize My life won't last long
Shrouding my body
Encased in concrete

Encased in concrete
