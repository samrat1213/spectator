No hesitation as the bloodshed begins
Frenzied violence, raging death
Devastation as the killers
Savagely murder all in sight

Mutilators swarming hacking off limbs
Falling bodies, severed heads
Pure destruction by the mob
Butchering all that they can see

Honing their insanity
Headlong into carnage without fear
Ruthless human weapons with no conscience, unaware

Rampaging killers slash with furious hate
Bones are breaking, blood is spilled
Mutilation feeds their hunger
Brutally killing satisfies
Relentless slaughter innards hang from their blades

Disembowelment, of their prey
In the bloodbath all their vile
Dreams will come to pass

Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain

Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck

Sweat flies while throats are cut
Tendons snapping, sinew tearing
Blood pours from gaping wounds
Sadistic chaos, grips you.

Bones crack from heavy blows
Fractured cheekbones, shattered skull
Bludgeoning without remorse
Eyes bulge and spurt out blood.

Extensive killing many thousands have died
Bodies rotten, stench of death
Desolation as the killers
Scavenge the corpses of the slain

Insane desire, killing cannot end
Psychotic evil, mania
Stimulation by the blood
Searching for people they can kill

Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain

Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck
