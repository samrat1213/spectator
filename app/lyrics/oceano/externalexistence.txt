The external remains in stasis
Sedative a constant cycle
Delving deeper through landscapes
Once thought to be reveries

A body at rest, as lines intersect
Traversing exterior realities
Beyond sight and out of reach
Re-occuring states of subconscious being forcibly released

Subconscious abilities are now unleashed
Brainwaves shift, elevate to a higher dimension
Reality transcends illusion

As this body decays, I am sustained
Immortal within the flesh
An entity without an ending
Only exit from this celestial plane

As this body decays, I'm sustained
As an entity without an ending
Only exit from this plane!

Just know there is something beyond the grave
In R.E.M. I'm more alive than awake

A heighted sense of existence
Submerge in the infinite!

Brainwaves shift, elevate to a higher dimension
Reality transcends illusion

Submerge inside the infinite
Death is not the end
