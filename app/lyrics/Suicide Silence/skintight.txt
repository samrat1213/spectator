Why are you like this?
The mirror couldn't prove, to you
She didn't do it
You could have made it through, to her
She just wants him
As damaged as he is

I want to wear all of your skin
And watch as the world ends

I want to wear all of your skin
And watch as the world ends
With you

(And punished she will be)

She didn't want him
And so he ran to you
Why are you like this?
The mirror couldn't prove
She didn't do it
And punished she will be

I want to wear all of your skin
And watch as the world ends

I want to wear all of your skin
And watch as the world ends
With you

He said
He said
He said
Ripped up existence
Ripped up existence
It never helps to soothe
With you

He said
I want to wear all of your skin
And watch as your world ends
I want to wear all of your skin
And watch as your world ends
He said

Watch as the world ends, he said
Watch as her world ends, with you
