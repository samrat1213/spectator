Enter the count
In all his grimoire testimony
Generations of genocide
Severed sex glands to his delight
Meatuses litter the ground
Every step--hundreds of genitals
Placed here for the kingdom of sodomy
Fanfare of depraved in despair
Blinding stench of carnage
Dismembered, discarded
Kill. Hate. Decreate.

In the perineum and out the mouth
Quartered by wooden spikes
Absence of genitalia
Hidden by disgorged abdomen
Entrails spill upon the land and then
swept aside to my delight

Enter the tyrant with all his carnal necrophilia
Generations of genocide
Severed sex glands to his delight
Meatuses under your feet
Placed here for the kingdom of sodomy

A cornucopia of throbbing gutshed
The sand is blood red and stained with disease
Every appendage is pinned and held high
A testament to humanity
Cannot you just die?

Everything you know.
Everything you love.
Must be destroyed.
You die annihilated...

Islets and divided sectors for every body part
Standing in fields of disease
Praying on bended knees
That you might survive
As you've lost your arms as they've tossed your legs
The hounds now eat the carnage
A fleshy turf now thrives
You've died of your wounds
Earthen visceral womb
Geography--a tomb

Enter the Christian
So blind in your demise
Impossible to run with spikes through your thighs
Meatuses litter the street
Placed here for the kingdom of sodomy
