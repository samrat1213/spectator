current mood: craving for you
"you are, you have always been, and you'll always be my number one priority"
Thanks fuck for that.
Take my heart and leave?
I bet you miss what we almost had.
Be kind. Even on your bad days. Especially on your bad days.
why is the first love always so special?
"you are my deepest, darkest desire"
It sucks when you have to keep yourself busy to keep you from missing them.
My heart still awaits you.
"me, you, and the rain. all night long"
"Are you healed, or are you just distracted?"
I still remember the first time we talked and how I fell in love with you.
"i'll steal a kiss from you whenever the fuck i want to, and there's nothing you can do about it"
current mood: i fucking miss you
Nothing you have held inside your heart is ever truly lost.
It's ironic how life keeps us alive just to kill us in the end.
"Make yourself a priority and learn to be at peace with yourself. In the end, nothing else matters."
"If you could unlove them, would you?"
you'll long for my darkness when i'm gone
oh my heart.
"Boobs, because is there a better antidepressant?"
"If I could do it all again, I know I'd still choose you."
Just because they carry it well doesn't mean it didn't break them.
"I still remember the spark in your eyes every time you looked at me, and it's been a while."
Imagine us being together with no end in sight.
"I fail to understand why with so much information so easily accessible, so many people fall for such obvious propaganda."
Hi. I hear you. Wanna have sex about it?
"no matter where you are, you'll always have a place in my heart"
I'm just a boy who dreams of loving you every day and rearranging your guts every night.
"If you are one of those people who just take and take and take, but never give back, fuck you and your entire fucking existence."
I'm in awe of people who refuse to give up despite the odds.
Falling in love felt so easy with you.
do you ever wonder if they miss you as much as you miss them?
God made you this beautiful so I could have my heart ripped apart every time I saw you.
They don't make them like her anymore.
"It's not me, it's you."
cause of death: those eyes
Your peace of mind is worth more than proving your point. Remember that.
"dear heart, what the fuck?"
I was yours before you even touched me.
"dear moon, i hope you will love me back someday"
Learn to be strong on your own or die trying.
"Fuck, I wanna kiss your neck."
Knowing that you’ll miss someone forever and not being able to do anything about it is a different kind of pain.
why do you have to be so horny all the time?
you'll wish you didn't let her go one day
All I want is to give you all the love I have and multiple orgasms.
"We may not be in touch anymore, but I'll always care about you."
RIP to all the moments I spent loving you.
"If I ever told you I love you, I sure as hell meant that because I don't fuck around with shit like that."
Fuck humidity.
"The process of healing may not always be pretty, but the other side is almost always beautiful."
"Gods, you're beautiful."
shut the fuck up and kiss me
My days are peaceful because I don't worry about the wrong things anymore.
"“you’ve changed” yeah, i don’t trust easily anymore"
"You will always be loved, and that's God's honest truth."
"If I don't like you the first few times we interact, I never will."
You are so much more than whatever it is the world thinks you are. Keep being you and be proud of it.
"I chose you once, and I'll choose you again in all the lifetimes to come."
"my head in your lap, and the world can fuck off"
Searching for you in temporary people.
what the fuck is wrong with you?
And then there are days when you just want to fade away.
Normalize letting people disappear quietly when they feel the need for it.

Normalize letting people disappear quietly when they feel the need for it.
It sucks when that one person who always refused to give up on you finally does.
mental health status: silence &amp; sunset
I pretend to be inaccessible so people would leave me the fuck alone.
"mood: me, you and a war of tongues"
It's always better to stay inaccessible to toxic people instead of reciprocating their negative energy.
Looking into your eyes helps my heart calm down.
I think about you more than I'm legally allowed to.
Fuck magic. Give me the real you.
All she wants is someone to look at her the way she looks at the moon.
"hello, sadness. do not fuck with me today"
I'm so proud of you for surviving when all the odds were against you.
Some people are unforgettable in every sense of the word.
What the fuck is happiness without you?
"If I could, I would hold you in my arms forever."
you eventually learn to keep some things inside even when they're killing you
Come over to the dark side. We offer universal health coverage.
I hope the emptiness inside you is bearable today.
"We will meet again someday, baby; we aren't done yet."
"you and me, and the end of times"
I have been thinking about all the kisses I want to steal from you.
"The thing about quiet ones is, they know how to converse without using words."
Touch their soul and they will never be able to forget you.
Help someone heal today.
"My mind craves you more than my body does, and that's saying something."
I hope your heart forgives you for letting them go.
the rumors are true she's a goddess who'll fuck you up if you mess with her
"Baby, you are loved more than you know."
I'm always in the mood for you.
Be with the one who makes you feel the most alive.
Let my heart be your home.
"Every time your words touch me, they feel like love."
"Some days I hate everything. Other days, I still hate everything."
"It's never good enough, is it?"
i miss being able to make you smile
you learn to love your scars eventually
The most beautiful thing about you is your heart.
Was it all a dream?
Fuck this heart.
"When you tell someone what you have been through, it takes a special kind of asshole to put you through it again."
Emotional depth or fuck off.
It's okay to love and care without expecting anything in return.
It's as if your eyes fuck with my heart on purpose.
"You can't stop missing someone you discovered your soul with, but you can try."
There are times when your happiest memories haunt you the most.
My five-year plan is to disappear without a trace.
you won't know who you really are until you know who loves you
The cdc recommends that we fuck each other.
A person who understands your silence understands you better than most.
I wish you could hear the way I talk about you. I wish you could feel the way my heart beats every time I do.
I hope that one day you see yourself the way I see you.
My heart doesn't know how to be peaceful without you.
Don't wait for a reason to be good to people.
Be mine.
The saddest day of his life was the day he realized that she could be happy without him.
People will always remember how you made them feel.
What the fuck do you know about how they feel inside?
"Vaccinated or not, stay the fuck away from me."
"Do you ever want someone so badly, but you can't tell them about it?"
I'm no poet. I'm just in love with a smile that is an artistic masterpiece.
They were madly in love with each other. Something like that could only end in disaster.
"Relax, bro. If she wanted to fuck you, you'd know."
I wanna kiss you uninterrupted for hours.
"If someone out there feels loved because you exist, there's no greater feeling than that."
"If anyone can have it, I don't fucking want it."
hearts and their fuckery!
"Just let her know what she means to you, asshole."
you are the place my heart feels the safest
I'm afraid these feelings I have for you will never wear off.
She moves like she knows the goddamn miracle that she is.
I miss the taste of you in my mouth.
People who fall in love with words never really stop falling.
Some people bring out better versions of you. Keep them close.
Longing for someone you had but had to let go of is a different kind of pain.
I hope you fall in love with someone who is kind to your heart every day.
"Love might destroy you, but it's the only thing that can make you whole again."
I can recognize you solely by your words.
Be their permanent person in the sea of temporary people.
I know we weren't perfect but did you ever feel this way about anyone else?
"The less they understand, the louder they judge."
I'm running out of people I give a fuck about.
"we fall, we break, we heal, we rise"
"I chased happiness, and it led me to you."
"If they're in your thoughts consistently, they're still in your heart."
Did you ever love me?
"In the matters of heart, time and distance are inconsequential."
"Call me old-fashioned, but I fell in love with a girl once. I haven't fallen out of it yet."
Life is too short to not love with everything you have.
The right person will understand you completely and irrefutably.
take me to hell with you
my heart is the darkest place in the universe without you
I think your soul is the most beautiful thing I have ever come across.
I want to fall in love with the rest of my sunsets with you.
kinda jealous of people who get to be in your life
"i don't fight darkness, i make love to it"
"a neck tattoo that says, ""if you kiss here, i'll melt."""
I write because she exists.
"you'll know when it's real, the universe will make sure of that"
do you miss them or do you miss the person they used to be?
I have survived storms darker than this. I'll be okay.
the sexual tension between me and the desire to be left alone for a while
I miss the way my heart felt when you were still around.
Find someone who understands what it means to lose you.
I'm done pretending that you aren't the love of my life.
"If you make her feel vulnerable, you better be prepared to protect her."
"if she has more books than shoes, don't fuck with her heart"
i'm a much better person with you by my side
"No matter what you are going through right now, always believe that it will get better."
I believe in heaven because I have been in love with you.
Nothing hurts you more than going against yourself for someone who's not worthy of you.
"I don’t always say much, but you hear me anyway."
I'm letting my heart wander off to a quiet place today.
I'd let you touch my heart inappropriately.
"you make my heart the happiest it has been in a long time, can i keep you?"
"in the war of egos, the winner rarely wins"
but can they read you without you writing anything?
The best kind of hugs has healing capabilities.
some days need silence and a mind free of unwanted thoughts
"baby, you were enough"
my favorite sex position is how your eyes tell me you love me to bits
"Some urges are simply too strong to fight, such as the desire to hug you for a long fucking time."
I miss holding your face and kissing the fuck out of you.
"Stop lingering, break my heart, and leave."
"Sunday mornings, naked cuddles, and coffee."
she's everything you could hope for in a girl and more
"I could be myself around you and knew that you would still love the hell out of me, and that is what made you so incredibly beautiful to me."
You don't get to decide who gets to keep your heart.
A tale of irresistible chemistry and unrequited love.
"If she doesn't set your soul on fire effortlessly, she's probably not the one."
i wish it was easier to forget you
A mere glance at you is enough to intoxicate me.
"Love her hard when she's feeling unlovable, motherfucker."
I wasn't like this before you.
my heart has gone rogue
Break me as if I'm not already broken.
Woke up still dreaming of you.
"In the end, all you remember are their beautiful heart and soul."
"Every time your words touch me, it feels like love."
Dreams of sunset and you.
"Everything my heart desires, it finds it in you."
Some conversations are never about what they are truly about.
I wonder what will become of us.
she's worth loving with everything you have got. remember that
how do you go back to being strangers with someone who has seen your soul and made it feel loved?
What's meant for you will come find you and fuck you up.
"the rumors are true, i'm madly in love with you"
I don't know how to unlove you.
I hope you find it in you to forgive those who don't deserve it.
Can't get you out of my head.
I hope your day is as good as your butt.
The immortal love we carry for those who left but never really leave.
Eyes you can drown in and be saved for good.
Look in my eyes and see for yourself how much you mean to me.
I have my heart set on you.
you'll wake up one day and you’ll not be sad anymore
It's not you. It's me. I'm a very private person both here and in real life. Please don't take it personally.
do you ever just want to forget it all for a little while?
"I love you, even though you are not mine to love."
"fuck, i miss the chemistry that existed between the two of us, nothing beats that"
"Some people leave, but how they go stays with you for a very long time."
feeling alive? i can't remember what's that like
"funny how i found you, when i was looking for myself"
"I'm who I'm, and it's okay if I'm not for everyone."
trying my best to keep you off my mind and failing
Love who you love with ferocious recklessness or don't love at all.
hug her from behind and tell her how hard she makes you without actually saying it
kinda jealous of people who get to hear your voice every day
it's your love that makes me feel special
"All the ways I have known love, I have learned them from you."
"It doesn't fucking matter what they think, what matters is how it makes you feel."
Understanding each other's silence is a different level of intimacy.
"You deserve the love you manifest, period."
"i'm not big on revenge. you do me wrong, i'm done with you for good"
"Perhaps one day, they're going to miss you back."
You don't always have to be with them to love and respect them.
"you deserve to be loved and spoiled and fucked senseless everyday, beautiful soul  don't settle for anything less"
One day you are gonna meet someone who looks at you and discovers home.
"because you are always gonna be mine, that's why"
"Listen to your heart, trust your instincts, be kind, be authentic, be you."
You know they have a direct connection to your soul when their words answer a question in your heart that you never asked out aloud.
The fact that I cannot have you doesn't stop me from loving you in all the ways I can.
"I don't know where I'm going, but I know all roads lead to you."
"Once you fall in love with words, you never really stop falling."
"Maybe you are broken. But, you have survived this long, haven't you. That’s something to be proud of."
You don’t have to explain how you choose to heal. You do what you gotta do.
"I might be the poet, but you'll always be my most treasured poem."
"For all the things my heart holds dear, the most precious by far is you."
Some nights we wait for the loneliness to find us.
Leave her wild. It's what makes her so beautiful.
"Once you have been with someone you really cared about, there are parts of them that will always be with you."
"There are questions you don't ask because you already know the answers to them, and sometimes you are just not ready."
I found myself when I found you.
Be someone they're scared as fuck to lose.
my heart exists where you are
there's so much my silence hasn't told you yet
"mood: my lips, your neck"
"she's made of flowers, and my love"
"you can't tame her wild, she belongs to the moon"
"I miss you, and not just in a moment of weakness. I miss you all the time."
Sometimes forever lasts no longer than a few precious moments.
I still get butterflies every time I read your words.
"I'll wait a thousand lifetimes if I have to, to watch another sunset with you."
Secretly in love with everything you
I hope I’m always the person you think of when you think about love.
One of the hardest thing in life is to hurt in silence.
Imagine having someone to hug you tight when you are just about to break.
Existing is exhausting.
"I’d say you stole my heart, but it has always been yours anyway."
Soulmates do exist. You just don't always get to be with them.
"I couldn't imagine a world where I was no longer a part of yours, but here we are."
Let them miss you for a while.
I would gladly spend the rest of my days loving you without expecting anything in return.
he looks at her as if she's the only thing in the entire universe that matters
"I wish I could talk to you whenever I missed you, and that's all the time."
I hope your favorite person never turns into a stranger.
I wonder who comforts the ocean when she's feeling blue.
how am i supposed to forget a heart like yours?
i want you back in my arms for a while. everything else can wait or fuck off
"Once you are kissed by love, everything else ceases to make sense."
"If you love being with them, don't fucking hesitate to tell them."
What's even the point if it's not with you.
Coffee will never break your heart.
The days without you are the hardest to deal with.
"it's okay to feel soft &amp; vulnerable, beautiful heart"
Your eyes are still one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
"Because baby, loving you felt right."
some days all you need is no words and a damn hug
I'm as proud of your scars as I'm of your accomplishments.
I don't need anyone to break my heart. I can do it on my own just fine.
she is the poem I cannot stop thinking about
I can't imagine a world where I'm no longer crazy about you.
I'd rather be alone by myself than be alone in a crowd.
Heavens existed in the eye contact between them.
you glow different when you are hurting for love
Loyalty is precious as fuck.
"I accepted it as fate a long time ago, but it still makes me sad."
everything becomes so peaceful the moment i look into your eyes
"It may be broken, but it is all some of us have."
I miss not having to miss you
why is everything so fucked up without you?
"the moon and I, we have known each other for a long time"
This too shall never pass.
fuck her like your life depends on it
"Do you still torture yourself thinking about the conversations you had and the decisions you made years ago, or are you normal?"
my heart will always be yours to deal with as you please
why do you have to be so cute though?
"It's sad, but life is full of unexpected goodbyes."
Some people have the power to bring an instant smile to your face no matter what fresh hell you are going through.
Your sad eyes tell me everything I need to know about your heavy heart.
It's beautiful and quite rare to find someone who refuses to give up on you. Don't fuck that up when you do.
Be brave enough to stand by it when you know it's right.
you start healing the day you stop wondering why
girls with a storm in their eyes and peace in their smile fuck you up beautifully
The words I don't write are the ones I feel the most.
a deadly sin disguised as a girl
old souls and silently falling in love
some days I wish I didn't know you the way I do
"gentle reminder: life fucks everyone, you're no exception"
I miss your energy and the colors it radiated.
"it's hard to stay sensitive in this insensitive world, keep being kind anyway"
Someone can be miles away and still be able to hold your heart.
"If we are wrong for each other, I don't want to be right."
sometimes I wonder if you haunt me on purpose
here's hoping the person you eventually fall in love with stays
"saw the moon, thought of you"
i still remember the day my heart died
I hope your heart feels a little less ached today.
Perhaps someday.
"Listen, you'll always be loved."
"take care of her heart, and she'll love you with everything she has"
Normalize walking away to preserve your mental health without having to explain.
Life is too short to not eye-fuck her every chance you get.
"once you surrender to the darkness, there's no going back"
my existence is so full of you i can hardly call it my own
"If the universe wants you to find love, she will find a way."
"someone who feels and appreciates your depths, someone who understands and cherishes your soul"
I want to disappear and just exist in your heart for a while.
hearts just don't give a fuck about rules
"When you hurt alone, it changes you."
"protect your peace, everything else is secondary"
your eyes are proof that sufferings can be both intense and beautiful
Be someone's exception to the rule.
"If it’s out of your hands, your mind deserves freedom from it."
time of death: her eyes
"Incredibly sad that I'm here and you are there, and my heart is there with you."
if it flows it flows if it crashes it crashes
At least sadness is true to itself.
I miss those days when I had you to talk to whenever I wanted to.
It's time you let your heart love again.
woke up wanting to feel you in my arms again
"if my words can make you wet, imagine what my eyes would do to you"
"mood: you wearing a T-shirt w/no bra and just underwear, and my hands reaching everywhere while i hug you from behind"
"somedays you feel everything yet choose to stay quiet to protect your mental well-being, and that's okay"
hug her from behind and let her know how you feel about her without actually saying it
"Wherever we are today, I'll never forget the way we were."
you can feel her in the softest spot on your heart
"If their presence brings you peace, fight with all you have to keep them."
"It's not easy, hurting in silence."
You were the most painful goodbye I never got to say.
"Remember, your oral skills are the key to his heart."
"For what it's worth, you'll always have a special place in my heart."
Sometimes the scariest place to be is to be left alone with your thoughts.
Some eyes have a love language of their own.
I have never been this aware of my heart.
"Quit begging for love, stop trying to force a connection, you deserve to be someone's first and only choice."
"some days my mind wanders to quiet, forgotten places with familiar scents and bittersweet memories"
Sunsets would never break your heart.
"I want to touch your books, caress them, smell them, feel them."
is there a sight more beautiful than her watching sunset with a pretty smile on her face
Be the person who loves with everything they have.
Fuck her like the world's ending.
Coffee and fuck each other to oblivion?
"First and foremost, be loyal to yourself."
The sexual tension between the moon and my darkness.
Talking to you changes my whole mood.
i'm sorry for missing you so much but fuck
This heart and all the love it carries belongs to you.
Learn to love yourself first.
I can be a gentleman and still devour you.
I hope you heal from the wounds you tell nobody about.
can i at least be someone you used to love?
would you accept it if you were offered a chance to forget it all and start afresh?
"it's on me, i fell in love with the impossible"
remember when we both thought we were inseparable? good times
"you'll know it when it's real, trust me"
being kind makes you sexier to me
I don't want to feel anyone the way I felt you.
I'd show you my scars if you promised not to break.
I sometimes wonder if you miss us too.
Strange isn't it?
you should see her eyes when she's feeling sad
Loving you is my native language.
"idk who needs to hear this, but please protect your heart. fiercely."
..and he fell for her like raindrops on a stormy night..
"do you ever miss the person you were so used to talking to all the time, like damn, what happened to us"
Obsession can only be healthy if it's mutual.
Just because you don't understand the way someone feels doesn't mean their feelings are invalid.
miss being on your mind 24/7
"All things considered, I'm glad we got to know each other."
i think i will miss you forever
"my heart is still there somewhere, stuck with you"
I miss laughing with you.
It's the kindness and the ability to forgive; that requires real strength.
she'll continue to bloom with or without you. she's fierce like that
"I'm sorry, I don't love half-ass."
"Just tell her she's pretty and fuck her every chance you get, motherfucker."
Deep thinkers deserve deep lovers.
"a lot on my mind, but mostly you"
you are more than the sadness in your eyes
"Some people leave, but how they go stays."
Love smelling you on my skin.
Looking her in the eyes as you slide inside is the best feeling ever.
can i taste that?  *points at your lips
Writing helps me heal.
I hope you don't mind if I think about you for a little while longer or forever.
"when they ask me about you, i tell them, ""she was the most beautiful thing to have ever happened to me, and I broke her."""
Every part of my existence craves your soul.
Perpetually infatuated with you.
You were mine like no one else would ever be.
"Relax, nobody cares."
Life is short. Fuck a lot.
No response is a fucking response. If only some people knew that.
Find yourself a girl with just the right amount of crazy and make her feel comfortable enough to let it fly.
Homesick for you.
I ache when I miss you. .. I miss you all the time.
I got you tattooed on my mind.
But does he make you feel sexy?
your eyes taste like i'd be in love for the rest of my life
There's a bright spot in every dark cloud. You're my bright spot.
Shut the fuck up and sit on my face.
I hope you get to spend your life with the love of your life.
Hope you think of me when you feel loved.
"Tell her you love her, dumbass."
"The moon is often dark and alone, but she's beautiful."
"If you see her, please tell her she'll always be loved."
Tell me about your day. I miss that.
"swear to fuck, death can feel so tempting at times"
mood: my handprint on your canvas
For you? Always yes.
Being quiet with you is all the magic I'll ever need.
I'm trying to hold on to you and let you go at the same time.
I dreamt about us being together and didn't want to wake up.
"You are there for everyone, but who is there for you?"
"I just want to pull you in my arms, hold you tight, and heal all the pain in your heart. Is that too much to ask?"
I'm in love with your sexy as fuck mind.
Be gentle with yourself; you are still healing.
you're fucking insane but adorable.
you are mine &gt;&gt;&gt; i love you
Some of us love for life.
"When I'm sad, I think of you. I think of us.  I read your words. I look at your pictures. I think of the moments we spent together.  It helps me forget. It makes me smile. It helps ease the pain for a little while."
Talking to the moon about you.
Stop mistaking someone's patience for their weakness.
His love looks so beautiful on her.
"Even though it left me sad and broken, it was all worth it in the end."
"hey there, can i borrow a hug?"
Coffee is a lot like drinking a hug from your lover.
I think what sucks most about anxiety is how suddenly it can creep up on you and surprise the fuck out of you.
you deserve to be with someone who wants you as much as you want them; compromise is not an option.
why does it have to be so hard to love yourself?
"i have survived this long without you, haven't i?"
Let me undress your mind and make love to your thoughts.
gentle kisses and bruised hearts
"And now, I'd like to kiss you."
Can you miss someone you haven't seen in like a decade?
I would sell my soul to go back in time and kiss you one more time.
"if it's all the same to you, i'd like to keep loving you"
"fuck, i want you"
Hate that you spend so much time in my head but none in my arms.
It's love. It doesn't always have to make sense.
I'm sorry I'm not someone worthy of your love.
"nvm, i'll be here missing you"
"I always wondered what heaven feels like, and then I finally heard you say my name."
"know your fucking worth, for fucks sake."
How I hoped we never became strangers again.
Some silences can potentially kill you.
I'll keep writing until I find you.
"“you're so quiet"" yes, you should try it too, sometime."
Coffee and fuck you until you can't walk straight?
I want to hug you and tell you how much I have missed you.
Truthfulness is such a turn on.
Might fuck around and tell you how I feel about you.
Some days my mind is the loudest place in the entire galaxy.
Are you going to read these words &amp; miss me when I'm gone?
I tried forgetting you...
"Sorry I couldn't take my eyes off you and didn't hear a word you said.  In my defense, I was in love."
"Out of sight, but always on my mind."
"Netflix recommendations, please?"
You're like coffee for my soul.
"""Follow your heart.""  my heart follows you..."
Me and you and the beach and sunset. And silence.
I've been thinking about all the words I want to say to you.
you are what my heart desires the most.
One day you will stumble upon someone who will ignite a fire in you that cannot die.  Keep them close.
She was brave and strong and soft and broken all at once.
Those eyes will be the death of me.
I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that we were both made for each other.
Could you hold my heart tonight?
I'm not for everyone. I'm barely enough for myself.
"Just when you think you can't feel sad anymore, something reminds you of them, and you fall apart all over again."
Sometimes I wonder if I'm in there somewhere in your thoughts like you're always in mine.
her eyes are a goddamn love language.
Darkness. It's tempting.
You have no idea how lonely it gets without you.
There's so much I want to tell you and no way to do it.
Kiss you until you forget everything else and chill?
I think about your voice a lot.
My rooftop or yours?
I am in a love-hate relationship with my demons. It's complicated.
Sometimes we grow quiet in order to survive.
How do I unlove someone like you?
I wish you were here in my arms right now.
"If they want you, they'll make sure you feel wanted."
"I don't get jealous, I get indifferent."
Not giving a fuck is easier. Try it sometime.
At what point does it get too broken to break any further?
stupid fucking hearts and the way they ache.
I'm just glad we felt the same thing there for a little while.
When you can read i love you in their eyes. That.
Forgive. Don't forget.
"I have never cared much about fitting in, and I never will."
Heart full of you.
I'll always find new ways to love and admire you.
"If it didn't hurt so much, there would be no reason to write."
"Excuse me for loving you so much, but I think I'll keep doing that."
She's got the most mesmerizing eyes I have ever seen.
There's so much I'd like to share with you.
This heart belongs to you whether you claim it or not.
It takes having everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know its true worth.
Even guys like to be held and kissed and pampered every once in a while.
Death by impossible cravings.
"I'm in love with you, and it's irreversible."
"Soft on the outside, complete chaos inside."
this new year's eve tastes like we should be kissing.
Raw words &amp; bruised hearts.
Sunsets will never disappoint you.
You looked prettier when you were in love with me.
"Fare thee well, December, you cold sonofabitch."
How many broken dreams are you made of?
We all deserve someone who understands and appreciates our depths.
What are you gonna do to my heart tonight?
My heart hurts for you.
Someone somewhere could be missing you.
Let me write poetry on your back with my lips.
Imagine being loved with the same intensity with which you love.
Because you are my destiny. That's why.
"There was a lot to be said, so they both stayed quiet."
How many silent screams are you made of?
The weight of unsaid words...
Look at your surviving 2020 with all its fuckery.
Do you think lunar beings fantasize about earth too?
"If they saw you the way I do, they’d love the hell out of you too."
"I miss you like crazy, but I probably won't tell you that."
Life is too short to not fall in love with someone like you every day.
My heart has a weakness for you.
Finding sanctuary in the dark.
will you be able to forgive yourself for loving me?
I couldn't stop loving you even if I tried.
Stuck somewhere between wanting you so fucking much and not being able to do anything about it.
Some days you feel too much.
"I could get lost in the woods or your deep brown eyes, you decide."
They're all a little bit crazy. Choose your poison and stick with it.
"Sorry to burst your bubble, but there's no hope for 2021 either."
"Because baby, your laughter is music to my ears."
Eyes filled with poetry &amp; sadness.
Thank you for reminding me that a person can be your everything.
"If they cared, they'd make time."
The darkness will never give up on you the way everybody else did.
I would never forget the way your words felt against my soul.
All ya 2020 haters need to relax. Next year could be worse.
There's no art as fascinating as the art of survival.
drug of choice: you
I could do with a hug right about now.
Loving with all you have is an art.
There are goodbyes that leave you aching for more.
"Some people are truly unforgettable, no matter how hard you try."
It hurts exponentially more when you know who you’re missing is never going to be yours.
There’s just something about you I find so intriguingly irresistible.
"Every time you cross my mind, the craving, and the aching multiplies."
There will always be a piece of you in me.
"you get hurt, and i bleed."
Our hearts were beautiful together.
are you a girl or his favorite nightmare?
"Baby, I'm permanently addicted to you."
you must have a broken heart to be writing this beautifully.
"If I wrote you a letter, would you write back?"
I see you in everything beautiful around me.
A kind soul holds a broken heart with love.
Maybe I'll get lucky and wake up to a message from you.
I can hear you the loudest when you're at your quietest.
There's a beautiful scar on my heart with your name on it.
I like to imagine that you still miss me the way I miss you.
I want to feel you with my hands and taste you with my tongue.
Don't judge them until you have lived their reality.
I want to be wherever it is that your thoughts go.
My darkness is a lot more bearable than it used to be.
"you see their smile, but do you also see their pain?"
"December, we meet again."
Dreamless nights and thought-free days can be a blessing at times.
sadness looks so beautiful on you.
I miss being held by your words.
I fucking hate winter nights without you.
Kiss her quiet.
All the love I couldn't share with you is still yours.
"Please stop trying, you are not her."
Careful who you ache for. Not everyone is worth the pain.
It's fucking hard to love and not be able to do anything about it.
Fucking Twittergram.
Fuck off to Instagram with your Fleets.
Look inside to understand all that you see outside.
"of course, my words are inspired by you."
"It's a dark, dark year. I need you."
It's okay to disappear every now and then to protect your mental health.
You have no idea how fucking hard it is to not think about you all the time.
To turn back time and give you a hug that lasts forever.
"Less overthinking, more kissing."
I wish I could hear your thoughts when you are lost in mine.
"More boobs, less bullshit."
"If I were to fall in love again, it would still have to be you."
can i skip all the days that don't have you in them?
"contemplating breaking the ice, and texting you...  NAH."
"The way they say ""fuck"" tells you all you need to know about them."
I don't want to know anyone the way I knew you.
"I have no idea where I'm going, love me anyway."
"I have never stopped thinking about you since the moment we met, and I don't think I ever will."
"It doesn't get easier, trust me."
Are you even alive if you aren't in love?
"seriously, though, fuck off."
"This is just a reminder that you'll always be special to me, no matter what."
holding you tightly in my thoughts
"It's okay, I'm okay. It only hurts all the time."
"hi. come, be my bad girl."
I know there is pain in your life yet you choose to ignore it and be kind to people. I respect you for that.
I miss your words and the way you said them.
It's hard to give up when you have felt how I feel about you.
Us not talking doesn't stop me from thinking about you all the damn time.
I miss reading beautiful poems in your eyes.
I'm dark by design.
You were so much better than anyone else ever will be.
How are you surviving today?
Falling for her was like looking her in the eyes and realizing that I was home.
Nevada is not gonna cum anytime soon.
I'm under no obligation to keep accommodating toxic people. Neither are you.
Let's fuck off together.
"I'm tired of not being able to talk to you, hold you, kiss you, make love to you."
"Baby, you make love feel beautiful."
we all need more boobies in our lives to be honest
mood: tits &amp; coffee.
Nevada is gonna be the decider. Who'd have thunk?!
I would like to stop hurting for a little while.
aaaand Michigan just flipped too. 😳
have you considered deactivating?
today needs more coffee
"All these miles between us, yet all I see is you."
"fewer elections, more erections, amirite?"
Let's fuck until the results are out.
Wisconsin has flipped. 😲
I miss how everything was so perfect between us.
I think it's game over for Biden. Trump will get more than 295 electoral votes.
Craving the impossible.
"We have all broken our hearts for someone, be considerate."
"Of course, I'll fight for you, but I'd much rather fight with you."
This numbness that you feel can be a blessing at times.
Have you voted yet? Who did you vote for?
this pandemic can fuck the fuck off.
The number of times I click on your avi on any given day is insane.
"I just want to sit by the ocean in silence, watch the waves crash at my feet with you by my side."
"my heart misses yours, regardless"
2020 is lava
I look at the moon when I miss you.
"Maybe a long, tight hug from you could fix this."
I didn't choose you. The heart wants what the heart wants.
"Wherever I go, my heart resides with you."
I need a quiet place to hide from my thoughts.
This version of reality is a motherfucker.
It's never too late for a quickie.
"It’s not all bad, I could still die soon."
There was a time when I used to know you better than yourself.
"In theory, I should be over you by now."
am i not the person you said you'd never stop loving?
I miss listening to the smile in your voice.
Fuck terrorism; it's aiders and abettors and approvers and financiers. Fuck them all.
"I do not claim to understand love, but I'm lucky to have felt it."
I would rather be missing you than loving somebody else.
Some souls are meant to heal your broken. Keep them close.
who do you think of when everything hurts?
My eyes have so much to say to you.
I don't want to be found if it's not with you.
I hope you never lose who you love the most.
"It's a dark, dark year."
so close yet so far away.
"Always you, nothing changes that."
fuck!
so alone in crowds without you.
"I don't know about you guys, but I think sad eyes are fucking beautiful."
Some days I hope.
"Can't really fight it, you run in my veins."
He loved her with everything he had; a part of him always will.
I'm so sick of this shit.  *points at life.
"Fall in love with sunsets, most human beings suck anyway."
Some goodbyes continue to hurt long after they're over and done with.
do you still hurt for me the way i do for you?
It is always yourself you need to forgive in order to move on.
Being with you brings me peace.
"Baby, come, let's make art."
"Be careful who you fall in love with, sometimes it's for life."
Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Fuck off.
You can never forget the eyes that used to make you feel alive.
"Now more than ever, I need to hear your voice."
If you only knew all the words I keep to myself.
"are you sad, or are you sad?"
Normalize not taking someone's kindness for granted.
Nothing breaks you like slowly watching them unlove you.
But do you see the pain behind their smile?
I hope you feel loved today.
"some days, it's numbness some days, it's absolute devastation"
Mindfuck me harder.
"But does he explode with happiness when he sees you, too?"
mood: neck kisses &amp; back rub.
I have loved you enough to last this lifetime and all the lifetimes to come.
"""you're so quiet"" thanks, it's because you're stupid."
Do not belittle an ordeal you are yet to endure.
"I want to read all of you, the entire book, and I want to take my time doing it."
Let's talk in silence until there are no more words left to say.
Just got tested for coronavirus.🤞
An ache so deep it becomes a permanent part of your being.
"If anyone could have you, I don't want you."
"I saw beauty in her, and it's the only thing that mattered."
"Of course, I care. I'm just tired of explaining."
"I look at the sky, and I hope."
Hearts that fit beautifully together should never have to be separated.
Love is her voice whispering my name.
A kiss to remember.
That smile is my favorite reason to be alive.
A pair of brown eyes can change your life forever.
I daydream about us more than I should.
why do you have to be so beautiful inside and out?
I feel so lost without you.
"sorry, dear heart, i've been so reckless with you"
"""you're so quiet"" thanks, it's because of all the suffering."
Sadness gets me.
I miss waking up to a text from you every morning.
Fuck love if it's not with you.
"Of course, I care about you, more than you'll ever know."
Does it ever get better?
"If watching them hurt doesn't hurt you, you never loved them in the first place."
"I'm dark, and I love it here."
"Because baby, I haven't felt anyone the way I felt you."
Sometimes the loneliest place to be is amongst people.
"There's so much I want to say to you, and none of it matters."
"Forever is a myth, stop chasing it."
I admire originality over everything else.
We could have grown fucked up together.
It's all there in the eyes.
"my head hurts, kiss me."
Better to have loved and lost. Always.
"Over the years, you have been my one constant. Thank you for that."
Find someone who matches your depths mentally and emotionally. Everything else is secondary.
I'd let you fuck with my heart and get away with it.
Fuck happiness. It's over-rated anyway.
Thank you for existing.
"This poem that got stuck in my throat, I hope I could read it to you someday."
"hi, i’m sad. you?"
Not everyone’s hoping to be found. Let people be.
My words are just words; you were the meaning.
It was always your heart to do as you please.
"Pain changes you, but it can also strengthen you if you are willing to let it."
the smell of winter and memories...
mood: you and me. all night long. conversing.
Morning. What are we freaking out about today?
It's crazy how there's still so much of you in me.
"If you were here holding my hand, nothing else would matter."
"There was so much more to us than just wild, carnal instincts."
Love that hint of crazy in your eyes.
Check on your favorite asshole today.
I can be a gentleman and still fuck you like a savage.
you are the only glimmer of hope in my darkness
But does she feel you inside her even when you're miles away?
But do you swallow?
I'm not okay with losing you.
Who do your thoughts carry you to when everything else hurts?
Coffee so dark it compliments your mood.
"he came, he saw, he left heartbroken."
I look forward to a lifetime of missing you. Miss me back sometimes.
Because I love loving you.
"I suffered in silence, let me mourn in peace."
"my head hurts, everybody shut up."
"your heart is art, and I'm completely mesmerized."
Wanna tie you up and reset you to factory settings.
I miss you every time I breathe.
Because loving you comes naturally to me.
Who knew you'd make me fall so fucking hard.
heavy heart and sad eyes
"I have never forced anyone to stay in my life. Heck, I have never even asked, and I never will."
"I don't know why, but I’m missing you more than usual today."
"Of course, I still love you.  Leave me the fuck alone."
so how are we suffering today?
The sky paints beautifully how I feel about you.
You’ll never feel unwanted in my heart.
I'm tired of not being able to hug you.
The quiet ones need to be heard too.
Some days my mind is the loudest place in the neighborhood.
Kiss her neck and watch her lose all her self-control.
"One day you too shall fall in love, and then you will understand."
I'll never forget how you made me feel.
We met for a reason. I have never doubted that.
"baby, you taste so good in my dreams"
"Sure you're pretty, but do you have any depth too?"
Don't let them tame your wild. It matters.
One last hug for old time's sake?
Imagine finding your soulmate and being with them for the rest of your life. Is that even a thing?
It’s been a long fucking time since I’ve been myself.
my main goal right now is to be dead.
"This heart will never crave anyone else, I can assure you of that."
Some kisses are truly unforgettable.
"First choice?  Baby, you are my only choice."
Spread love and share orgasms. It's really that simple.
It's real if the silence between the two of you becomes foreplay.
Some silences have the potential to slowly kill you on the inside every day.
What they think doesn't matter when you are aware of your true worth.
"Nothing's wrong, but nothing feels right either."
I regret not making more memories with you when I had the chance.
I wonder if you remember the day we first met.
The fact that you're not mine to miss doesn't stop me from missing you all the damn time.
"Once someone's dead to me, they stay dead for good."
The places my thoughts escape to are full of silence and you.
"I find myself in your words, and that's the most beautiful gift anyone has ever given me."
Some love stories never end.
"Fuck, I'm exhausted."
survival tool: numbness
"When in doubt, fall in love."
I hope the happiness you deserve finds you when you are ready to be found.
"Let's spoil the fuck out of each other, then go our separate ways."
"Life is short. Make love. Like, a lot."
Life has been canceled. Go back to bed.
"If you can dream it, you can achieve it."
My mind craves you more than my body does.
Broken hearts weigh a hell lot more than the ones that are whole.
"To love, that transcends both distance and time."
Don't look at me like that unless you want us to sin.
Some days all you can think of are the moments spent with them.
"Beautiful, heart-wrenching silences that haunt eternally."
To the words that remain unsaid.
Never take their scars for granted.
"Maybe I want you to text me, you don't know."
The sexual tension between fuck you and I want to fuck you.
"Idk, do I look like someone who gives a fuck?"
Her mind is such a turn on.
I miss conversing with you more than anything else.
To the letters that were left unsent.
Let me show you what my heart tastes like.
"I barely remember your voice, but I would never forget what it could do to me."
drug of choice: darkness
"bruised, but not broken. yet."
"Real love is not easy, but it's worth every bit of trouble."
"Alexa, turn off the notifications inside my head."
Woke up craving your lips on mine again.
"When it comes to you, I don't trust my own heart."
You are the words that form at the tip of my tongue but go unsaid.
"If it's love, it will be timeless."
mental health status: too dead to care
"I'm sad, and I miss you."
"I may be flawed, but I love with everything I have."
Some nights it takes every ounce of you to silence the voices inside your head.
some girls are bullets
The sexual tension between the moon and sadness.
My heart gets turned on a little bit every time I look at you.
I hope you get through the battles you tell nobody about.
"Darkness engulfed me a long time ago, and I have learned to be okay with that."
them:  me: fuck no
"you're much more than what you have endured, remember that"
Some silences hurt more than words ever could.
"and if you fuck that up, it'll break you for good."
"fuck coffee, i want you"
How did your heart become my favorite place to be.
does it hurt? yes  was she worth it? fuck yes
no one:  introverts:
what do you do when you miss them and have no way of telling them.
"September, be kind."
confession: you were my favorite impossible thing.
"Is it just me, or do you find sadness beautiful too?"
"The words I don't say, are the ones I feel the most."
mood: hunt you down and have my way with you.
mood:
All this injustice around the world breaks my heart.
Wear your darkness proudly. It looks beautiful on you.
I don't know what I'd do without all this sadness.
mood: new moon and eternal sadness
Let love hold you for a change.
You look like you could really use a hug.  C'mere.
"fuck, we should be making out right now."
She's the midnight to my darkness.
"you may never hold my hand again, but you will always hold my heart"
"If he doesn't breathe ""fuck"" every time you walk by, he's not the one."
I'm not nearly as dark as I used to be.
It would be so much better if you were here wearing nothing but a playful smile.
"Physically I may be anywhere, but mentally I'm always with you."
"with your hands in mine, what else would i possibly need?"
"the hurt is endless, and the screams silent."
The act of surviving can be both painful and beautiful at the same time.
let's talk about what you're going to do with my heart
I wish my dreams were kinder to me.
"When every thought leads to them, that's how you know."
"I'll be the first person to reach out when you need me, and the first person to leave when you don't anymore."
do you still sometimes scribble their name absentmindedly on random pieces of paper?
"I hope when you listen to our song, it brings a smile on your pretty face."
most meaningful i love yous are wordless
"You are cute, wanna fuck about it?"
i'll not survive another goodbye from you
bleeding love until the last sigh
i don't want love if it's not with you
A place to exist quietly in your thoughts.
I w̶a̶n̶t̶ need you in all the ways imaginable.
You don't forget people you fall in love with sunsets with.
Stop overthinking and let's kiss.
"Your smile is like oxygen to me, and I have been deprived of it for so long now."
Your eyes tell me everything I need to know to feel alive.
You are the words I write but never share.
I miss how full of hope I was with you.
Love and let love.
She is my favorite color of the sky.
Quit torturing yourself over things you can't control.
"We may never talk again, but I will always feel you in my heart."
Eyes like wildfire.
Good girls cum for those who wait.
"Her heart is the wildest, most beautiful place I have known."
"Some days, you can't even tell where it hurts the most."
"“you changed” yes, I stopped giving a fuck."
We would have been beautiful together.
"to me, integrity is everything"
a message from you messes with my heartbeats.
Let me be with you in my thoughts a little while longer.
There will always be a place for you in my heart.
"New heart, who dis?"
I was at my most hopeful with you.
"fuck, i miss you so much it hurts all the way down to my bones."
Can you not stop messing with my breathing?
"New handle, who dis?"
I can feel my heart beat in sync with you from a thousand miles away.
Deep conversations followed by rough sex. That.
"Who heals the healer though, have you ever thought about that?"
"We were not perfect, but the chemistry we had was fucking magical."
You were the one I learned to love with. How could I want it with anyone else.
"come, be my person."
Unleash your inner whore.
"fuck, i miss you"
"If I let you in, don't fuck it up."
The calm between storms feels the heaviest sometimes.
"With the right person, quiet sunsets are everything."
There is something insanely beautiful about your heart.
Are you mine like I'm yours?
I'll never forget the way you touched my heart.
"Don’t ask her to smile, fucking make her."
I have got 99 problems and you not being with me is all of them.
"No tragedy can keep me from loving you, not even death."
I'm emotionally unavailable. Can I just fuck you instead?
There's no calming this heart after the storm that is you.
I want to feel vulnerable with you again.
"With the right person, silence is intimacy."
"You look delicious, can I taste you?"
I blame no one but my heart.
I'd let go if I knew how.
"Beautiful, abandoned places inside my heart."
The things I'd do to you when we meet would make you blush and wet at the same fucking time.
"It's raining, come, fall with me."
"I wish you were here, I've got silences I'd like to share."
"I have endured darkness, and it has made me kind."
"I'm lost, no one knows how to find me, and I'm okay with that."
I still love you like it's 2010.
Normalize not being ashamed of how you feel and how you choose to heal.
A few clicks from last night.
I'm ready to surrender to the moon tonight.
Slap her ass and kiss her neck for no reason.
"Was it that easy, forgetting me?"
"You have no idea how beautiful your heart is, do you?"
Obsessed with sunsets and you.
I find myself when I get lost in your eyes.
I want coffee and I need you.
"It is all so fucked up, we need to be more patient with each other."
You can taste a million different emotions in a kiss.
It feels as though I would need another hug from you to survive this year.
"Because baby, you are the only place that feels like home."
Every. Fucking. Day.
I want to kiss you and tell you you are my everything and more.
The desire to be with you holds me together and breaks me simultaneously.
"Sometimes I still hope, and all I see is you."
"If it's not too much to ask, I'd like to hear your voice again."
you have no idea how intoxicating her eyes are.
How many times have you wanted to give up but didn't?
"I just want to hug you, fuck everything else."
sucks to be me ... without you by my side.
"I write my heart out, and you think it's poetry."
I carry so much of you in my heart.
I’ll never forget how beautiful watching you tuck your hair behind your ear felt.
"Still love you, still ache for you."
Bookmarking all the words I wish I could say to you.
My heart chose you because.   I wish I knew. The heart wants what the heart wants.
Bring me some coffee and come sit on my face.
I want to taste every sinful thought you have ever had.
I hope the sadness inside you is bearable today.
"I'm an old soul with a tender heart, and the possibilities are endless."
"Stay, for I cannot afford to let you go."
"I miss you, fuck off."
"It's raining, and I wonder if the blue sky misses you as much as I do."
Fluent in loving you.
Ride him like you stole him.
I'm ready to feel something real again.
"Good things take time. Be patient, and don't fuck it up."
Eyes like a tragedy waiting to happen.
this coffee tastes like i wanna fuck you and then make love to you.

"Lightening strike at Bar Beach, NSW."
"I may have forgotten the words, but I'll always remember your eyes."
I have felt you in words poets can only dream of.
There are abandoned places inside my heart where once you used to dwell majestically.
Surviving between the lyrics.
What would you say to them if you were to get that final goodbye you were deprived of and still ache for?
I miss being loved.
We don't have to be together to love each other forever.
"I need a nap, and when I wake up, I want your lips on mine."
I spend a lot of time thinking about how you spend yours.
sext: show me the real you.
It's damn near impossible not to fall in love with the sadness in her eyes.
"Push her against the wall, put her hands above her head, and kiss the living hell out of her."
"hey. if you need help naming your vagina, hmu."
Stop acting like you don't care when it's actually breaking your heart.
I miss your late night shenanigans. I miss you.
Nothing fucks you up quite like a betrayal by a dear friend.
"You can't break what's already broken. At least, there's that."
"There was something so remarkably alleviating about the way she used to look in my eyes and smile as if she understood me, and the way she used to hold me tightly when she hugged me as if she knew we were meant to be together.  She felt like home in the middle of nowhere."
"baby, your eyes give you away."
"Are you lost, baby girl, because I'd like to find you."
"It will always be you, I have never doubted that."
"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the sluttiest of them all?"
I love you. Sometimes I wish it was good enough.
Love and kindness are the only way out of this mess. Don't let the crazy voices in your head tell you otherwise.
I miss dreaming about a future with you.
"Come, kiss the darkness from my lips."
You keep happening to me. Don't you get tired or something?
Let your heartbeats tell me.
"I don't just miss you, I hurt for you."
I need to learn to be gentle with myself.
I bet you'd look pretty on my lap.
"Baby, we don't belong here. Let's go find another galaxy."
"I know you can be a good girl when needed, but can you be a bad girl when I ask you to?"
"I'm more than just words, but not everybody gets to see that."
"I saw her eyes, and my heart caught fire."
"You licked it, so it's yours."
How some of you are still alive is beyond me.
"Trying to forget how your skin felt against mine, and failing miserably."
"Tell me, how do you manage to be everywhere inside my head yet so far away?"
I hope staying the fuck away from me fixes you.
The night sky alone knows how badly I miss you.
Are you a girl or a weapon of mass destruction?
"Those soft, thunderous eyes."
"When the realization hits you that instead of being a part of your life, they have been reduced to being just a memory."
Let's just skip to the part where we continue to love each other from afar and never talk again.
I'll never be able to forget your eyes.
A silence more meaningful than words.
Don't make someone question their worth just because you fail to see yours.
I want to feel safe in your arms for a while.
Fall in darkness with me.
"If loving you was easy, I'd never do it."
I can't stop thinking about kissing you.
What part of my Twitter persona makes you think I care about your opinion?
Poetry is pain converted into art.
where do you go when all hope is lost?
"I wonder if somewhere in the dead of night, our thoughts touch each other."
"dear heart, that's enough."
There's a poem written on my heart with your name on it.
Something inside me breaks every time I see you hurting.
You exist everywhere in this heart I have kept alive.
"I feel, and so I write."
You can tell a lot about them by looking at the way her body responds to his touch.
i'll touch your books so hard.
sext: let me ruin you with my eyes.
Raindrops and tears are a beautiful combination.
"i love you, it's awful."
Soul aches are undoubtedly the worst of the lot.
"It's alright if I don't mean much to you anymore, but know that you will always mean the world to me."
You wouldn't realize you're addicted to their smile until they're gone.
Absolutely nothing can fill the void you left behind.
cause of death: too much loyalty.
There's so much of you in everything I write; I wonder if you can feel it.
Dreams filled with sunsets and you.
"If we are together, we are fucking all the time."
"i didn't change, i grew out of it."
I'd moan for you.
"If it's not killing you slowly every day, is it even unrequited love?"
"If they wished you the best even after you broke them, it's more your loss than theirs."
cause of death: she whispered my name.
"It's raining, let's fuck."
"i'm ready darling, let's go. 😂"
A soul hug that washes away the pain.
Come and plant your kisses all over me.
"If I could, I would hold you in my arms and never let you go."
I'm beginning to accept that it's going to hurt every day for the rest of my days.
"""I'm a horny engineer, I never joke about math or sex."""
"How hard is it to understand, really?  If you have been tested positive, stay the fuck away from people, asshole."
Some memories can break you in silence.
I'll break my own heart before I let anyone else break it.
"When we finally meet again someday, I'll show you what it means to love you."
Sometimes strangers on the internet make your day with kind words like these.
"Neither friends nor enemies, just  two strangers with a magical past."
I have spent my entire life loving you. I'm not stopping now.
"I love you, and that's never going to change."
Take my heart and convert it into art.
I missed you so much again today.
Your bruised heart makes you even more beautiful to me.
Fluent in unsaid words and suppressed sighs.
"It will always be you. It's not like I have a choice. I was born to love only once in my lifetime, and I have had my chance."
your eyes are my safe place.
I hope one day you see me the way I see you.
Surely one day you'll miss me back.
"Despite all her scars, she loves beautifully."
Note to self: quit longing for the unattainable.
Your smile intoxicates me like no other drug.
I'll never apologize for the way I feel about you.
"Remember me kindly, that's all I ask."
Imagine finding someone who loves you with everything they have and not screwing that up.
Fuck this year in the ass without lube.
"i'd never claim to understand the severity of your grief, but i'll always be there to lend you a shoulder to cry on."
"A moment of such perfection, it becomes etched on your memory for years to come."
are you fucking kidding me?
"Aren't you tired of saying, I'm okay, when in fact, you're not fucking okay."
How do you get over someone you have imagined spending forever with.
I have felt you in every shade of emotions.
"Come, kiss me, and please don't stop."
"Not quite sure what I want in life, but I know it has to be with you."
"In my dreams, we are together, and it's always sunset."
You have been broken for so long you have forgotten that you are capable of being loved again.
I wish I could hug away the sadness in your eyes.
Trying to write my way out of the heartbreak.
you look like someone who hasn't been hugged enough. come here.
"don't trust me, trust the sky."
"I dreamt about you this morning, you were so beautiful. I wanted to kiss your everything."
my soul is not for sale.
"You are always here, even when you are not."
It doesn't matter if I matter to the rest of the world as long as I matter to you.
"Death by beautiful, brown eyes."
Some bruises are worth the ache.
Some nights are insufferable without you.
Your eyes tell stories your heart can't cash.
Life and bittersweet endings.
"You can't fake ingenuity, no matter how hard you try."
"For what it's worth, I'll never forgive myself for what I did to you."
"Just fuck her good and tell her how much she means to you, dumbass."
"I thought my heart was invincible. Then, I met her."
Short girls taste better. It's science.
But are you willing to fall with me?
"In case anyone hasn’t told you today, you are pretty fucking beautiful."
You don't forget people you discover your soul with.
I miss you harder on days I find it difficult to love myself.
I'd write you a handwritten love letter if you promise not to break.
I thought my heart was incapable of love before I met you.
I want you by my side when the world disintegrates.
2020 is a weird fucking year.
"If I were bi, I'd fuck both versions of your fucking faceapp."
"I might ache for you for the rest of my life, but I'll never chase you."
"Some days, quietness is bliss."
Shutting down and other acts of self-preservation.
"nobody cares about your problems, shut the fuck up."
My heart is my only foe.
I'm willing to break again if it helps you heal.
I have kissed you far too many times to forget what magic tastes like.
Your eyes tell stories your words never could.
Fuck it all kinda mood.
"Remember, when I could still talk to you. I miss those days."
"Come, choke on my words."
"If you can't impress me with your intellect, we probably won't fuck."
"mood: me, you and 365 Days."
I can't remember not being in love with you.
Homesick for a heart that once used to be mine.
"Hate to break it to you, but fifteen likes on a tweet do not make you an influencer, bro."
It was in those fragile moments when you shared the real you that I fell in love with you.
"The world is fucked up, and I miss you."
"Hear me out, an otc drug to help you move on."
You will never know what it's like to ache for you.
"I don’t have a vibe. If we type, we type."
I may look like fun but I'm dead inside.
"No words, just a shoulder for you to lean on and cry your heart out."
You are the prettiest ache I have ever felt. Thank you for existing.
Missing you more than the usual  today.
You will never be able to forget me. I can guarantee you that.
"When I talk about love, I really am just talking about you."
Am I dark enough for you to fall in darkness with me yet?
mood: confessing to the night sky.
"Of course, my words hurt; I used to be in love once."
"I remember everything, even things I ought to forget."
"Some days, loneliness can be a bitch."
"Fuck nudes, write something for me."
I'd like the nights I spent obsessing over you back if that's alright with you.
"The future is dark, and it is upon us."
Love doesn't give a fuck about rules.
"You know, you're impossible to not love, right?"
"I love you, and it's pretty much all that matters."
Sometimes I wonder what you feel when you read my words.
"Hang in there, baby. I'll come, find you."
"Do you ever just want to hug someone and tell them how much they mean to you, but you can't, so you slowly die inside instead."
Stay with me until I'm whole again.
I want to hug you until our scents become indistinguishable.
"I'm fucked up, I'm ordinary, and I make mistakes, but I love fucking hard.  Sometimes it's a blessing, sometimes it's a curse."
Sometimes I wonder what those lips taste like and get dreamy.
"I like how you hold me together, even when you are falling apart."
You are the most painful goodbye I have ever had to endure.
There comes a point in life when you realize that a healthy mental connection means fucking everything.
I'll just keep loving you.
I hope I survive myself today.
"I see you hurting, and I wish I could take the pain away."
A broken heart holds love more gently.
Whatever words I have left in me are all yours.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Perhaps there's hope for our bruised hearts yet.
"Surviving on coffee, sunsets, and memories of another lifetime."
It takes a lot of character to be kind to someone who breaks your heart repeatedly.
I don't need much else if I have you.
Some days I struggle with the darkness. Some days I'm the darkness.
Imagine being with the love of your life. Wonder what's that like.
"*unbuttons your heart.. ""let's make love."""
You were and shall remain my most prized mindfuck.
I miss my 3ams with you.
"Please, God. We have suffered enough."
"Gentle, fiery eyes and a heavy heart filled with unrequited love."
"June is always so hard on me. Brings back a thousand different memories, both priceless and hurtful."
"When words fail you, love them in silence."
Wanna come over and take advantage of me?
Would you stop overthinking if I kissed you?
Music hits different when your girl's in someone else's arms.
"I have been darker, thank you."
Know what’s easy? Walking away when you're no longer appreciated.
My heart will always seek the peace it found in you.
Bury me in sad poems and dead flowers.
"Next time I see you, I'd let my eyes and hands do most of the talking."
I should have kissed you longer the last time I saw you.
Some people aren't meant to stay in your life. That's one of the harshest truths of life.
All my favorite songs talk to me about you.
When the storm outside compliments the storm inside you. That.
"bitch, please. not today. we have all seen your tits."
you will never know what it's like to love you.
"Locked account with zero followers: whatcha up to, ya fuckin' weirdo?"
"Where do you go when your patience runs out, and you still can't talk to them?"
A part of my heart is permanently closed. It has your name on it.
It feels as if my soul has always known yours.
"I feel words, that's my curse."
Loving you unconditionally and endlessly makes me whole.
"When I'm in, I'm all in. There are no two ways about it."
Life's a heartless bitch.
the world inside me ended the day i Iet you go.
the “i’ve missed you” text that we all long for.
"I know, James, I know."
I don't need to be fixed; I just want to be felt.
"One day I will find the right words, and they will be enough."
All of me aches for all of you.
Two strangers in a multiverse.
Words we don't write come back to haunt us.
All my sighs belong to her.
"It's hard to stay hopeful, but I'm trying."
"Her words, and all the pretty little things they do to my heart."
Some words are mind-numbing pain disguised as parting messages.
There's something so tragically beautiful about the way she looks at him.
Respect the pain and darkness. They were there for you when no one else was.
"It's been so long, yet your presence lingers."
At least I get to keep the memory of your love.
I hope you find it in you to smile today.
Fuck fake. I'd much rather be by myself.
"I'll never get enough of you, so you may as well stop trying."
I want to exist quietly somewhere inside your thoughts.
You are good for my soul. Can I keep you?
I would still love you when the world falls apart.
"The world is hurting, and so am I."
The truth will have the last laugh. It always does.
Find your quiet and fall in love with it.
"Today, just let me be."
Eyes that left imprints on my soul.
"I ruined myself for you, and it was worth every bit of it."
I hope you're ready to love again.
You remind me of everything beautiful that's missing from my life.
"I'm lost, and I will probably never be found."
I sentenced myself to a life without you knowing it would kill me every day for the rest of my days.
Watching the years disappear into the void with no sign of you.
I deserve to feel happy too sometimes.
"Are you always this horny, or is it just my personality?  *awkward wink*"
"Don't ""you do you"" me. I fuck things up and break hearts."
Not to brag but I deleted facebook six years ago and I have never been more proud of myself.
Fuck you guys. I'm switching over to the political twitter.
"If I see you again, I'm kissing your neck."
"My heart hurts. Anyway, thought of you."
"We were not perfect, but what we had was real and magical."
"dear heart, stop fucking around."
"Game over. You quit, I lost, my heart died."
"Fuck her like you are in the middle of a pandemic.. wait, what?"
The deepest of love leaves the deadliest of scars.
"Old souls, quiet sunsets, and timeless love."
"When a beautiful heart touches you, don't fuck with it."
Fuck this sadness.
some i love you's have the potential to haunt you forever.
Death intrigues me. Is that normal?
Only you can fix you. Stop looking elsewhere.
Found my religion inside her eyes and between her thighs.
"You absolutely don't have to respond to every tweet you don't agree with, fuckface."
"I may never forget you, but I have already forgiven you."
"With or without conversation, you will always be my favorite person."
Some souls stay connected for good.
"Yes, I love her. No, I'm not going to do anything about it."
I don't like the person I become when I haven't heard from you in a while.
"Love will break you, and you will let it."
"If I could, I would hold you in my arms and make time stop."
"Touch my lips, taste my emotions, kiss me."
"yes, heart, i miss them too."
Her smile is the sexiest thing I know.
I hope you are reminded of me when you look up at the moon tonight. I hope it makes you smile.
I need a break from me.
"Those beautiful, devastating eyes."
Sometimes loving them with everything you have is not enough.
Woke up still in love with you.
I want to trace lyrics on your skin with my tongue.
Every breath without you is a different kind of ache.
There's hope left for my heart yet.
"Sometimes when you fall in love, you fall for good. Don't fuck that up."
People often wonder why I'm so quiet as if they don't see it in my eyes.
"I love you. I wish I didn't, but I do. I always will."
Coffee doesn't care if your heart is broken.
I keep forgetting that you no longer love me.
Do your future self a favor and stop being an asshole.
She's not just a girl; she's a lost art.
sext: i got you.
Another day spent aching for you.
Come taste my words.
I think I'll break a little more before I can finally start to heal.
I hear you the loudest when you're quiet.
"For what it's worth, I never stopped loving you and I never will."
"A connection so powerful, you can feel it when they miss you."
Ever wonder who inspires my words?
"Fuck what you think, I write for me."
"You can't just push people away, burn all the bridges, and expect things to be the same again."
At least coffee gets me.
Trying to carry oceans of love in my bare hands.
"I touched her chaos, and I swear it felt like magic."
Some late night conversations you never forget.
"It's all falling apart, and I couldn't care less."
Everything about you is everything I ever dreamt of.
My heart just can't let go of you.
"I miss you, so I write."
I want to taste the poetry on your lips.
It’s damn near impossible not to fall for the magic in her eyes.
She's the kind of high you never really want to recover from.
She's a fucking mess; love her anyway.
"Seriously though, fuck off."
"I'm starving for your touch, and it hurts like hell."
"Some days, all you need is silence and a person who gets you to hold hands with."
But can you touch her without actually touching her?
"Baby, you and I aren't done yet. I have still left a few pages blank in our story for when we meet again."
I don't know how to stop missing you.
Kiss her deep until you can taste her essence.
Damn you for making me crave you so much.
Eye conversations are sensual as fuck.
hi. wanna be my coffee?
I’m not a poet; I write to ease the pain.
The colors in her eyes humble the skies.
I wonder if you can feel the way my heart reaches for you.
The most brutal of wars are fought inside the head.
You will never not be mine.
"Thank you, internet stranger, for interpreting my tweet for me."
Imagine finding someone who felt like home and losing them.
"Some days, you can't even tell where it hurts."
"It's tempting, silence and death, and nothingness."
I just want to be a carving on a tree somewhere peaceful.
I stopped chasing forevers a long time ago.
"A little bit moody, an awful lot magical."
"I want to be able to forget it all, just for a little while."
I hope you learn to love again.
"Don't mind me, I'll be here longing for the unattainable."
I miss places I haven't seen and the person I would have become if I hadn't lost you.
I want to feel alive again.
All my hopes and dreams have but one name.
Amazing how hearts can be both broken and capable of love at the same time.
"Sure, you're breathing, but how long since you last felt alive?"
"Let's take a long walk at sunset, talking about nothing and everything."
"The world is ending, and I want to kiss you more than ever."
"Those eyes, though."
I can't seem to get you out of my head or my heart.
Music hits different when you are dying inside.
Nothing's prettier than your most authentic self. Remember that.
May you fall in love with someone who never gets tired of loving you on your darkest days.
"Fuck it, I'm flying to Andromeda. Wanna come?"
Your scars should encourage you to love harder and live more fiercely.
Not a day goes by without me missing the hell out of you.
"When the dust had settled and the smoke finally cleared, all I could see was you."
An eternity of silence for what could have been.
"I used to smile too, a thousand dreams ago."
"It may be in pieces, but it is all I have."
"If loving someone is hard work for you, you're not doing love right."
Fuck making love. Let's ignite a fire with our bodies.
She's wildfire dressed in calm and subtle indifference.
The fire you once ignited within my soul a forever ago is still burning strong.
I want to listen to you whisper my name on repeat.
Let's sit by the ocean and forget about the rest of the world.
I love you. Let's never talk again.
Death by unsaid words.
"I have my regrets, but loving you shall always be something I'd cherish."
"I keep finding you in old songs, and it breaks my heart."
Some days the darkness engulfs you. Some days you're the darkness.
"We all miss someone, wondering if they miss us too."
Missing you is a full time job.
It's all in the eyes.
Loneliness hits different when you're in love.
"Not to be dramatic, but I think I'm dead inside."
I will never be able to forget you.
I too once had happier stories to tell.
Do you not see that my heart has eyes only for you.
Do you not see the yearnings of a thousand volcanoes waiting to erupt in her eyes?
Let's be enough for each other.
"When the day comes when you can no longer find me, find me inside your heart."
Consume me until I fade away into you.
Amazing how some people have the power to turn around your mood and make your day with just a few words.
It's always kinder to let them be.
Not in the mood for anything but you.
"I'm a bloody mess; come, fix me?"
"If someone you admire responds to you on their tweet once, don't go full psychopath on them.  Twitter 101."
You used to be mine once. Nobody can take that away from me.
Today needs more coffee and less feels.
"A break from feeling so much, please."
An endless cycle of emptiness and restlessness.
"You ask for one song, and all hell breaks loose."
"Kiss her like it's your last kiss, every damn time."
"I don't want for much; a little more coffee, a few more sunsets, another heartbreak or two, and a swift, painless death. That's all I ask."
When can I kiss you again?
A smile that could end wars inside of me.
Sometimes you have to let the darkness light your path ahead.
Her heart is beautiful beyond your wildest dreams.
People who smile despite their heavy hearts are the true heroes.
Some souls love eternally.
"If your word is worth nothing, I can't help but pity you."
Tell me a song that breaks your heart.
Soul aches are the worst.
"This too shall pass, if it doesn't kill us all first."
Nothing makes sense anymore.
Aren't you tired of living a lie?
"Universe, are you listening?"
Tried ghosting my feelings. Little fuckers keep coming back.
Cuntiness is cuntagious.
I hope the lies you tell yourself help you sleep better.
Fuck it. I'm going back to bed.
"hey, can you stop thinking for a minute? your thoughts are distracting me."
"Due to personal reasons, I'd be loving you even harder."
Hug them while you still can.
"If you’re happy and you know it, go fuck yourself."
Being alive is overrated.
Bring your own misery. I don't share.
Today can go fuck itself in the ass.
I’m not good at existing without you.
I don't matter. You don't matter. Nothing fucking matters.
My LDL is off the charts. Can't wait to die. Wbu?
Good fucking morning.
Hi.
"Not all tweets have to make sense, right?"
It's extraordinary how someone can go from telling you absolutely everything that's happening in their life to nothing. People are weird.
There's a difference between being there for someone and being around. Be there or stop being around.
I'll keep touching you inappropriately with my thoughts until I can touch you with all of me.
Nothing makes sense without you.
Hoping against hope to be found.
"Sorry, heart. Not today."
I'll do as I damn well please. Let it be known.
"Hey baby girl, will you be my nightmare?"
I miss how you said my name.
"Soft thighs, gentle kisses."
Soft sighs filled with regrets.
Music hits better when you are missing someone.
"If it's a maybe, it can't be love."
She's full of delicate complexities and beautiful contradictions.
To love is to keep wishing them happiness as you slowly die inside.
Let me taste the rebellion on your lips.
"Twitter is broken af today. Welcome to the club, bitch."
You are all the magic I'll ever need.
Pin you down and make a few confessions with my tongue all over you?
Show me the parts of you that hurt and I'll show you mine.
That smile will be my undoing.
Find someone who loves and cherishes all your scars.
"Remember that one time when you had my hands tied, pinned me down, and made me laugh breathlessly?  I think about that a lot."
"You think you have it all figured out, then life happens."
"Yes, I know. No, I don’t care."
This day would be so much better with a little bit of you in it.
Look at her and tell me magic doesn’t exist.
Cherish the ones who make you feel alive.
"Okay, so who else is tired of this shitshow?"
"Make her want it, heck, make her beg for it, then give it to her until she can't take it anymore."
Don't go chasing forever; it's a fucking ruse.
Let us fuck already.
You were my favorite mindfuck.
Numb is the new black.
"Don't tell me, show me."
My soul finds it hard to survive without you.
The fact that I can breathe without you doesn't mean that I want to.
"I fell for her eyes, stayed for the mind."
We are all lost here. Be kind.
Your heart will forever be my favorite place to be.
I write because it's the only way I feel closer to you.
Craving one of those long silent hugs.  Any givers?
"Excuse me, but have you always been this cunty?"
We are but two strangers who knew each other to the core.
Fuck nudes; show me those eyes.
I wish I could tell you about the songs that remind me of us every time they're on.
"And just like that, they were strangers again."
Our words become art when we pour our souls into them.  Twitter is a fucking museum.
I miss the person I was with you.
Knowing you are enough for someone is the most beautiful feeling ever.
She's love and love is her.
"Come, kiss me into oblivion."
The emptiness in my chest is weighing me down.
Just a friendly reminder to be gentle with yourself today.
I would fall for you again if I wasn't already so smitten.
Cheers to the way we used to adore each other.
"Tell me, love, how does it feel to be the love of my life."
"When you're sad, the lyrics understand you better."
"If you can't think for yourself, we have got nothing in common."
Can the next notification be you? It's been a while.
All my favorite memories start and end with you.
"I was fine, living my life and shit. Then you happened."
The ones that have walked through hell and back are the people I most admire.
"A connection that transcends words, time, distances, and even physicality.   That's true love, and I was fortunate enough to experience that.  Are you?"
⚡️ “Forsaken Dreams”
She. Notices. Everything. She just doesn't care anymore.
"Press your lips against mine, and the world can fuck off for all I care."
A genuine conversation with an intelligent person is such a turn on.
"Be calm, heart. It was just a smile."
I miss the way you took care of my heart.
My shoulder would like to know if it could keep your head forever.
"I'll fingerbang the fuck out of you while we discuss global politics. I'm fuckless like that, meaning I don't give a fuck. Can't. Don't have any to give.  What were we talking about again?"
"I don't know who needs to hear this but stop reading into my tweets so much.  Actually, I do know. It's just rude to point."
"I long, my darling, to feel the touch of your body."
"Life is hard, we know. Stop being a pussy."
"Load up on pain, and it grows on you."
Because life... 🙂
"Once the pandemic is over, could you stop being so fucking stupid?"
We should both be tangled up and kissing the hell out of each other in a car or something.
"Fuck, there really should be a universal limit for missing someone."
Love is love; it doesn't have to make sense.
I'm 98% feelings today.
"I'm yours, always was and always will be, whether you claim me or not is up to you."
"Relax, we're all fucked."
Damn you and your goddamn irresistible ways.
"My hand on your bare thighs, and you'll lose your goddamn mind."
Your presence is all the reassurance I need.
"Listen, bitch. Go fuck your husband or whatever."
"It's been so long, I'd break at your touch."
Kiss my neck and watch me lose all self-control.
"Unfollowing someone after you get a courtesy follow back? Don't do that shit. It's not cool. Fucking noobs.  Fuck off, kindly."
Craving your touch like never before.
"Because every time you cross my mind, all else fades away."
Some hearts can touch you more than hands ever could.
"I lose interest quicker than you can say hey, so please don't bother."
"Even in the darkest of days, you will always be my sunshine."
I'll love you the hardest on days you feel the darkest.
We all deserve someone who accepts us for who we are. Fuck them if they make you feel insignificant.
*wakes up* .. *looks at the world around him* .. *sighs and goes back to dreaming again*
"""oh, not you again.""  - me to you in my thoughts."
"I have seen the parts of her that nobody else gets to see, and they're all so heartbreakingly beautiful."
I know exactly how you feel when I touch you. Your breathing gives it away.
Go on then; break my heart.
Holy fuck. Oil prices in Canada just turned negative.
Sadness never gives up on me.
"It's alright if I don't mean a thing to you anymore, but know that you still mean the world to me."
I had quite a few last words to say. I guess I'll never get to say them.
She's worth every sin.
"Your heart may be a puzzle to everyone else, but I know exactly where each piece fits."
I'll have your ass for dessert.
"Emotional maturity is highly underrated, quite rare, and so fucking beautiful."
"mood: coffee, silence and butt rubs."
I'll dip my finger in your sins and make you repent by licking them off from there.
"I wanna do filthy, unthinkable things to your ass."
Establish dominance by knowing when to shut her up with a kiss.
"Kiss her forehead and tell her everything is going to be alright, motherfucker."
Establish dominance by knowing when to walk away.
I wasn't meant to be a romantic until you happened. You have made a poet out of me.
Are you sick of reading my thoughts yet?
"In my dreams, I daydream about you all the time."
"In my dreams, I frequently die."
"In my dreams, you never leave."
"In my dreams, you are always by my side."
"People who can appreciate the beauty in silence, sadness, and darkness are my people."
"Apocalypse or not, my love for you remains wild and unchanged."
I want to lie on your lap and listen to you talk and kiss and kiss and talk all night.
"It's not me, it's you. Every time I try unloving you, I end up loving you even harder."
Find someone who understands you without the need for words.
sext: can i touch your books?
"I don't care for much except for the heart that belongs to me, and would never really be mine."
Everything about you is so goddamn distracting.
"Her story was both sad and beautiful, kinda like her eyes."
"Come, let me show you how I got these scars."
Let's fuck about it.
I think you're cute. Get the fuck away from me.
*sigh*
I miss you only when I'm breathing.
Meet me where emptiness meets silence and reminisce about the good old days.
I'm in a love-hate relationship with my memories.
I was ignorant of the concept of pain and darkness until you left and snuffed the life out of me.
I felt like myself the most with you.
Okay I'll list down a few I can remember from the top of my head. Pls feel free to add your own.  Sherlock Peaky Blinders The Wire Cosmos Seinfeld Narcos True Detective House of Cards Prison Break Friends Stranger Things Game of Thrones Chernobyl Twin Peaks Black Mirror Dexter
"Idk who needs to hear this, but breaking bad is a tad bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, I liked the show, but it's nowhere near my top 10 all-time favorites."
I could tell your scent hidden amidst a thousand different fragrances.
"Fuck it, I'm ordering pizza."
Is it possible to like someone based on their choice of gifs alone?
"I got so bored retweeting your crappy tweets, I started retweeting myself.  People, do better.  ps: mine are crappier."
Woke up dry humping the bed again.
Still am.
"When nothing else makes sense, I think about us."
I hate myself more than you possibly can. Calm the fuck down.
Kissing you feels right when all else seems terribly wrong.
"If you plan on haunting me forever, at least be gentle about it."
Do I think about you?  All the damn time.
Words are weapons; use them wisely or don't at all.
Hold me close; I'm falling apart.
Let's mix our scents and forget about the world outside for a while.
Unsaid goodbyes can hurt you forever.
Don't be deceived by all the smiles you come across. Some of us are extremely broken inside.
Burn the heart out of me or stop wasting my time.
Sadness is an art form.
All my scars recognize your touch.
"You, me and a distant moonlit shore."
Knowing when to walk away and being able to do so is the ultimate power move.
One of those days when only a hug from you could make me feel better.
"Fuck this reality, let's coexist in a dream together."
Your eyes have a way of making out with my heart.
I have got so much to share with you once this is over that we would need an eternity together. A single lifetime is just not long enough.
I'm saving my heart for you.
"She was once in a lifetime kind of a girl, I was a major fuck up. We were perfect together."
"I came here at the behest of a dear old friend. For years, I hated the app and didn't want anything to do with it.  Now, I spend the better part of my day here, and that old friend is no longer in my life.  Life, huh?"
Indifference is the death of love.
When I grow up I want to be feelingless.
Hi @flaccidiocy. Wanna exchange reply gals for a bit?
My hobbies include watching you smile from afar and silently falling apart.
I'm always a mess. Today is no different.
"It is never too late to make amends, until it is."
Be smart with the choices you make for you will have to live with them all your life.
"You are already so full of yourself, what the fuck do you need me for?"
"There are only a few things I care for, but I care for them so much it fucking hurts."
Must you always disrupt my thoughts?
"I can survive most days on coffee and music. Some days, I need you. Today is one of those days."
"If I use the word fuck excessively with you, know that I care."
You know what's sexy? Everything you.
"I'm sad, you're sad, we're all sad, sad, sad."
"I'd always prefer setting you free over clipping your wings. Always.  Now, you know."
You fall in love with a random ho on the internet every day. I have only ever loved once.  We are not the same.
"Hey, baby. Would you like to be my more than a handful? You sure carry all the right resources."
Some answers can break you harder than the silence ever could.
It's starting to get lonely and I wonder if you feel my soul reach out to yours.
To all three of my followers who are awake and reading me: i love you.
I survive on the love we shared once upon a time.
"All hearts matter. Yes, yours too, motherfucker."
"Fourteen days later, and my pants still fit.  Yep, still winning at life."
Could you heal me back after you are done breaking me.
"What is love if not pretty scars, broken promises, and forsaken dreams?"
I can feel the stillness of the skies and the restlessness of the oceans in your silence.
"Your gentle, violent eyes speak more intensely to me than words ever will."
Tested positive for failing miserably at trying to forget you.
"Come sit on my lap and face me, for there are promises to be kept and love to be made."
Meet we where hugging is still acceptable because I'm going to hug the fuck out of you.
I wonder if you remember the first time we kissed.
"If you don't spoil the fuck out of her, I will.*"
Some silences hurt more than the screams.
"If you don't spoil the fuck out of her, someone else will."
I'll rip those panties off of you with just my eyes. I don't give a fuck.
"She loved me with everything she had, with body and soul. I just wasn't ready to be saved."
"so, this happened:"
"Come, fuck me in my dreams."
A kiss so good it revives your faith in humanity.
"One way or another, fate will bring us together. It always does."
We are nothing but an assortment of memories and scars.
My tweets are real; your tits are not. We are not the same.
It is the relentlessness of your love that I miss the most.
"let's take a walk, you and I. it has been a while.  Iet's talk things through. it has been a while."
I miss taking you in with every breath.
"Hey there, can I interest you in an orgasm?"
We all have that someone we are dying to hug again.
You were the only fuck I ever gave.
"To me, chemistry is everything."
"If your eyes were a religion, I'd start believing again."
"I get drunk, reading you."
I wonder if you read the words I write for you.
I’m the artist; she’s my art.
"If inconvenient, love me anyway."
All boobs heal. It's science.
Muggles can't see this tweet.
You are never not with me.
"Besides the moon and your smile, I do not care for much else."
Slay me softly if you absolutely have to.
Happily hallucinated ever after.
I love the smell of rain on your skin.
"Find your happy place, burn it to the ground."
Sex is amazing but have you ever watched her tuck her hair behind her ear while lost in deep thoughts.
I feel everything. I just don't feel the need to react.
Seduce me with truthfulness.
"I love the darkness. Some days, the darkness loves me back."
Stop seducing me with death threats.
Being in my skin is suffocating at times.
I will never forget how your sins tasted inside my mouth.
Was it that easy? Forgetting me?
"I write to calm the storm within, to help ease the constant pain I'm in.  I write in the hopes of finding peace I scarcely deserve."
You are all the magic I need in my life.
What a disgusting time to be alive.
"God, your voice is intoxicating."
"For fuck's sake, Twitter, get your shit together."
"Once I lose respect for someone, it's over. They're out of my life for good. There's no going back. It's just the way I'm."
I’ll always have your back even if the rest of the world abandons you.
"Congratulations, you guys have finally managed to break Twitter."
"You're all over my thoughts today, and I'm a complete mess."
Your eyes have me all fucked up for good.
"Come, kiss me again one final time; I need to savor it for the rest of my life."
Your fingertips on my back have the power to simultaneously make and break me.
"If you're not spilling your heart in these pages, what the fuck are you even doing?"
As long as you still think about me sometimes. I can live with that. I think.
"I thought the song was over, why are we still dancing?"
Hearts just have a way of breaking.
"Crushing on you so hard, can you feel me?"
"oh, fuck."
In the mood to spoil the fuck out of someone.
[pulls you closer] bloom with me.
You took a piece of me when you left. I may live but it will never be the same again.
You weren't meant to fade away. I'll carry you inside me for as long as I live.
It's going to take a lot more than the end of the world to stop me from loving you.
Bored as fuck and craving a very specific kind of mindfuck.
"Some days fire, some days ice."
We already share the same blue sky. Someday I'd like to share the air you breathe.
Counting the heartbeats until we reunite.
I like how sometimes our thoughts collide out of nowhere.
"I can see right through you. Naturally, I'm not interested."
Teach me how to dream again.
It's time we took a stroll down the memory lane. Together. For old time's sake.
"Shut up, crazy bitch inside my head, SHUT UP."
Pin you down and fuck you crazy?
"For fuck's sake, make me shut up. Anybody?"
I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss you anymore.
"You bring the lubes I'll bring the handcuffs, there's fun to be had."
The need to slide your panties aside and have my way with you until we both can't breathe anymore.
Things get easier once you lose your will to live.
"I'd rather not make you beg. But it's not beneath me, either."
I know I'm moody af. Go fuck yourself.
The curious case of the last cucumber on the aisle.
he came he loved he lost  #sixwordstory
I remember your soul like yesterday.
All the pretty ways you work my heart.
"Come, let's be reckless together."
I can't wait for you to break my heart again.
Only her wild can tame the restlessness inside me.
The beauty lies in everything you do.
It's so loud everywhere. I'd like a quiet place inside your thoughts to rest.
"So cold, yet so warm."
"For you, I'd wreck my already broken heart."
Some what could have beens are heavier than the what ifs.
Shut up and let me get lost in those sexy eyes of yours.
Not much has changed for me. Life was meaningless without you even before the pandemic.
Blood type: Her.
Heartbroken.  - Since 1885.
"Talking to yourself can improve your mood, enhance your intelligence, and boost your self-esteem.  Talking to me, on the other hand, will make you drop your panties."
"No matter what you do, don't even think about eating a fucking bat."
Sometimes the simplest of words are the hardest to forget.
"Seriously, what in the actual fuck?"
I would kill for a few words with you right now.
What. The. Fuck.
Blow my mind first. The other kind can wait.
"I dreamt about you, about us and for a moment there I felt peace."
"Let's take a walk, you and I. It has been long overdue."
"Beware, she's wild at heart."
Driving fast. Being chased. The thrill.
"Death by excessive sex? Yep, I'll take that."
Woke up with you on my mind and a void in my chest. Again.
Her: I love you. Me: Pretty sure you can do better.
Show me what it's like inside your heart.
"Hang tough people, the worse is yet to come."
"Let's forget about the world, turn on the music and dance till out souls oscillate in perfect harmony."
I thought of it first. Maybe come up with your own thoughts? @maybechaos
Where do you put all the love you carry inside of you when it's not needed anymore?
Here's a little advice.  Don't fall in love in the middle of a pandemic.
I liked it better when you were in my life.
"The world is changing, fuck playing by the rules."
Help will always be offered to those who deserve it the least.
"If you listen carefully enough, their silence speaks volumes."
Twitter seems quiet today. Where the fuck is everyone?
I was procrastinating and fucking things up long before the pandemic started.  What's your excuse?
"We are tough motherfuckers, we will survive this."
She's the kind of girl you never really recover from.
"Treading through life, one broken piece at a time."
I'd call you a scumbag but I like my used condoms better.
"When this is over, I'm going back to missing you as always. Nothing changes that."
Bras around the world are partying hard.
Now would be a good time to tell me all those things you have wanted to say for years.
"If you missed them, would you tell them?"
"In between my thoughts, there's silence and you."
"I held her, and it felt like home."
Can we skip the small talk and get to the dirty talk already?
Let me watch as you touch my favorite thing.
I'll steal your girl and make her mine. Don't fuck with me.
There’s hope left in my heart yet.
Only your gentle voice can calm the storm brewing deep inside my heart.
I wonder if you can feel the weight of all those words I didn't say.
Ask. Don't assume. Sympathize. Don't criticize. Keep an open mind. Don't judge.  Spread kindness if you can. We can all use some today.
Are you guys sick of doing nothing yet?
"And practice what you preach, for fuck's sake."
Find a heart worthy of your love and hold onto it for dear life.
"With some, your soul connects effortlessly. Keep them close."
I'd rather be in your mouth than anywhere else.
"Hear me out, a surgical mask, but for your heart, so it stops catching feelings."
Coffee is love.
My thoughts keep turning back to you again and again.
"I managed to watch a couple of Money Heist episodes in between reviewing contracts for work. Who would have thought?  By the way, the show is okayish. Plenty over-rated in my humble opinion."
Choke me to death gently with your pretty little hands and I won't say a word.
Forever is a scam. I want you right here right now.
I'll always be unapologetic for my feelings towards you. I honestly don't give a fuck.
I miss you and have no idea what to fucking do about it.
I need to think this through.
The moon will show herself when she's ready.
I wonder if you and I are destined to do this dance forever.
She's more dreams than a girl.
"Make her feel appreciated, you piece of shit."
You were mine the day I first set eyes on you.
I dream about being with you a lot.
Some nights I can feel you in my veins.
Hope and despair. Story of my life.
She's my reason to smile today and every day.
"When I see you hurting, I'll love you even harder."
I'd hug you if I could.
The fact that you are safe is enough to get me through this ordeal.
Kiss her until her demons surrender.
"How many subtweets before they notice and respond. I mean, is there a rule or something?"
Love or death?
"A double cheeseburger so perfect, you stop craving sex for a while."
Get you a girl who catches you watching porn and helps you get off.
I spend hours staring at words you didn't say.
I miss talking to you about everything and nothing.
"Every time I see you smile, I fall in love all over again."
"Sad song suggestions, please."
My heart is a restless little bitch.
The sex must go on with or without you.  -socially distant sext.
Sometimes all it takes is a solitary word to bring back a thousand different memories.
Fucking yes!!!
Look me in the eyes as I break.
Behave like a fucking adult if you want to be treated like one.
Stop ignoring me or I'll come put a baby in you.
One moment of weakness is all it takes.
You guys should be careful who you hug in this day and age. Just saying.
"If I knelt before you, would you let me worship you?"
"My heart is restless today. Come, calm it down as only you can."
Stupid fucking typos and her useless piece of shit sister autocorrect. 🤷‍♂️
Legs like those should be resting on my shoulders right about now.
Can I guy get a fucking hug around here or what?
Don't get me wrong I'm horny all the time. Just not for you.
It was the end of the world for me when I lost you.
No one:  2020: Bazinga!
"So when you RT before you favorite one of my tweets, I can tell that you're a left-hander like me."
Forgive me father for I haven't sinned in a long fucking time.
Nope
"I loved her, and I broke her heart despite that."
Some unsaid words have the potential to suck the life out of you.
Drunk texting and then not responding when you're sober?  Not cool.
Shut the fuck up and let me kiss you.
"Life is short. Love hard, bang harder."
"If you'll not have me, I'll keep loving you from afar."
Let us all scream the word fuck at the top of our lungs together and maybe it will all be okay.
I miss kissing your goddamn neck.
Do you ever stop missing them?
If only I could show you the mayhem inside my head.
How much further can one zoom in before it starts getting creepy?
Let's make each other cum until this shitshow is over and chill?
Be the hero you need. Practice self-care.
The darkness inside me is my one true friend.
"Wear her pussy down, not her heart."
"Hi people, a request:  The 5 of you who enjoy reading me on and off, and the rest of you who scroll by, I'd like y'all to guess my age.  Also, post your answers if you want. Or don't. 🤷‍♂️(please do)  And don't fucking say if you already know."
I feel you in my bones.
Fuck nudes. Let me show you my scars.
Tweet testing: 1... 2... 3...  [i hit the fucking limit again]
Knowing you exist helps me breathe.
The shitshow goes on.
"Ever feel so sad, you fantasize about ripping out your own fucking heart, crushing it into a million little pieces and sprinkling them inside the ruins of a long-forgotten graveyard just so the damn thing stops feeling so much.  No? Just me then."
Feeling too much is good until it's not.
"While it hurts to be forgotten, it hurts more to be remembered unkindly."
I think about your boobies a lot.
Serenity is everywhere she is.
Maybe now we will be kinder to each other when we finally get to socialize again.
I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet.
Fuck her like 2020 is fucking us all or don't bother.
Can this fucking nightmare end already?
"Damn, you are beautiful."
"You know who you are, and you are pretty fucking essential to me. Bye."
"Well, fuck off then."
Finally. At long last. It's done. The unthinkable has happened. I'm officially tired of sleeping.  Who'd have thunk.
I'll never give up on you even if I gave up on me.
"If I don't wake up tomorrow, please know that you were the last thing on my mind."
"This too shall pass.  Wonder if we are getting out of it alive, though."
"Pandemic or not, dumbfucks will be dumbfucks."
So forever then?
There's an element of sadness to almost everything these days. I'm starting to kind of feel at home.
"This will probably earn me a few unfollowers, but I think I need to say this. I'm not here to find love. I don't care about that. At all.  I'm here to read and be read. Tweeting merely acts as an outlet for my thoughts, most of which are random bs anyway. Nothing more.  kthxbye."
Bitches &lt;-- gender neutral.
"It's Tuesday, with most of you horny bitches at home today?  This should be interesting."
"Ruin me; I don't care. The world is ending, anyway."
There's not much I wouldn't do for an opportunity to pin you down and have my way with you.
You are only everything that matters.
Retweeting y'all from six feet away.
Stop tweeting for fuck's sake. You're supposed to be working from home.
You will know if you are essential to them.
I still get incredibly flustered every time you cross my mind.
Bone deep feelings.
I'm lost. Help me make sense of it all like only you can.
Woke up full of rage again.
"If she doesn't set your soul on fire frequently, she's probably not the one."
Don’t think you won’t bleed when you try and cut me.
I lost my will to live way before the fucking pandemic hit the streets.
Shout out to that one girl that holds the key to my heart.
Lost in a moment worth a thousand lifetimes.
There's not much I wouldn't do for an opportunity to kiss you again.
Might fuck around and become a reply guy for a change.
There comes a moment in life when you realize that forever is a long fucking word and almost never real.
Your hair in my fist as you go deep on me.
"Calm down, we are all fucked."
Woke up scouring for that one person who could make me whole again.
"Come, kiss me. Make me forget everything for a little bit."
"Look inside your soul, go deeper, and you'll find me, maybe."
"The world is ending, do you still love me?"
"If you're seeing this, please report and block @Cyouhurtme for harassing one of the nicest people I know here. The motherfucker is a sick-minded tweet thief. Thanks."
My demons would love to meet your demons over coffee sometime.
Not every lap merits your head. Choose wisely.
I have been spending 18 hours a day on twitter ever since I'm in lockdown. I need help.
I can fuck you without touching.  - me flirting.
"If I drunk texted her during quarantine, it doesn't count, right? Right??"
"Dear Internet Providers,  You have one job.  Regards, Socially distant customers worldwide."
A soul so beautiful it hurts.
"Time like this, you can't not miss me just a little bit."
I feel more than I'm comfortable with.
"If I have feelings for you, I have feelings for you. It's not changing anytime soon. I'm stubborn like that."
"Stop changing your avi every fifteen seconds, bitch. Some of us are trying to masturbate here."
This too shall pass.  - gestures at the shitshow around us.
Darkness so profound you start attracting demons from miles away.
I have been loved before. I know what it’s like.
"If only you could see the colors I see, when I imagine you, you would understand."
Tell me about the days you had to live through after we grew apart.
I can't tell you what my type is but you're not it. Sit down.
"Pandemic or not, I'll keep writing about you."
Fuck having to live without you.
"About 95% of the population is stuck at home being useless today. Crime rates have dropped. Discrimination, violence, hate crimes have all subsided. The virus has managed to kill fewer people than people do by direct or indirect means.  What a pathetic bunch of losers we all are."
She was the kind of girl that could bring miracles to life and mend hearts that were irreparably broken.
Remember when we could go out at will? Good times.
"missed a comma there, didn’t I 🤷‍♂️"
"I am nothing, if not your favorite thought in the heart of a quiet night."
"I keep dreaming of you, about you about us.  I need distractions if I'm to survive this."
And can't fall out of it. No matter how hard we try.
Your chaos is like art to my eyes and music to my ears.
Treasure her scars or someone else will.
"If you ever need me, I'm just a few words away."
Losing weight? In this economy?
Sunday afternoons are for reminiscing over the past.
You look like someone I'd love to be isolated with.
Let's leave all this chaos behind and go exist in a song together.
A gentle feathery touch somewhere along the way changed my life for good.
I can feel my heart race even before your words reach me.
I can vividly remember every moment of all the lifetimes we spent together.
"Since everything else has been canceled, can we also cancel hating on each other for a few weeks?"
Is that one chick still posting pictures of her butt? We are in the middle of a pandemic for fuck's sake.
I'll never give up on you.
"Only if our ancestors hadn't so selfishly decided to crawl out of the water, we would still be socializing."
Saturday? What Saturday?
"Fuck her, or I will."
Ruin me for everyone else and then leave me the fuck alone.
I shaved my balls for this?  *looks at everyone's tweet about dms not working.
Fucking what ifs.
All it took was a hug from her for him to forget every pain he had ever felt.
I see nothing else when you are within sight.
"Every now and then, a word from her reaches me, and I can breathe easier."
You must know her to understand me.
Be with them while you still can.
You are mine to love. Nothing will ever change that.
"For you, I would."
"I'm just a guy, standing in the middle of nowhere, hoping you'd find someone who loves you as much as I did."
Did you smile today?
"Don't mean to scare y'all but the cases, and therefore, the deaths associated with them are showing an accelerated increase.  In the last 24 hours alone, 3,000+ more have reportedly died."
"These are troubled times, let me fuck the anxiety out of you."
It appears that nothing has changed for some of you jackasses. You're still spending a lot of time alone doing nothing but troll people online.
Reverse cowgirl because I like to grab her tits for momentum.
My coffee would like to taste your lips.
I haven't shaved in days. I look one sad son of a bitch. Not that I'm not one anyway.
Don't think I don't see the restlessness in your words.
"I pay attention. Some days, it is my biggest flaw."
"These are desperate times, kiss the fuck out of me."
I think about your head resting on my shoulder and my arm around you a lot.
I like to imagine I still inhabit a tiny spot inside your heart.
"You stay in my thoughts, always."
My imagination ends where your charm begins.
There's so much of you in everything I write. I think the words have started to feel envious.
"Ladies, for the last time, I like dudes. Back off."
What we had when we had it was magic. The rest is just bullshit.
What's a guy gotta do to see some girl on girl action around here?
"One out of five infected patients has died. That's a 20% fatality rate. Be safe and stay inside, y'all."
She's like an open book to my observant eyes.
Swallowing mouthful of regrets.
Woke up with a sweet aftertaste in my mouth. I might have dreamt about you.
Quote tweeters are covid-19 of coronaviruses.
I need to hear your voice if I'm to survive this.
I want to go where your heart goes to rest.
We hope until we don't.
I dropped my pinned tweet so I could pin you instead.
Feelings? In this economy?
"The last time I fell, I bled too much. I'm not falling in love again."
"Yes, it's broken. No, it's not incapable of loving."
Her love is the only thing that can save him.
Tested positive for being unlovable.
"Burning for a taste of you. Come, quench my thirst."
I have been hoarding memories long before it became uncool to hoard things.
"Stop bragging about your sex drive because when I'm done with you, you won't be walking straight for weeks."
"If I were a junkie, you'd be my drug of choice."
I just can't get enough of you.
Life is too short to love you adequately. I could spend lifetimes adoring you and still feel starved.
"If you could have them that easy, would they still be worth having?"
I need to go out for a bit and interact with potentially infected people. So long friends. See you on the other side.
Insatiability leaking through the cracks.
How does it feel to be the essence of every word I write?
"A heart made of steel, and she could pierce it with just a look."
Fuck six feet. I can't stand six inches between us.
Can I at least love you in my dreams?
"Total deaths crossed 20k worldwide today.  Recent deaths: 1,600+ (within last 24 hours)  Shit is getting ugly. Stay indoors and stay woke."
Let's love in fall. Falling in love is way too mainstream.
"I swear to fuck I could have accomplished so much in all this spare time if it weren't for twitter.  Nah, who am I kidding."
Be wary of the short girls with fierce eyes. They're known to steal hearts.
My stupid fucking heart keeps crawling back to you.
:-(
"Sometimes a muse, always a poet."
"Tested positive for being horny, 24/7."
"Excuse me, but you are oozing sexiness all over my timeline. Could you be more careful, please? Some of us are already starving for sex."
Staying indoors and wanking at each other from six feet away is the new black.
I wonder what helped you decide you were better off without me.
"It's raining, and I wonder if the clouds miss you as much as I do."
it's raining and i miss you.
Nobody cares. Remember that.
How long before we can start expressing our feelings without a care for consequences?
My coffee wants to taste your coffee.
I still haven't found anyone who understands me the way you did.
Tested positive for being wrongly judged again and not giving a fuck about it.
Excuse me while I go adore you from a distance.
"Considering changing my name to ""You"" so everytime I like your stuff it reads, ""you liked your tweet..."""
"The world is burning, and all I can think about is you."
"Condemned to love you forever, and I'm not even remorseful."
Today needs more kissing and rage fucking.
"hey, girl. what those eyes do?"
"Fuck her like you have been quarantined for a fortnight, and she's the first thing with a hole in sight."
"I sympathize with all the extroverts who are stuck at home with their Netflix, porn stash and vibrators trying to socially distance themselves.  Who am I kidding. I don't give a shit."
Didn't even need a global pandemic for me and her to behave as socially distant lovers.
Work from home? I could get used to it.
"i just want to hear you say ""i love you too"" once again and then i can die in peace."
I'd break the curfew just to be with you.
You can tell a lot about a couple by the way her body responds to his touch.
"Every time you say fuck, I get turned on a little."
You wanna know what it's like inside my head?  Look at the world around you.
"If we are fucking, I'm touching your hair."
We could have grown old together.
"A love so pure, it lasts longer than a lifetime."
Wanna be my inspiration for sultry poetry?
"Sit back, spread your legs and relax. Let my thing worship your thing."
It's okay to break sometimes.
"Learn to live with yourself, or no one else will either."
Are you done ruining me for everyone else yet?
"If there ever was a time for Netflix and chill, this is it. Don't fucking leave your homes unless you're dying. Or want to."
I'm so fucking tired of not having you by my side.
"Eyes so pretty, my heart hurts."
How many times can you reread a conversation with someone before the words jump out and ask you to get a life.
"Pandemic or no pandemic, I'll always love you."
"If you looked past her eyes, you would see me."
"Fuck the world, fuck this shitshow, fuck everything. I just want to lay in your lap for eternity."
I'll never be able to forgive myself even if you did.
"If you have to go outside, try not to die."
"If you suck my balls right, I might do that thing you like."
Are you done obsessing over me yet?
I miss the slut in you.
"For the record, my soul still craves yours."
Trying to forget like it's even conceivable.
"Okay, this is the maximum reach one of my tweets has ever fetched.  Show me yours.  Or don't.  Whatever."
I don't care for much today. Just one of those days...
Nothing turns me on quite like honesty and integrity.
She's the only one worthy of being in my story.
"When you finally manage to get close to me, go for the jugular."
How the tables turn.
"I know we are in the middle of a pandemic, but I feel good today. You can obviously kiss my ass if you have a problem with that."
"If it's end of the world, I'd like to make a few confessions."
Closure is something I'll never get or deserve.
"Fuck, some of you are good for my soul. Can I bring you home?"
I hear my heart race even before your words reach my ears.
Broken hearts attract.
"Relax, it's not going to be alright."
There's light ahead. I just hope we don't go blind before we reach there.
A kiss that helps you forget. That.
We are all going to die eventually. What is with all the unrest?
My phone's battery drains faster than your husband. Stupid fucking phone.
"My heart has been in quarantine long before your mother popped you out, I think I'll be okay."
You're not supposed to wear clothes under quarantine. Everybody knows that.
My heart has been in quarantine since 2012.  -me flirting.
I'm replying to every stupid comment on my tweets today. Come at me bitches.
She was thinking of me as you slid inside her.  We are not the same.
I'll love you in silence when the words run out.
"Some days, they will bleed nothing but darkness, love them anyway."
"If you find yourself in my words, I must have loved you once."
I'll make you laugh so hard you'll cum a little.
Jesus holy mother of fucking christ... Her eyes!
Kiss her before the world ends.
I'm done pretending that I could care about anyone else the way I cared about her.
Morning hard-on &gt;&gt;&gt; Any other hard-on.
Selflessness is such a turn on.
"Yes, this is my personal blog and I'll say whatever the hell I want. Fuck off to way over there and stay."
What do you tell your heart when it asks about me?
"Play nice, or I'll have to fuck the brat right out of you."
Just a friendly reminder to keep using protection during all the quarantine sex you won't be having.
Sometimes I wonder what you and I had if it was even real.
Can't even remember the last time I truly felt alive.
"Fasten your seatbelts, ladies &amp; gentlemen. Bunch of quarantined tweets coming up."
"In my head, time works differently. It's before her, with her and after her."
Forget you? I wish.
I had such fucking hopes for the two of us.
Where the fuck are all the quarantitties that were promised? QuaranTwitter is no fun.
"My heart is not broken, it's merely out of use."
Got lost thinking of you. Again.
"no one:  2020: well, fuck you all."
Hold me tight and feel me fall apart.
"It's tough, you know, to find the right kind of crazy amongst all kinds of crazies of the world.  So if you do find them, fucking keep them."
"When you try too hard to avoid feeling anything, you end up feeling everything."
Have you given up on me yet?
Happy memories are what's eventually going to kill me.
"You may not deserve much else, but you deserve to be loved."
I refuse to give up on me and you.
"Days feel strange, nights stranger, without you."
"CoV*d-19 is the new c*nt. Damn you, twitter police!"
Just leave me alone with your eyes for a while.
They asked me about love. I penned your name. On my wrist. In blood.
"Pricky boy here first copied my twitter name, then stole my tweets and then blocked me when I tried to explain how twitter works, nicely.  What a jerk."
Now where did you find this? @sip_of_bourbon
"Ladies, who's/what's more hurtful?"
"It's fine, I'm fine."
"If you're thirsty and you know it, shut your trap."
"Just so you know, I used to smile way more during the days we were together than I do now.  Not that it matters..."
It's like this all year inside my heart.
I simply refuse to share you with anyone. Period.
Adore me all you want but from way over there.  The same applies to hating on me as well.
"Go talk to them, damnit. They might not even be here tomorrow."
Can't we adopt social distancing as a permanent feature in our lives?  - Asking for 90% of the twitter population.
You say social distancing like it's a bad thing.
Be kind. Be considerate. The world needs it the most today.
She's worth the trouble. Don't ever doubt that.
"In light of the recent pandemic, I have decided to cancel all human contact until further notice.   Fingerbanging her continue to remain an exception, of course."
"Shit's getting ugly, bitches. Take cover, for fuck's sake."
Tested positive for being in love and not being able to do anything about it.
"For the record, I'd choose you again in a heartbeat."
"Fuck, existing is tiresome without you."
Why would you plant the seeds if you planned on trampling upon the flowers later.
"It's all falling apart, kiss me."
Don't forget to be kind to yourself today.
"Meet me on the other side of midnight, and I'll show you how it's done."
I'd like to fall in dreams with you.
Don't make someone question their worth just because you don't see yours.
"[Pulls her closer, takes a deep breath, inhales her essence...]  And now I can die in peace."
Nothing with you is better than everything without you.
I'll never apologize for loving you.
Woke up drenched in your thoughts again.
Kiss me like there's a sanitizer in my mouth and your tongue has been exposed.
But do they know you like I do?
"Maybe, I don't want it to make sense you don't know."
"Some memories are like books, except they can't be shredded or burned, no matter how hard you try."
There's not much I wouldn't do for an opportunity to kiss you again.
I know a survivor when I see one.
"Meet me halfway through rock bottom, and maybe, I'll rock your bottom there."
"Alright, bitches. Who wants to touch my face? Come forth, let's get this done with."
"Stab me harder. .. No, seriously."
"When the going gets tough, the assholes get scarce."
How about I put a baby inside you right now and we can call it Covid-20?
"[lits a cigarette] So, whatcha doing this quarantine season?"
Hi. Can I dip myself in your sauces?
Can I come inside?
Don't ask me to stop missing you.
Greet me wearing nothing but 'fuck me' in your eyes.
Soaking in her sea of desire feels heavenly.
"Forever is the heaviest of all words, use it wisely."
A smile that could brighten the darkest of days.
"Wherever she touched me, she left imprints that will never fade."
The only whisper that matters is yours in a world full of screams.
Let's go to a secluded place inside a library and let books be the witnesses of our love.
"Only one person can walk all over my heart and go unscathed, and it's not you, so fuck off."
I miss how our minds used to fuck.
The finest of hearts feel too much.
"More filthy kisses, please."
"If it costs you your self-belief, it's not worth it.  And, if it costs you your ability to believe in people, it's not worth it either."
"If you ever see her, let her know that I'm a better person because of her, and for that, I'll always be grateful to her."
I'll be sweeping you off your feet now and kissing the hell out of you if you don't mind.
"Me, you and covid-19."
Let's go for a walk and never come back.
"For what it's worth, my heart still dances a little every time our song is on."
I NEED A FUCKING SMOKE. ANYONE?
When has love ever made sense anyway?
Wearing nothing but darkness in the hopes of enticing your glow.
"Taking down the walls around me, one blow at a time."
"Are you trying to fuck me, because if you are. Don't."
This thing in my chest beats for you and you alone.
"Heartbreaks don't scare me anymore, I have learned to grow with each one of them."
"Here, hold my hand for a moment or a thousand lifetimes."
There are days when breathing becomes a struggle without you.
"Hi, you seem like a person with a thing for broken ones. Can I keep you?"
"I'll edge you so hard, you'll beg me to fuck you to death. Don't fuck with me."
Wearing nothing but darkness.
Lost count of how many times I have whispered your name in the dark and found my light.
"Nips so hard, you use them to scale your teeth."
"I might as well post all my drafts, we are all dying, anyway."
"Bludgeon the life out of me, so we know it's real."
"i'm more dead than alive, to be honest."
"I'm way past your event horizon, there's no escaping now."
"Eternal bliss in itself is over-rated, longing for it is what makes it worthwhile."
"Hey, my demons called. They'd like to meet your demons."
Incite violence inside my chest with your words.
Can I bribe you into going in quarantine with me?
Can I bribe them into putting me in quarantine?
"In light of the recent pandemic, can my feelings work from home too?"
"Show me the parts that hurt the most, I'd like to deal with them first."
I wonder who haunts the night for it seems as sleep-deprived as I'm.
"When the going gets tough, motherfuckers get tougher."
I keep falling for all this magic in your eyes.
"We may not be together anymore, but I'm nothing if not yours."
I just want to fuck you and your demons senseless.
It's almost as if I unlearnt how to love after she left.
I love you's and other unsaid words...
"Fuck sanitizers and toilet rolls, give me your best hug."
Eyes wide open and legs wide spread.
The rest of me hates you for my heart not being able to let go of you.
"Nudes so bad, you wish you had some coronavirus to wash your eyes with."
I'm empathic most of the times but I hardly ever give a fuck.  Know the difference.
"Every piece matters, even the broken ones. Especially the broken ones."
"I get to like one tweet every five minutes, so if it's yours, you're pretty special."
"I'd tap that.  - coronavirus, probably."
I could spend a lifetime or two doing nothing but watching you.
"I'd like to unravel so much more than your thoughts, baby girl."
"I find myself in your words, and that's the most precious gift you have ever given me."
"It's a privilege to be trusted, handle it with care.  It takes a special kind of asshole to break someone's trust when they open up to them."
"No, you think I care."
My heart could spot her heart in a crowd filled with fuckload of hearts in a heartbeat.
Can you help me feel nothing?
"People often ask me to try and move on. Little do they know that if I ever managed to let go of her, there would be nothing left to talk about."
"Come, let's disappear for a while or forever."
"Perhaps, you too would have fallen in love with yourself, had you seen yourself through my eyes."
"If I'm not grabbing your ass when I'm kissing you, I'm not feeling it, you feel me?"
I wonder if you miss our late night conversations as much as I do.
"What? You mean, I can't even touch my fucking face. Fuck off, I don't want to live like that."
"You say you love them, but can you hand them your phone without freaking the fuck out?"
Walk the talk or walk the fuck away.
"In a galaxy far, far away, we would still be fucking."
"Letting my mind wander to places my hands can't reach, and by places, I mean various strategic locations on her body."
"Take my heart with you when you leave. I wouldn't know what to do with it without you, anyway."
"Here, take my heart and have your way with it."
"#FF you guys, she loves anal. Follow her."
"Life is short, love her harder."
"My likes won't stick, pretty much like they don't in rl."
"If I ever told you, I'll be there for you when you need me, trust me, I'll be there. I don't fuck around with these things."
Can I trust you with my ache?
"If I click on your   link in order to retweet your stuff, know that I really must care about you."
This is quote tweeting.
"Stop quote tweeting my shit, crazy motherfucker."
Everything that is broken can't be fixed. Stop trying.
Every little piece of soul that you left with me is my most prized possession.
"When you hold them for the very first time, and you know it in your heart that you are meant for each other. That."
A message that makes you weak in the knee.
I want to hear you say my name as I explore the universe inside you.
I want to hear you whisper my name as I slide deep inside you.
All her colors were irresistible to his eyes.
Drunk on her eyes.
"Embrace me, I want to spend the rest of my days in your arms."
"My heart chose you, deal with it."
"Woke up, choking on your name again."
💙💙💙💙💙  (this is obviously a subtweet)
i wanna stop feeling so much.
Let the dust settle and we shall see who is who.
"I'd spank you if you are mean to me. Heck, I'd spank you anyway."
"God damn, you're beautiful."
"She was a pretty little mess with eyes full of complicated thoughts, and I loved reading her."
"Hi, have we loved before?"
"Trying to hurt me won't work, trust me I tried. I feel nothing, I'm immune to pain."
Show me where it hurts and I'll kiss the pain away.
"If you absolutely must bite me, at least be sure to leave the mark."
Your name would manifest beautifully next to mine.
There's so much to be done yet. Let's waste the day away.
"If I ever accidentally ran into you again, I think I'm gonna melt on the spot."
"A thing of splendid, mouth-watering beauty."
We can't be together if my scars terrify you.
Is it cheating if you tweak some of your old crappy tweets to make them crappier?
Be my slut?
I reside in the depths of darkness. Those who merely swim in the shallow murkiness shall never find me.
"Kiss me, it's been a while."
"Something to wash away the memories, please."
Only love can heal what love bruises.
Kiss me until I'm devoid of all thoughts.
"I'm yours if you'd have me. Heck, I'm yours anyway."
Perhaps it will make sense when you too are left with nothing to lose.
We are all idiots when it comes to that special someone.
Stay still for I'm about to hug you with my thoughts.
Yearning for a taste of your deepest desires.
"To my friends from India and across the world celebrating Holi, Happy Holi!"
Shut up and love me.
"What doesn’t kill you, makes you shrug a lot."
My dick appears to have a dick of its own.
"Let it hurt, then let it go."
My heart was forged to adore you from a distance.
"Get this, if you tweet for a bit without pausing, Twitter begins acting like a jealous bitch and starts limiting your reach."
"Magic boner in my pants, who's the filthiest in the land?"
"Darkness, so much darkness, inside and around me."
Forsaken dreams and the vicious circle of life.
Dry hump you until we both can't take it any longer and chill?
"Here, take my heart and crush it."
"I don't know who needs to hear this, but,  No. Fuck, no. Absofuckinglutely, no."
We will make strangers out of us yet.
"I get it, babe. If I were you, I'd want to hate-fuck me too."
"Remember when we used to be so full of hope? Yeah, me neither."
drop*
"For those of you who are wondering, I just got done with a pretty hectic two week work-related project, which pretty much sucked the last drops of blood from my brains. So all those crappy tweets are my way of releasing stress and saying fuck you to unending hours of mindfuck."
"I can write and write and write, but what's even the point if my words don't reach where they're intended for."
"Drain his dick, not his patience. Or credit limit, for that matter."
"I write for me. I wish I cared about how my words are perceived, but I don't."
I'm sorry you're upset I didn't give you the attention you thought you deserved.  Did you try sucking my dick about it?
I wonder if the world recognizes the weight of dead feelings in my eyes.
"Well, fuck me."
"Geez, I have had seven guys in a row follow me. Am I giving the wrong vibe here, people?"
"A sanitizer for my thoughts, please. For when I’m done thinking about you."
I have got something that can sanitize your hands plus a whole lot of other things if you know what I mean.
Tell them when you write them out of your life. Don't keep them waiting. They deserve at least that.
Think you could forgive me if I spent the lifetime writing about you?
So many thoughts get stuck in my throat whenever I catch a glimpse of you.
"Tread softly, for I'm in a melancholic mood."
Ever felt the sand slip through your fingers underwater? Pretty much how I felt my life escape the day she left.
"Remember when I said, I'd die without you.  I think I lied.  I'm alive. Barely, but alive."
"I wanted to tell her how fucking special she was. Instead, I watched with teary eyes as she left."
Fuck everything. It's YOU or nothing.
"Love and indifference fought valiantly inside my head for years. Love won, hence I write."
I could survive on her alone for a thousand years and more.
Be like love in the world full of heartlessness and indifference.
"I'll pinch the one while I bite the other, I don't give a fuck."
Remember when I could affect your moods with just a few words or the lack thereof.
"Let me reside peacefully in the ""what was""."
My tongue and your cleavage should be converging right about now.
"Make me wanna lose control once again, baby."
"I get it, babe. If I were you, I'd hate me too. Oops, I already do."
Fuck twitter and its restrictions.
One last hug before we part ways?
"She's a bit of a mess, yet so insanely beautiful, kinda like the moon."
Sometimes it feels like my heart would have stopped beating a long time ago if it weren't for you.
Lunch would taste so much better if I were eating you instead.
"fuck, fuck, fuck fuck, fuck, fuck  #sixwordstory"
Unconditional love is hard to find and harder to reciprocate.
"I'm perfectly capable of wiping that smirk of your smug face, motherfucker. Don't test me."
sext: fuck me up with your eyes.
"Remember when you were a smaller account and used to like all my stuff? Yeah, me neither."
Who am I? Just someone you used to know.
"Be careful who you open up to, not everyone deserves a glimpse inside your soul."
"Geez, don't you ever shut up?"
"Just a little more cleavage, baby girl. I'm almost there."
"When I die, I want to be looking in your eyes because if heavens exist, your eyes are it."
I can feel your heart beating inside of me.
Everything in moderation except your ass. I'm gonna keep grabbing that booty if you're mine.
I wonder if we are both made from the stardust of the same star.
"With her, good behavior is a given. Bad behavior, on the other hand, is something you'll have to earn."
Why use words when we could just let our eyes do the talking.
"I once told her to calm down, back when we met. .. She still hasn't calmed down."
"If your best is not good enough, fuck them."
He wears the blues like he owns the goddamn color.
I can get you exasperated at first sight. *wink*
"When life gives you lemons, keep them. Might come in handy someday."
"Hope you collapse under the weight of all this hypocrisy you carry around, you pretentious fuck."
There was a time things made sense inside my head.
This sadness inside me needs to be loved too.
"Fuck, you're killing me here."
Misery doesn't really like company and neither do I.
"If it's absolutely essential that you judge, wait till you hear both sides of it."
"If my retweets don't give you multiple orgasms, is there even a point?"
"Repel me harder, motherfucker."
"If I love you, it's for life. There's no getting over it.  Chances are I'll never love you, though."
Painfully thick can be a good thing too if you think about it.
Fresh blood gushing from old wounds.
I'm gonna fuck your feed up with my bs tweets and there's nothing you can do about it.
I wonder what it's like for people who don't have anyone to ache for.
"Boner so overwhelming, it gets painful keeping it inside."
The lost art of masterful fingering.
"When I grow up, I wanna be the undies that stick between your butt cheeks."
Move my heart or move the fuck away.
Staring at the void around me as I slowly but surely edge closer to a bottomless pit.
"If I have to share you with someone, you were never mine to begin with."
"If it's true, it will never fade. You're scarred for life."
"Last time I gave a fuck, it came back to bite me in the ass. That's it, no more fucks will be given by yours truly."
Let's skip to the part where we stop talking and I fuck your brains out.
Not to brag but my reply girls can beat the shit out of your reply guys.
Having a good heart is likelier to get you fucked over in this day and age.
"Go on then, these lips ain't gonna bite themselves."
One name keeps playing in my head like a broken record.
"I'm afraid if I said your name out loud, it won't sound familiar anymore."
"In her chaos, he found his peace."
"""If you work a standard 40 hours a week all year, making $2,000 per hour, and do that every year for 2,000 years (that's working regular full-time hours since Jesus) you would have made 8 billion dollars.  You wouldn’t even be in the top 100 richest people on the planet."""
When their silence speaks louder than the ear-piercing noise from literally everywhere else.
Fate has this uncanny ability to come up with creative ways of having its way with my life.
I'm dead inside and I'd like to keep it that way.
"Been there, done that, buried it."
"Find a girl worthy of all your fucks, literal and otherwise."
my hurt looks at your hurt and nods understandingly.
His mind often wanders far and wide to the extremes of the universe only to return to the asylum that once was her heart.
I wonder if you long to hear the words I have been dying to say.
She's always going to be my favorite fragrance.
"I came, I didn't like what I saw, I left."
"Guys, please accept my sincere apologies for all the crazy ass replies you get on tweets that I RT. I'll keep retweeting you, though."
I dream of my fingers making you dripping wet.
"Mostly, I just wish people would leave me the fuck alone."
"For the record, I still ache for you."
"I feel lost. Come, fuck me back to my senses."
I wonder if it will ever make sense.
I'm the moodiest person I know.
I wonder if your heart misses the way it used to dance with mine.
Who will you think of when you are down to your last breath? Keep them close.
"Hearts are meant to be broken, get the fuck over it."
"I'm just a cold, soulless existence searching for the warmth of my lost soul."
"People change and people leave, that's what they do. Don't be like people."
Falling in love with the way your body responds to my touch.
I like the way your words complement my thoughts.
But can you hear them when they go silent?
No one can begin to understand your pain quite like you do. All they really do is pretend.
What a fucking day! I woke up for this?
"Somewhere along the way, I got better at suppressing my feelings so much so that I let her go despite knowing that I'd ache for her until the day I die."
"My head in your lap, your fingers in my hair."
"""Can you not stop thinking for a fucking minute?"" and other conversations I have with my mind."
Sixteenth time is the charm.
Wow.
"I'm good at keeping my feelings to myself. It sucks, but at least I'm good at something."
"Careful, she will consume your soul alive."
I have bookmarked moments spent with you so I can look back and smile every time I'm feeling dark.
"Fare thee well, my heart."
"I'm addicted to your poison. Come, kiss me."
"I can't, for the life of me, seem to forget those eyes. No matter how hard I try."
The eyes matter.
I just wanna find someone who understands me completely and fuck them in all their holes repeatedly. Is that too much to ask for?
"All things in life are temporary, barring my feelings for you."
"Swear to fuck, I don't think about my tweets nearly as much as some of you do."
Do people still call each other? I wonder whats that like.
"In my head, we're already fucking, so please don't make this awkward."
"I stalk, you stalk, we all stalk, stalk, stalk.  Get a life, bitches."
"Today, we fight sadness. Tomorrow, we shall strive for happiness."
"To me, love is a person. One person in particular. Always has been. Always will be."
Would you rather let go of?
She's the one song my heart dances on every time I play it in my head.
So do I still haunt your dreams or nah?
"If you pressed your lips against mine, you'd be able to feel the urgency of my desire for you."
"I choose you, happiness be damned."
sext: read my eyes.
I procrastinate and fuck things up. Wanna hang out?
I'm gonna reduce you to a cum-guzzling whore and you're gonna like it.
"What I tweet or retweet may be open to interpretation but fuck you if you try and judge me for that, Judgy Mcjudgeson. Fuck you."
"If by living in the moment you mean a moment ten years ago, sure I like to live in the moment."
The kind of scar that never heals.
"The kind of girl, you watch all your sunsets with."
Learn to cherish your hurt and life will get easier.
There's just a little bit of madness in everything I write.
Fall in my arms so things can start making sense again.
"Lady, if you keep changing your boob avi, how are we supposed to recognize you?"
"In my head, you miss me as much as I miss you, so there's that."
"If you rubbed my lamp the right way, I might grant you the three wishes you most desire."
My words get hard often. Does yours get wet too?
"And then she said, “Come inside,” so I did."
Strangers. Acquaintances. Friends. Best Friends. Confidants. Lovers. Oxygen.  Strangers Again.
I let the moon know how I felt about her as the sun rose this morning.
I have traveled far and wide to a lot of beautiful places but the most scenic view I have ever seen is the one between her thighs.
"Fuck, I'm so freaking tired. What's a guy gotta do to get some death around here?"
A meaningful silence is always worth more than meaningless words.
"bitch, you mean."
"She's poetry and art and music, all intertwined into one."
"Oh, look, you're overthinking again."
"Someday, we'll find each other again."
Retweet if you're both sick of twitter and can't stay the fuck away.
I'll take you to the edge so hard..... and leave you there. Don't fuck with me.
Can't you tell I write exclusively for you?
"Trust me, if she's the one, you'll know."
Don't think I don't see you smiling at my words.
I'm all out of feels since that one girl robbed me of everything.
"Wrap your legs around me, you piece of shit."
Hearts capable of falling in love and other miracles of life.
The magic in your steady gaze has me captivated.
"Heavy eyelids, heavier heart."
Death &gt;&gt;&gt; dying a little everyday.
I'm yet to meet a disaster prettier than you.
Fuck me like you mean to break my heart later.
A story with no ending in sight.
I miss the fearless child buried somewhere inside me.
i love you's penned with tongue on bare skin.
It’s damn near impossible to look into those eyes and not fall.
"Eternal happiness came knocking at my door, disguised as a pretty girl with dreamy eyes. I gave her all I had and sent her on her merry way."
Perhaps you'll understand when you see her with my eyes.
Story of my fucking life.
The darkness will never give up on me the way you did.
I still think about her sometimes.  * all the damn time.
You have to understand pain to like me.
"That's the thing about love, the pain comes long after the fall."
"I'll always love you, let the heavens fall."
Do something nice today. Reach out for the forgotten ones.
"She's a mess, but she's my fucking mess."
He dreams of spending the rest of his days tasting her.
"Hey girl, have you been bad cus my hand feels kinda itchy."
"Never ask a woman to choose between you and her batteries, I know this now."
The quiet ones are usually the ones who have the most to say. They just choose to say it wordlessly.
Kinda wanna get to know you in the biblical sense.
She's just a pretty little mess who can break you with a touch.
"My heart is tired, be gentle as you wreck it."
"Hang on a second, I'm trying to fall in love with your eyes."
"you, me and an unfinished love story."
Beautiful things will always make me stop and admire them.
Sending love your way. Be sure to send some hate back.
26+90=116
Fuck her often and fuck her proper. Just don't fuck her over.
Violate me with your words.
Love those pieces of you the most that only I have had the privilege to see.
you're*
Looking her in the eyes while you’re deep inside her. That.
There’s a thin line between ego and love.  Don’t tell them you did it for love when it really was your ego that made you do it.
I just want a soulmate who follows me around with a steaming cup of coffee.
Let's make out before Coronavirus gets us.
"Corona, you feisty bitch!"
I hope you find your peace after you are done disrupting mine.
Some memories are like the sweet ache of a long forgotten scar that stings a little every time you scratch it unknowingly.
Let me exist in peace in a quiet corner of your mind.
"Ruin me, and for fuck's sake, be thorough."
"Once you have been lost long enough, you stop caring about being found."
"Sex, coffee and music rhyme in the language I best understand."
They were beautiful together.
"""Does this thing even work?""   - me, trying to listen to my heart beat."
You and I would make a beautiful catastrophe. Can I get you a drink?
If you don't like coffee then I can't like you. Period.
"Not everyone will understand you, and if you think about it, it really is a blessing in disguise."
"Love is the single most powerful emotion in existence with the potential to make you or break you.  Choose who you fall in love with, wisely."
You should be in my arms right about now.
"In your opinion, was the suspension justified?"
"Hi Everyone  I got suspended by twitter today for posting this tweet. This was supposed to be a very general comment not intended to target any individual or a specific group, except well, pussies!  Do you find the suspension justified?  There's a poll in the thread. Please vote."
"A kiss so potent, it breaks the fabric of spacetime."
"Sometimes, their words terrify you more than their silence."
Fun fact: left handed people fuck better.
Mood: wild sex on repeat.
"Why so quick to jump on the cuntwagon, motherfucker. What's the hurry?"
"Fucked off so hard, I might end up in the year 2030."
"I leave my reminiscing and regrets for the late hours, way after it's dark, like a fucking adult."
Fuck the days i spend without you.
"Bitch, please. You're such a cocktease.  - Poetry is easy."
She creates magic with her tongue on my skin.
"Anyway, we should smoke and drink and whine."
"Once I cross 10k, it's all over for me, bitches."
Be a slut in bed with me or don't bother.
Smack her ass and tell her how deep you want to be inside her. Repeatedly.
"fuck, i miss you. come, fuck me."
Ever had a conversation so intense it plays in your head over and over again for days to come?
Not to brag but I can make you cum with just my words.
"Giving a fuck about people's opinion of me?  Yeah, no. I don't do that."
All we really want is someone to be reckless with.
She's poetry and art and music. All at once.
A few words from that special someone can make all the difference in the world.
Fucking morons. Everywhere.
Your softness and my hardness should totally make out.
You can't hide your emotions from someone who has mastered the art of reading your eyes.
"Together, our minds danced in the dark, all naked and vulnerable."
Being enough for each other? Nothing beats that.
"I dreamed I was a fire on a wintery evening, warming everyone around me, even as everything inside me froze."
Hate this irrational longing for a person I have not been with for ages.
But do you even matter?
Let's skip work and make love all day long.
Pin you down and take you for a ride?
Tie me down and have your way with me?
"I wish I didn't know you, but I do and I'll have to live with that."
I met burnt forests and dried oceans and asked them about you.
I undress you with my thoughts as I write poems about you.
Sometimes I wish I was a kid again so it didn't hurt to smile so much.
There was something distinctly familiar about the way she used to look at me and smile as if she understood me and the way she used to hug me like she knew she was meant to be with me.  She felt like home in the middle of a desert.
I wonder if you could feel it on days when I'm missing you more than usual.
sext: come with me.
"When everything else stops making sense, I think about us."
Extraordinary feelings demand extraordinary measures.
Eternal happiness came disguised as a broken girl with dreamful eyes at my door. I gave her a piece of me and sent her on her merry way.
"Excuse me, I have got some rules to break."
I'd gladly give all my sunsets to be with you and I fucking love sunsets.
How much for you to fuck off?
"It's all about butts, folks."
"🎶 bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao."
I think about her butt a lot.
"Roses are red, violets are blue I've got a bad feeling about you"
"I wouldn't care if the skies fall, as long as you are holding my hand."
My heart's a fucking traitor.
Can I fuck you back into pieces?
"I'll make you wet in public, you sexy minx."
There are parts of me that will never stop craving your touch.
*helps a person in need* ... *gets fucked over*
"I am the last person you want to fall in love with, baby girl."
It feels like centuries have passed since I last heard your voice and caressed your skin.
Killing time until time kills me.
"Beach, sunset, lustful eyes and stolen kisses."
I will let you in if you promise to stay.
Roads less traveled and kisses that taste of sin.
"Now is not a good time.  Actually, scratch that. It's never a good time."
Pink lips with dark eyes are a catastrophe.
I'd give all my sunsets to be with you.
I solemnly swear to never forget how you made me feel.
Make love to me like it's our last day on earth.
"Easy on those emoticons, honey. Leave some for the rest of us, will ya?"
Person liking all my stuff and not retweeting any of it - I see you.  I see you and I fucking love you.
"While I'd love to retweet you, you follow someone I hate. So...  - motherfuckers on twitter."
Fall in love with someone who will never stop disappointing you.
Don't beg for them to stay.   Leave before they do.
"Take a deep breath, count till five as you inhale and fuck off."
I hope you're as good to yourself as you were to me.
"No better feeling than knowing people relate to your words so much, and that you're not stuck alone in this relentless cycle of hope and misery."
Her smile is poetry to my eyes.
Let's fall in love with the impossible and ruin our fucking lives.
"Some days I want to want fuck you, some days I want to fuck you harder."
"Patience is key to most anything. Learn to be patient, you ignorant fucks."
To consume or be consumed.
Cremate my remains and let the winds carry my dust in all directions but one.
"Our whore universe was in a hot, damp state. Then nearly fourteen billion years ago bang bang started, wait."
Where do you go when you don't want to be found?
"You beautiful, weird thing."
i miss her voice.
She left such a lasting impression on him that anyone who seeks to understand him would have to know her first.
"My breath lies quiet, at the edge of her lips."
"No, thank you. All my feelings are spoken for."
"If I were to see you again, I'd tell you how every one of my dreams starts and ends with you."
"Just because I don't show it to you, doesn't mean I have stopped hurting for you."
My heart could spot hers in a crowd filled with melancholic hearts in a heartbeat.
"In my next life, I want to be the blood running through your veins."
"I'm fluent in fucks. I don't usually give a lot of them but when I do, they're majestic. as fuck."
Fuck the fuck off.
Sync our heartbeats and never talk again?
Bedsheets wrinkled with loneliness and lust.
"How you manage to be loyal to your husband and be in my dms both at the same time is just amazing, babygirl."
You may nap uninterrupted the day you die.  - God to me.
"Those intense, torturous eyes capable of wreaking havoc at will."
"Shhh, shut up and let me read you."
"Kneel before me, it's worship time."
My heart was declared a crime scene the moment we met.
Would you notice if I mispelled a word in my tweet?
She's just a pretty little mess who owns my fucking heart.
"I will gladly take the worst of you over the best of literally anyone else, every damn time."
Daydreaming about running my tongue across her collar bone.
"Some days, they may be brimming full of nothing but darkness.  Love them anyway."
When did you last wake up smiling?
You were the last thing that felt like home. I've been lost ever since.
The smile I sometimes wear on my face is a reminder of when she used to be in love with me.
Tell me about the last time your heart smiled when thoughts of me crossed your mind.
I wonder who comforts the moon when she's feeling dark.
"Walk with me, let's go get lost together."
Tried running away from the feels today and ended up back where I started.
"Since my hands can't reach out and touch you any longer, I write in the hopes that my words will."
There's something about the darkness she radiates that makes me lose myself even further.
"Look up from your phone when we are talking, bitch."
Sure heartbreaks could be rough and painful but have you ever buried a friend?
There's something about love that even distance can't seem to overcome.
When your only constant becomes a variable.
I'd like to have that dance now that you promised.
Pretty sure the apes think humans are deadass ugly af version of themselves.
Staring at the void around me as I slowly but surely edge closer to a bottomless pit.
Are you past rock bottom yet?
I'd have sex just to forget about you for a while.
Stupid.fucking.typos!
How long before words stop making sense?
"Show me those assets, let's do some accounting together."
This.
Shrugging is always the best answer.
"Love her back already, asshole. It's almost the V-day!"
"LIVE, LAUGH, EAT A DICK."
"buddy, it's rude to retweet every tom, dick and harry from my timeline but me. fuck off, kindly."
Retweeting your own shit is a lot like masturbating.  Some days you just can't keep your hand off your dick.
"What's a little ""my tip on your clit"" action between friends?"
What's a couple hundred followers between friends?
"I knew better, but I let her go anyway, so don't tell me about how your life sucks."
"For what it's worth, I'm just glad you exist, and we got to know each other."
"My head hurts. I want you, coffee and silence, preferably in that order."
"Idk who needs to hear this, but ""Damn, you're beautiful."""
"I still haven't recovered from that one kiss, several lifetimes ago."
Crappy tweets get more traction while deep meaningful ones get fuck all. It's science.
Why does it still hurt every time I see her.
"I rarely interact with people unnecessarily, but I could talk to her for days on end."
I wonder if anyone loves you the way I used to.
I wouldn't have wandered this far if I wanted to be found.
"All I want is to be the memory that even when I'm long gone, still resides with you and makes you smile a little, every now and then."
"I want to kiss the softest spot on you and no, it's not your heart."
She felt like home. .. I feel lost ever since.
Does expressing how you feel ever go out of style?
It's a long way to someone's heart. Don't fuck it up when you get close.
Find someone who loves you more than their fear of the unknown.
"Here's the thing, in all my life, you were never a stranger."
"I'm so fucking tired I don't even feel the pain I know I'm carrying somewhere inside me, any longer."
A dreamless night and a thoughts free day are all I ask for.
"I know this might come as a surprise, but I have a life outside of Twitter too."
"Of course, I remember her eyes. How can I forget something that's going to haunt me forever."
Show of hands if you too are tired of cleaning up other people's mess.
"I hate it when people ask, “How have you been?”   Not so great. Mind your fucking business, dumbass."
Words so articulate lost amidst all the chaos.
"In our next life, I'll be finding you and making you mine sooner and not letting you go."
"The dick wants who the dick wants and it's definitely not you, creepy bitch in my dms."
"Let's skip to the part where we don't talk much and have lots of wild, unbridled sex."
And there's nothing like two ladies talking butt sex in your mentions.
Unconditional surrender in bed.  That.
Am I broken beyond any hope of redemption?  I hope the fuck not.
Fuck her broken self back together and then fuck her some more until she can't walk straight for days.
Her lips tasted of wild strawberries and longing.
Might fuck around and drunk dial her husband.
"If they ain't loyal, they ain't worth shit."
Do you still think about me sometimes on nights when sleep eludes you?
My therapist thinks I need to fuck you one more time.
"A love so strong, it devours you."
"hey, buddy. why so superficial?"
"It's Sunday. Show that pussy some love, bro."
I'm done pretending I don't need you anymore.
got like restricted again. motherfucking.bitch ass.twitterfuck.
I have @SexytotheNorth. Who do you have?
"I write for me and me alone. If anybody has a fucking problem with that, fuck them and their problems."
You get to know me only when I choose to let you.
I mean fuck I'm so smitten.
Is it the season of walking the fuck away yet?
"You're gonna crush my fucking heart, aren't you? Come here!"
Public display of cold indifference.
sext: i understand you.
Are you a girl or my last train home?
I don't believe in forever but if there ever was one I'd want to spend it kissing her.
Why talk when we can just ignore each other for the rest of our lives?
"Of course, I believe in magic, I mean, have you seen her?"
If I can't have it with you why in the world would I want it without you.
"In the battle of hearts, things get real ugly whenever ego triumphs over love."
"The day he gave up on her, he gave up on life itself."
"You be the music, I'll be the lyrics. Let us dance."
"And some days, the silence in your head gets so loud it overwhelms you, and the words elude you. On days like these, you miss them the most."
I miss the way she used to wreak havoc inside my heart with just her smile.
Kiss them until breathing is no longer essential for their survival. You are.
"Wreck me, and for fuck's sake, don't be gentle about it."
The art of maintaining silence when you're up to your neck with words.
"My face buried deep in her chest, feeling the softness of her skin and breathing in her scent.  Pure bliss."
Just be with me now and forever. Is that too much to ask for?
Dip you in chocolate and lick you inch by inch from end to end?
🤷‍♂️
I just blocked someone for their stupid comments on my retweets. Don't fuck with me or mine.
"Timeless moments, wordless poems and her."
A cigarette post-coital keeps the doctor away.
Push her darkness against a wall and have your way with it.
One day we'll lay together and listen to each other's heart beat.  Some day.
"Always on the tip of his tongue and the back of his mind. Are you a miracle or a curse, babygirl?"
Kiss me and see for yourself how much you mean to me.
"fuck me up like a wildfire, burn my being to the ground."
A tired old soul with a heart so young.
Forever in feels with forgotten memories and forsaken love stories.
ƒuck ɱe.
"""Universe"" follows me on here. Am I timeless yet?"
"Some hearts will love, regardless."
I'd trade my soul in exchange for a few timeless seconds with her in my arms.
My idea of a great conversation is to ignore it altogether.
[kisses the past goodbye] .. . .. [can't get rid of the aftertaste]
You can't sell momentary happiness to someone who has tasted forever and had to let go.
"Coffee and your eyes in mine would be perfect, right about now."
Make it rain inside my heart and have your thoughts dance around all carefree and naked.
"for fuck's sake, stop fooling around with me, motherfuckers."
Don't ever be afraid to walk away. Fuck ’em all.
"still like &amp; follow restricted. twitter, wtf?"
"That awkward moment when you learn something that can potentially kill you on the inside, but you don't care because you're already dead inside."
And then suddenly you mean absolutely nothing to them.
*sigh*
A notification that makes your heart beat faster.  That.
She makes my life better by virtue of her presence under the same blue sky.
why am I like restricted. haven't even liked that many tweets today. fuck it.
Land in quarantine together and chill?
There are days when you wonder if you are ever going to find someone to love again or if you were done for life.
Rain check on that drunk text I owe you?
I would kill to protect you.
"I fuck, therefore I am."
But does your heart inquire about me as often as mine asks about you?
"My head is a pretty dangerous place to live, babygirl. Get the fuck outta here."
"In an alternate universe, where space and time had a slightly different set of laws, you and I could have been together."
The sweet ache of wanting something you know you can't have.
"When I kiss you, I won’t ever be able to stop."
Winky vajayjay!
My internal monologue is just a lot of curses flying around.
[pulls mind out of the gutter] ... . ... [puts it in a dumpster fire]
The purest of I love you's are whispered through the eyes.
"Today, I got followed by something I have been following all my life.  Twitter &lt;3"
"Come, let me help you unwind a little."
"Baby, what are you going to do with all that raw, untamed rage?"
are you a girl or a hole in my heart?
"If it were up to me, I would choose to live in the last moment I spent holding you every fucking time."
but did you ask your heart about me?
"Not to brag, but I can survive most meetings with my AirPods on."
"For the sake of every fuck that the God of fuck has to give to all the little fucklings of the earth, fuck the fuck off."
Because feelings leave scars.
I'm tired and the night has decided to linger.
She eclipses the moon when she smiles.
"Be safe, please."
I have seen her in various stages of undress and let me assure you that there's not a better sight in this goddamn universe.
Don't let echoes of the past disrupt the peace of your present.
"Make me surrender, I dare you."
"Do my heart a favor and show up, unannounced, one day."
I'll judge you by how you treat your inferiors.
"I want to consume you, the way your thoughts have consumed me."
"Why do you have to be in every chic's replies, guy? Is it some sort of compulsion you feel and can't resist? Please enlighten us all."
Love is a farce until it's not.
Thinking about you all the the time can be painfully exhausting.
Her eyes gave away the intensity with which she wanted him.
I don't know who needs to hear this but maybe hit that like button before replying fuck face.
"The moment their lips met, everything started falling into place."
What’s even the point to all these words if they don't reach where they are supposed to.
p.s: I can't do life without you.
Don’t try and find everyone who comes across as lost to you. Sometimes people who are lost don't wanna be found.
Why do you have to miss the same person every day?
🤷‍♂️
"Be gentle, be kind, be present."
"I feel absolutely no compulsion to hold my tongue for anyone, why should twitter be any different?"
May your mornings be filled with the aroma of your favorite coffee and the flavor of your favorite pussy.
she's obviously kidding.
"She kissed me once, I can still feel the aftertaste in my bones."
"I like to shrug a lot. In fact, I shrug at most questions thrown my way. 🤷‍♂️"
"Let's fuck our way out of this mess, shall we?"
"Your words look beautiful, bleeding from invisible wounds, radiating light all around my darkness."
"It's raining red inside my chest today, how you doing?"
"The way she dresses up for him, without putting on any actual clothes..."
"Love comes first, followed closely by the egos."
She's my last train home and I find myself at the ruins of a razed station.
Protected hearts and precious wonders.
"different lives, similar dreams"
"validate my darkness, i dare you"
"Not my fault I didn't take you seriously at first, you have got that face of a fucking idiot."
"I wanna see your fucking playlist, like right now! Fuck."
Ask your doctor if falling in love with me is right for you.
Have you chosen a snapchat filter for your funeral yet?
"kiss me, i'm hurting"
"“In less than a hundred years, we have found a new way to think about ourselves. From sitting at the center of the universe, we now find ourselves orbiting an average sized sun, which is just one of the millions of stars in our own Milky Way galaxy.”  ~ Stephen Hawkins"
"hugs &amp; kisses, kim. @kimbermahree"
"If I happened to like dicks (which I don't) and if I were to eat one (which again, I won't) - it would definitely be @EatMyDick1217 dick, no question about it."
I sometimes imagine you whispering my name in the dark and it still gives me the shivers.
"Stir shit up, then fuck off?"
"Sorry, I couldn't hear you over all these voices inside my head."
Time flies by and yet some moments find it in them to last forever.
Be the void you want to see in the world.
I swam across oceans of time to find that nothing has permanently adhered to my heart except for her.
Keep your head low and expectations lower.
Mean-fucking-human beings.
Expectations come at a cost. Disappointment.
"if you tweet fast enough, it stays hidden from all 9k of your followers."
"Fuck this Monday, more than the usual."
"Time couldn’t erase a feeling that strong, I know cus it tried."
Nothing left to see here except shunned feelings and excessive baggage.
"Fuck just being alive, let's go beyond the realms of existence."
Do I look like I fuck with your kind?
the stars will never forget her but they wish they fucking did.
Where do you go when they don't need you anymore.
I wish there was a noise loud enough to shut you out of my head.
I miss her and it fucking hurts my heart.
so many good words buried in the middle of nowhere.
Getting lost with someone is a beautiful phenomenon.
"Take my advice, don't reach out."
"Stories end, what we had never will."
My subtweet game is lousy.
"The winds and the ruffling tree leaves, my head in her lap, her hand in mine."
I would kiss the pain away from your eyes if I could.
Strategically planned butt grabs!
I’ll keep writing about you until I run out of the ink that's flowing through my veins.
"I wonder what crosses her mind when my words reach her, if they reach her."
Let's kiss for a while and then kiss some more.
"Missing you comes naturally to me now, like breathing."
"The trouble with writing your heart out is, your wounds stay afresh."
"When life gives me lemons I squeeze them on food and eat them cus let's be honest, I do that with almost everything else too."
The truth is often brutal enough. The world could really do without all the lies and deception.
"My hands, her hair and deep throating.  A perfect love story."
Swinging like a pendulum between misery and despair.
"My best friend is depression, which is inevitably going to consume me."
Been years since the last time I felt truly happy so don’t tell me this twitter thing is not for me.
She's full of complexities painted in a thousand different shades. I adore every single one of them.
offwards and downwards...
Healing is over-rated.
"Get your head out your ass and use a fucking turn signal, you freaking moron!"
"If  you were a drug, I’d be high all the time."
Coffee with a side of miss yous!
"They see you hurting, they be rejoicing."
"Sometimes you don’t get to know, sometimes that’s a blessing in disguise."
"Some people just get you irrespective of the situation or your various mood swings, don't drive them away fuck face."
The unrestrained chaos that dances in her eyes is why i fall in love with her every day.
All else collapses around you inside my head.
"I don't regret the yesterdays spent with her, I regret spending the tomorrows without her."
"Idk who needs to hear this but,  pause and breathe."
Eyes that make you want to both live and die simultaneously.
Hear!! JFC.
"When I lost you, I lost everything."
Five year olds can be a serious pain in the ass sometimes!
Don't turn on my notifications for you unless you want me to cum inside you.
I knew all your verses by heart.
Sleep depravity is a bitch.
"I haven't just read her story, I co-authored it with her."
"Imagine being in bed with a guy named dick, now you can have two dicks in bed."
"I can't promise being with me will solve all your problems, but I sure as hell will never fail to disappoint you."
"She's not yours to save, goddamnit."
"""Every human being starts out as an anus - It's the first part that forms inside the womb.""  Some stay that way for the rest of their lives."
I miss the warmth of your breath on my neck.
"Here me out, a nap that lasts forever."
It must have taken centuries for evolution to draft a story as beautiful as ours.
I would let her hurt me and still talk beautifully about her.
"She's just a girl, but to him, she was once in a lifetime kind of a girl."
...and what became of all those promises of forever?
"The ability to forget at will is an essential, life-saving gift."
daydreaming about touching you in places nobody has touched before.
Lalalalaaaa~
"Can you see me, like really see me?"
"Fuck, this is beautiful."
"Careful, she will haunt you for the rest of your days."
"Fuck nudes, do my words make you just a wee bit sad?"
"Pain. Excruciating, mind-numbing pain and I go hand in hand."
"Nights, when the emptiness in your chest is so much more than what you can manage."
How many licks would it take to get to the center of you?
"It's what you learn after you think you know, that hurts the most."
Those who stood by when you needed them the most are the ones you can trust with your life.
Post-mortem: they found her fingerprints all over his essence.
Breaking free can be very alleviating or so I have been told.
"Come, be my favorite pain."
"I don’t care how you react, if I happen to run into you again, I’m giving you a hug and never letting go."
My heart was ransacked and it fell in love with the bandit.
I'd like to do a lot more to your tweet than just ❤️ it.
"Plot twist: her tits are real, she’s fake."
So fucking tired of these never ending work meetings.
pretty fucking sure KETO is a dumb fucking diet.
"I have been meaning to tell you how beautiful you are, for a long time now."
Quietly falling in love with her silence.
Let my words choke you gently.
She exists invariably and unceasingly at the back of my mind.
"My heart has decided to hold onto you, it's not up to me anymore."
Show me the chaos inside that pretty little mind of yours.
Quiver at my touch.
OD on sunsets and chill?
In time you realize that forgiving yourself is a lot harder than forgiving others.
I wonder if you know how often I have picked up my phone and almost called you. Fucking hate these almosts.
Meet me where the feelings go to die.
My glass is half empty and I intend to keep it that way.
But have you seen her smile chase the sadness away from his eyes?
"I may wander into your dream and prevent it from ending, don't fuck with me."
Lay on my chest and tell me stories from your past as I run my fingers through your hair.
The intensity with which you miss them has to be reciprocated at some level.
"Loyalty? All my scars have, but one name."
There's no escape if you're trapped inside your own goddamn mind.
Miss you like an addict who misses his favorite drug.
The world gets scarier when you start believing again.
I'm no longer attracted to beautiful things since they all remind me of her.
"kindness without motive, so rare yet so gratifying."
"I knew I'd never be able to forget you, I just hoped it wouldn't hurt as much."
How can we forget each other after all that we have been through together.
"I don’t want forever, for it ends too soon. All I want is a moment with you."
"bitch, you cold."
I'll keep frequenting places that remind me of you until I find you again.
Eyes capable of igniting wars and destroying civilizations.
"I would have set my soul on fire for you, but I ran out of gasoline.  And soul."
I don't like all this air between your lips and mine.
I want to taste you today and every day for the rest of my days.
Imagine getting them and letting them go.
I want to kiss you in all the places my words won't reach.
Pain is how empty my heart feels without you.
Years later and he could still breathe in her fragrance and feel her warmth when the winds blew a certain way and everything else grew quieter.
"On her rough days, nail her harder."
"Like blowjobs? Don't get fucking married, bro."
Woke up with thoughts of you on my mind again.
Perhaps.
"There’s no good or bad in this world. Only the love, and the beloved."
"I’ll forever love her from afar, no questions asked."
I wish burying them in the past was an option.
"Girls with small titties want big titties, girls with big titties want small titties.  Guys? They just want the titties. Keep the girl if you will."
It’s like her memories follow me everywhere.
"I like my women like I like my unicorns, horny and evasive."
"Damn you twitter algorithms, damn you!"
Panties shall be redundant if we are to spend the night together.
The devil in my pants craves the goddess in yours.
"Not ready to love again. Not today, not ever."
"At the risk of sounding creepy, I often zoom into your avi and get distracted for hours. But you already knew that, didn't you?"
The way we keep finding each other doesn’t make sense unless we were meant to be together.
"Stop playing hard to get, you little piece of shit."
The sexual tension between the two of us is unmistakable.
I like you. Let's never meet again.
"This, you and me not being together? It's just a goddamn chapter, not the whole story."
"Scars, barely visible under the sands of time."
Massacre my feelings.
she’s basically a volcano waiting to erupt.
"Let's forget to remember. Together, alone."
"Why are you still here, lingering on my thoughts?"
Incredible how they can destroy you with just a few words.
"Hope becomes despair, despair becomes hope. Life goes on."
"Look me in the eyes when I eye-fuck you cus manners, bitch."
"Leaving her, broke him."
"Excuse me, I have been meaning to grab someone and shove them inside my van. How you doin'?"
"Her soul made of sunshine, His eyes shone with moonlight."
"Disgusted, yet intrigued."
"Bought a new leash today and I don't even own a dog. C'mere, you."
Single mom here if you’re down to fuck! 🤨
Fall apart at her touch.
Survival of the darkest.
Let’s dwell on tragic ends and dream of despair.
"It’s the journey that mattered, not the destination."
Bring me dead flowers when I die.
We are but two strangers who dreamt of the same future in a distant past.
"In a galaxy far far away, we would still be together."
"It's pretty dark inside my head with a deep fog looming over its entirety. Even then, if you glanced inside, you would see her with clarity."
"Some people fade, but never disappear."
When her silence alone speaks to his heart.
and I will love you so much more on days I cannot love myself.
Stop making it impossible for me to forget you.
"I'm surrounded by people, yet all I feel is your absence."
Haunted hearts and an ancient fire that keeps them throbbing.
"Sometimes I try to write about life and make sense, all at the same time."
Be with me.
I must have done something right if you still think about me sometimes.
Not to brag but bad timing is my specialty.
I would gladly take the fall for the both of us if I could.
"ooh, cleavage! *retweet, retweet, retweet*  - fuckbois"
Keep running away from pain and eventually it will kill you.
The person you fell in love with is long gone. It’s just his relics.
Miss second guessing your thoughts.
I take your tweets very seriously. You should too.  - fucking idiots
"Come here, will ya? I'm running out of things to pin on my wall."
Please take my will to live with you when you leave.
All boners are not created equal.
"Some reply guys stay reply guys their entire fucking lives, while the rest graduate.  Don’t be like that, reply guy."
Ugly naked guy is tweeting again.
Excuse my heart for not being able to let go. It's not like I didn’t try.
"Some days, words just get stuck in your throat and it’s the eyes that do all the talking."
"Inscribed on my heart, “your presence still lingers here”."
Of course your claim is weak. She was mine to begin with and I intend to keep it that way.
"Show me that smile, cause I need to feel alive again."
"It was worth every bit of heartache just to have a chance to be with you, hold you and spoil you. No regrets."
Forgive me but I fell for someone once.  I'm still down.
"With you, I was the most me."
Y'all can unmute me now. Thank you guys for your patience.  *drops mic*
"I wish you weren't on my mind all the time. I got stuff to do too, you know?"
"I'd leave twitter as soon as I run out of things to bitch about.  Or die.  Or maybe come back as a ghost to haunt y'all, you don't know."
Say it before it's too late. Do it before you run out of time.
How does my heart miss you so much when you never even left.
Kinda in the mood to get hit by a truck driven by you or something.
At least she is not as fucked up as I'm after all that we have been through.
I hope to find her where the horizons meet.
My need for her is annoyingly overwhelming.
"I wasn't the one for her. I could've been. I should've been, but I wasn't."
"🎶 Looking through your photos I imagine all of your dreams I will always wonder who you really were before me what did you lose? I hope, nothing too soon 🎶"
I wear emotional wreckage like it’s fashion.
Given enough time all your friends will turn into assholes eventually.
"Come here, take my hand. Let's  ride into oblivion."
"There's much to be said about the hopeful ones in this dark, dark world."
"[gets pulled over] cop: were you texting and driving? me: *nervously* yes wife, pulling off the mask: then why didn't you reply to my text?"
I'd candle your vagina so hard.
Autocorrect won’t let me say bitch so I’m gonna make it my little birch.
Craving something as much as I crave you is illegal in at least thirty different states.
"Whoa, you mean sane people tweet too?"
"I can tell you’re ovulating by looking at the stuff you post, wanna make babies together?"
"Fucked off so hard, ended up back where I started."
"Do you make no sense on purpose or does that come naturally to you?  No, seriously."
Taking comfort in the fact that at least she doesn’t have to deal with my bullshit any more.
"Beware, there’s more to her than meets the eye."
New phone. Send nudes.
I think about smacking that ass a lot.
You need to let your eyes adjust to all this darkness that surrounds me first.
Redshift me into oblivion and chill?  -Astrophysext
She's just another song I don't get to dance on anymore.
Missing you is like second nature to me. I'd miss it if it ever stopped.
"I can't not love you, even if I tried."
I wonder if I'll ever feel the way I did when I used to be with her.
You never quite forget the effect their smile had on you.
"No, you de-escalate first."
Blink and they’re gone!
"I’ll be fine. In pieces, but fine."
"In her touch, he found serenity."
This headache feels like I’d be avoiding my responsibilities all weekend.
"not feeling too well today, can y’all shut the fuck up?"
It would take me an eternity to outgrow “us”.
Kiss her neck and bite her ears until you feel her crude tenderness drip between her thighs.
My signature move is to ignore you and miss you at the same goddamn time.
Reverse cowgirl but you won’t be able to do anything except maybe scream a little.
Twist the knife a little deeper inside my wound and watch me smile.
"In the matters of heart, you don't get to win either way."
I'm 3% human and 97% bittersweet memories of her.
"Your mere existence would have sufficed, had they truly loved you."
"the butterflies maybe back, but they are lacking the wings"
I would do you to the moon and back.
"Why, though?"
"Well, well, well.. if it isn't my nemesis, the memories."
"Alexa, show me the locked accounts that are following me"
Let the crazy in you rebel for once.
"If you keep giving me that look, I’m gonna have to put a baby in you."
I can feel you hear me whisper your name from miles afar.
Nothing has felt right since you left.
Looked inside her eyes and travelled back in time to my happy place.
"Beautiful when festive, even more beautiful when furious."
All I wanna do is listen to sad music and sulk over things that were never meant to be
I have her written all over my existence.
"The awkward moment when it's not you, it's their cramps."
Some days it just gets impossible to breathe without you.
"Already over twenty twenty. December, where art thou?"
"Escalation is never a smart choice, war is not an option. There must be an end to this madness. Humanity has suffered enough."
Make me believe in fairy tales again.
"Once you learn to endure the endless pain, it gets easier."
Sensing the darkness descend.
Losing myself in my quest to find her
I’d rather have you assume incorrectly than opening up.
Consider this an open invitation in to my dms.  *clothing optional of course
"Stick around when every one else is leaving, that’s when they need you the most."
silence and darkness are my sanctuaries
"Here’s to hoping again...  Nah, who am I kidding."
Life after her is like an endless fall to a bottomless pit.
how long do you suppose one has to pay for one fucking mistake?
"Remember, your opinion doesn’t count for shit. Opine anyway."
"I’m sorry it didn’t work out, I really am.  Not for you though. You are better off without me."
Same. I shower regularly though.
Thoughts that are yearning to explode.
"His heart searches for hers, alone."
What’s good days feel like?
All I ever wanted was a sip from her elixir of life.
I'm exhausted from all this inaction. Old age is a bitch.
"Fare thee well, shitty decade."
"Oh, you were dancing? I thought you were having a panic attack."
"If I don't shut up soon, someone here will have to execute me."
"I enjoy long walks on the beach, sunsets and dropping bodies.  Wbu?"
"I admire your taste in trouble, let's elope."
Fighting with strangers on the internet? Motherfucker you need help.
"Excuse me, miss. Have we banged before?"
Come dance with me like it's the last dance of our lives
Can’t. Busy collecting all those new year kisses on twitter.
"Enough with all these new year resolution bullshit already, some of us are trying to survive in here."
"On my good days, I'm barely tolerable. On my bad days, however, I'm fucking awesome."
Ugly crying before or after the midnight?
Imagine a timeless universe. Everything would happen at once and we get rid of the shit show  Happy new year
It’s as if I need you more and more every day.
"Fuck the midnight kiss, blow him into 2020 tonight."
Surprise your coworkers by masturbating in the middle of a meeting today.
Your time zone or mine?
.skcus tamrof teewt lrigwoc esreveR
My ex ran away with a guy who wore no show socks so don't tell me about your problems.
"Don't underestimate the typos, they can change your wife."
[..throws the last decade in a dumpster and walks away..]
"2019, couldn’t you stay a little longer? I’m lonely."
Typos can change my wife.
"Don’t mean to upset you or anything, but this place was awesome before you joined."
Hold on to me as we drown...
"Overwhelmed at my own game, ready to surrender."
"When I told you I would love you for eternity, I meant it."
I love you.
I got perky tiddies. Please retweet.
"I got big boobs, please follow."
"I’m either horny or depressed. Sometimes both, simultaneously."
It’s not you. I fake all my human interactions.
"A leash, strong enough to hold their attention."
When they become less of a person and more a part of you.
She was someone I greatly desired and didn’t deserve.
"Hate me, for the indifference is killing me."
"I smile every time I talk to you, which is never."
"We could finish what we started or set the world on fire, you decide."
"For better or worse, you got me tangled for life."
"doesn't matter how hard we try, the scars remain"
suck my indifference

that awkward moment when you start adapting to the darkness that surrounds you
"It’s not me, it’s the raging hormones."
🎶 show me that smile again...
"Let’s take a silent walk, your fingers in my hand."
"It’s not over till I say it’s over, motherfucker."
All that matters is you matter to people that matter.
Not everyone will have a heart like theirs. Preserve it.
"December, it’s time to leave."
"Just damaged, yet to be broken."
Till life do us apart
It will always be you
"The sensation of his thighs slapping her lower back, repeatedly."
Fuck the future. Let’s just relive the best of our memories.
I fucked up. What’s your excuse?
soaking in the rain is my favourite relief
It’s a beautiful day. Let’s ruin it by existing.
Go fuck a penguin
Penguins can’t fly but I don’t see them whining about it all the time
"Together, our minds danced in the dark..."
how about we start with forever and see where it takes us from there
"hey, get off my vibe."
Struggling to remember what it was like to be me.
a wandering glance and I come undone...
Her love was an ocean I was too afraid to dive in
"Be kind to animals, you filthy animals."
"In the world full of permanents, be my temporary."
Still recovering from the last time I fell in love.
The Doctor hasn't met me yet.
"guy retweeting all those selfies, save some pussy for the rest of us, will ya?"
I fucked off once. Highly recommended.
I'd make a cute corpse.
"Of all the miserable hearts out there, you had to walk into mine."
Damn you insomnia! I want my nightmares back.
miss all the mind games...
Autocorrect changed “send nudes” to “nurses” and now I’m a nurse manager in a tertiary care facility.
Unfastening the blood pact...
"A medicine, but it causes dementia."
"Horny, depressed and uptight. Three words that describe 90% of Twitter."
Do we really have to keep doing this? Can't @jack shut it down for good?
Do you miss us?
"Some of you tweet like you were born with a dick in your mouth.  You can take it out now, you know?"
Has there ever been a good Christmas movie?
Relationships are temporary. The ache is permanent.
"Death is nothing but a last great favor, the universe bestows upon you."
Death is a dessert we all get to taste... eventually.
"According to this website, I'm leaving for hell any minute now. Want anything?"
Fuck this life. I’ll see you after death.
Is year-long vacation a thing? It should definitely be a thing.
"It was good while it lasted.  Narrator: It wasn't that great, to be honest. Actually, it sucked."
Got countless reasons to love her when none were required.
Let me disintegrate into your system.
A connection that transcends physicality.
"If it was all a dream, I’d like to wake up now."
"Subtlety ain't your thing, huh?"
I have already slept with you in the fifth dimension. Don't make it weird.
"Despite all these years between us, my heart is still dead set on her, like a cruel fucking joke played by life."
"More than lovers, less than friends..."
I don't.
"It doesn't always have to make sense. It's just a tweet, not a fucking gospel. Get the fuck outta here."
mood: neck kisses
Not to brag but I have been feeling blue for nearly a decade now.
Have no fear. Tomorrow shall be worse.
The feels in my heart are not fucking around this December.
"yeah, life is tough and shit but have you tried to stop breathing for a while?"
In a fuck all kind of a mood.
My heart chose you and the pain that accompanies it.
Don’t just tell her you want her. Fuck her like you mean it.
"That night, in a distant past Left me wanting more, forever"
"Dreams stranded on a treacherous, haunted island."
Disrobe her like she’s yours to disrobe.
"Me, her, my hoodie and her short shorts..."
Sometimes I wonder if I would want to make it right even if I could.
Let's make love in front of the fireplace to keep the house warm.
Inspirational twitter makes me wanna puke my guts out.
"Sunsets, stolen kisses and betrayals.."
It sure as hell doesn’t get better with time.
Winters feel far more bitter without her.
Sorry my sexy talk turned you off. Again.
That smile with a hint of sadness...
First crack of dawn in an unusually dark night.
"Still recall that ""I'm gonna hate you till the end of times"" look in your eyes."
Is it even real if you have to constantly spit on it for lubrication?
Survivability is an overrated cunt.
Why would you fly if you are scared of the fall?
My joystick in your Nintendo and chill?  - 90s sext.
Evenings spent gliding down roads less travelled.

(Me in 2009): Hopelessly in love  (Me in 2019): Hopelessly in love
"In my book, it all starts and ends with her."
The miles between us mocking our love...
"So many pieces of art, craving for attention."
"No bro YOU live in a society,  I’m barely alive."
She tasted a lot like sin.
Twitter. Who hurt you?
How do I unhate myself?
"If someone gives you their everything, be sure to walk all over them."
Hate this feeling of not knowing how you’re doing.
Hiding behind words.. Treading between the lines..
Surely I’m not the only one who re-reads text messages from a decade ago and smiles like an idiot. Surely.  Anyone?
Her smile is the most devastating thing I know.
"You worry about how you are perceived by others, I have lost my will to live. We are not the same."
"Keep seeing cliffhangers, show me the ending."
I have already licked your avi. Don’t make it weird.
perpetual sorrow and december..
You decide who gets to break your heart. Choose wisely.
It's real if the silence between the two of us becomes the foreplay.
So many words Not enough lifetimes
I will forever be amazed with you.
I’m addicted to the search. Finding you may ruin it all.
I like how you wear my thoughts down
Take me back to the moment I met her. Then end me.
We’re all broken. Some beyond economic repair.
Short girls are more likely to do that thing you like..  *kick you in the nuts
I will devour both your wolves.
I saw the most beautiful sunset in her eyes.
"A ""trust me"" that didn't last."
The one smile that fixes everything.
My eyes and my smile speak different languages.
I'm sane in between the insanity fits.
Seeing my own madness reflect in your words is what keeps me here.
The hardest thing I ever did was to walk away when I still loved you.
Reminiscence is just another form of suffering.
Hey you. Why so uptight?
You're in her bed. I reign her mind. We're not the same.
Maybe it was all a facade after all.
The kind of in between that has the potential to end you.
"Flight attendant: Is there a doctor on this flight?  Dad: *nudging me* that should've been you  Me: Not now Dad  Dad: Not asking for an Engineer to help, are they?  Me: Dad, there's a medical emergency happening rn  Dad: Go &amp; see “if applying Kirchhoffs law"" helps"
You have them. And then you don't.
"Can I have my bacteria back, please?"
"Simply put, I only existed with her."
Some nights you miss them a hell lot more than usual.
Stupidity should be taxable.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
Drink life to its fullest.
He looks inside her eyes and fills his heart with a fix of love.
The mighty love smashes delicate souls to pieces everyday.
Don't fucking talk to me if you can't do it without wiggling like a little bitch.
There's nothing more pathetic than a broken heart with a facebook account.
"It gets exceedingly difficult to breathe when she's not around. Trust me, I know."
"Less procrastinating, more orgasming."
"she looks her most beautiful self, dressed in nothing but her words."
"Relationship status: for fuck's sake, stop asking me."
Some trolls on here have elevated to the levels of emotional cannibalism. Don't feed them.
"A belt, but for keeping your ego in check."
Being miserable all the time is pretty demanding. Get on my level or get the fuck off.
Wake her up by drawing little circles all over her back with your tongue.
"You know you're seriously fucked up, once the voices in your head start tweeting on their own."
Love...  Best case scenario: you come out alive.  Worst case scenario: you're alive.
Pro tip: Always have sex before you plan on doing something extraordinary. Like stabbing the Night King.
The ruins of the words left unsaid.
Every moment now stained with a memory of hers.
"It's a beautiful day. Let's ruin it by breathing.  - Assholes, probably."
You are not clingy if you have a decent rack. It's science.
"If you have to ask If I ever loved you, then no I never did."
Life gets better once you get past the stage where you can look back and laugh.
Realms of men.
"Her memories taste exactly as she did; bittersweet, with a side of desire and regret."
"You have linked your Instagram account to your Twitter bio, but keep it locked?  Fucking weirdos."
My feelings for her are like an incurable illness and I'm perfectly okay with spending the rest of my days bearing those scars.
I make it a point to immediately block those bitches and sons of bitches who unfollow as soon as you follow them back.  No questions asked.  Fuck you all.
4 in the morning:  [wakes up with a start]  [frantically deletes drunk dms of last night only to realize twitter doesn't work like that]
An unrequited love is like an unopened gift.
"If you think they love you, try disconnecting their wifi."
Forever is not long enough to adore the ebb and flow of her soul.
I love you was the original avada kedavra.
Not gonna get any RTs on this one. 😬
I wonder if you use the same finger to rub one out and RT me.
I'm haunted by living and breathing human beings.
Shut up or I'll have to marry you.
"Fuck off, feelings. You're not the penis of me."
The spells of a dark-eyed raven.
"I may be out of words, but my heart would never be out of feels for you."
Rock paper leave me alone.
It would have been nicer had you stayed.
The smile that has the power to weaken your knees.
Things we do for love...
Saturdays are for tweeting stupid shit.
No thanks. I already smiled once like five years ago.
I fucking hate Hitachi.  Don't @ me.
"When you have had your way with it, could you please return whatever is left of my soul."
Learn to recognize the value of a moment before it turns into a bittersweet memory.
"I don't feel like feeling feelings, ya feel me?"
The monster in me shall forever seek the darkness inside of you.
"Fake smiles in the streets, ugly crying in the sheets."
I can't believe I used to like people.
But have you tried not judging them before you get to know them?
"[plants bitter seeds, expecting sweet results]  Don't be like that guy."
"A dumpster fire, but it's just all these feelings inside your heart."
We haven't retweeted each other in a while. Can we see other people now?
"If she has boobs, she's a keeper."

Twitter is a nuthouse and we're all trapped inside. Forever.
"Somewhere in the darkest alley of her mind, he found his favorite sanctuary."

Fuck nudes. Show me your face without the skin on it.
"Of course, you can be funny too. Have you tried not tweeting at all?"
"Fragile, vulnerable and broken. Ain't y'all beautiful?"
Seeking silence in a world full of deafening voices.
I'm damaged as fuck too. It's just that I'm better experienced at hiding it than most others.
You keep the pieces I left with you. I'll keep yours. And we shall never meet again.
"Epic foreshadowing by the thrones showrunners. I sincerely hope Greyjoy, Gendry, Grey Worm and Mormont survive the upcoming war with the Army of the dead."

"It would be nice for you to want me as much as I want you, for once."
I hope your principles keep you warm at nights.
How many forevers before you give up altogether?
The temptation of wanting something you can never have.
Trying to remember what it felt like before you permanently holed up in my thoughts. Can't.
When you don't even need music to dance with them. That.
Making out after sex is boring af.  Don't @ me.
"All she has to do is smile at me, to make my heart melt and my knees weak."
"When you finally learn to survive alone, you have conquered life."
Maybe try and not over analyze everything they said today and chill?

Being understood yields the greatest amount of satisfaction.
Gathering broken pieces for the rest of eternity.
Just waiting for the jerk off emoji so I can twittercide in peace.

I like my coworkers better when they're on vacations.  Or dead.
"Damn, girl. Allow me to cream that donut of yours."
I don't want to be big on Twitter. Too much pressure.
Don't presume to know how I like my coffee if you don't know what I have been through in my life.

"""Never let anyone tell you what to do."" .. ""I'm a sub. That's how we roll."" - A sub, probably."

Fuck fairytales. Live happily ever after.
"Edging towards madness, one tweet at a time."
I'd take the storm with a hint of you any day over sunshine.
Where the fuck is my coffee?
Can't. Cancelling all my plans for today.
Don't let your lives be the chaos that consumes your dreams.
Twitter is my sanctuary.
Life is nothing but a series of snoozes. You wake up when you die.
Scratch your name with your nails on my back while I pin you down  and take you apart
"There was a lot yet to be said, but we ran out of time."
I'm there if I'm needed and I leave when I must.
It's what people do. They get offended. Screw them.
Knowledge is the new freedom.
"Boys, don’t let your pickle get you into a pickle."
Nothing distracts you quite like a pair of titties ogling at your face.
"I'm never alone. I have her soul oscillating with mine, endlessly."
What does blackhole and your mom have in common?  They both suck.
Vulnerability draws respect from those who have felt vulnerable themselves at some point in their lives. It takes a fighter to know one.
"In the midst of your chaos, I finally found my peace."
"Sometimes our stories do not follow the path, we intended it to."
When was the last time someone told you they loved you and absolutely meant it too?
"Don't get me wrong, I love that smile of yours. But I need to know what you're hiding underneath."
Tell me about your demons. I'd like to meet them one day.
Feelings have a way of showing up at the worst possible times.
"Might fuck around and get my shit together.   Nah, fuck it."
Does this jeans make my ass look fat?  Yes. Sit down.
Give me back what once was mine.
You'll remember them when you need them. Let's hope they remember you back.
Sick of aimlessly wandering through your trashy life?  Get twitter and tell us all about it.
"Blocking cunts left, right and center.  - Bitches of Twitter."
"I don't know who needs to hear this but don't tweet while driving, fuckface."
Be wary of the girls who wear black eyeliner and have dark painted nails.  They carry stolen hearts in their back pockets.
Go back to sleep. Nobody cares about your tweets.
"At least my hand makes me a sandwich, after."
Even I'm excited about the Leafs win last night. And I have never been to Canada.
"Grimacing face is fast becoming my favorite emoji, you guys. 😬"
There comes a point in your life when all you can hope for is a break from feeling too much.
I find solace in your words.
Fickle fucking hearts.
Carrying around a heavy heart all the time is pretty damn hard.
"If your souls mate, do they produce a baby?"
"A crotchless underwear, but for life, so you can fingerbang it all you want."
Taking comfort in the fact that at least she doesn't have to deal with my absurdity any more.
"The music of her laughter, shall forever be his only weakness."
"I can sense you stalking from afar, stranger."
"Cunt so cold, your dick catches it."
I’m sorry your tc can't help with your mental illness. Somethings necessitate a professional’s support.
Shitty tweets get more likes. It's science. Unless you've got tits. Titty tweets get the most likes.
The heart wants who the heart wants. And there’s absolutely jack shit you can do about it.
I’m gonna suck that tongue right out of your avi.
Don't you guys love it when the memories just won't stop haunting you.
Now is as good a time as any to fuck off.
"Not now Karen, I'm fresh out of fucks."
"Come listen to what my heart has to say, cus this fucker never lies."
Sadness? That's my jam.
"Happiness is overrated. Once you learn to live with your regrets, you are at peace."
"Words we conjure are nothing more than an illusion we seek to create, to camouflage the feelings buried deep inside of us."
"No one:   Daenerys: I'm Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.  Daenerys: Also, I'm a sucker for bbc and I fuck like a pornstar."
Done loving her. Dealing with it now.
"I'd like a break from life, thank you very much."
Look in my eyes and fall in love with yourself.
Butterflies? More like bitterflies.
I'm yet to find a leash strong enough to control my goddamn heart.
She was the purest of hearts I had ever met.
"Introverting so hard, I might as well have fallen into a wormhole and ended up on the opposite end of the universe."
"Have you ever scrolled through  a timeline and thought,  “God, I love their soul and would like to pound their hole”"
Don’t just be a bitch. Be the bitch.
"If you find a guy who's sweet and smart and genuinely cares about you, please inquire about their vagina."
Shut the fuck up and hold my sweatpants boner in your pretty little hands.
What's a guy gotta do to make a girl sit on his face around here.
We all are prisoners of our pasts. Some more so than others.
"I'm sorry, couldn't hear you over all these voices screaming simultaneously inside my head."
Tweet. Retweet. Bang your head against a wall.
How do you deal with people judging you? You don't.
Didn't even ask for happiness. Just a little less pain.
Boobs so good even the tweets with typos get 2k likes.
"Not all heroes wear capes, some wear condoms so they don't unleash...  ...the stupidity in their genes."
Idk who needs to hear this but that chick you're efucking still has cum inside her vagina from her early morning romp session with her husband.
"If you pretend to be someone else long enough, it's not pretense any more."
Can't wait to meet you to lose control all over again.
Can't. Waiting for my kind of fucked up.
His tongue knew the contours on her body better than she did.
It's always the quietest motherfuckers that are the toughest to break.
She would always be the girl that gave me a story worth telling.
"What’s a person gotta do to get a follow back around here, you ask?  - Be polite. - Comment decently if at all. - Wait for at least 99 years before sliding into the dms. - Watch porn if you’re thirsty. - And don’t be a fucking creep."
"Can't. Going through my old tweets... And now I wanna delete Twitter, crawl under a rock and die."
[pens something really important on a post-it note] .. [never finds the said note ever again]
"Have you ever clung to a mistake just because you put in a lot of effort making it?  Yeah, me neither."
"Let's set our pasts ablaze and take off, never to return."
Some of you have never had your soul crushed by someone you loved and it shows.  Get the fuck off twitter.
But what if I don't want to be forgiven?
"I don't know who needs to hear this but if you drive your car vertically upward, it would take you less than an hour to reach outer space and die."
There's a fine line between waking away slowly and being blown over by a landmine. Choose your next step wisely.
The people who don't require an audience for every word they speak and are not looking to get validated for their actions are my kind of people.
Don't lose it to begin with if you know you won't be able to live without it.
I just wanted our song to be ours alone.
"All I ask for is to be remembered kindly, when I’m gone."
What goes around might just cum inside you.
"Reveling in the ruined wastelands of the memories, that used to be ""us""."
"Put that vagene away, miss. I wanna do your sense of humor."
Crazy how I miss her mind the most.
"I don't know what you have heard darlin, but I'm way worse."
He wears the blues like they were tailor made for him.
"Sure, virtual love from a stranger on the internet is what's gonna save me."
"Would you rather be killed or saved? Time: Fuck off, bro."
Up to my neck in unspoken words.
"""Have you no shame?""  Me: No."
It's on you if you cry over the same person twice.
Tattoos don't make you trashy. Your attitude does.
Honestly? I don't care.
It's amazing how some unspoken words have the power to rip you to pieces.
I wish my heart knew how to let you go.
"Even when the nicest things don't make you feel any pleasure, that's when you know you're done for life."
Might fuck around and post a picture of my face to make y'all hate me sooner.
Some of us live for the memories.
It's like I'm allergic to happiness. Wondering if anyone else feels the same way.
Stop trying to fix me. I like my broken self better.
"I wish I had eternity on my hands to spend climbing over your walls and unearth all those hidden secrets underneath, brick by brick."
3am thoughts are a bitch.
Don't let your mistakes make you.
"Of course it hurts if they mattered. But you learn to live with it, eventually."
I'd let you hurt me and still talk beautifully about you.
Auto correct changed boobs to blobs and it's like this new phone is making zero efforts to know me better.
"If you can't handle my tantrums, you don't get to play with my boobs."
Hey motherfucker. You look like a hot chick on that avi of yours. I almost retweeted a bunch of your crap.
"The more you see, the quieter you become."
Can't. Eating to fill voids.  Emotional and otherwise.
"For the love of God, please do fuck off."
"I may be a jerk, but I'm not a thirsty jerk."
You're way better off without a love that makes you feel all tied up and emotionally exhausted.
Be with them while you can.
Loyalty gets me hard.
I tweet a lot on days I miss her the most.
"I might have said this earlier and I can’t stress it enough.  But, please do fuck off."
Hey no need to point. Everyone knows who the Jerk is.
"Nothing fucks you up more than waking up without a boner. Like bitch, who did you fuck while I slept?"
Eve in the streets. Steve in the sheets.
Nothing like dying a thousand slow deaths craving someone you can't have.
"The way they smile speak volumes about the sadness they otherwise try so hard to conceal, to the perceptive eyes."
I'm sick and tired of having to live without you.
I know it’s probably been said before but loyalty is sexy as fuck. Arguably the most desirable attribute in a relationship for some.
I need to kiss you like a thousand times from your lips to everywhere.
I knew it in my pants that it was true love when I first met you.
Not to brag but I could make your insides blush with just my eyes.
Wanna use my dick to stir your warm liquids?
"Love them as much and as often as you can, while you still can."
Welcome to your 30s. You now want to put your dick in any hole you can find.  Am I doing this format right?
"How great could you really be if you had to mention it  on your bio, bro."
Nice guys get all the hugs but no pussy.
Lay down on my lap and tell me all the secrets your heart holds.
Do us all a favor and get run over by a bus today.
"Last time we kissed, it felt like the fresh air you breathe after you have almost drowned.  I keep waking up gasping for air in the mornings, ever since."
How do you tell someone you don't love them anymore?
Have you ever swallowed words and pleaded with your heart to stop typing and erase the paragraphs meant for them.
"Desire inducing aromas: - rain on dry soil - coffee, dark - all of her various scents"
"Days like this where you wish twitter had a ""flip the bird"" button right next to the retweet and heart buttons on some of these tweets."
"Remember, it fucks you up only when you start caring too much."
Everything you tell them can be and will be used against you at the most agonizing of times.
Is it okay if I zoomed in to your avi? Like really really zoomed in?  *winks awkwardly*
"Okay people, I’d really appreciate if you can help this amazing lady cross the 10k mark. She’s almost there.  @Havish_AF   FFS, follow her."
Read her poetry and make her cum.
All the good wishes mean fuck all to you if you can't be with that one person.
Nothing fucks you up like gradually losing hope.
"My favourite pieces of art are the ones she created.  With her nails, on my back."
"I’d take living in the past that has you in it over living in the present that’s without you, without a second thought."
"if you ever find a love that makes your toes curl and your heart ache, hold onto it for dear life."
"I'd gladly leave you alone for the rest of eternity, but please don't expect me to forget that you exist."
Do you still smile like the way you used to when you still loved me?
"I loved a girl once.  2/10, not recommended."
Impressive how crazy we all turned out to be.  All on our own.
He loved the way the light danced in her eyes every time their eyes locked.
Is it possible to be kissed to death?
All talk and no boobies won’t get you nowhere with me.
I'll make your mum a playlist cuz Idgaf.  And I bet she’d love it.
In a love hate relationship with my demons.
I sexually identify as a curvy woman.
My nipple game is on point today.
I'm all out of cunts for today. Can I use yours?
Netflix and cry ourselves to sleep?
"A parallel universe, where my heart is still with me instead of being miles away with a soul beyond my reach."
I refuse to move on.
"I'll need a cigarette or two, if you didn’t shut up soon."
Twitter would embrace you if you are the right kind of damaged.
I’m the weirdo in the “no weirdos” tweets.
A kiss that is remembered and cherished for years to come. That.
At this point I'd literally lick anything that’s spelled with a V.
"At least we’re together when I’m unconscious, so there is that."
"Spring has returned, but she never will."
Might fuck around and stop missing you for an entire minute.
"No matter what you do, don’t trust me with your fries."
You. Me. Strategic edible arrangement. -69
Can’t. Busy conversing with her body.
Lost the privilege to tell her that I was still there if she needed me a long time ago.
"The heart and it’s ridiculously absurd, nonsensical choices..."
I’d like to feast on your cherry if you let me.
I’m over you.  Narrator: He was so not over her.
"Can I get a clean on the timeline, please?"
I just wanted to make her laugh hard enough that she peed a little.  Bitch ruined my sheets.
Swallowers are precious. Be very grateful if you’re fucking one.
You can never forget the eyes that once made you feel loved more than anything in the world.
Respect.
"The attachment we felt may have worn out a long time ago, but the love is there to stay."
She had too much soul. Enough for the two of us.
"Fucking love me, damnit."
What kinda sick motherfucker wears pants on a Saturday morning?
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.  Drafts!! you pervs.
Tired of all the pretense.
I like talking to her nipples. Is that weird? I think it's weird.
I believe it’s way past your fuck off time.
"A pussy in the hand is worth a thousand, overseas."
Kinda wanna use my magic wand to stir your love potion.
Be nice to me. Dicks have feelings too.
Amount of time you spend on Twitter is inversely proportional to the number of times you get laid.
What’s a guy gotta do to get a boob in his mouth around here?
How I wish I knew it was to be the last time I would ever see you.
You rarely would have to say it out loud with the right person.
"You won't have to ask for a blowjob today or any other day if it's real, bro."
"Pi? More like cream pie, amirite?"
"I may not confess my love for her very often, but every time I smack her butt, she knows."
"How to prevent someone from falling in love with you?  When they show you their soul, show them you're a dick."
My lever in your beaver?
Some of y'all's parents paid a fortune to get you on twitter and it shows.
"Uh-oh, you're in my thoughts again."
"I pretty much condemn all criminals unequivocally, but child molesters are the worst of the lot. Absolutely despicable."
The crunching weight of all the lives you did not live.
A stranger inside my own trecherous heart.
What's a couple of inches between friends.
"It is such a trecherous place, the realm of tears. Makes your heart melt instantly."
"Despite everything, I believe in the general goodness of hearts.  Unless, you do something to really, really fuck that up. Then you're an asshole for life."
I wonder if you know that all my words are inspired by you.
Woke up feeling dead on the inside again.
"Before responding to my tweets or to anyone else's for that matter, consider the following first:  1. Have they asked you for your opinion? 2. Would they care about your opinion? 3. Would they give a shit if you get butthurt by their words?  4. Can you not fuck off instead?"
"Less talking, more thrusting kind of a day!"
murderer: any last words? me: shut up and do you thing.
"Things I care about,  - coffee, dark - minuscule bunch of people (from a distance)  - all things anal - smothering - jukin - motorboating  - mammary suffocation - fucking off in a timely manner - not doing that thing you like - definitely not you - her eyes  Did I mention boobs?"
My scars still crave her lips. I wonder if that will ever change.
"Some people are outrageously dumb to account for two billion years of evolution. Crazy, dumb fucks."
So is there an International Men's Day too that I'm not aware of? How come we don't celebrate it?
Not to have a thing is less humiliating than having to beg for it.  This applies to people as well.
"Life: Me: 🤷‍♂️ .. Also, me: 🖕"
"By the power vested in me by the  Gods of BDSM and man, I now pronounce you Dom &amp; Sub."
Mood: want to chokehold you against a wall with one hand and fingerbang the crap out of you with another.
I think the time is ripe for you to fuck off.
Been ages since I last whispered your name in your ears.   Who would have thought.
"Sure, she's sexy and funny and probably tastes amazing. But does she clog the shower with her hair bro?"
"If all 7.5 billion of us farted in unison, we could potentially launch the planet off its orbit and would probably all die in the next 24 hours. Have you thought about that motherfucker?"
"Good relationship advice:  1. 2. 3.  Well, shame on you if you need relationship advice from me. Haven't you been paying attention?"
"It's not what they say, it's what they don't."
I'd take a selfie and post it here but I can't stop laughing at it and you see my dilemma...
"If you see a hole and you're not low key thinking about doing awkward things to it, you're not me."
"Hey girl, if I bought you a drink would you go away, cus you're on my favorite spot."
"Not to brag but it usually takes a ""no means no"" for me to realize that she's not into me. I'm persistent like that."
"I got nothing against you being a lying shitbag piece of cunt, but try not being one when you're live on national tv?"
"Just want to belong to the tax bracket where I could afford to rip her Victoria Secrets every time we had sex.... so basically never. Wait, I think I'm already there."
"*gets down on one knee* OMG! *unties shoe lace* WTF? *hands her spiked shoe* ""Would you beat the fuck out of me?"""
I'm out of coffee and fuck you's for today.
Wednesday is like the middle finger of weekdays. Nobody likes it and it's too fucking long.
"Angina, vagina... both ache hearts!"
Nobody:  Death: It's time.
Subtlety is the key.
"Hey egg-avi, running around body shaming everyone.  Here, found your undies."
"Someday I'll leave for good. I'm going to get the fuck away from life and all it's cruelties. Maybe then, alone, I can finally find the peace I've lost."
"Hello stranger. Take your two cents and use them to clog both your shit holes, cus I don't give a flying fuck about your opinion."
"Seize the nipple! Lick it. Pinch it. Bite it. Heck, clamp it even."
"Hey you! half-faced selfie avi, I see you."
"Break hymens, not hearts."
Let go.  Feels amazing!
"Can't live with her, can't live without."
"I'd take off the mask, if you promise to suppress your screams."
You'd think I look hot naked for the amount of time I spend in the nude.   You'd be wrong.
Give me my dreams back.
"Bitch, if I've blocked you from three accounts, what makes you think I won't do it from the fourth?"
"If you don't visit their timeline fifteen times a day, are you even in love?"
Her: Hang in there.  My balls: Dude!
Exhaust the limits of my love.
"When in doubt, gag her."
Need a boob fix. Any givers?
I'd totally smell your panties.
But what if I don't want it to heal?
"Guys, it was rhetorical. I know it never ends."
"Rest in peace, Erika. @QueeniesBack666"
What's the expiry date on aching for someone?  Asking for my stupid fucking heart.
"Disgusted, yet intrigued. - Few people that get to know me."
"Love it when new accounts have the words, ""no dm"" in their bio.  Like you've got three followers bro. Let them message you, ffs!"
Just tell me you're okay one last time.
Forever ecstatic in pain.
"If you're on vacations and are in a hotel room, think about all those people who have jerked off on those very sheets.  Happy vacationing!"
Motorboat her huge tweets.
I leave jizz on bodies to mark my territory.
Sure you can have my dick. My heart though.....  It's gone for good.
She fucking does not.
Is it okay if I made love to you now and fucked you later?
It's amazing how much you see when it's best to look the other way.
A few traces of your soul are still fused with mine. So there is that.
Girl to guy ratio in my dms is like 15:1. Does that make me ever so slightly gay?
"Some fucks, you have to give."
How we hope all of this makes sense some day!
Would all my sufferings die with me?
"Maybe I wasn't enough. No surely, I wasn't enough."
"What's wrong? Haven't you seen an excessively obese, horny, borderline depressed, heterosexual gent with oozing sexiness before?"
Her milkshake once brought me to her yard but she offered me her frozen yogurt* instead.  *butthole.
It's all fun and games until she asks you to suck her non-existent dick and you agree like the little bitch that you are.
Only time I have got your back is when there's food involved and you lose your appetite.
Can someone please set me ablaze when I'm on a tweet spree? It's fucking embarrassing when I regain sense.
"So when you're quote tweeting yourself, is it more like masturbation or self-flagellation?"
It ain't over until my last heartbeat.
"Reports about me, involved in a twitter threesome are greatly exaggerated."
We all are in RRR.   Reciprocal Retweeting Relationship.
I'd be fine as long as you promise to adore me from a distance.
Could y'all just try and notch it down a bit? I'm trying to grieve in seclusion here.
"Make an effort to move on, they said.  I laughed and laughed and then cried a little."
"Had it not been for all this pain, I wouldn't know how to survive."
Leaned in to kiss my psychiatrist on the cheek and kissed her lips instead and now my psychiatrist needs a psychiatrist.
I have lost count of the number of times I have reread those last few texts from her.
Bore me to death if I ever stopped loving you.
"If you call it a hump day, we are not humping.  You can still give me a handjob though."
War is madness.
"Guys, if you don't like something, shut the fuck up about it, pull out your butt plug and scroll [take a stroll]."
How bad could it be if you're joking about it on Twitter.
All those tweets about sex is why you're not getting any.
"Make that 10 seconds, will ya?"
"You wouldn't need to explain, had you won."
"Make babies, not war."
"You can start a war, but you sure as hell won't end it."
Ground trembling beneath my feet...
*Life ahead.
Noted.
"Your selfies make my bowels move. If that's not love, Idk what is!"
Would you notice if I disappeared?
"Fuck her sore, until she's limping. Let the damn bed screech."
"Her venom dripped thick from his mouth, soaking his beard."
"Just because something fits in your holes, doesn't mean you should put it in there."
"For what it's worth, I'd fuck you."
Of course I fucked up. Is that not why you tweet?
Wish there was an antibiotic for all the bad decisions we make in life.
"I can still feel the taste of your lips on my tongue, after all these years."
Nothing ruptures like a heart.
"Broken hearts and people who fake smiles, are my kind of people."
"She will always retain the power to touch my heart, my soul and my mind like no other."
"A spell so powerful, only she could break it. 😊"
Never be too nice. Being too nice has the tendency to kick you in the guts.
I found comfort in the fact that I was your favorite disappointment.  Don't take that away from me.
A second chance won't mean shit if you didn't learn from the first.
I cherish all my regrets.
"If it doesn't end in shattered dreams and broken hearts, was it even real?"
"Caught up in the distant past, gradually descending into madness."
"Holding a feeble heart in my shivering hands, I endeavor to traverse a treacherous trail."
Not to brag but I usually apologize in advance for my dismal coital conduct.
Nothing unnerves me quite like knowing that you are in pain.
Lost her on the crossroads between indifference and desire.
Let me worship the stretch marks on your heart.
"My brush, her canvas. My ink, her diary. My poison, her tongue. My mind, her thoughts."
"Saturdays are for tasting her sinful nectar, dumbass."
Desperately hanging on to every word you didn't say.
I wish it was easier for me to bid farewell to what could have been and move the fuck on.
It's all fun and games until she farts in your face.
Only if you could witness the chaos in my heart.
Abandoning you shattered me.
He's a genuine playa and you can hardly hold your own. Are you sure?
Bush or no bush. I'd destroy your pink taco.
Of course I pay for sex. With dinners and donuts and new lingerie.  Everybody pays for sex.
Life's a shitstorm. And nobody is coming out alive.
I'm not high. Or drunk. Just deeply and madly in love.  Unrequited love.  Excruciating pain.
Sometimes I do this thing where I let my thoughts take over my twitter handle and allow them to run wild. Please bear with me.
"Whatever you're gonna say has probably been said already, so fuck off and crawl back to your hole."
Take your ulterior motive and shove it up your ass.
One last kiss! Is that too much to ask?
You're beautiful with all your flaws. Don't let strangers on the internet sidetrack you.
"Spoil her, goddamnit."
"A load so complete, your balls put up an out of stock sign after."
"Fuckface is one word. Fuck face is not. Learn to differentiate, fuckface."
"Twitter needs more ass wriggling, in my opinion."
Knee deep in regret...
Mere thoughts of you turn me on.
Stalk me harder you sonovabitch. I barely noticed you.
I have never chased anyone. And it's not about to change.
I would have set my soul on fire for you.
There are only so many times you can break.
I get it. I would hate me too if I were you.
Making her laugh is the surest and quickest way to get her panties wet.
"Do what you love, they said. Not realizing that I loved doing them."
Her neck. My lips.
"Your legs look best, wrapped around my back."
Tired of searching for you in every person I meet.
No better feeling in the world than your child smiling at you.
The way we passive aggressively favorite each other's tweets worries me. This could be something serious.
I'd take messy and in her pj's any day over dresses and makeup.
"He had eyes for her and her alone.  His dick though, is a different story."
Till your next tc do us apart.
"If you're jerking off to their avis, don't forget to retweet them after."
Trigger my mind and I'll get your juices flowing real quick.
Listen up. If I have shit to say to you I'll say it to your face. I expect the same from you.  Good talk.
Fuck nudes! Show me your lingerie collection.
"It won't do to fan a fading fire deep within, and then letting it succumb. It just won't do."
Your pussy tastes like whiskey. Have you been drinking all day again?
But is she the one you think about when you lie down at nights.
"Something about this moment, bruises from a lifetime ago seem to be healing."
Her heart still beats. Just not for me.
At least you survived. Ain't that something.
"There's still a little bit of life left somewhere inside me, but I'm not too sure if I'm still alive."
Sorry your TC's getting laid while you wait for their nudes to wank on.
Shout out to all ya motherfuckers who'd be making love to yer fists and fingers! Y'all are my valentine.
Buy her flowers and tell her she's a hoe.
"When she's sitting on your ass, rubbing your back. Naked. That."
The fuck? Is it Valentine's day already?
A group DM room. But for guys...   Nobody talks.
"Muting every account with the word influencer in their bio.  Try influencing me now, cocksucker."
You know whats hilarious? Your face. Fuck off.
The road to my happiness goes through your backdoor.
Tread softly for my heart is fragile today.
Treat softly for my heart is fragile today.
"Just got another one. Guys, I'm on a roll. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
*Spreads whipped cream all over your low-carb diet tweet and licks it off seductively*
Was it even real if she doesn't hate your guts afterwards.
I finally received my first dick pic today and I've got so many questions.  Should I compliment it? Do I send one back? Have I graduated from Twitter now?
Checking out someone's 'Likes' is like fingering their butthole. So don't do it unless you're fucking them.
I have given up on me. You can do it too now.
Can everyone please cut down on these stupid fucking gifs? It's getting tougher scrolling through your media to find your tits.
Rise and shine motherfucker. This Monday is ready to kick your ass.
Post your responses if you like... or don't.
Would you rather be?
"If you fucked with my life motherfucker, I'd let ya do it."
Jet fuckin' lagged. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Have you ever had a tweet that gathers favs &amp; RTs in a perfect 1:1 ratio and then this one motherfucker shows up and disturbs the symmetry of the universe?  Nope? Just me then.
Some wounds bleed eternally.
- Robert Creampie
I see your insecurities and raise you a dick to choke on.

So what's your ring size again?  Not asking for a friend.

13. Arya is going to kill Frey brothers as well. 14. Night king is going to kill at least 2 major characters and acquire one of Danys dragon
9. Jon is a Targ. 10. Wall is coming down. 11. Gendry is going to show up unexpected. 12. Arya will re-unite with her werewolf.
6. United battle against white walkers. Cersei wont be part of it. 7. Westeoros vs whitewalkers (season 7) 8. Cersei vs ROW (season 8)
3. Sansa is going to take over as new KitN in Jon's absence. 4. Starks are going to re-unite in the North. 5. Jamie would ditch Cersei.
"My predictions on GoT S7:  1. Jon &amp; Dany are going to sleep together. 2. Arya's gonna kill Little Finger, avenging her father."

Heart-wrenching sights at Parachinar.
People died cause of greed in Bahawalpur. In Parachinar they were ruthlessly killed in a bomb blast by Saudi funded militants.
"CM Punjab announces PKR 2M for victims of BWP fiasco, whereas Parachinar victims get no media/political coverage. The irony is unmistakable."
