<i>[Tanner Womack:]</i>
The world has fallen to its knees, filling us with insecurity
Our world is lost, which brings us all to plea
Where must we go, to find a place to breathe?
Which path must we follow to rid all this filth?
Hope for a new tomorrow as our past's rebuilt
I feel this losing where your right, from your arms

As the day breaks, and the sun has set
I hide my tears within
These wounded eyes, have come too far to watch destruction
Pay its toll

I'm the same as you, I run away with you watching
I've had enough
Were the same for your lies?
Why must we run from ourselves when we've come this far?
Now we flee to places unmarked
How come we can't make a truce upon loyal ground?
And now I know where it's gone
All we've seen, has been a lie
Now they're waiting, to show demise
Your idols, aren't what they seem
Your idols, are within a dream
Now you're lost, inside yourself
Another victim of tragedy
