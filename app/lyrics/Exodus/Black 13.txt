[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Darkness, your surest bet
Wage of sin and blood roulette
Laying the odds against your gods
High stakes and no regrets

No parlay in this game of hell
Lose your soul and they'll sound the knell
Nothing ventured nothing gained
The cards foretell

[Chorus]
The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

[Verse 2]
Salvation, a game of chance
Roll of the dice at the devil's dance
Speculate and tempt your fate
Life paid in advance

Double down and pull one more
Even money, you even the score
Can't renege you pay the vig
You're spoken for
[Chorus]
The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride

[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Lee]

[Verse 3]
Eternity on the money line
Cloven one pulls three of a kind
You bet the spread and end up dead
Too late to change your mind

You went all in, didn't hedge your bets
Dark bookmaker collects all debts
Death begets the devil's hand
The wheel resets

[Chorus]
The stakes unclean
Through black 13
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
