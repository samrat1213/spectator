After,
Can't be seen with these hands can't be seen 

Can't be seen

Can't be seen, causes everything
Don't you see, causes everything
Can't be seen, causes everything

Give me your hand, reach out I'll crush it 
Cause is OK 

Nothing can be, something to me, nothing can be, me 

Smashing, lashing, slashing, for the same thing
I say quit, while we are heard.

A victim of high tension, and beat me every day

For what? 

Scream for you lying

Can't be seen, causes everything 
Can't be seen
