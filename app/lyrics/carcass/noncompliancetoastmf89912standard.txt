Numbing torturous troubadours
Of this melodious dirge
Ostentatious triumphalism
Impressarios of despair

Virtuosos of the visceral
Artisans of the morgue
Wretched morbid euphemisms
Orating grisly tongue

This is the way of all flesh that will decay
The cycle of death exhausted well and truly plagued
A vacuous malaise for which you studiously cater
The lowest common neonate denominator

Germinated spores are sown
Plagiarised as your own
But it's you we've outgrown
Stillborn at birth

Artistically moribund
Soulless ghosts of the underground
By the past you are bound
Stunted at birth

Dulled, blunted, low tensile dearth metal
Melodists of soullessness
Harmonisers of the converse
In heartless exuberance
Impotent vain facile notations
Purveyors of rottenness
Deadpan putrescent prose
A musical spent blunt force trauma
The butcher's cur attenuated

This is the way of all flesh that will decay
The cycle of death exhausted well and truly played
A terminal malaise that you so feverishly savour
The lowest common puerile denominator

The fruits of perfection shown
Assimulated &amp; decomposed
But it's you that's been outgrown
Stillborn at birth

Non hardened, brittle, untempered, dead

This is the way of all flesh that will decay
The cycle of death unbroken - stunted at birth
A vacuous malaise well and truly plagued
-the lowest common denominator
-stillborn at birth

Dulled, blunted, low tensile dearth metal

Artistically moribund
Soulless ghosts of the underground
By our own past we are bound
Stillborn at birth - D.O.A.
