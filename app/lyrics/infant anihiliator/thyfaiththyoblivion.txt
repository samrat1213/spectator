From the podium to the pit
The royal gown stripped
In a filthy robe I sit
Gaze cast toward my broken sons birthed
I smirk as I stare at the worst of the cursed
Descendants of rage struck with fear and disease
The children are cattle to use as I please

Long live the King!
Of violent rape and savagery
Long live the King!
A masquerade of nobility

I lay on the floor with half-dead whores
Humming the ballad of their fallen mothers
Erotic evisceration
Organ asphyxiation
Each stroke stokes the flames of completion

"I am the King!"
"Malevolent master of sodomy"
"A misanthropic tyrant dwelling beneath your glorious majesty"
"I am the King!"

Broken screams emphasize the beauty of their melody
Resonating in my chamber of chastity
The rhythm of shackles falls in sync with my thrusting
A fairytale of feral fornication

The guillotine raised
I bound and gag the soiled and bleeding
The Enslaved now weak from hours of mistreating

My passion finally finds its end
I pull the chain
The blade descends
Upon those prostrated, my fetish is freed
I fill the beheaded with my heinous seed

"I am the King!"
"Malevolent master of sodomy"

"Succumb to the saint of soiled sin"

"I am the King! I am the King!"

"Praise to the Pastor"
"The Peerless Prince"

"I am the King! I am the King!"

A vulture of gutted cunts
Masturbator of skinned cocks
Addicted to the aroma of death and cum

Sweet sweat-scented skin
Erupting excrement
Smothered in menstrual fluid
Rancid sticky sensation
Rubbing rectal leakage on my shaft in sequence

"I am the King!"
"Malevolent master of sodomy"

Long live the King!
Of violent rape and savagery
