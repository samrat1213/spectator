Sutured slabs of beef
Active cultures of yogurt and yeast
Acidophilus interacts with tissue
Suffocated by the stench of sinew
Vomited dairy products
Peppers, seasonings
Striated muscle flaps
No fruit on the bottom
Inhumane, carnivorous jerky wraps
Agonizing odor of the industry
Ever consuming multiplying fungus
It's all around you
In the air you breathe
In the food you eat
In the bed you sleep
In the rotting meat
Ever looming presence of rot and disease
Unseen and disguised
Slowly, chemically altered
Programmed and chastised
To believe that life is grand
As your arteries squeeze shut
You now realize
They're thinning out the numbers
This is the state of the union
This is the state of the mess
This is the truth behind happiness
And the ignorance of man
Destroy what we've been given
Dig our graves a little deeper
Fuck this world we live in
And fuck its ugly inhabitants
Long live the stench
