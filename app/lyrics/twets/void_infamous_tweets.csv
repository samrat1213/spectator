I want to stand with both feet joined upon your throat as I smile and stare into your pleading eyes.
To suffer amongst demons and wraiths.
Empty even though I’m surrounded by hundreds.
And I rot.
Sooner than you think.
"Dear weak minded stalker, when you get off your ass and go back to work you wont have to worry which my alt profiles are."
"What a dumb bitch, he subtweeted."
"The forest sways, becoming one with the wind.  Wish you were here."
Take a moment to think about your eventual demise.
"Exceptionally tonight, I will be drinking."
The Devil’s thoughts run through my mind.
"Death waits no longer, for the lucky ones."
This world is fucking broken.
The collective growth of entwined souls.

Sometimes I like to spice things up by shutting the fuck up.
We let the anger flow.
"All it takes is one look into our eyes, to see the coldness."
Ok guys so this is the 5th tweet.
"Imagine rethinking your ""twitter brand"" while living at your moms with no job."
Humans weren't created to accomplish anything cool ngl.
I dream of a social media platform where you are obligated to provide your gps location at all times.
"On a more positive note , Twitter really helped me regain confidence in myself and boost my self-esteem. I mean, after seeing all the fucking losers on here I thought to myself ""shit, my life isnt THAT bad afterall!"""
Humanity is literal ass.
I never said that.
"Sometimes, its 2 racks. Depends. Karma I guess."
We don't ever run out.
"""Belle équipe"" is what they say when we roll up for work.  Proud is an understatement."
The devil always keeps his word.
"Sometimes I love. Sometimes I hate.  Whatever the case at hand, I always give my absolute all.  Anything else would be insufficient and a lack of self-respect."
"You want to forget but I want you to remember. Not to torment and scar yourself further but to grow from the suffering. Build upon the ashes and be reborn. Everyone is watching, show them."
"The cycle of misery brought to a halt. A void extinguished, swallowed &amp; solaced."
It's called karma. I hope you get what you deserve.
Ton pit sera toujours le bienvenue. 💖

"I'm at work, so you know."
Don't act like you don't know.
Dark Souls.  Respect the mask.
I'll hate you better. Try me.
"The thing about love is that we probably are too stupid or weak to properly diagnose, acquire and maintain such a beautiful state of being. Its easy to claim love is fake and such trash when you look like shit and have the appearance of a fucking slob."
This world is slowly tipping into the void. Solace will be bestowed when the cosmic abyss swallows us whole and our insignificant blink of an existence is extinguished leaving nothing but ash behind.  Well deserved in my humble opinion.
The shadow of existential shame cast upon humanity is dark and long.  What a sad bunch of pathetic fucking losers we are.  We study our own history as if we had accomplished grandiose feats worthy of mention. Narcissistic sacs of sentient shit is what mankind embodies to me.
"Some people believe their intelligence surpasses the norm. They think they can fool us and that we won't notice when they replicate tweet styles or act shady around our significant others, like rats. These rats (grossly out of shape) claiming retributive acts are merely actors."
Fuck all sentient life.
Mine.
"Fuck nudes, show me your most prized possesion."
"Bear witness to the perpetual halt of time as the veil of darkness insidiously washes over the earth, extinguishing all sentient life forever."
There's nothing we can do to stop it now.
Which mask are you wearing today?
"Circumstances lead to action, which create circumstances leading to action."
nah
"Remember when @BLACKTONGUEUK said ""This is the city of HATE"" on H.C.H.C?  I've been ready ever since."
"Words, are insufficient."
"Tu croit tout savoir, mais en vraie tu ne sait rien."
"Forcefully dragged through interminable suffering and desolation again &amp; again, if just to be with her. Id do it again, until the end of time."

"Infamous Voidposter, I, until no longer.  Oblivion, I implore thee, take me home away from this fucking world of infinite hate and insignificance."
"I am that which bears no name. This malevolance hidden away within my eternally blackened heart and rotted soul. The creation of my childhood fears and years of fucking abuse, this thing that sleeps, forever awake and always watching; capable of obliteration and creationary love."
Bluenose pitbull meets Harlequin pitbull.   Sadly no pics.
That new @makethemsuffer single is absolute fire.

The human life cycle is probably a flat tire.
I wish people took Twitter more seriously. 😔
"When I die, bbq my lifeless corpse then snort my ashes and build a half pipe where my coffin should have laid while a progressive deathcore band plays a live venue for thousands of homeless people sponsored by RedBull. Its what I wouldve wanted."
"Person: ""fix your attitude"" Me: *dies*"
"If existence leads to suffering which then leads to uncontrollable substance abuse, what the fuck are we complaining about?"
Sid Vicious is my spirit animal.
The issue I have with Antinatalism is this: how can you consume industrial amounts of drugs and alcohol if you are not brought into existence?
My favorite part of the human life cycle is cremation.
Swallowed and buried by the demons you sought to befriend.
Mankind's inherent nature to decay and gradually rot before fading away.
With an extremely large smile on my fucking face.
I have a rather small list of names worth another federal sentence.
wHy DoEs YoUr BoYfRiEnD cOpY dEaThCoRe sOnG lyRiCs?  Might wanna take a look at the credits you stupid fuck.
"Obliteration, Eradication, Sanctification."
It could be one of us. It will be none of us.
The best argument pro antinatalism is the long silence of a deep introspection upon your wretched life.

No one can save our souls.
Evil always wins.
We find solace in the coming of infinite darkness.
"Born into absolute darkness, we will never see the light."
Arrèté de vous prendre autant aux sérieux sur les réseaux sociaux. Le monde est un tombeau ouvert pis anyways la plus part du monde sont des calisses de vidanges sur pattes qui n'ont aucunes paroles ni respect sauf pour eux même.
J'el sait même pas si ça se traduit all good en Anglais pis j'men criss sérieux.
"Loyal à mon clan, comme un pit à son maître."
Fuck Twitter.

Well that was fun.  Now back to suffering.

"Dreamers ceaselessly attempting to awaken dreamers from this repetitive nightmare. Designed to fail and fail again, until eternal slumber in the night of infinite shadows."
"If we really wanted to be happy we'd start by getting off this collective sewage called social media. But no, we're way too worried what other people think &amp; do because in truth we are nothing but spineless narcisists. Anytime we see people think for themselves we point a finger"
Wanna laugh? Then follow somebody else.  All I preach is rot and infinite darkness.
You're welcome.
You know what would alleviate the pain? Opiates.
Why do we even bother?
I will never be like you.
"When the dream is shattered and can no longer be remolded, there are those who aspire aspiration."
"Enjoy it while it lasts, you fucking sadist."
"People ruin people, who ruin people."
I refuse to weep because it happened. I smile because it will soon be over.
Human existence is just not worth it.
No matter where I go and who I'm with it doesn't matter. I always miss my best friend Rocco.

Nothing is eternal.
"Together, let's pave the path to hell."
This is not our home.
Open arms to oblivion.
"This misery you've grown accustomed to. Let it soothe you, let it be your mentor."
"Everything Changes, Nothing Changes."
"Whatever it is, keep in mind that no one cares."
They are all too blind to see reality.  We have already won.
This crimson moon is the last we will ever see.
The sun slowly falls into darkness.
We will never be the same.
The dead will rise.
Everything you touch withers away.  When will you learn?
One must imagine Snoopy happy.
Litérature française be like:

Red &amp; White Forever. Forever Red &amp; White.
"For all disrespect issues, a maelström of violence ensues."
"For example, hes on his knees blowing bubbles atm laughing while retro fucking music plays and a porno movie also chimes in on his big screen tv."
Your perception is nothing but a mockery.
Succumb in absolute terror to nothingness.
Man is a such a fragile machine.
"In a godless world, we are all bastards."
Sanctioned to spend most of eternity in death.
In trance with the moon.
He's most happy during these walks.  Seeing him like this makes me forget my own sufferings.
"Worry not, child.  All will ascend to the realm of the dead."

"Contorted smiles from beyond the shadows, and I writhe."
"Hope dies a little more, with every passing day."
"Today might be the day you change your life around, but it wont."

Condemned to walk the earth with no end to the nightmare in sight.
Reoccuring dream of perpetual night.
"Humanity, born to rot."
"Shattered, rebuilt, shattered."
Bring forth the plague.
It was in the darkness that I saw the light.
Take a step back and let your demons take control.
You brought this on yourself.
Most people can't decipher the urgency in brief annecdotes.
"""We will never surrender.""  ~Berger"

Until there's nothing left.
"If it's not about respect or money, it probably doesn't concern me"
Meaninglessly we burden ourselves with a life long quest for purpose when in truth everything and everyone is null and all quests lead into the void.
Obsessed by themselves they take to social media thinking they are better than us.  We elevate in actual thinking packs whereas they stagnate in their own foulness and inherent filth.
Who me? I'm nobody.
The many faces of the Void.
"If you're reading this from an alternate profile because I've blocked you on main:  Get a fucking life, whore."
Nothing but a sentient waste of space.
"When the time comes, I will save my fucking self."
"No Life, No Pain."
"To have and to hold, until it's forcefully ripped from your still grasping hands.  Leaving you behind, alone with nothing but darkness to fill the chasm created by this loss."
Perceptual manipulations are both friend and foe in this foul world of hatred and sin.

And the world shall tremble to the sound of his hooves drawing nearer and nearer.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
To the grave and back again.
I am my brother's keeper.
The machinations of malevolance are driven by the infinite screw of greed.
"In this perpetual process of dying called life, the countdown continues."
Music saves.
I'm the first to admit that I'm a very bad person.  The truth is indeed liberating.
"A wish for wings that work, to carry me into the sun."
"Pick yourselves up brothers &amp; sisters, the fight has only just begun."
Years ago hearing that same loud knock on the back door and seeing that same grinning face meant an entirely different encounter.  I was down but now Im back up. She made sure.
As positive as it gets around here.
You've been sinking and drowning for far too long. The time has come. The time to fight your way back to the surface.
"If you've been looking for a sign, this isn't it."
"Take me away, take me far away from this place."
I don't forgive. I don't forget.
A vendetta feeds the fire.
"All things will come to an end, in due time."
Your existence is a burden to your loved ones.
Pray for obliteration of the scourge that we've become.
"Into the abyss, cold embrace."
This hellscape is what we have created.
She will be reaching for a dead mans hand.
Go see for yourself.
The darkest days have yet to be seen.
Devour because that's all you know.
This is my final form.
As a child I often dreamt of death.
We will never learn.
S T R O L L I N G
Unfamiliar faces in unfamiliar places.
But I will.
No one is coming to save you. No one gives a fuck about anyone other then themselves.  The sooner you accept this and learn to live isolated from the other rats the sooner you can be forgotten and finally go home.
"Man, I just wanna go home ffs."
I find existential comfort in graveyards. Knowing that an end to the nightmare exists quiets my inner storm.
"People are amazing. Loyalty and Respect comes natural to them.  You should trust people, always."
"You may randomly think ""oh my, what a wonderful gift this life is. Why must I, of all people, be so lucky?"" Well, I can assure you,  it only gets better from this point on.  The gift of life never stops giving. What a beautiful time to be alive."
For someone who's not on my profile every hour of everyday that was rather fast. 😆
"Hey! post up that heavily filtered montage of your horrid mug so we can all laugh! Dumb fucking bitch. Keep poping them 0.5mg Xanax your mom dispenses, acting like you hood. 😆"
"I used to be a fraud expert and printed fake govt cheques for 4k$ and more. Those cards were fake just like your face, keep subtweeting me I dont give a fuck. Youre nothing but a fucking clown with odd looking tits half of Twitter had seen, whore."
I am the son of the devil and I've come to free mankind from this violent masquerade.
"Have no fear, the devil draws near."
Love could very well save us but hatred will set us free.
I will make things right.
Humanity is expendable.
"2 of the 3 of you are in the USA, since Im an ex-felon as you've said yourself I cant personally deal with yo. But truth be told, I never lose. I never have and I never will. Youd be amazed what drugs addicts would do for 100$.."
"If I could I'd lean in and hold her close, then I'd whisper into her ear that the world is cold and dead but not to me because she exists and makes everyday worth any amount of suffering just as long as I can hear the soothing tone of her voice, if only for a short moment."
I'm very passionate about hatred.
👀
You're probably mediocre.
The only way out is down.
Remember.
"Amidst the neverending pursuit to satiate the hollow it is imperative to remember that ultimately your life amounts to nothing and that everything and everyone you've ever loved will crumble into dust and be forgotten, forever."
I am wolf.
Perhaps the meaning of life is to serve as sustenance to something malevolant and far darker then we could ever imagine. Something unknown that watches from the shadows and ceaselessly feeds on our suffering.
"This world has failed us so we retreated into the forests, with wish to start again."
"The poison runs through our veins, we are the cursed.  Don't you see?"
"Devil take my eyes, I no longer wish to see.  Oblivion take me, I no longer wish to be."
The light has long since departed from their eyes.
Nothing left for us or anyone at all.
la lune est absolument magnifique ce soir mais elle n'est rien a comparé de ton visage qui s'illumine lorseque tu me sourit.
"Il n'ya rien ici pour les nôtres, sauf de la souffrance incéssante."
"In violence we trust, until this world crumbles into dust."
Oh how I crave release from this filth we call existence.
"Until the eternal embrace of the cold, loveless void do us part."
These words don't mean a thing.
"Her words, my world."
*runs you over*
The only father I honor on this day is Lucifer.
"Happy Father's day, whore."
"Eventually, our shadow fades to nothing."
It's called 'the gift of life' because it leads us unto death.
"Eventually, we finally die."

Your kind could never fathom the things that we do to feed the behemoth of absolute darkness.
"Forever united by the blackness of our wretched souls and left standing defiantly amidst the remnants, watching the crimson sky rain red.. We are timeless, We are eternal."
"I want to show you the madness that resides with my cracked psyche, but you keep looking away whenever I open the cage..."
"I cannot be saved, nor do I want to."
I reside within the darkness dwelling.
What a cold and lonely world we live in.
Words are insufficient. Actions however will accurately reveal your worthlessness in their eyes.
The visions of lies have poisoned our minds.
They enjoy watching us suffer.
We were all wrecked from the start.
This disgraceful life takes its toll.
Unrelenting agony and despair pave the way to hell.
"Time keeps forever slipping away, like sand falling though my fingers."
"Endlessly searching for her soothing presence, in everything and everyone."
Nothing can save us from the pain.
"Awake, I stare into darkness."
"Existence is a meaningless piece of shit that inevitably leads to suffering and decrepitude but atleast the sun is shining bright and today is going to be a beautiful fucking day. (Void of meaning, but beautiful nonetheless)"
"I am, therefore, worthless."
"Everything we do, seems predestined to be devoid of meaning."
"""The greater the thirst for life is for some souls, the more solitude swallows them""  ~Emil Cioran"
"""The flowers that are not picked by pale hands have bloomed for nothing.""  ~Emil Cioran"
Doomed to a future in which we yearn for death.
"Don't forget to Live, Love, Leave your worthless opinion under tweets thinking we give a shit what you could possibly think."
"Facedown, lifelessly solaced."
"Loneliness like cancer, gnaws without end.  Until there's nothing left."
Lets see them try to stop us now.
"I, the Dreamer, forever cursed to awaken from slumber unto this nightmare world.. Oblivion, deliver me."
I am everything you hate.
"Promise me, that you will remember."
"My eyes weep not, yet I am drowning in tears."
Hopelessness and nothingness.
Such things mean nothing to me.
I am the Superuser.
Malevolant machinations of the autodidacte technosentient.
"Slowly one by one, forever forgotten."
"The maelstrom rages on, devouring everything in it's path."
"I was waiting in line earlier and the couple in front of me bought 2x rounded dirt shovels and I thought ""This is goals."""
"Antinatalism is the condiment of philosophies.  You add it to an existing meal, you dont just eat that... unless you're broke asf."

You probably think I'm unhappy in my life.
On apprends très jeune a se méfié des autres.
We are all Voidposters.
We are the faithless ones.
"Cancer, probably."
Humanity disgusts me.
Incessantly pondering a means to swiftly vacate this wretched existence.
Isn't she absolutely perfect? She's just the way the devil intended.
You can never control the darkness.
"Come along my friends, the void is calling our names."
"If alcohol bad, why good?"
"""Forever or nothing"" is also a love language."
"Every where shadows fall, you will find us."
I'll show you coldness.
"Algorithms ceaselessly compute, herding humanity through the unstoppable process of termination."
Why do we hopefully look to the futur when all that lies therein is desolation and death?
"No longer, do we find comfort in your false prophecies."
"Nature reclaims all, in time."
"Obliterate the shrine and instead raise the Obelisk, dedicated to those from beyond the trees."
"One day I'll take you to the timeless place, deep within the forest where our names are forever etched in the heart of the wood."
Darkness may fade but it will never leave.
"Sometimes I wish that you could be me, so you could see how beautiful you are."
"I thought it was over ""something""... 🤔 😄"
"I've been off drugs for about 2 months now. That's why I clearly see arrogant pieces of shit from a mile away. However, I'd love to further discuss this face to face.  hmu."
"I'd sit here for hours on end staring at the moon, just thinking about her."
"Suffering can never be eradicated, it can only be alleviated."
Manufactured terror keeps them in line.
Maybe the reason you can't find love is because you're unloveable.
I hope life humbles you.
"There is no rock bottom, only an infinite downwards spiral."
The feeling of sheer loneliness is enough to drive anyone beyond the boundaries of sanity.
"So much wasted time in our fleeting, ephemeral existences."
Nothing could ever turn this wolf against his pack.
We don't know what it is but we're all looking for something.
Spend a little time with your tweets.
Some people on this app seem to think after zero Respect shown ever they can step in and invalidate whatever post with their worthless fucking opinion. Don't be surprised you get put in your place when that happens. Arrogant assholes annoy me. Just be glad we're not face to face.
Normalize putting people in their fucking place.
"When I was face down in dirt, suffocating on absolute darkness without hope, a familiar hand reached in.  I've been holding on tightly ever since."
The updated definition of eternity is a single day without her.
"Spending time and telling you about me, while you lay in your grave."
I'm on a broken road.
Revel in the un-life that we lead.
"oh great, another day."
"Who wouldve thought calling arrogant assholes out on their bullshit replies would be ""unappreciated.""  Must be an ego thing."
"Hark, the calling of crows."
The darkness consumes us.
Mankind inherently bears the darkness of death.
I weep as I walk through the gloomy streets.
"Ruin upon ruin , humanity was doomed from the start."

Holy fuck this is deep.
Depends on what Im doing or not doing.
Some times I tweet stuff and then sometimes not.
"If you saw me irl you could never know its me. No apparent darkness, no scars and no tears.  Unless ofcourse you looked into my eyes."
"Time will take your pride, away."
"Make no mistake about us, we are the children of darkness."
"Because she exists, a heart now beats where a void used to be."
The hatred only builds and builds.
We've been holding back the tears since forever.
"Today, I grant you solace.  There's always tomorrow to suffer with insignificance."
Some wounds will never heal.
"In the dead of the night, I never felt more alive."
Why do we unwaiveringly endure?
Everything shifted that night.

Cleanse them with arson.
Beyond this hellscape world lies another.
No remorse for the creatures of the earth.

The beast rears it's ugly head.
"The signs were heavily obfuscated, evidently."
Take a look and recoil in disgust at this world.
I hate these dead streets. They will never let me leave.
Retreat to the forests.

We're all obsidian souls dreaming of an obsidian sun.
We never asked to be part of this world.
Sad to say that no amount of A/C is sufficient to melt away the suffocating existential dread that follows us around like a black cloud.
Your life is such a mistake.
"No matter how the world changes, suffering has been and always will be inherent to humankind."
I know you see the hate in my soul.
Follow my voice. I swear I’ll get you out alive.
Who would forgive this world?
You better learn to stand your ground because you're not going anywhere.
We were all meant for so much more than this.
My favorite thing about people is when they finally leave.
Be the reason people show Respect and pay back money they borrow on time.
The sky opens up for the apocalypse.
You won't get in my head.
"Social media mirrors the weak nature of humanity each and everyday. Rare are those who seek to elevate their game, they think we dont see the same old tired ass tweets from years ago still being reposted. The same eroded quotes from Goodreads or one liners from memes or reworded."
When human intellect eventually spawns the vocabulary needed to fill in the gaps I'll have such anecdotes &amp; stories to tell you. Until then I only hope that you read between the lines and remember the base lessons.

Stop blaming everything and everyone for the state of decrepitude that defines your existence and the way you lead your life.
"Remember, death."
Red &amp; White forever. Even the company shirts.
We willingly walk among the damned.
We will all rot the same.
"They emerge from beneath, the messengers of darkness; bearing his words and sigils. This world is ours."
I've chosen not to follow your ways.
Ultimately your life amounts to nothing.
Have you no shame?
Soulmates and true love do exist. Most people are just too pathetic and weak to pursue and maintain such things. Effortless existence begets nothing of value. This is why I often say that most people are nothing but worthless pieces of shit. Because I know.
Can confirm.

Are you normal or are you happy?
How many of us awaken and immediately turn to this website to bathe in the insatiable suffering and existential emptiness behind it.
Seeing the brother who put me on the map years ago and receiving that level of love and respect is in itself one of the most important life lessons.  Respect is everything.
Apparently evil does sleep; for days at a time when the miracle man runs out.
A place in the woods where time stands still.
Collabo with @Voisistere
I will stop at nothing.
They say that the most dangerous man is he who has nothing to lose.  Have you ever seen the fury of a man who is motivated into retaliation by love? The vindictive anger of this man is what I truly fear.   I am this man.
"Her distance is darkness. Its a good thing that Ive been using my heart amd gut since the beginning. What good are eyes, for affaires of the heart and soul?"
We often blame miscommunication. What if words were simply insufficient and the communication needed to fully express the things within had been lost in time.  What if we were doomed from the start and had been fighting against the void between us..  I wont ever stop fighting.
I could blacken entire notebooks with things I love about you. Things Ive been seeking all my life and that I could never find again.
I use Arch btw. (for now.. until I reinstall Gentoo)
Just a little while longer.
Debatable.
One love to @iSlangAIR who's probably reading this but can't reply because he's in Twitter segregation for a week.  Real recognize real.  So here we are.
"Say what you want about me, but say it to my face."
"In my circle women like her are worshipped.  Truth be told, they're usually the true wolves and we, the lesser evil. Its an honor to lay your life down for the matriachs in my world."
I expect violence everyday. When it doesn't conclude I've come to be rather pleased and content. No wonder that I flee to her at every possible opportunity.  Love is the remedy in this crazy world.
Accelerationism has more appeal to me now than classic pessimism.

Even extreme pessimism is watered down for our weak minds.
Make me forget.
I often wonder if she's looking with disappointment through shadows at the way I lead my life and the choices I make. I wonder if she knows the way everything was shattered when she stepped out.  Its probably best I never know.
Perhaps to love and be loved is the purpose of our lives.
"Of everything that once was, nothing now remains."

Yesterday is a good day to die.
Rotted existence awaits.
"Like father, Like son."
Child of waste.
I'll show you malevolant fucking darkness.
We're so scared of returning. Back to the void.
There is nothing after death.
The door to the other world is open.
You'll never be one of us.
Humanity doesn't deserve shit besides a shallow unmarked grave.
There is no sunshine where we go to thrive.
"In the maelstrom of eternal morte, I willingly drown."
Pathetic fucking replicas. You may fool the unknowing but I see  you rather clearly for the unintelligent pieces of shit you really are.
"In the mirrors you see their faces, don't you?"
You scream into the void whilst I vomit virulent hatred and malevolant blackness with intentions to infect.  We're not the same.
Solace begotten through prompt sentient obliteration.
Expectation is weakness. We should have the courage to stand on our own severed from other humans. Thus shielding us from their doings/undoings. Yet our pathetic nature leads us down the same path over &amp; over again. In the end we're only setting ourselves up for disappointment.
"'Fuck life, it's shit anyways.'"
"Oblivion, take me. Take me home to the realm of all darkness, sorrow and eternal death."
You probably give more than you get.
This is the time when we all pretend everything's fine.
Who needs teeth anyways.

Humanity is literal filth.
Don't ask. Don't tell.
It's usually about money or ego.  Either way it usually concludes in bloodshed.  But not today.
Helth.
"Ignorantly, we follow."
Bask in the void of the composer.
The hivemind has morphed. Behold the gravemind now bestows our damnable fate.
"The gaping chasm is fed with bodies, hell cries out for more."
"Lately, I've been thinking about going home."
"Exposed to the horror, I smile."
Broken and empty roads are paved with regrets.
Did they ever do anything for us without the promise of something in return?
So far up north these places have Indian names. 😄
750km round trip today.
Awakened from my dreams I see a world on fire.
Your best days are long gone.
"Ceaselessly it beckons, unseen from within malevolant shadows.  Death."
We might be broken but we won't fall down.
The shadows are closing in. We are stuck in the silence.
Why do I follow the moon?
What is the worth of my words? When my words don't mean shit.
"There is absolutely nothing I need from anyone , except her love."
My final moment upon this wretched earth will no doubt be marked by the realization that I never really lived.
"The more I think about life, the less I want to partake in either."
Disappointment will never disappoint.
Pessimists who lead by example should be worshipped.
You can't succeed if you don't try.
It's important to remember that earth is not our home.  We're merely passing through.
How can someone die when he never existed?
"At home, in the street."
No one will ever shed a tear.
We are burdened with existence.
Everything we do is in vain.
Nihilist Earth was one of my Facebook meme pages. I made 2 memes with the tag. This is one of them.
Foot soldier.
Ive said it time and time again but retards on here will have huge follower counts while the realest and most well written profiles receive way less. Its a fucking shame but also an indictator as far as global intelligence across social media.

"You spend your life struggling to survive, I spend my life wasting away. We're not the same."
Crazy is underrated as fuck.
The voids between us are flooded with cascading emotions spilling into an ocean of eternal hope.
"I never showed anyone my world entirely until I met her. I thought she would turn away and recoil from me but no. She stood by me even during moments when I was below ground. For people with my values this means so much, I dont even have the words.  I hope you find yours too."
Circle of cowards.
At the epicenter of the void lies an even greater and much more malevolant darkness.
I overthink therefor I overtweet.
Your quest for meaning and significance is quite entertaining for those that know and watch you struggle from afar. Similar to the circus clown your act distracts many from their own problems.
We are the lost souls condemned to walk this earth in search of things we could never comprehend.
This world is the cradle of all despair and misfortune.
humble asf too for a titan.
Holy shit what the fuck..
You're not replaceable.
I was saying earlier how my bro was a psychopath. So he just stopped Oceano and put on Céline Dion if you needed further proof. 😄
This.
😝
The devil knows all your secrets.
The society of consumerism in which we exist is to blame for the state of decrepitude in human relationships. True love does exist. You're just not patient and invested enough to find and nurture it. To bring it from seedling to full bloom until your departure from this realm.
For her I would willingly walk through the flames over and over again.
"All we see is darkness, but she's firmly holding my hand.  Fear is non-existant."
Stop saying 'humans are just numbers.' Numbers have an actual value.
Reality is one of the most depressing sources of pessimism right now.
Don't give up on your dreams. Keep sleeping.
The only certitude we have in this nightmarish existence is that one day this fruitless pursuit for meaning will come to an end. Everything will cease.  The torment and suffering will be brought to a complete and perpetual halt as nothingness washes over the world again.
We are just mindless slaves to the sinister algorithms.
"If you can't reason with them, you can always knock em out."
Everyone has left you here. Discarded and Deluded.
Any meaning you give your life is meaningless.
Are you prepared to burn?
Until the sleeper awakens.
"while moments of joy are few and fleeting, despair is consistent and eternal."
My worthless name in the local obituary will be the ultimate void post.
stop asking 'wyd'  I am filling the void.
I'm not a 'sad piece of shit' it's called depressive realism. Look it up.
who called it life and not 'bottomless abyss of never-ending suffering.'
It will probably get worst.
I want you to know that I will do absolutely everything necessary to conclude. You may forget about me and 20 years will pass.. I wont forget you and the harm done. I wont ever forget. I will conclude what you started. I hope it was worth it.

I watched him closely and learned. I am her pitbull now.
The thing with pitbulls is they watch over you. If you know how to train them properly you'll have the best bodyguard and best friend imaginable.  Ive never seen such a deeply loving and loyal creature on the face of this wretched earth.
I'll honor every word I said.
We were indeed eternal.
Ill always remember the aftermath of that dream.
Annihilate the dream. Rebuild.
I see the world through cold eyes.
I never thought I'd see a wingless angel.
You will hate yourself until the day you die.

"If humanity really wanted to rectify the current state of decrepitude in which it bathes, it would teach compassion and understanding. It would get its lazy ass off internet, go outside and make an actual change in society.  But where's the fun in that?"

Are we having fun yet?
"I hate so many things about myself &amp; my life. My list of regrets is insane. One thing I absolutely love about myself is the incredible patience and malevolance when acquiring revenge. Im so vindictive that I often wonder wtf is wrong with me. But I smile. Keep subtweeting, whore."
"Some people on this website/app would like to make us believe they have such interesting lives. If such is the case , why are they wasting away with the rest of us in cyber reality instead of enjoying their near perfect existence?"
"We don't deserve the solace that comes with death.  What humanity really deserves is eternal suffering and subsequent  terror , until our minds implode."
"When our loved ones pass we should rejoice. For several reasons , the main one being that they no longer look down in shame upon our disgusting existence(s)."
The most significant thing we can do as humans is sever ourselves from this hell and willingly return to the bliss of nothingness.

Hell is what you see right now.
Absolutely beautiful. Just fucking beautiful.
Nights like these...
"Dear Infosec Twitter , I piss in your general direction."
You make me fucking sick.
"You probably think that I don't see you. Oh, I see you, worthless piece of shit.  I see right through you."
We are not worthy. Our destiny is one of ceaseless suffering.
Purge the world of hope.
"I am he, who dwells in shadows."
"Everything in this life is temporary, only coldness lasts forever."

Beset by your absence I've been living my life in reverse ever since.
Cast into oblivion we emerged bearing the mark of the void.
Cursed to waste time until we are dust.
She's so precious when she laughs.
The veil of oblivion cries my name.
Under the moonlight I yield.
My mirror no longer reflects.
Maybe home is a pine box beneath ground.
Bear witness to mankind's demise.
The voice inside my head is not my own.
We would thrive under a blackened sky.
Now the martyrs of time are safe in their tombs.
I only wish to vomit my virulent hatred upon this wretched world and it's worthless inhabitants.
The shadows reclaim this world.
Condemned as children.

Twitter class reunion in the grave.
I don't think words can express your beauty.
We think we are in control. We can't even save ourselves.
You give me every reason to breathe.
Life is worth nothing.
Our headspaces filled with thoughts of infinite night.
We returned bearing the mark of the void. Our suffering now serves as it's sustenance.
In her eyes I see no fear.
You are the devil. Look.
"All hope is lost, the beast tempts from within."
"Raven of darkness, send us into a bottomless abyss."
Eternal fucking hatred for rats &amp; snakes.
Do you even know who you really are?
The old me has been visiting more often. I hope you know what that means.
Your life is a lie.
What ever happened to those threats?
Together we will topple any obstacles.

I can hear their voices.
Humanity is a dying breed.

"Oblivion take me, take me home."
Come save me from myself again.
I'll never know why all things beautiful must reach an end.
You dont fucking know.
Take a moment to remember the place.
The burden is my own.
Fade back amidst the shifting shadows.
From my cold dead hands.
Worship annihilation.
"Silence mortal, I am the devil."
All existence shall be void.
We now know we’ll never be saved.
"Misery will rise, and desolation eternally prevails."
Your sorrow is forevеr.

My blackened soul never belonged to this life.

"Bound to a lifeless future , we are the chosen."
"We children of malevolance , bring forth a new dawn of darkness."

And if I leave a note who really gives a fuck?
I tried to fill this void but you are my everything.
Why must I feel one with this sickness?
The blackest thoughts they always call.
My demons are calling.
I know we've never met and you'll probably never read this.
I'd sever the stars from the sky and place them in your hands.
When you read this I will not be the same.
And silent darkness.
One simple wish now dies.
"You will all witness, all that I've become."
The time has come to face the end.
"I'll wait here for you, just for you to realize what you have done."
We will remain as one.
I pray for the worst so that we all may go home.
Inhale dirt.
Watch me fade to nothingness.
The tree of life bears rotten fruit.
All my friends are dead.
"You are not like me, you are just like them."
Guided by the moon.
Leave me behind.
A dead flower at an unmarked grave.
By my grave I saw you weep.
Nothing is built to last.
I wish we could forget we're mistakes.
Pitbull smiles.
Our hearts will fill the abyss.
"There's no light, only darkness."
Drowning in woe.
Hadn't hung out with these two in 2 years. Crazy is an understatement.
No gods. No masters.
"She , Zenith. I am the obelisk."
You're in love with a speechless siren.
All your life is a fucking disgrace.
Close your eyes.
We are eternal.
The Maelstrom consumes us.
Darkness comes early down here.
It was Murmur who cursed this place.
"Evil lingers , where ever we set foot."
The ceaseless ebb &amp; flow of time gnawing at your being.
"Shattered, the fragments of my life lay scattered."

This whore digs her own grave.
All the things you'll never be.

No one will shed a tear.
Soon this world shall crumble beneath its own foundation.
There is no god to pray to for deliverance.
We have no sympathy.
The whispers of doom.
"In the dark, they have no name."
There will be no end to your suffering.
What you call fear is but a shadow of its truest form.
I am the host of Satan.
Abhorrent and soulless. When will you learn your fucking lesson?
I have become one with the damned.
The cycle never ends.
I hope you enjoy living in my shadow.

How did we get so empty?

As night falls my thoughts begin to darken.
The eye of Lucifer is upon us all.
Life becomes a dilemma when you are living a purposeless and goalless life.
All paths lead to oblivion.
We now stand before the flames.
Your life is a hollow excuse for existence.
You look to the heavens for answers but true guidance lies buried in the soil beneath your feet.
Shoutout to the voices in my head.
"All is cold, cold is all."
...and back again.
heavy is the nod that ventures unto the edge of oblivion and back again.
OPEN YOUR EYES.
We are the children of the void.

I am void of life.
I am the man I fear.
