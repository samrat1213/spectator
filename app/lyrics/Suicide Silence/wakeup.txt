Wake up, wake up
This is no hallucination
This is what we have become
This is what dreams are made of

Go look in the mirror

Wake up, wake up
This is no hallucination 

Do we still exist?
I can't see my face
Or are we just not here?
I can't see my face

Wake up, wake up
This is no hallucination
This is what we have become
This is now what dreams are made of

Wake up, wake up 

Come on, come on you've got to wake the fuck up

Wake up, wake up
This is more than you bargained for
It took so long so you ate some more
You did too much man, you did too much!

Wake up, wake up
