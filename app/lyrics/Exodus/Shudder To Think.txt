You hit rock bottom, now where do you go from here?
Sunk-down, locked-up; all you do is disappear
All your promises are all just a pack of lies
You've got nothing; something you can't recognise

Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew

I can't take any more excuses
No longer needed and you don't have any uses
Washed up, washed out, what more can I say?
You"d better start filling out your resume

Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew

Everything was there for the taking
Too busy with the lying and faking
Drugged up, fell out, too many second chances
Nothing else to do under the circumstances

Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew
Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knewEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
