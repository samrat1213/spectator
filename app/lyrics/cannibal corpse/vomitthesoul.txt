Grotesque, crippled, carved up carcass
Evil controlling my mind,
The fear of dying expired of life,
To vomit the soul I am dead within my self

The end a beginning to a new life in hell
I am your path to ever-lasting pain
Mass extinction of the human population
Son of the devil the evil incarnation
Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals,
The child born unto evil,
Trapped within the statue of flesh
Vipers travel through bodily orifices, 

Blessed by the devil
Under inverted crosses,
Religious ways,
Lies controlling minds

I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves I search for decay
Packs of flesh driven zombies ready to feast
I suffer forever living only to dismember

Open season on humans,
Laughing I watch them die,
They bleed so easily
Their blood flows through my body,
I need to taste the flesh
Exposing pulsing arteries
Removing vital organs
Not stopping till you've died

Pus from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore
Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts

Constricted corpuscles coagulating
Blood my drug a slave to its taste,
Reincarnated to human form,
Creating a race of immortal beings,
Rot away
Dead bodies, set a flame
Searing flesh, broken necks
You can't kill what's already dead

De-evolution, hunting for life
Cannibalism, immortality
Rip and slash, a society of mass murder
Bleeding slow

I take away your life,
And leave you lying cold,
Decapitated body
Searching for its head

Anticipate apocalypse,
Rising dead dismembering
Hacking limbs
Bleeding,
Cracking ribs
Torture us

Blessed by the devil,
Under inverted crosses
Religious ways,
Lies controlling minds

I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves
Desolate
Empty hollow corpse,
Desecrate
Forced to eat your flesh
Extracting purity
Violate
Twisted bodies rot away
