Bil Ur-Sag LyricsBil Ur-Sag
You quake the earth
Scorcher of skies
Your Towers of Flames
You've come to Cleanse the treacherous act
You've come to Tame the rebeliousness
Bil Ur-Sag Lul-Lu Nig-Hul Tur
Ha-Elm Zalag
Za-A-Kam Me-Lam-Ma-Bi-Du
Ki-Bal-A Su-Sa
Unmatched Your Principle is unopposed
The Light You hold unmatched is unopposed
You glide across and beneath the lands
Your Affects engulf the rebeliousness
Ur-Sag Zi-Ga-Ni Naphar Ajjabi
Sharush
Sa-Par-Mah-Zu Diri La-Magiru
Sin Su-La
Terror
Your Battle Roar seeds
Terror
No shield can withstand
The Seven Weapons of Flame
The Principal Force that You wield
Captive
The hostile ones are held
Captive
The insubmissive are
Brought to their knees
For they cannot counter
Your massive assault upon them
The ill-natured
You've Burned from our land
Hostile gatherings You've Tamed
You were unmatched
No counter could be found
With Fury and Flames
You Scorched their aggressiveness
Bil Ur-Sag Lul-Lu Nig-Hul Tur
Ha-Elm Zalag
Za-A-Kam Me-Lam-Ma-Bi-Du
Ki-Bal-A Su-Sa
(Translation:)

Treacherous and the ill-natured. Purifying them

O lion-heads, with Your most awesome Rising power
Destroyer of the gathering of the enemy gods

Your Great Net, being so enourmous swallowed the disobedient ones, binding
There handsEmbed
