Behold!
The blade is nice and dull from the millions of heads, from the millions that we left for dead
Bluntly disassembled and painfully dissected
With an instrument of gore, bisected heads like rose pedals litter the floor
Clinically insane -- serotonin flooding the brain
A sudden charge of epinephrine leaves my victims writhing in pain
In ecstasy I continue to maim -- no one around me shall remain the same
I can take off their scalp, watch the cranium palpitate, bleeding and throw them away

I decide your fate
I say you're too late
With the Judgment Stick of hate
I decapitate

With this axe... I behead.
With this knowledge I've obtained of the human race
I leave you dead...

I've stared in the eyes of my helpless casualties
I've yet to experience any kind of "human" remorse...

I stand on the harvest floor
The place where death shows its face
and extinguishes all of the human race...

Behold!
A blade to crush the skull, the ribcage, break every bone and destroy every membrane
Smite the people with vengeance and bring damnation upon their descendants
Bluntly disassembled and painfully dissected with an assemblage of gore, bisected heads, appendages, intestines and more!
Clinically deranged -- norepinephrine driving me insane
A sudden charge of adrenaline leaves my victims writhing in pain
In ecstasy I continue to maim -- everyone now just a pawn in my game
I can remove their faces now displaced in ways that you never thought could happen again

Like the murders of yore
Dearly departed and discarded gore
Forever living in my mind
In axetasy -- the only peace I can find...

I decide your fate
I say you're too late
With the Judgment Stick of hate
I decapitate

With this axe... I behead
With this knowledge I've obtained of the human race
I leave you dead...

I've stared in the eyes of my helpless casualties
I've yet to experience any kind of "human" remorse...

I stand on the harvest floor
The place where death shows its face
And extinguishes all of the human race...

In axetasy its fight or flight
Euphoria in slice and dice
No better way to spend my nights
In axetasy I end your life
