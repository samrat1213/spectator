Rumanian dictator, emperor for life
Lived a life of luxury shared only by his wife
Growing fat like pigs, eating meals fit for a king
Accumulating assets like none you've ever seen
Now the table's turned, they were stripped of all they owned
The revolution's cast the dictator from the throne
With their execution, so ends the tyranny
Two bullets from a rifle set the people free

Fighting for their rights
They toppled the regime
Pillage all their riches
Left them not a thing
Now they know the feeling
To reap the seeds they've sewn
Banished from the living
When they were overthrown
How did they feed the enormous greed
It took to satisfy their needs?
They drained the country dry
As thousands had to die
But now the monarchy is nullfied!

The changing of the guard
They no longer deal the cards
The world demands democracy
It's the dawning of a time
When the system's redefined
Oppression's now a distant memory
Communism yields to the might the people wield
For a democratic form of government
For their blatant disregard
They have suffered long and hard
It's time for a changing of the guard!
No longer will they rule the land by genocide
The traces of their empire have all been liquefied
Political reform has gotten underway
Now they're free to speak, before they'd only pray
Freedom is contagious, it's spreading far and wide
The Berlin Wall has fallen, there's no need to divide
They walk across a border where many tried and failed
Others died but not in vain, the people have prevailed

Fighting for their rights
They toppled the regime
Pillaged all their riches
Left them not o thing
Now they know the feeling
To reap the seeds they've sewn
Banished from the living
When they were overthrown
How did they feed the enormous greed
It took to satisfy their needs?
They drained the country dry
As thousands had to die
But now the monarchy is nullified!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
