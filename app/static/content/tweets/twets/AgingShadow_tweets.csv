You are my delusion of all delusions.
The hour glass figure and the diminishing returns of sand.
"I am not lost, the way you are lost, I know where my skeletons hide."
Nestled  in your rose garden are the dubious intentions of stone dragons and aging shadows
"We are falling, and no one can remember  what we were reaching for."
The great desolation is but a teaspoon of sound.
Preach to the birds there only serpents in this garden.
You demand the delusions of fidelity by offering nothing but words.
"No angel, some dreams are but serpents posing as sunlight."

Just an old ghost impersonating an aging man.
Tell me all of your dark secrets     as I'm stripping off your decorum
We are awake together and separated only by life.
All hunger begins with a single thought.   -Decadence-
"Who spread your long ringlets like ocean waves across your pillow, and rode your body into the darkest wreckage of broken dreams?"
"Lay back, close your eyes, allow me to anoint your body  with my ravenous hunger."
"How can we believe there is no one else for us, when the oceans are deep, and the universe keeps expanding."
"Oh, yes, we can hold every dark secret we bear, while living and breathing beneath the sunlight."
"Because on this earth, all we have is each other, and every emotion and desire, is trapped, in a hot, humid cage of time and mortality.   -Defiling-"

"Slip out of your wavering decorum, and ruin me with all of your melancholy."
Because you chose poetics over truth and embers over fire...
Arrange your demons accordingly.
"The years dragged through a barbwire; while your scent ignited wildfires inside of my blood. We called it 'love', but a hoax had been perpetrated upon our willingness to delude the Sun god."
Because we adapt our delusions to fit the mirage.  -Love-
I want to slip your panties off while you moan about your fate.
