What have we done
Destroying every acre of our gift
One by one

Furthest from grace
There is no hand reaching down
It was never there because
A god would never stand
For such a fucking disgrace

Carry the carcasses over the plains
To the mountains
Where we try to burn away the pain
In a massive grave
The solution is to hide the mistakes
But the problem remains ingrained

Let the necks of the bodies fall
And let our poor mothers cry
Don't mutter any pointless prayers
We don't deserve to repent
We deserve to die alone

The dead cry out, naked and cold
Disconnected from the earth
We all die
We all die alone

Betrayed and broken
Universally flawed
Hopelessly sinking
Into the frozen thaw

Empty creations rooted out from under our feet
We engorge on our failures, we toast to our defeat
Of all that we've made
We'd throw it all away
Together we decay

Oh humanity what a shameful existence
If the world would stop spinning I don't think I'd miss it

The dead cry out naked and cold
Disconnected from the earth
We all die
We all die alone

Betrayed and broken
Universally flawed
Hopelessly sinking
Into the frozen thaw

Shallow existence
We're only living cause we can't seem to leave

The hunger of power is the demon of man
He awaits in the dark to be fed by our hand
And the souls of our children won't quench the taste
We will all die together with our heads on the plate

Oh humanity what a shameful existence
If the world would stop spinning I don't think I'd miss it

We don't deserve to be safe
We've earned the flames
Engulf my shell
And let the embers sail into space

Let the necks of the bodies fall
And let our poor mothers cry
Don't mutter any pointless prayers
We don't deserve to repent
We deserve to die alone
We all die
We all die alone
