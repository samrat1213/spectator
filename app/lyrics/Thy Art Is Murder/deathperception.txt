Bring forth the lamb of the sacrifice
One more heretic to crucify
Stained with the blood, the mark of the three
The chaos in man, no longer free

In the fire, fuel to the flame, hell inspires
The almighty genesis
And the incarnation of pestilence
No death perception
Eternity's ascension
The icons of deceit
Holy words of the priest

Hammer the nail through the hands of the weak
Impale the foolish on the cross of their king

Blind disciples
Burn your bibles
Blind disciples
Burn your bibles

Hammer the nail through the hands of the weak
Impale the foolish on the cross of their king

Part the heavens
Part the seas
The son of god summoned
The final day of judgment

Bring on destruction
Bring on the revelation

The lions of war
Devour the lamb of the lord
The lions of war
Devour the lamb of the lord
