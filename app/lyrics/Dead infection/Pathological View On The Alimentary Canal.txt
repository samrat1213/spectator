Lets take a look into the abyss of the abdomen
Anatomy of human body fills us with heat
We would love to eat that sodden meat
Enjoy the savour, and devour the delight
Physiology of stomach Is adequats
To our pathological Procedure
Our desire aimed at that
They are stronger than a rotten corpse's mind
Function of tissue is symbiosis for the system
Disembowelement brings a side effect
Let's pull the bowels out, it's quite a long piece
The most important element of the human course
Tearning the element all over
The desire of seeing half-digested broken meat
Naked intestine wriggles like a snake
A worm gets outside-the unexpected element
Fleshy-slimy shell
A new world in the eyes of the worms
Basic instinct is to change a host
A new organism will will soon be infected
Someone else will admire this pathology
Inevitable end of the inner putrefactionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
