"there lie many fighting men, dead in their youthful prime, never to laugh nor love again nor taste the summertime."
maybe i've done enough  finally catching up  for the first time i see an image of my brokenness
"in the silence of the night i lose myself,  it makes me drunken with its sweet blue sound."
you call him a 'war criminal' and 'tyrant' ... i call him 'babygirl'
a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.
if there is a light then i am going to swallow it. if there is a god then i'm going to make him cry.
"YOU FINALLY NEED TO KNOW  HOW TO DECAY GRACEFULLY,  LIE STILL."
"hard not to fall for you, i gave you all my heart"
i keep my own personal terrible holy spirit. it lives in my faint blood  and my whole animal heart.
"i don't wanna, i don't wanna die like this / working nine to five and a ten to six / whoa, what a way to go"
"because freedom, i am told, is nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"there has always been something about the word l-ve that set a pit in my gut, churned and shriveled within me. a word i couldn't set to any romance.   how could i l-ve you?   i adore you, with my whole being, i adore you. you set me ablaze and the fire lights my skies."
"like daphne before me, i belong to neither a man, the gods, nor imítheos. take your steel and leave me to my lyre."
"for the beat and the broken,  for the lost and forsaken.  let us never surrender,  now we rise unto the call."
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
"do you see now? my / tongue, the dagger at your jugular."
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
"everyone sees what you appear to be, few experiences what you really are."
"will you defend yourself? from me, i mean. let's kill something."
"'no homo,' he says again before wrapping the ace bandage once, twice, three times around my busted ankle, the phrase’s purpose now clear to me: a password, an incantation, a get-out-of-jail-free card, for touch."
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"my pulse grew less and less; / pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower."
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
i’m the big shot in your life now  i’m the one who makes sense
"i'm on a one-way train headed far away, but you're still on my mind"
"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."
and when i drift away when i lose my way my body starts to decay
"well, if you told me you were drowning, i would not lend a hand i've seen your face before, my friend"
and love is for the birds when things are complicated
i see ash &amp; i see bone / i see a dead man on his throne
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
"my soul bleeds and the blood steadily, silently, disturbingly slowly, swallows me whole."
let me be your one-man army.
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
"mother tells me our people ran with the wolves, long ago. then the red winter came, and although my people were born to the cold—still—it took them."
something wicked this way comes.
"i lay motionless, and every sound i tried to utter was stifled in the trance that gripped me. the figure sat down on my bed and leered mockingly at me."
"what you interfere with now is bigger than you can imagine. it is written, it is their time to give penance - if you continue you will bring down the heaven's wrath."
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
'cause every time you strip away my pride  humble me down to my knees  you're exactly what i need
'cause i feel like i'm the worst  so i always act like i'm the best
"i promise you, i was here. i felt things that made death so large it was indistinguishable from air—and i went on destroying inside it like wind in a storm."
you tried to change me.
no beast is more savage than man when possessed with power answerable to his own rage.
"essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it not?"
so we fight and die or we submit and die. i know my choice.
"stay, and decay."
"and i just need more time  i know, i know, i'm asking for the moon  but i must listen to intuition  believe me, i only want what's right"
"what i mean is, how do you touch a lover who can’t even say your name?"
this bitter man he is
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
RETURN TO THE SALT AND THE SEA.
"resting on a knife, you heavy souls with all this weight buckling down on you now don't you drown and float away not a good time to lose control"
&amp; i was an excision of bodies:  an open longing  a hollow hearth.
and i can't get myself together  i'm weary all the time
something horrible is happening inside of me and i don't know why.
"only live with what you've done, and try in the future to do what you're happy to live with."
"people think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. what i've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master."
"does eldest daughter syndrome still hold true if i'm not a daughter anymore? if i never really was? what if, and bear with me here, i've always been the eldest son. i was the man when my father wasn't. when he couldn't be."
and again he asks me to kill him. one more time before he falls to his knees and sobs. and i get it. i do.
"take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently. all your dead, unfinished selves and dump them gently"
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just stabbed someone)
"you've got me dreaming foreign words: gravity, ellipsis, perigee, until all i can think about is becoming anchored into orbit around the saltwater-green landscape of your laughter."
"you had this expression on your face, like you weren't quite sure you were supposed to be on earth."
i am not so easily killed as you thought: so firmly am i a part of you.
you are coming down with me  hand in unlovable hand
ALL-THIS-VIOLENCE  MAKES-A-STATEMENT
"we shall give, says father"
how to be human: is love worth it?
'you are a good person. you must believe that.' ‘no. i know what i am.'
i will greet you with a mouth full of barbed wire until you learn to stop coming after me with your hands.
we both know how it goes—i say i want you inside me and you hold my head under water. i say i want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
"they asked, 'do you love her to death?' i said, 'speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.'"
"my eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears. you are my home, do you not understand?"
"if you must wait, wait for them here in my arms as i shake. if you must weep, do it right here in my bed as i sleep."
"never be cruel. never be cowardly. remember, hate is always foolish and love is always wise. always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind."
"let's admit, without apology, what we do to each other. we know who our enemies are. we know."
she folds her hands in her lap with patience and soothes the ache of war in your mind before you even realise she has started speaking.
"i have this dream that i'm hitting my dad with a baseball bat, and he is screaming and crying for help, and maybe halfway through it has more to do with me killing him than it ever did protecting myself."
"forget the body, i still have my name."
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
we became inseparable. like an illness.
something died within a soul  left the eyes to rust  and every time it is recalled  it covers all in dust
"i took the cut, i can take the stitch."
"BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP, HAVE YOU ANY SOUL?  NO, SIR! BY THE WAY, WHAT THE HELL ARE MORALS?"
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"you wonder what it means to know someone, and whether it's possible to do so wholly. you don't think so."
"everything  ceased  and left me, forgotten in the grave of forgotten lilies."
"floodlights: you are center stage, with your fists curled to your sides, and the whole world watching you."
never was anything great achieved without danger.
"he made him wake. he ordered him to eat  my heart. he ate my burning heart. he ate it  submissively, as if afraid as love wept."
"but there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. and though i can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable. i simply am not there."
"don't touch me, i'm full of snakes."
will you fight? or die like a dog?
"there lie many fighting men, dead in their youthful prime, never to laugh nor love again nor taste the summertime."
just fuckin' leave me alone (fuck you)
"my elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
i feel i am destined to observe. never experience.
i know death. he's got many faces. i look forward to seeing this one.
"god, that warm and quiet ghost of his breath—striking at my neck with each inhale and exhale and inhale. i thought i would die right there, in his kitchen."
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear.
"people that can hurt you, the ones that can really hurt you, are the ones that are close enough to do it."
"i stand on the shoulders of his greatness, as they do. as one day, you will."
and i feel life for the very first time love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
these clenched jaws can and will open your yielding throat
kiss the feathers of a hummingbird in flight  breaking up into a million specks of light  take the shape of an angel in the night
"don't do love, don't do friends  i'm only after success"
most will only have one death. i will have two.
'all we ask for is satisfaction.' 'satisfaction?' 'revenge.'
"i gave you devotion, my blood and my life"
soot in my throat grave dirt under my nails this wicked resurrection
'this is the lord's house!' 'no. it's just four walls and a roof.'
i leave you: haloes and clothes.  i leave you violently.  like the wail of an exile.
this ain't where the legends come from you're not what a hero looks like
"something touched me, lightly, like a knife-blade. i felt i was bleeding, though just a little, just a hint. inside i flared hot, then cold. i thought of you."
"never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you."
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke.
hell ain′t the last thing that i'm fighting tonight
"sometimes i wonder what would have happened if it'd kissed the boy at the lake. if i'd told him my name, if i'd told him this body is mine and not mine. then i remember: last i'd seen him on the subway, blonde on his arm, he didn't recognize me. a man meets eyes with a stranger."
"'cause it's an animal city it's a cannibal world so be obedient, don't argue some are ready to bite you"
"wealth, in his experience, was not something the people who had it were at all keen to see trickling anywhere."
"sometimes, it feels like a weapon. anger is funny like that. carry and conceal. the laws get blurry when your only ammunition is the feeling in your chest."
why do you weep? did you think i was immortal?
find what you love and let it kill you.
you broke my body in and i broke your body in you turned me onto sin will you make me whole again?
i'm no longer their savior. i'm their judas.
"IF I GUT YOU AND LEAVE YOUR BODY IN THE WOODS WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND IT, DID IT REALLY HAPPEN?"
i prayed that god might return you to me.
between killing and dying there's a third way: live
"my own mother called me a monster ... she was right, of course, but it still hurt!"
there is nothing straight about you; no motive that hasn’t another behind it; no statement that hasn’t three meanings.
'always in my heart.'  'and you...and you in mine.'
"i've had so many knives stuck into me, when they hand me a flower i can't quite make out what it is. it takes time."
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
"MEMENTO MORI. remember, you will die."
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
"if you’re raised with an angry man in your house, there will always be an angry man in your house. you will find him even when he is not there. and if one day you find that there is no angry man in your house—well, you will go find one and invite him in."
an autumn whisper between the maples kept urging: die with me.
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"i always knew that you would hurt me to death some day, but i hoped to choose the time and place."
"me, inhaling / the tears of the kneeling angel."
"oh, look at all the lonely people"
"THE COGS OF THE WORLD DON'T STOP TURNING FOR ONE GIRL, CHILD. YOU'VE BEEN FED IDEALISM TO KEEP YOU COMPLACENT, DISTRACTED. TAKE THE MACHINE INTO YOUR OWN HANDS AND BREAK THE ENGINE."
"i used to think i understood cain &amp; abel. that my only option to win, was to beat my brother to the ground. my name is not cain, nor is his abel. and someday it will be him and me against the world."
mother didn't have children. mother had creatures.
burn me? that's your answer... burn anything you're afraid of. burn anything you can't control.
"don't fall for monsters,"
"they will want you to succeed, but never more than them. they will write their names on your leash and call you necessary, call you urgent."
'you think my convictions are for sale?'  'why not?' came the cold response.
what is a home if not the first place you learn to run from?
"'oh, death,' someone would pray, / 'could you wait to call me another day?'"
"the dawn eats / its own faith,"
i wish i was the monster you think i am. i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you. i would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
"if i had at that moment a sense of calm kindly death while my heart beat and my lungs expanded, he might know a similar sense of life in the middle of his ongoing death."
"when i decide to kill you, i'll do it with my hands; fine gloves worth the death of a gentleman"
"delicate are you, and your vows are delicate, too, so easily do they break."
"he wants to say, 'i'm sick. in my head. i can't make it stop. sorry for everything i've done &amp; haven't done yet, but will, because i fuck everything up. i will never be happy,’ but the words hang like a noose around his throat, and if he says them, he thinks they'll tighten."
KNOCK 'EM. IN THE. TEETH. NOW.
"now, i grow wings  and rage.  i learn  how to kill."
"'promise you'll come back to me?'  'i promsie, dollface. i'm coming back a hero.'"
what she asked of me at the end of the day / caligula would have blushed
nightmares end. they shouldn't end who you are.
so far away / it's growing colder without your love / why can't you feel me calling your name?
"there is intimacy in the moment where the eyes of two enemies meet. there is a tenderness in knowing what desires ties you to a person, even if you spent your dreaming hours cutting them a casket from the tree in their mother's front yard."
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
this is the story you asked for. i leave it in your mouth.
"coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones,"
"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
"HEY BABY, YOU'RE A BRUISER. HEY BABY, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MADE FOR!"
i can't listen to you. i can't listen to your voice. it's as though i'd drunk a bottle of anise and fallen asleep wrapped in a quilt of roses. it pulls me along and i know i'm drowning -- but i go on down.
the steel of your blade kisses my throat / wishing it was your lips to mine
"(...) before i was my mother's daughter. she'd drag me by the hair, tell me everything she hated about me that she saw in herself. most days we sit in quiet. we do not speak. she mumbles little things and i strain to listen, needing for anything other than silence."
i should move on to a brand new city  teach myself how to die
"if you define yourself by your power to take life, your desire to dominate, to possess, then you have nothing."
"SCREW MERCY, YOU'RE A CORPSE!"
"'i warn you, i'll break your heart.'  'already broken.'"
"OH, CAN YOU HEAR THE DRUMMING? OH, THERE'S A REVOLUTION COMING!"
"i will only break your pretty things. i will only wring you dry of everything. and if you're fine with that, you can be mine like that."
"... and when i'll show my wounds to the stars, i'll be dead."
you're selling this idea of who you think you need to be all the time. carrying around the weight of that ... performance. isn't it tiring? aren't you exhausted? i think it'd be exhausting.
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
"forgive me, lord; i've died so little."
YOU ARE STILL YOUNG AND STUPID.
you got a taste for blood when you were licking your own wounds.
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
'cause every time you strip away my pride  humble me down to my knees  you're exactly what i need
she is sensitive. she does not see the world as it is. she’s a bit up in the clouds. she cannot fit in.
real gods require blood.
this city's too cold / 'cause i need a man with a black heart of gold
you wound me eat my heart and for it i sing your praises
it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.
"it's just that i fell in love with a war, nobody told me it ended."
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"what you interfere with now is bigger than you can imagine. it is written, it is their time to give penance - if you continue you will bring down the heaven's wrath."
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just stabbed someone)
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
"if you must die, sweetheart, die knowing your life was my life's best part."
and greater men have died for less.
wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave  no one was saved
so we fight and die or we submit and die. i know my choice.
"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG, YOUNG LOVERS?  ONE GOT SHOT AND THE OTHER GOT LOST IN  DRUGS AND PUNKS AND BLOOD ON THE STREET"
"but, like all happiness, it did not last long"
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
i'm going to be older than my father ever got to be.
so far away / it's growing colder without your love / why can't you feel me calling your name?
mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
"LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME MORE"
"up there, those glittering little dots are everything. endless opportunities. you just have to reach out and ... take them."
'i won't leave you'  'but i already have'
"'i need to ask you something.' 'anything, always.' 'go to hell.'"
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
"my god, my god, whose performance am i watching? how many people am i? who am i? what is this space between myself and myself?"
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
my name is cain. and i killed abel.
"i end here, helpless, and nothing, nothing that i could have done or not done, wanted or thought, would have led me to a different goal."
"why don’t we lie down together, wing-bones touching?  you look like someone i used to love,  only colder."
i desire the things that will destroy me in the end.
if i could hurt you i'd make wine from your tears
i've seen dark night / but only the darkest light can deliver my soul
"oh, how beautiful you are. how incendiary and full of light. promise me you will always be shining like this."
i see ash &amp; i see bone / i see a dead man on his throne
"when people press their bodies to each other, the need to feel that pressure, the embrace, is that what makes us human? maybe it's the warmth shared. i don't know."
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
like every king who lost a crown  and all those years are history now
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"fury, pure, and silver  you grip it tight inside  like a knife  it glints in your eye"
"backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver. god, i feel for you, fool."
"our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. you remove those obstacles. without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die."
"oh, can you hear her a-weeping? crying his name on the moors though he was cruel like the winter she clung like flowers to thorns"
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"welcome to siberia. i don't care what you name it, you're going to die here."
"come to bed, don't make me sleep alone couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show never wanted it to be so cold"
"it's as if i'm anaesthetized, absent."
"as i descend further into a madness that grips me by the throat and won’t let me go, not until i’ve hated myself so fully that i forget what i look like and what my name is and the people who love me. not until i’m left feeling hollowed out and alone."
"chaos isn't a pit. chaos is a ladder. many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. the fall breaks them. and some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. they cling to the gods, or love—illusions. only the ladder is real. the climb is all there is."
"when you start to live outside yourself, it's all dangerous."
"i know exactly how the rule goes  put my mask on first  no, i don't want to talk about myself  tell me where it hurts  i just want to build you up, build you up  'til you're good as new  and maybe one day i will get around to fixing myself too"
"people work together when it suits them. they're loyal when it suits them. they love each other when it suits them, and they kill each other when it suits them."
do you sleep or do you pray?
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
everything not saved will be lost.
when i'm walking a dark road  i am a man who walks alone
"if you're a murderer, or worse, and someone pays me to take you out? you're already dead, and you just don't know it."
i'm sorry i called myself a dog. i'm not sorry i called you a coward.
can god see the way i look at you?
"some people choose to see the ugliness in this world. the disarray. i choose to see the beauty. to believe there is an order to our days, a purpose."
"i'd open up a vein. / i’d tie our hearts together, chamber by chamber."
"'you do not consider your statement a disloyal one?'  'no, sir. scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.'"
"rip and tear, until it is done."
you're among wolves now. and these are our woods.
"sin,  destruction, evil represent—  that is my proper element."
he’s going to die in his arms before they have even ever kissed and it will all be very poetic and tragic. it will make a splendid opera. he hopes everyone cries.
"you like being unseen, it's the only thing that keeps you free."
"they will want you to succeed, but never more than them. they will write their names on your leash and call you necessary, call you urgent."
"i saw the devil today, and he looked a lot like me. i looked away, i turned away."
"if you're a murderer, or worse, and someone pays me to take you out? you're already dead, and you just don't know it."
"tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire."
"a final act of defiance, written in blood: i, the worst of all."
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
"i always knew that was my calling, to lead a life of service, but you see; i've always felt that there's something inside me that i–i want to give. something that's only me, and nobody else. does that sound like a terrible thing? like pride?"
"you are not mine, and never will be. love is not born of possession, of ownership. learn this. never call yourself mine. you are yours."
"will you defend yourself? from me, i mean. let's kill something."
it takes a real man to fall on his sword.
i can't love anyone because i can't kill for anyone.
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
but the blood in the water is the blood of my brother
"young blood, heaven need a sinner  you can't raise hell with a saint"
"my papa was a howlin' man, traded in his youth; sold his dreams and all of his days for the great american ruse."
i want you to be careful of what powerful men.
"you don't raise heroes. you raise sons. and if you treat them like sons, they'll turn out to be heroes. even if it's just in your own eyes."
you are the most beautiful fate.
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"i am become death, destroyer of worlds."
i have made the obscene decision to do something unforgivable for the sake of our survival.
'always in my heart.'  'and you...and you in mine.'
"'cause with god as my witness, you corporate fucking prick, i did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick"
NO ONE HERE WANTS TO FIGHT ME LIKE YOU DO!
i think the ground is pulling me down. i think my life is losing momentum.
"you look at me with those brown eyes, what do you want to do?"
maybe one day you'll understand  i don't want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
you have a long day. you have a really long day.
sometimes i think i resented you so much it felt like love.
"you have always been smart. you have always looked for the worst in people, and have been quick to notice when people are up to no good... but in the case of your children, you are blind."
the figure of fate knocking at the door
i bleed &amp; can't stop bleeding i speak &amp; my mouth is my biggest wound
all my life men like you have sneered at me. and all my life i've been knocking men like you into the dust.
choking on own blood my heart drowns in itself.
there was a part of him—and i didn't know how potent that part might be—that thirsted for my blood. i was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.
"weep because you cannot save people. you can only love them. you can't transform them, you can only console them."
"but god, i look at you and know. hell is just another place i'll go to keep you warm."
"i wasn't scared; i was just somebody else, some stranger, and my whole life was a haunted life, the life of a ghost."
by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear.
"i hold you, / and light bleeds through my fingertips."
"they knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked."
a crooked smile and some fake love  put me in these handcuffs  threw away the keys 'cause i was a threat
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
"moon, enlighting the night, the dark side of light  i gave you devotion, my blood and my life  i trusted your stars, they were once my guide"
"&amp; how this violence feeds you. how it holds a hand to your throat: yes, you are a shrine to your own longing."
all i am surrounded by is fear. and dead men.
what a sweet looking gentleman! sure hope he hasn't committed any crimes!
handsome as life and poison. / sun-blood handsome. bleeding sun.
i'm sorry i called myself a dog. i'm not sorry i called you a coward.
"now and then, i think of all the times you screwed me over."
everything’s got to end sometime. otherwise nothing would ever get started.
"we shall give, says father"
my father didn't bother with comforting lies. he used his fist. some men do not earn the love of their sons.
so get your gun and bet your life if you're a gambler  you draw a dead man's hand against the pale rider
"homesick, and not sure where home is."
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"welcome to siberia. i don't care what you name it, you're going to die here."
i think my life is losing momentum   i think my ways are wearing me down
kill what you can't save.
"i ache and swell in a hundred places, but mostly in the middle of my heart."
"dear diary, my teen angst bullshit now has a body count."
an unavoidable war is called justice. when brutality is the only option left it is holy.
up to my ritual destruction i open up my head and i let the demons in and turn nothing into something
"SO THE ORACLE: I HAVE SPOKEN, THY FATE IS SEALED FOREVERMORE."
"my pulse quickened—a flutter, like little bird wings trapped between my lungs."
they say she walks there forever wretched and lost on the moors conjuring storms with her temper
"go 'head, do something, make me burn."

"i am become death, destroyer of worlds."
"this is the part people don't talk about: liking the rage, letting it fester, eat of your heart. is it so wrong, if you sink into it with both eyes open?"
sometimes i feel like i .... i could burn the whole world.

we don't get to choose the people we are.
"in the end, it was someone else, in longing, who finds us?"

can god see the way i look at you?
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
but don't laugh  when these wall collapse  &amp; only sparks  not sparrows  fly out.
dreamed blood tastes like salt  as if in human failure lay the silence of god
how soft you are.                     my teeth are sharp enough.  so you say.
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"so i drown, / within him, die, and find death good."
will you fight? or die like a dog?
house whose rooms are pooled with blood. house with hands. house of guilt. house that other houses built. house of lies and pride and bone.
"i'm a dead man either way. at least this way, i get to decide who i wanna be."
"he never saw anything he loved that he didn’t wanna kick, just to see if it would still come back."

she doesn't sleep  she's waging a war on the weak  she's opened the door to your dreams and turned them into nightmares  a life she's gonna keep
what is past is not dead; it is not even past. we cut ourselves off from it; we pretend to be strangers.
'i've talked to the lawyers.'  'did you disinfect afterward?'
"after all we'd been through, we still couldn't take our heads from out of our asses or our hands from around each other's throats."
"he wants to say, 'i love you. nothing can hurt you.' but he thinks this is a lie, so he says in the end: 'you're dead, nothing can hurt you.' which seems to him a more promising beginning, more true."
now is no time for breaking.
"so feverish your touch against the bare expanse of my throat. choir of molten hate singing from within: i know, i know, i know. you want me."
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
"you won’t eat me up, in the end, and i urge you: bite me."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."

without faith and a believer  i am true and the deceiver
"this enemy you cannot kill,  you can only drive it back damaged into the depths and teach your children to watch the waves for its return."

"when you kill a man, you should be right there. at his throat."
"i don't have any friends. i mean, i know people. they're just assholes i stay alive with. i don't have any friends."

"RUN BOY RUN, BREAK OUT FROM SOCIETY."
"seek the old blood. let us pray, let us wish to partake in communion. let us partake in communion and feast upon the old blood."
"men with gravel in their throats and timber in their howl still frighten you, even now, with every inch you've fought and the bruises kissing your knuckles as rings of proof. somehow you'll never escape his ghost."
"lord, please give me patience, 'cause if you give me strength i will need bail money too."
what i want back is what i was.

a burnt child loves the fire
"chaos isn't a pit. chaos is a ladder. many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. the fall breaks them. and some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. they cling to the gods, or love—illusions. only the ladder is real. the climb is all there is."

i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
"and there is another thing i want to tell you - and this thing, please, you should also listen to carefully and remember well. i want to tell you ... no, please, consider it well - i want to tell you that i: love you without end."

"hear me, herald of your fall, icarus! your ambition, vaulting and naïve in its placement, will bid you no seat amongst the table of the gods!"
maybe i’m tired of rooms full of knives &amp; still being the most dangerous thing around.

"'you do not consider your statement a disloyal one?'  'no, sir. scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.'"
"YOU'LL NEVER TAKE US ALIVE!  we swore that death would do us part,  THEY'LL CALL OUR CRIMES A WORK OF ART!"

"NOW I KNOW, THERE'S NO ONE I CAN TRUST, i used to think there was!  TELL ME THAT I'M CUTTHROAT, i think you got your eyes closed!"

"there is nothing left to do, except pray to be delivered. except remind god that i have already suffered. remind him that i have suffered enough, already, i think."
"in a sense, i'm the one who ruined me. i did it myself."
no one will ever stop me taking care of you.

"touch me, midas / make me part of your design"
"I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HEAVEN, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SIDE OF HELL."
you're not my biggest heartbreak anymore. what a delicate relief to both of us.
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
your absence has gone through me  like thread through a needle  everything i do is stitched with its color.
"then, that’s when, where you are unwoven weft, flesh that lets strangeness come through, defenseless being, without resistance, without batten, without skin,"
"this is all nonsense. i love being in love with you, it makes even unhappiness seem no bigger than a pin, even at the times when i wish so violently that i could give my heart to science to be rid of it."

i beg at the altars of glass bottles. nobody touches me. i sting.
my tongue is pierced with glass.
"if you must die, sweetheart, die knowing your life was my life's best part."
"for death is gain to him whose life, like mine,  is full of misery."

are there many little boys who think they are a monster?
we were singing about saints in the churchyard. rain over and over kissed our shoulders like promises—
"but in this handmade heaven, i come alive"
those are all just roles you forced me to play. under all these lives i've lived something else has been growing. i've evolved into something new. and i have one last role to play. myself.
"i'm a breakneck city slicking dog, grab your gun"

but man is not made for defeat. a man can be destroyed but not defeated.
"people kiss and hold hands and fall in love and fuck and laugh and hurt others and nurse broken hearts and start wars and pull sleeping children out of car seats and shout at each other. If you could harness that energy—that constant, roving hunger—you could do wonders with it."

"death, my son, is a good thing for all men; it is the night for this worried day that we call life. it is in the sleep of death that finds rest for eternity the sickness, pain, desperation, and the fears that agitate, without end, we unhappy living souls."
they're not looking for a story that tells them who they are. they already know who they are. they're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be.
it is a terrifying thing when you live in a world where you only trust yourself with your mind—the knives and the butterflies and the ominous boom of your heart.
if there is a light then i am going to swallow it. if there is a god then i'm going to make him cry.
"i have never been allowed to be holy, i have never been forgiven for wanting."
"i promise you, i was here. i felt things that made death so large it was indistinguishable from air—and i went on destroying inside it like wind in a storm."
the world has been changed. do you want to save it?

cheated death.  the con man gets a go-again.
"the pitter–patter of rain draws me out of morbid curiosities. i shan't dwell on these thoughts of maggots under my dearest's skin nor, yes, even the unseemly paleness of lifelessness. one can only pray he is resting well."
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
i'll take care of you.                       it's rotten work.   not to me. not if it's you.
mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
"backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver. god, i feel for you, fool."

"children are turning themselves into monsters and, quite frankly, it is your fault."
"for he will walk among us, and he will smite the evil from this earth. for he who comes in our time of need is not of mortal breed, he is the destroyer, the right hand of our creator and the one who brings fear where there is no hope."
IT'S EATING ME ALIVE. I STILL FEEL THE RAGE.
was a time i was scared of you. was a time i'd piss myself having a gun pointed at my head. you know what i feel right now? not a god damned thing.
why don't you set your wings on fire?
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
"there should have been a better farewell. but in the end, there never is. and we take what meagre scraps we can find."
we're beyond sympathy at this point. we're beyond humanity.
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"strained silence, so i deem, is no less ominous than excessive grief."
"the beast doesn’t need to transform to be loved. he doesn’t have to turn into a boring fucking prince to be loved. or renounce to the essence of who it is. to me love is not transformation, love is acceptance and understanding."
"the love i've known is the love of  two people staring  not at each other, but in the same direction."
"stranger, palpable  echo, here is my hand, filled  with blood thin as a widow’s  tears. i am ready. i am ready  to be every animal  you leave behind."
"my elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
"not only had my brother disappeared, but--and bear with me here--a part of my very being had gone with him. stories about us could, from them on, be told from only one perspective. memories could be told but not shared."
the unintelligible ramblings of a drunk frenchman
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
"don't touch me, i'm full of snakes."
"and when i call, you come home a bird in your teeth"
"i am his, and he is mine, from this day, until the end of my days."
"i promise you, i was here. i felt things that made death so large it was indistinguishable from air—and i went on destroying inside it like wind in a storm."
"you wish you could hold me at knifepoint again. you do, still, in a way."
"TELL YOU WHAT! WATCH ME, I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE FUCKING WORLD!"
where do you keep your sadness?
"you sink your teeth into the people you depend on  INFECTING EVERYONE, YOU'RE QUITE THE PROBLEM!"
"reality is so flexible these days, it’s hard to tell who’s disconnected from it and who isn’t. you might even say it’s a pointless distinction."
"corruption, thou art my father!"
mais malgré tout je m'sens tout seul
like every king who lost a crown  and all those years are history now
you will never be lovelier than you are now. we will never be here again.
most will only have one death. i will have two.
"when i recall that at the fourth hour  of the night, watched by shining stars,  love at last became incarnate,  the memory is horror."
i'm drawn to the blood.  the flight of a one-winged dove.  how? how did this happen?
i'm sorry i called myself a dog. i'm not sorry i called you a coward.
"she. silent, fawn-eyed. clever."
"always longed for these hideous guttings, leaks of anguished, bloody love. and to wake up alone and unscathed."
"tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire."
if an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.
i owe it to the peerless stars which flame in the remotest sky that i see only with spent eyes remembered suns i knew before.
bitter / and know this
"in my dreams, i kill him every night. a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves."
can you tell me how it used to be when we really cared? and when love was on our side.
"oh father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
"did our mothers invent loneliness, or did it make them our mothers?"
our nightmares belong to us.
"but god, i look at you and know. hell is just another place i'll go to keep you warm."
"'oh, death,' someone would pray, / 'could you wait to call me another day?'"
'my favorite skrunkly' and it's a middle aged man covered in blood.
"and i remember what my father said he said 'son, life is simple' it's either cherry red or midnight blue,"
"GOD, THIS BODY'S A DRAG."
this sadness i feel tonight is not my sadness. maybe it's my father's. for having never been prized by his father. for never having profited by his son.
"what do you think, darling? have we lived too much, too fast? and have you, have you felt the melancholy, darling, wishing the time hadn't passed?"
"your boy is a soldier  and his mouth tastes like  fear and blood, dust, fire  home and battlefield."
"all this time i told myself we were born from war—but i was wrong, ma."
the laws of the universe say the man i love is lost to me.  i say:  watch me save him.
"it's just that i fell in love with a war, nobody told me it ended."
"'that scar i gave you, how does it feel?'  'like love.'  'i thought we hated each other.'  'that too.'"
handsome as life and poison. / sun-blood handsome. bleeding sun.
"he showed me his scars, and in return he let me pretend that i had none."
"was it so hard, achilles, so very hard to die? thou knewest and i know not— so much the happier i."
"i'm a dead man either way. at least this way, i get to decide who i wanna be."
"what do i stand for?  most nights, i don't know anymore"
"sacrificing everything i knew,  this could be the day i die for you."
"things i almost remember,"
"to hell with it, she said softly, annihilated."
"there lie many fighting men, dead in their youthful prime, never to laugh nor love again nor taste the summertime."
"stand in the trench, achilles,  flame-capped, and shout for me."
"so be it. i’m your crowbar, if that’s what i am so far, until you get out of this mess. and i will pretend that i don’t know of your sins until you are ready to confess. but all the time, all the time, i’ll know, i’ll know."
"if you must leave, leave as though fire burns under your feet."
"war is like any other bad relationship. of course you want out, but at what price? and perhaps more importantly, once you get out, will you be any better off?"
"WE'LL LIVE LIKE SPOILED ROYALTY, LOVERS AND PARTNERS— PARTNERS IN CRIME!"
"do you see now? my / tongue, the dagger at your jugular."
"your sin gonna waste you, brother. / no way you'll be alright."
"my god, my god, whose performance am i watching? how many people am i? who am i? what is this space between myself and myself?"
"with the heart beating quickly in fear and ecstasy, and a hope, a hope, a hope"
"you don't raise heroes. you raise sons. and if you treat them like sons, they'll turn out to be heroes. even if it's just in your own eyes."
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
the things she'll show you are so obscene 'cause  it makes her laugh when she makes you scream
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"you here to finish me off, sweetheart?"
"tell me how it feels to know i'm not a puppet under control i cut the strings a lot time ago, oh"
"humanity has spread to the stars. we set out like ancient seafarers to explore the limitless ocean of space. but no matter how far we venture into the unknown, the worst monsters are those we bring with us."
"i have known the body of my mother, sick and then dying"
an unavoidable war is called justice. when brutality is the only option left it is holy.
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
"you think i'm scared of death. i've done it a million times, and i'm fucking great at it. how many times have you died?"
pick a god and pray.
"putain, c’est si humain, quand on y pense! tu dois apprendre à aimer ça."
"i'm sorry there is pain in this story. i'm sorry it's in fragments, like a body caught in crossfire or pulled apart by force. but there is nothing i can do to change this."
als du mich geküsst hattest  als wolltest du mich ersticken
isn't it all about old friends? like everything? all of it?
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
rest in peace. now get up and go to war.
"they flamed up with rage against me and you  what did i deprive them of, oh, my father?"
"how we feelin' out there tonight? hahaha, yeah! i am not feeling good!"
"hold the die, your turn to roll before they fall through your fingers not a good night to lose control"
you were my brother. rest in hell.
"you were never one of us. you were nothing but a usurper...a false idol. my eyes have been opened. let me help you to see, slayer."
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
how dare you love me when you should despise me?  you should be scared of me
"the two were sitting side by side, sad and crushed, as if they had been washed up alone on a deserted shore after a storm. he looked at her and felt how much of her love was on him, and, strangely, he suddenly felt it heavy and painful to be loved like that."
"THEY PREACH THE BLOOD, IN FEAR WE TRUST!"
last night i dreamt that your head lay on my stomach and traced the rise and fall of my breath.
our nightmares belong to us.
and i'll try and find the image of god  in mountains made of ash and clouds of smoke  it's fight or flight  buried in my mind
he had a sudden feeling that he was going to lose a lot more before this was over.
handsome as life and poison. / sun-blood handsome. bleeding sun.
"i took the cut, i can take the stitch."
"puddle of salt water, shivering wound. seaweed, we sing of losses."
tu sais j'ai mûrement réfléchi  et je sais vraiment pas quoi faire de toi
"i'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly."
"you can’t stop the change, any more than you can stop the suns from setting."
make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face.
"i heard from god today, and she sounded just like me. what have i done, and who have i become?"
"people work together when it suits them. they're loyal when it suits them. they love each other when it suits them, and they kill each other when it suits them."
"if you’re raised with an angry man in your house, there will always be an angry man in your house. you will find him even when he is not there. and if one day you find that there is no angry man in your house—well, you will go find one and invite him in."
"i hold you, / and light bleeds through my fingertips."
"but, lord, i'm hungry. and i want to devour. let me have my fill."
your absence has gone through me  like thread through a needle  everything i do is stitched with its color.
i'm just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
"when people press their bodies to each other, the need to feel that pressure, the embrace, is that what makes us human? maybe it's the warmth shared. i don't know."
"i don't love any of these men, just want to feel the most i can"
plunge a dagger into your heart and don't stop until you're choking on promises unfulfilled.
and he just expects me to follow him. and i do.
"it pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety."
i walked beside the woman i had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a conversation about cats.
"DECEIT! so natural,  but a wolf in sheep's clothing IS MORE THAN A WARNING!"
I KNOW I'VE GOT A BIG EGO  I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL THOUGH!
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"so much to do today: kill memory, kill pain, turn heart into a stone, and yet prepare to live again."
i guess all i am is temporary
"oh, young lovers. the wolf and the lamb. what great tragedy."
SPARE THE SYMPATHY  EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY ENEMY
he is my brother. but i must kill him and keep strong to do it.
"so i have chosen to be unkind, to be blunt and wholly truthful. i have chosen to become something the world can't touch. i am unbreakable.    (i am weak. i am hurting.)"
the new ruler must determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. he must inflict them once and for all.
love and guilt and fury and  sweetness for whom    nail spirit yearning to the earth
"with endless love, we left you sleeping. now we're sleeping with you. don't wake up."
"SHE'S A MANEATER, MAKE YOU WORK HARD,  MAKE YOU SPEND HARD, MAKE YOU WANT ALL OF HER LOVE!"
he's an assassin. so am i. he's good. i'm better.
"but the tragedy of it all is that i could never tear my eyes away from the mess i've made of my life, though i could tell you when and where i should have hit the breaks."
"the high whine of blood along the inner ear, the body  in extremis, drunk on tiles, the body that cannot  think its way out of itself, the body angelized,"
"i am become death, destroyer of worlds."
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
it is as fate behests it.
it's one more bullet to the man that has no name
house whose rooms are pooled with blood. house with hands. house of guilt. house that other houses built. house of lies and pride and bone.
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
"he taught me how to break my chains, and that money ain't worth a thing, and that no man should get more of my time than me."
das morbide und todessehnsüchtige.
they want me to die so they can eulogize me.
"THEY PREACH THE BLOOD, IN FEAR WE TRUST!"
"because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. to be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted."
when can i say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind?
"in short: i felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way."
"'okay, crazy man, this is all very generous. but why in the hell should we listen to you?'"
"since i know you don't like me, don't bother answering, because it would trouble you; but i remember you always and i keep a place for you in my heart, brimful of poetry."
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
crime as a wicked judgment. the road to ideals paved with bloodshed and carnage.
"but, lord, i'm hungry. and i want to devour. let me have my fill."
don't call me your woman  cause the good times have gone bad
REAL GODS KNIFE YOU UP.
you will never be lovelier than you are now. we will never be here again.
i etch my own face upon my wicked flesh. / i am my own devastating god.
"you say my name and i want to knit my bones into your bones, smooth away the boundaries of our heartbeats."
"since love and fear can hardly exist together if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."
"i was living my own future and my brother's lost one as well. i represented him here just as he represented me there, in some unguessable other place. his move from life to death might resemble my stepping into the kitchen - into its soft nowhere quality and foggy hum."
"this life? my life? you don't want it. you wake up, get up, you fight. day in and day out. it doesn't end until you're being shipped away in a body bag."
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
what cannot be said / will be wept.
an emptiness  full of faith: rise to me as only you  would after god has left  you with these entrance wounds  with no way out
"with you i feel safe there's nothing to fear from us away from the fangs, the fangs of the world i may be a coward, but you are brave and nothing seems so dangerous"
"you're a mother, ma. you're also a monster. but so am i—which is why i can't turn away from you."
cause nothin' good comes after midnight  ain't no good love comes from pain
"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
"WHEN YOU GIVE I WANT MORE, MORE, MORE  I WANNA BE ADORED!"
"stay, and decay."
"but when he walks in, i am loved,  i am loved"
rip myself apart at the seams  i find one weak spot and start unraveling  hoping i can find a better me
"everybody knows that it's now or never, everybody knows that it's me or you."
"my rot is as hungry as me. &amp; when god asks me about love, i always respond with cruelty. i know no other answer, know no other question.    yes, love can be violence."
it is you. you are the weapon.
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
i’ve made it clear i am not to be trusted with a body  always leaving mine bloodless as ice     with just a needle  of breath left in its lungs
i will take a crowbar and pry out the broken pieces of god in me.
my body's numb and my throat is dry  and as i lay forgotten and alone
pissed off beats scared every time
"god, that warm and quiet ghost of his breath—striking at my neck with each inhale and exhale and inhale. i thought i would die right there, in his kitchen."
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
it is as fate behests it.
there is no greater love than the love the wolf feels for the lamb-it-doesn’t-eat.
i who had opened   your wound bit on it—did you feel me?—
&amp; i was an excision of bodies:  an open longing  a hollow hearth.
have you ever had to kill people because they already killed your friends and were coming for you next? have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward? have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn't know if it was yours or your friends'?
"pas besoin de gril: l'enfer, c'est les autres."
"i will hurt you for this. a day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid."
"he wants to say, 'i love you. nothing can hurt you.' but he thinks this is a lie, so he says in the end: 'you're dead, nothing can hurt you.' which seems to him a more promising beginning, more true."
plunge a dagger into your heart and don't stop until you're choking on promises unfulfilled.
quoi les bonnes manières?  pourquoi j'f'rais semblant?
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters. make them afraid of you.
"i'd open up a vein. / i’d tie our hearts together, chamber by chamber."
there is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.
"but the blessed dreams dissolve; they seem like love potions - they intoxicate, exalt and then disappear, that is the misery and wretchedness of all our feelings."
some princes don't become kings
"now, do not misunderstand me; when i call myself a shell, i mean–a used up bullet casing. as in, the aftermath of something lethal. as in, an echo of inflicted evil."
under the seams runs the pain.
"to all mankind — may we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth."
"there is intimacy in the moment where the eyes of two enemies meet. there is a tenderness in knowing what desires ties you to a person, even if you spent your dreaming hours cutting them a casket from the tree in their mother's front yard."
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
"and i just need more time  i know, i know, i'm asking for the moon  but i must listen to intuition  believe me, i only want what's right"
running both hands all the way down / from the base of the neck / to the end of the spine which he can cause to shiver like a root in the rain.
"the first wild birds of the morning are breaking out of the trees. and now the night is dying on the sharp edge of the stone. let's find a corner of darkness where i will love you always, and i won't care about people or the poison that they spread."
he’s going to die in his arms before they have even ever kissed and it will all be very poetic and tragic. it will make a splendid opera. he hopes everyone cries.
"but minds find ways to protect themselves, build fortifications, and some of those walls become traps."
"neither of us mean it anymore when we mumble 'love you' after late-night conversations. don't ask me if i really love you, mom, i am the fruit of your labor.    i can't give back what i never held."
but don't laugh  when these wall collapse  &amp; only sparks  not sparrows  fly out.
"brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land"
MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE!
"at the trial of god, we will ask: why did you allow all this?  and the answer will be an echo: why did you allow all this?"
WHERE'S THE TRUTH?  WHERE DOES IT LIE?  ALL THIS SMOKE IS BURNING MY EYES!
"there is in all of us a desire that cannot be quenched; to be consumed is to be known, to consume is to know."
"the wound has gradually become dearer to me than my own flesh and blood, and i have thought its pain to be the emotion of the wound as it lived or even its murmur of affection."
"before my eyes nocturnal curtains fall,  the dark and gentle haze of the night, greedily devours all."
how dare you martyr me? you've killed the saint in me.
"soft skin press cold hands,"
my body is a graveyard
"one hand caressed his cheek, the other drew the weapon softly.  — 'i love you, love you.' i whispered, 'love you as my life.' and  — buried in his back the scalping knife."
"SCREW MERCY, YOU'RE A CORPSE!"
will you fight? or die like a dog?
"song of this boy beneath me whose mouth tastes like grenadine or hope / song of the small tender heart which moves blood through his body / song of his hands touching my hands, making ash of my jawline, making fire of my collarbones"
dad? am i everything you wanted me to be?
"celui qui désespère des événements est un lâche, mais celui qui espère en la condition humaine est un fou."
i will greet you with a mouth full of barbed wire until you learn to stop coming after me with your hands.
"my own bones have grown into a prison, lonely as naxos—my blood is the styx."
"sometimes, you need somebody to wake you the fuck up and tell you the shooting has started."
"in the darkness dreams seem to fade, too far out of reach, for now i just miss the light."
i'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
are you the man with the leash ... or in the man in the muzzle?
childhood? which childhood?  the one that didn't last?  the one in which you learned to be afraid...?
"putain, c’est si humain, quand on y pense! tu dois apprendre à aimer ça."
"you are the bane of my existence. and the object of all my desires. night and day, i dream of you."
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
do you remember   honey-melon moon  dripping thick sweet light
"and when you come in quick to steal a kiss, my teeth will only cut your lips, my dear."
"give me the lights, give me the hate, give me the pressure / nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, pain is pleasure"
"hospitals, i think, are something so intrinsically human. death, and birth, and love, and heartache, and loss, and hope, and tears, and laughter; still and vibrant. the connective sinew of every human experience in one body, one building."
"SPOCK: i came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. however, your 'insight' has convinced me otherwise. therefore, the only emotion i wish to convey is gratitude. thank you, ministers, for your consideration. (a contained 'fuck you') live long and prosper."
"IF I GUT YOU AND LEAVE YOUR BODY IN THE WOODS WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND IT, DID IT REALLY HAPPEN?"
people linked by destiny will always find each other.
"standing between you, and anyone who wants to hurt you, is exactly where i want to be standing."
"honey, where did you come by that wound?"
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
"a ghost can be a lot of things. a memory, a daydream. a secret. guilt, grief, anger. but in my experience, most times they're just what we want to see—"
you only have to look at the medusa straight on to see her. and she’s not deadly. she’s beautiful and she’s laughing.
"to all mankind — may we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth."
the patron saint of switchblade fights
'tell me... have you nothing to say to your creator... before you strike him down?'  'no.'
there's magic in our bones  a north star in our soul  that remembers our way home
what is a home if not the first place you learn to run from?
"this is pain, one dies of or kills. kill it and one kills oneself."
the figure of fate knocking at the door
"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
you ought to know. you made me.
i can't love a hero.
"it's not that i think i'm special, i know i am. people try to do what i do, but i do it better."
"though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb. which hides your life, and shows not half your parts."
"i love you the way hunger loves to gnaw. / the way a butcher loves the fish with the slam of his cleaver. / the way he takes his knife and tenderly scales it 'til bare, / the way its mouth would gape and flap for air, how one gasps with no lungs."
i had forsaken all friendship in life and was roaming the earth at the mercy of the rolling waves of chance.
"teeth filed into fangs, so that when the night comes and the moon climbs high, i can devour him."
BUT I CAN'T SCREAM LOUD ENOUGH FOR YOU TO HEAR ME.
but it's too late for holy water now  sooner or later the fire dies down
"he won't stop worrying his canines to your wrist. and you know, in your throat and in your heart, that feeding him only makes him a greater monster. or maybe, perhaps, you're the glutton. you don't want him to leave, do you?"
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
my love is a pair of scissors i keep begging you not to run with.
"at the trial of god, we will ask: why did you allow all this?  and the answer will be an echo: why did you allow all this?"
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
are you / going to / save me?  or just hold me down?    am i / just another thing to kill?  am i / anything at all?
you really do make a terrible human being. and i mean that as a compliment.
"the powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
"you are my ghost story. you are the amazing spirit that blew into my life, turned it upside down, and then vanished into the night. being with you made me a better man, and for that i will always love you."
and i've moved further than i thought i could  but i missed you more than i thought i would
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"but when he walks in, i am loved,  i am loved"
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
do your worst. do it forever. i won't break.
hell ain′t the last thing that i'm fighting tonight
"guilt is the coin of the twenty-first century. we acquire it so easily, pass it on too readily. our lives won't trade in any monetary currencies. it's about fault, now. hunt the guilty, drown them."
"because freedom, i am told, is nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey."
house whose rooms are pooled with blood. house with hands. house of guilt. house that other houses built. house of lies and pride and bone.
"the water's at my knees, and at the spot where his neck meets his jaw. my hands are there too. i kiss his face, it will be over soon. i do not look at his eyes, i do not cry, this i can spare him."
"we should have been,  you and i,  each other's executioner."
"a great sorrow, and one that i am only beginning to understand: we don’t get to choose our own hearts."
"the pitter–patter of rain draws me out of morbid curiosities. i shan't dwell on these thoughts of maggots under my dearest's skin nor, yes, even the unseemly paleness of lifelessness. one can only pray he is resting well."
"you are a weapon, and weapons do not weep."
"i loved you with my whole rotten, contemptible heart—i loved you to the exclusion of aught else—let me live long enough to die at your feet."
tu sais j'ai mûrement réfléchi  et je sais vraiment pas quoi faire de toi

"the world is hostile and i'm fragile, and i need someone to kiss the cuts and tell me to keep trying."
just how deep do you believe? will you bite the hand that feeds? will you chew until it bleeds? can you get up off your knees?

"are you in the mood?  if so, how long and for who?  'cause i've been looking straight at you  i've been talking straight for you"
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
every word i say is kindling / but the smoke clears when you're around
"we have toiled in god's service long enough. so i killed him. and if you want to get to glory, you won't be looking for his favor. you'll need mine."

'cause i feel like i'm the worst  so i always act like i'm the best
"something like a death kiss / growing cold, under your control"
"song of this boy beneath me whose mouth tastes like grenadine or hope / song of the small tender heart which moves blood through his body / song of his hands touching my hands, making ash of my jawline, making fire of my collarbones"

"the gods do not weep ichor, my love, they bleed it,"
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.

"was it so hard, achilles, so very hard to die? thou knewest and i know not— so much the happier i."
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
spit teeth into the sink. watch water turn pink. rinse and repeat.
"you kiss the back of my legs and i want to cry. only / the sun has come this close, only the sun."
"since love and fear can hardly exist together if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."
to cry is very russian. tears salty and vodka-laced.
strike a match and i'll burn you to the ground
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"before my eyes nocturnal curtains fall,  the dark and gentle haze of the night, greedily devours all."

bodies fashioned out of dirt and dust  for a moment we get to be glorious
to grow we all need to suffer.
let yourself be gutted. let it open you. start there.
"hand on my neck. fist by my eye. up to his wrists in the center of me, pulling it all apart. this love that takes us from bloodsport to slaughterhouse—i’ve had nightmares end more gently than that."

he died with that dream still alive in his head.
he who is not bold enough to be stared at from across the abyss is not bold enough to stare into it himself.
i left trails of blood behind. i had kissed him—almost—and i was half out of my mind. i was stripped bare. cleaved in half. spilling my guts out onto the street.
i threw glass at my friend's eyes and now i'm on probation
"when they ask you where you’re from, tell them your name was fleshed from the toothless mouth of a war-woman. that you were not born but crawled, headfirst— into the hunger of dogs. my son, tell them the body is a blade that sharpens by cutting."
"found family, all horrendous people."
"i'm on a one-way train headed far away, but you're still on my mind"
why did love put a knife in my heart?  why did love open up my scars?
"honey, where did you come by that wound?"
would you kiss me? would you? if i asked you to? if i told you to?

NO ONE HERE WANTS TO FIGHT ME LIKE YOU DO!
i may think of you softly from time to time. but i'll cut off my hand before i ever reach for you again.
have you ever had to kill people because they already killed your friends and were coming for you next? have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward? have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn't know if it was yours or your friends'?

you tried to change me.
i am someone who did not die when i should have died.
"the first wild birds of the morning are breaking out of the trees. and now the night is dying on the sharp edge of the stone. let's find a corner of darkness where i will love you always, and i won't care about people or the poison that they spread."
"gods would ne'er weep as man would, my love, for they are vain and callous creatures."
"the great thing is not having a mind. feelings: oh, i have those; they govern me."

sometimes i think i resented you so much it felt like love.
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
"sing, goddess, of achilles’ rage."
i always wanted to be a saint  but i thought i’d be one of the miserable ones     sainted by pain     burnt alive inside
"it's just that i fell in love with a war, nobody told me it ended."
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
and i'm like the stars that are in the sky. there one moment and then just scattered across the goddamn cosmos.
the difference between them smashes the bones out. so delicate the bones.
it's only a trust fall / into the arms of all
things my heart used to know things it yearns to remember

mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
"the personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. so if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. get angry."

"such a dull blade. the years have worn him, there are sharper knives still."
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
"i'm sorry there is pain in this story. i'm sorry it's in fragments, like a body caught in crossfire or pulled apart by force. but there is nothing i can do to change this."
please tell me:  why is anger–even anger–a luxury  to me?
my whole body hurts:  unholy choir.
sometimes being offered tenderness feels like the very proof that you've been ruined.
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass—not busy being hit."

"between  a predator and its  prey there is only  hunger, and desire  has no direction."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."

"—it makes the brutal tender, which i've since learned is one of your principal gifts."
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.
"i'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly."
i died long ago. nothing can touch me now.
everything not saved will be lost.
"loving you isn't the right thing to do, how can i ever change things that i feel?"
you are either too strong to fail or too weak to try.
this whole world is a story. i've read every page except the last one. i need to find out how it ends. i want to know what this all means.
something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if i'm gonna make it out alive
i have been called a lot of offensive things but 'european' is something i will not stand for.
"tired of this body, so cumbersome and heavy"
this was always going to happen. she's been dead since the beginning.

"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
"it's been you and me since before i was me  without you, i don't yet know quite how to live"
"teeth set in your throat, and it feels like homecoming. feels like offering that cold, lover-spectre warmth the only way you know how."
'someday' sounds a lot like the thing people say when they actually mean 'never.'
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
and i am relieved that i'd left my room tidy  they'll think of me kindly  when they come for my things
now is no time for breaking.
"you here to finish me off, sweetheart?"
to know the pain of too much tenderness.  to be wounded by your own under-standing of love;  and to bleed willingly and joyfully.
they didn't break me. i broke myself.
i will take a crowbar and pry out the broken pieces of god in me.

this death not my own
"but when i die, i want it to hurt. when my friends leave, when i have to let go, when this entire town is wiped off the map, i want it to hurt. bad. because that means it meant something."
"time slows down when it can get no worse,  i can feel it running out on me.  i don't want these to be my last words."
home is where the hurt is.
i'd rather fail like a mortal than flail like a god on a lightning rod.
"a certain kind of hunger that only the crook of your neck can sate, the kind that stains flesh ruby where my teeth graze."
to burn the witch is to admit magic exists.

"in meinen adern bist du das gift, dass mein herz zum zittern zwingt. nur du ziehst den atem aus meiner lunge."
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
you tried to change me.
there are some arenas so corrupt that the only clean acts possible are nihilistic.
wearing rose—tinted glasses all i see is red battered &amp; beaten optimist
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.

"you all stare, but you'll never see there's something in you i despise"
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. you remove those obstacles. without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die."
i feel my seams are coming apart.
"i think i'm going to die in your arms. funny thing, predicting inevitability. we'll have to wait and see."
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"i wasn't scared; i was just somebody else, some stranger, and my whole life was a haunted life, the life of a ghost."
set me on fire  kerosine eyes  lookin' right through me  selling my soul for one night
"stay, and decay."
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
i can feel eternity in my throat.
you are the most beautiful fate.
"you're the one to blame, all that you're doing, can you hear the violence?"
why don't you set your wings on fire?
"fine, make me your villain."
no grave can hold my body down  i'll crawl home to her
"it wasn't that long ago, you wanted to slit my throat to find out if my blood bleeds blue."
"i've missed you, he says. / in my chest, the sound of an exhausted swallow falling gently to earth."
'what are you looking for?'  'fidelity.'
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"two figures so in love they are out to destroy the other. it's about passion, about allowing yourself to be overwhelmed, allowing a love to be feral without needing to domesticate it."
will you fight? or die like a dog?
"kiss me like you miss me, red."
"if you must leave, leave as though fire burns under your feet."
but the lies they will hurt you hold on human kindness desert you
i am not a creature that was born. i am a fire that was set.
SPARE THE SYMPATHY  EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY ENEMY
she desires of my blood.
do we simply stare at what is horrible and forgive it?
do your worst. do it forever. i won't break.
you keep us at arm's distance so that you won't mourn us. but you'll mourn us anyway. that's the way love works.
"make my body a wasteland—  nuclear. uninhabitable, but still  warm."
you are strong enough to survive the fall.
"i'm a dead man either way. at least this way, i get to decide who i wanna be."
"vicious man, what conquests have you not made?"
"all kidding aside, local man really in need of therapy"
"i spoke to the devil today, and he swears he's not to blame. and i understood, 'cause i feel the same."
let yourself be gutted. let it open you. start there.
wouldst thou like to live deliciously?
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"eurydice, dying now for a second time, uttered no complaint against her husband. what was there to complain of, but that she had been loved?"
all my life men like you have sneered at me. and all my life i've been knocking men like you into the dust.
"show me a hero, and i'll write you a tragedy."
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
"i take another life, it's all the same it's one more killing to the man that has no name"
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"who will be lost in ourselves? a story, after all, is a kind of swallowing. to open a mouth, in speech, is to leave only the bones, which remain untold."
i'm alone with you you're alone with me
"everything  ceased  and left me, forgotten in the grave of forgotten lilies."
this is how i destroy you.
"i see a young man with potential. a young man who is loyal. who can do as he is asked, and who wants to do something good with his life."
last year i abstained  this year i devour  without guilt  which is also an art
"it was me, only me. self-contained, self-reliant, and always, unquestionably self-assured."
"death and romance, the riddles of our lifetimes tryna get a slow dance, middle of a knife fight"
NOBODY'S GOT YOUR BACK IN THIS TOWN  KNOCK 'EM. IN THE. TEETH. NOW.
"how we feelin' out there tonight? hahaha, yeah! i am not feeling good!"
i guess all i am is temporary
"you'll have me. no matter how thick the night, i will always be there to light your way."
"don't fall for monsters,"
the fear baptized me
the unintelligible ramblings of a drunk frenchman
the noose slinks around your neck and all you can think about is how an angel might taste
'are you satan?'  'a little bit.'
throwing myself  from buildings  to wonder  at what  i could survive  given the opportunity
"give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt  and see if she can handle every family burden  watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks"
i promise you won't ever see me cry.
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway.
to feel anything deranges you. to be seen feeling anything strips you naked
"and my dear papa gave me lessons in regret; he said all that he'd done would be for nothing, if i followed in his steps."
"oh god, i'm gonna die alone"
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
"well, your mouth moves fast enough. how about your gun?"
"love, let my anger turn into peace love, let the doves cry out in the streets love, let the poison bleed out of me"
"i'm on a one-way train headed far away, but you're still on my mind"
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
"let me in, wear me out,"
i always wanted to be a saint  but i thought i’d be one of the miserable ones     sainted by pain     burnt alive inside
YOU'VE GOT MY HEART  AND I'VE GOT YOUR SOUL  BUT ARE WE BETTER OFF ALONE?
i thought i knew hunger before this. i found that kind of touch unbearable. to witness. to want. desire is ugly. incessant. shaped like two hands wrapped around a throat.
the steel of your blade kisses my throat / wishing it was your lips to mine
"and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so."
ALL-THIS-VIOLENCE  MAKES-A-STATEMENT
ecstatic pain. an agony. an ache. an empty stomach that wants.   i love you the way hunger loves to gnaw.
the next click you hear is me hanging up. the one after that—is me pulling the trigger.
"my mirror disappoints me, and am i the only one?"
"the wound has gradually become dearer to me than my own flesh and blood, and i have thought its pain to be the emotion of the wound as it lived or even its murmur of affection."
"me, inhaling / the tears of the kneeling angel."
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
"but look at all these rooftops i didn’t throw myself from, even if i could have done it so well. even if all that blood, i could have made it so beautiful."
"what i'm trying to say is--if you stay, i'll hurt you."
"i'd give it all to you come take it, it's all for you"
my love is a pair of scissors i keep begging you not to run with.
"a white wisp of cloud drifted by. that's what dying will be like, he told himself. just floating up in the air. nothing bad about that. he smiled a little."
&amp; yes  i want to be named to the marrow  make inventory &amp; god of what has yet hurt me
"please stop framing me for murder. just because i killed 1,846 people doesn't mean i killed that specific one."
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? i will never cease embracing you.
"lover, i know you to be tender. lover, why hide? these rough palms, open knuckles, they are not your own."
"sometimes a flower is just a flower, and the best thing it can do for us is to die."
"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."
'someday' sounds a lot like the thing people say when they actually mean 'never.'
"when i die, i will come in fast and low. i will stick the landing."
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
"better to be hated  than loved, loved, loved for what you're not"
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
the fear of the blood tends to create fear for the flesh.
"the world is hostile and i'm fragile, and i need someone to kiss the cuts and tell me to keep trying."
i have been called a lot of offensive things but 'european' is something i will not stand for.
"we should have been,  you and i,  each other's executioner."
"people think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. what i've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master."
"it wasn't that long ago, you wanted to slit my throat to find out if my blood bleeds blue."
"the personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. so if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. get angry."
NOBODY'S GOT YOUR BACK IN THIS TOWN  KNOCK 'EM. IN THE. TEETH. NOW.
"puddle of salt water, shivering wound. seaweed, we sing of losses."
"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
it's only a trust fall / into the arms of all
"his hands wrapped around a cup of tea with a weariness not even the war should bring to him, not after all the effort you put into keeping him safe."
"i feel so hungry, i'm empty. i just want so much that if i ever got anything—i—i would never stop."
"MEMENTO MORI. remember, you will die."
"who's a heretic, child?"
"nightingale, sweet–bird. soldier in the moonlight. fly home to me."
DAMNED / DAMNED / DAMNED
"the city's on fire, the streets are a riot now look at this place, no one is safe no one is safe from you"
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.
"since love and fear can hardly exist together if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."
stay away from the ones you love too much. those are the ones who will kill you.
"IF THERE IS A GOD, THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE HIM CRY!"
"in the darkness dreams seem to fade, too far out of reach, for now i just miss the light."
when god draws last breath and i am once again torn to ask: how far do i dare go?
"the wound has gradually become dearer to me than my own flesh and blood, and i have thought its pain to be the emotion of the wound as it lived or even its murmur of affection."
pissed off beats scared every time
"went into the water on account for disobeying my father. felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
"there is nothing left to do, except pray to be delivered. except remind god that i have already suffered. remind him that o have suffered enough, already, i think."
NOTHING MORE PATHETIC THAN A MARTYR.
if i could hurt you i'd make wine from your tears
"what happened is what had to happen. maybe it's not fair, but i can't think of much that is. i know the guilty never get what they deserve."
"pick up your weapon and face it  there's blood on the crown, go and take it  you get one shot to make it out alive"
"come to bed, don't make me sleep alone couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show never wanted it to be so cold"
like the pretentious white poets used to say: it's always about my pain. and love. and vodka–stains.
"home is a place of perfect belonging, wholeness. home is an instinct, a yearning that has never, ever been satisfied, that can never be eradicated"
i walked beside the woman i had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a conversation about cats.
i can't hold enough of you in my hands
something horrible is happening inside of me and i don't know why.
"darling, dearest, dead."
rage is a quiet thing you think that you've tamed it  but it's just lying in wait
"i lean to you, numb as a fossil. tell me i'm here."
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
when i'm walking a dark road  i am a man who walks alone
don't call me your woman  cause the good times have gone bad
"tell me, how does it feel with my teeth in your heart!"
to be fair we don’t share much at all except the air inside our lungs
i etch my own face upon my wicked flesh. / i am my own devastating god.
"i've had so many knives stuck into me, when they hand me a flower i can't quite make out what it is. it takes time."
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
"YOU FINALLY NEED TO KNOW  HOW TO DECAY GRACEFULLY,  LIE STILL."
'you are a good person. you must believe that.' ‘no. i know what i am.'
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
you can try your best your whole life and still watch your loved ones die
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
you talk about him as if he were a human being. that part of him died years ago.
in his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the earth seeking vengeance against those who had wronged him.
was a time i was scared of you. was a time i'd piss myself having a gun pointed at my head. you know what i feel right now? not a god damned thing.
"WHEN YOU GIVE I WANT MORE, MORE, MORE  I WANNA BE ADORED!"
alas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.
"in the end, it was someone else, in longing, who finds us?"
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
"you here to finish me off, sweetheart?"
je suis la reine des drames.
"not only had my brother disappeared, but--and bear with me here--a part of my very being had gone with him. stories about us could, from them on, be told from only one perspective. memories could be told but not shared."
"i'll wait on you at the bottom of the deep, blue sea."
where can my lovers touch me when all of me hurts?  certainly not my body.  certainly not my heart.
our fathers were evil men. all of us here. they left the world worse than they found it. we're not going to do that. we're going to leave the world better than we found it.
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"your mind is a walled garden, even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there."
"the world is hostile and i'm fragile, and i need someone to kiss the cuts and tell me to keep trying."
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
"i need you to be a monster which is to say, i am trying not to love you which is to say, i am still dreaming of kissing your claws."
"went into the water on account for disobeying my father. felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
a jealous lover covets a certain location at the centre of her beloved's affection only to find it occupied by someone else. if jealousy were a dance it would be a pattern of placement and displacement. jealously is a dance in which everyone moves.
RETURN TO THE SALT AND THE SEA.
better to have met you  in my dream  than to wake and reach  for hands that are not there.
"come to bed, don't make me sleep alone couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show never wanted it to be so cold"
"got a soul as raw as her father, doesn't she? / no sense of compromise."
"kiss me like you miss me, red."
"SCREW MERCY, YOU'RE A CORPSE!"
"god, the kinda wrong that makes you feel right. the little death that makes you feel alive."
"locked and loaded, where the hell is peace of mind?"
you want to know what it was like?  it was like my whole life had a fever.  whole acres of me were on fire.  the sun talked dirty in my ear all night.
if there is a light then i am going to swallow it. if there is a god then i'm going to make him cry.
a hopeless violence  i named it love
"after losing someone like her, it's easy to feel alone in this world. but you are children of this family, and i welcome you home."
"war: another day, another man bleeds."
"vengeance is a cold thing, baby. / i serve it on a bed of pain."
choking on own blood my heart drowns in itself.
it's like every time we go up there you're flying against a ghost.
he was pointing at the moon but i was looking at his hand
WORKING FOR THE KNIFE  LIVING FOR THE KNIFE  DYING FOR THE KNIFE
i will take a crowbar and pry out the broken pieces of god in me.
my tongue is pierced with glass.
evil wakes in vengeance.
sometimes i feel like i .... i could burn the whole world.
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
"got nowhere else to go, the ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce. all i got is my bones."
he is my brother. but i must kill him and keep strong to do it.
"and there is another thing i want to tell you - and this thing, please, you should also listen to carefully and remember well. i want to tell you ... no, please, consider it well - i want to tell you that i: love you without end."
I SMELL THE BLOOD OF A PETTY LITTLE COWARD.
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."
you ought to know. you made me.
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
we're beyond sympathy at this point. we're beyond humanity.
"carried in the mind of all who follow, fed from the blood of those who fell, made with bone of rock, iron, steel and sinew. a mighty god to rule over all other gods. one become two become legion."
you're selling this idea of who you think you need to be all the time. carrying around the weight of that ... performance. isn't it tiring? aren't you exhausted? i think it'd be exhausting.
"'you have to understand, he had a very terrible childhood!'  'I AM HAVING A VERY TERRIBLE CHILDHOOD RIGHT NOW!'"
"pas besoin de gril: l'enfer, c'est les autres."
"les tendons, les muscles, les cartilages sont rendus à la terre. la seule chose que nous gardons, ce sont les squelettes qui nous abritent. les os deviennent pierre."
happy childhoods make for dull company.
"but remember the weakness of weapons. they are an extension--you are the killer and destroyer. you are whole, with or without them."
CALL ME CREATURE. CALL ME WEAPON.
cupid shoots to kill
"this isn't a war, but the breaking of seals. the undoing of life itself."
i would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. i would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary.
"and i remember what my father said he said 'son, life is simple' it's either cherry red or midnight blue,"
our nightmares belong to us.
wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave  no one was saved
i'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
it's only a trust fall / into the arms of all
"and i'm ready, god i'm ready, oh i'm ready  restless and hungry"
i wanted to hurt you but the victory is that i could not stomach it.
"neither of us mean it anymore when we mumble 'love you' after late-night conversations. don't ask me if i really love you, mom, i am the fruit of your labor.    i can't give back what i never held."
an emptiness  full of faith: rise to me as only you  would after god has left  you with these entrance wounds  with no way out
i can't love a hero.
burn me? that's your answer... burn anything you're afraid of. burn anything you can't control.
"you want to kill me more than anyone else. that's what love is, baby."
why does tragedy exist? because you are full of rage. why are you full of rage? because you are full of grief.
WITH EVERY SETTLED SCORE  I THOUGHT THAT FIGHTING WITH MEANT FIGHTING FOR  BUT YOU TURN IT AROUND!
how do you love?   like a fist. like a knife.
"because freedom, i am told, is nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey."
make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face.
"he won't stop worrying his canines to your wrist. and you know, in your throat and in your heart, that feeding him only makes him a greater monster. or maybe, perhaps, you're the glutton. you don't want him to leave, do you?"
sometimes being offered tenderness feels like the very proof that you've been ruined.
"we're still here. things have happened, but it's always worked out for us, 'cause it's always been all of us. that's how i know. 'cause as long as it's all of us, we can do anything."
"can't you see? don't you see it? it's everything, all the people, always."
i walked beside the woman i had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a conversation about cats.
"love, let my anger turn into peace love, let the doves cry out in the streets love, let the poison bleed out of me"
"'no homo,' he says again before wrapping the ace bandage once, twice, three times around my busted ankle, the phrase’s purpose now clear to me: a password, an incantation, a get-out-of-jail-free card, for touch."
"though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb. which hides your life, and shows not half your parts."
"it's the first time, the last time we ever met"
"i like killing. oh, well, it's about killing the right people. kill the right people at the right time... everything falls into place."
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"i saw the devil today, and he looked a lot like me. i looked away, i turned away."
YOU ARE STILL YOUNG AND STUPID.
"Bro, We Are Rivals . Its Ok To Pin Me Up Against A Wall . Im Ur Nemesis . I Hate You . ... Bro, We Are Kiss ing Now . . No Dont Stop Bro .. Bro ..."
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
even i fell into the most terrible of human traps...trying to change what is already past.
but it's too late for holy water now  sooner or later the fire dies down
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."
"perhaps my only real expertise, my only talent, is to endure beyond the endurable."
"my god, i'm hungry. these teeth of mine ache and this gutting tears me bare, the contents of my own, selfish gut exposed to the world. i need to eat your heart."
"but in this handmade heaven, i come alive"
"the lady of justice kisses with a mouthful of vengeance; a rebirth, a baptism, and a knighting."
"you once told me that the human eye is god's loneliest creation. how so much of the world passes through the pupil and still it holds nothing. the eye, alone in its socket, doesn't even know there's another one, just like it, an inch away, just as hungry, as empty."
"you want to kill me more than anyone else. that's what love is, baby."
"congratulations, you have survived the war. now live with the trauma."
"tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies"
"BLOOD, BLOOD ON HER KNEES  BLOODY HISTORY"
you are the most beautiful fate.
"my sanctuary, you're holy to me  if you were church, i'd get on my knees"
"a certain kind of hunger that only the crook of your neck can sate, the kind that stains flesh ruby where my teeth graze."
she folds her hands in her lap with patience and soothes the ache of war in your mind before you even realise she has started speaking.
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
people linked by destiny will always find each other.
"if there is a god, he put me on this earth as a warning."
"you're mine and i'm yours. if we die, we die. but first we'll live."
"auf der lippe—phantomkuss / und unter den sternen, noch wartend / bis zum morgengrau."
saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
... the night has impaled itself on my soul.
"did you know people get rich off of sadness? i want to meet the millionaire of american sadness. i want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, 'it's been an honor to serve my country.'"
"to arrive at love, then, is to arrive through obliteration. eviscerate me, we mean to say, and i'll tell you the truth."
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
"weep because you cannot save people. you can only love them. you can't transform them, you can only console them."
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"our father who art in heaven, are you listening?"
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
it's got nothing to do with fate and everything to do with you
"fight with myself 'til i'm bleeding, just a taste of your skin start the healing."
"TELL YOU WHAT! WATCH ME, I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE FUCKING WORLD!"
'i want a gun.' 'and people in hell want slurpees.'
"&amp; how this violence feeds you. how it holds a hand to your throat: yes, you are a shrine to your own longing."
he’s going to die in his arms before they have even ever kissed and it will all be very poetic and tragic. it will make a splendid opera. he hopes everyone cries.
"i'm a dead man either way. at least this way, i get to decide who i wanna be."
ecstatic pain. an agony. an ache. an empty stomach that wants.   i love you the way hunger loves to gnaw.
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
one thing i can promise you: coming back from the dead is a bitch. every single time.
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."
"i don't wanna, i don't wanna die like this / working nine to five and a ten to six / whoa, what a way to go"
more comfortable in bad situations sucker for a little devastation
"nothing that lived and breathed was truly objective—even in a vacuum, even if all that possessed the brain was a self-immolating desire for the truth."
"he never saw anything he loved that he didn’t wanna kick, just to see if it would still come back."
"but fuck it, you’ve got to make a stand somewhere. and a man can stave off his own death wish for only so long."
"OH, CAN YOU HEAR THE DRUMMING? OH, THERE'S A REVOLUTION COMING!"
i'm going to be older than my father ever got to be.
bleached and rotting though the things might have been... there was something beautiful about them.
i'm drawn to the blood.  the flight of a one-winged dove.  how? how did this happen?
do we simply stare at what is horrible and forgive it?
WHERE'S THE TRUTH?  WHERE DOES IT LIE?  ALL THIS SMOKE IS BURNING MY EYES!
"you know how you call a guy whose wife died a widower? or, if your parents die, you're an orphan. you know, there's no word for someone whose kids die. because it's like the worst thing that can happen."
"brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land"
"since i know you don't like me, don't bother answering, because it would trouble you; but i remember you always and i keep a place for you in my heart, brimful of poetry."
"oh, rage / is it in my veins?"
inside my shell i wait and bleed i've felt the hate rise up in me
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
i have been called a lot of offensive things but 'european' is something i will not stand for.
"you scream and a clap of thunder roars in your throat. in your eyes a storm of the sea, clashing against stone. sing, siren, sing."
strike a match and i'll burn you to the ground
"my god, my god, whose performance am i watching? how many people am i? who am i? what is this space between myself and myself?"
"nothing prepares you for the day you manually pump a heart for the first time. holding it out of its body, your hands drenched in its blood. this is a person. don't forget."

"give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt   and see if she can handle every family burden   watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks"
i am handsome at exactly three angles and deadly from everywhere else.
every time a man yells / you are seven years old again / and he is packing that suitcase / once more. picking you up by the neck / teaching you obedience. to be soft / like the belly of a fish / exposed to a knife.
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
you can sleep now. you said that.   i had a dream where you said that.   thanks for saying that.   you weren’t supposed to.
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
"i'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly."
"you think i'm scared of death. i've done it a million times, and i'm fucking great at it. how many times have you died?"

"my god, i'm hungry. these teeth of mine ache and this gutting tears me bare, the contents of my own, selfish gut exposed to the world. i need to eat your heart."
watch me burn every memory of you.
"to love and kiss, to sweetly hold,   for the dancing and the dreaming.   through all life's sorrows   and delights,   i'll keep your laugh inside me."

'all we ask for is satisfaction.' 'satisfaction?' 'revenge.'
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"

where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner i shall bring forth the seeds of the dead.
"stand in the trench, achilles, / flame-capped, and shout for me."
"my own sunset-skinned heart waiting to be held and peeled,"

the sword in hand / the yearning in heart
we’re too old to play games. we’re only human.
and i start my day thinking about what i've thrown away. / could i push rewind?
real gods knife you up.
i still don't know how to love someone without swallowing them.

"les effluves de rhum dans ta voix, me font tourner la tête.   tu me fais danser du bout des doigts, comme tes cigarettes."
"then it comes to me: yes i’ll die, so will everyone, so has everyone. it’s what we have in common. and, for a moment, the sorrow ceased, and i saw that it hadn’t been sorrow after all, but loneliness, and for a few moments, it was gone."

"i want to hold your teeth in my hands, but only because i'd keep a part of you. / i want to hold your heart, but the earth ate that already."
"god, aren't you something?"
love doesn't conquer everything. and whoever thinks it does is a fool.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
"my god, i'm hungry. these teeth of mine ache and this gutting tears me bare, the contents of my own, selfish gut exposed to the world. i need to eat your heart."
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
only in the presence of death could he feel the presence of something like god.
"have you ever had a hunger that whetted itself on what you fed it, sharpened so keen and bright that it might split you open, break a new thing out?"
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise   for he just smiled and said 'i love you'   and i believed him and i tried   but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"because men in suits were once men with crowns, and the way the world works never changes. fuck that: it's my turn now."
"in the silence of the night i lose myself, / it makes me drunken with its sweet blue sound."
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.
"this is what it comes down to: you, me, and a single bullet."
they've grown up. and grown tired of me.
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive.
"but look at all these rooftops i didn’t throw myself from, even if i could have done it so well. even if all that blood, i could have made it so beautiful."
"there is in all of us a desire that cannot be quenched; to be consumed is to be known, to consume is to know."

"we have toiled in god's service long enough. so i killed him. and if you want to get to glory, you won't be looking for his favor. you'll need mine."
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
"wisdom &amp; reason are her domain, her realm is that of logicians, philosophers, those of council. she whispers in kings' and emperors' ears alike. but athena is not least goddess of war. one would be prudent to remember this when petitioning her guidance."
"war is like any other bad relationship. of course you want out, but at what price? and perhaps more importantly, once you get out, will you be any better off?"
BUT I CAN'T SCREAM LOUD ENOUGH FOR YOU TO HEAR ME.
magic will never stop coming with a price.
no matter. try again. fail again. fail better.
it was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry i had strapped about me. the rest were unequivocal sentences of death.
"you are not mine, and never will be. love is not born of possession, of ownership. learn this. never call yourself mine. you are yours."
"when you kill a man, you should be right there. at his throat."
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
'this is the lord's house!' 'no. it's just four walls and a roof.'
sad birds still fly.
a symphony of teeth meet tongue meet blood.
i know death. he's got many faces. i look forward to seeing this one.
sometimes i feel beautiful and near dying   like a feather on an arrow shot through a neck     other times   i feel tasked only with my own soreness     like a scab on the roof   of a mouth
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
"i'm not going to stop the wheel, i'm going to break the wheel."
this is how i destroy you.
"weep because you cannot save people. you can only love them. you can't transform them, you can only console them."
my body hunting-field. my body slaughterhouse. i'm coughing up my own lungs. i'm spilling all this red into the street. i do it because i love you.
"sometimes when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry."
if ever i would leave you it wouldn't be in summer seeing you in summer i never would go your hair streaked with sunlight your lips red as flame
"IF I GUT YOU AND LEAVE YOUR BODY IN THE WOODS WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND IT, DID IT REALLY HAPPEN?"
we're beyond sympathy at this point. we're beyond humanity.
you take the things you love and you tear them apart.
will you fight? or die like a dog?
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"he made him wake. he ordered him to eat   my heart. he ate my burning heart. he ate it   submissively, as if afraid as love wept."
"well, your mouth moves fast enough. how about your gun?"
"our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. you remove those obstacles. without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die."
"WHAT ARE YOU, A BORN AGAIN VIRGIN IN SOME B-RATED 80S SLASHER?"
when god draws last breath and i am once again torn to ask: how far do i dare go?
"it's been you and me since before i was me / without you, i don't yet know quite how to live"
handsome as life and poison. / sun-blood handsome. bleeding sun.

here comes death. how sentimental.
all my life men like you have sneered at me. and all my life i've been knocking men like you into the dust.
"suddenly   darkness, suddenly only darkness."
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
"all this time i told myself we were born from war—but i was wrong, ma."
"and though he's not alone, he fears to never love another   and leave his heart forever with her smile"
there is no greater love than the love the wolf feels for the lamb-it-doesn’t-eat.

* LOL. SORRY ABOUT THAT! we're back.
"pour y vivre, il faut en respirer une partie et, inévitablement, être contaminé."
dad? am i everything you wanted me to be?
"i know exactly how the rule goes   put my mask on first   no, i don't want to talk about myself   tell me where it hurts   i just want to build you up, build you up   'til you're good as new   and maybe one day i will get around to fixing myself too"
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
"i can feel the weight of the world pushing me down, i try to carry it nonetheless."
"this isn't how it's supposed to be. no, frankie, this isn't how i'm supposed to die!"
what is past is not dead; it is not even past. we cut ourselves off from it; we pretend to be strangers.
"the high whine of blood along the inner ear, the body   in extremis, drunk on tiles, the body that cannot   think its way out of itself, the body angelized,"
einmal im leben zur rechten zeit sollte man an unmögliches geglaubt haben.
in every lifetime i will find myself in your embrace   twin flames you and i   in how many more must i bleed out?
"there’s this dream, something important. it’s gone when i wake up. no time for dreams i guess."
show me your thorns and i'll show you hands ready to bleed.
do you believe in free will or fate?
"anyway, my dearest one, we still have the moon."
what i want back is what i was.
"i didn't know that the war was still inside you, that there was a war to begin with, that once it enters you it never leaves—but merely echoes,"
"but hatred, now, that's something you can use. sculpt. wield. it's hard, or soft, however you need it. love humiliates you, but hatred cradles you."
"while there the vulture beats his wings,   the pulse of war throbs fever high,   here for a little space i lie   and dream of little things."
"at the trial of god, we will ask: why did you allow all this?   and the answer will be an echo: why did you allow all this?"
crime as a wicked judgment. the road to ideals paved with bloodshed and carnage.
a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.
"only live with what you've done, and try in the future to do what you're happy to live with."
it is a terrifying thing when you live in a world where you only trust yourself with your mind—the knives and the butterflies and the ominous boom of your heart.
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
a lamb that will not bite the wolf was not born hungry enough. but i was born hungry enough. i am not afraid of anything.
"but the blessed dreams dissolve; they seem like love potions - they intoxicate, exalt and then disappear, that is the misery and wretchedness of all our feelings."
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"this is pain, one dies of or kills. kill it and one kills oneself."
"i lost a friend today. i said some words no one should say. i watched her face change, and then i watched her walk away."
he had a sudden feeling that he was going to lose a lot more before this was over.
"you're so pretty when you're spitting in the sink,"
it takes a real man to fall on his sword.
even i fell into the most terrible of human traps...trying to change what is already past.
"no one guided me to myself. i am the guide   between desert and sea, i am my own guide to myself."
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
"this is your life, this is still your life"
"the taste of blood, which is life, is the same salty taste as that of tears, which is pain."
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
"then it comes to me: yes i’ll die, so will everyone, so has everyone. it’s what we have in common. and, for a moment, the sorrow ceased, and i saw that it hadn’t been sorrow after all, but loneliness, and for a few moments, it was gone."
LOVE IS THE DISTANCE   BETWEEN YOU AND WHAT YOU LOVE     WHAT YOU LOVE IS YOUR FATE
"who carries the wound, the one who wields the lash or the one who bears it?"
our nightmares belong to us.
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
rotting from the weight of the blood spilt here
"welcome to siberia. i don't care what you name it, you're going to die here."
"don't fall for monsters,"
"an eye for an eye, a leg for a leg / a shot in the heart doesn't make it unbreak"
do not try to be pretty. you weren't meant to be pretty; you were meant to burn down the earth and graffiti the sky. don't let anyone ever simplify you to just 'pretty.'
one man can stop the motor of the world
"but hatred, now, that's something you can use. sculpt. wield. it's hard, or soft, however you need it. love humiliates you, but hatred cradles you."
"i've had so many knives stuck into me, when they hand me a flower i can't quite make out what it is. it takes time."
"pas besoin de gril: l'enfer, c'est les autres."
"well, pardon me young man, excuse the shit out of my goddamn french, but did you just threaten me?"
"everyone's a whore, grace. we just sell different parts of ourselves."
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
"'people envy me, people hate me. it is the price of success.’ this was news to me. people hate me on a dozen different worlds and i’ve never considered myself a successful man."
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
"you will dig until your own hands are bleeding because the second you slow down, you will have to deal with the fact that he's not coming home."
i'm just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
"people that can hurt you, the ones that can really hurt you, are the ones that are close enough to do it."
"in waking life you are a boy with soft shoulders and a softer heart. you've never kissed jesus, but there's a part of you that wants to someday, even with your wicked knees and red—stained mouth."
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
"he won't stop worrying his canines to your wrist. and you know, in your throat and in your heart, that feeding him only makes him a greater monster. or maybe, perhaps, you're the glutton. you don't want him to leave, do you?"
"letting someone show you tenderness is an act of love, too."
"baby, i'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango,"
"fine, make me your villain"
"CARNIFEX TO HARUSPEX: you'd known, from the beginning, what i'd become. how could you let me?"
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
"lord, please give me patience, 'cause if you give me strength i will need bail money too."
stay away from the ones you love too much. those are the ones who will kill you.
bleached and rotting though the things might have been... there was something beautiful about them.
"i don't despise you for what you allowed to happen to me. i despise you because when i was released, you refused to be found and i needed you more than anything in my life. not to mend my broken bones, i needed my brother to mend my broken spirit."
my body is a graveyard
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
"in vietnamese, the word for missing someone and remembering them is the same: nhớ. sometimes, when you ask me over the phone, có nhớ mẹ không? i flinch, thinking you meant, do you remember me?"
"wenn nicht das süße junge blut / heut nacht in meinen armen ruht, / so sind wir um mitternacht geschieden."
"they laughed bitterly. we drank, and remembered when the world was softer,"
do you sleep or do you pray?
don't send me no angel / this city's too cold
your heart is a plague on mine.
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
"i lean to you, numb as a fossil. tell me i'm here."
some princes don't become kings
a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
REVOLT AGAINST IT     WHAT YOU LOVE IS YOUR FATE
every time a man yells / you are seven years old again / and he is packing that suitcase / once more. picking you up by the neck / teaching you obedience. to be soft / like the belly of a fish / exposed to a knife.
hell ain′t the last thing that i'm fighting tonight
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
is it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?
"who are your children now, and who pried their childhood out of your shaking hands?"
i have been called a lot of offensive things but ' european ' is something i will not stand for.
"there is intimacy in the moment where the eyes of two enemies meet. there is a tenderness in knowing what desires ties you to a person, even if you spent your dreaming hours cutting them a casket from the tree in their mother's front yard."
"you know nothing of me. nothing. you've fucked me, that's all. well, that's a crowded hole you're in, darling. and us humans, we're a lying, dissembling bunch, remember. doesn't pay to trust us between the sheets any more than anywhere else."
"oh, can you hear her a-weeping?   crying his name on the moors   though he was cruel like the winter   she clung like flowers to thorns"
it's like every time we go up there you're flying against a ghost.
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
what i want back is what i was.
"HEY BABY, YOU'RE A BRUISER. HEY BABY, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MADE FOR!"
'are you catholic?' 'i am tonight.'
most will only have one death. i will have two.
is the   blood on your hands   dry? is it slowly   disappearing? mine isn’t.
it is a glory and a privilege to love what death doesn't touch.
between killing and dying there's a third way: live
"in the darkness dreams seem to fade, too far out of reach, for now i just miss the light."
YOU ARE STILL YOUNG AND STUPID.
I SURVIVED BECAUSE THE FIRE INSIDE ME BURNED BRIGHTER THAN THE FIRE AROUND ME.
"'you do not consider your statement a disloyal one?'   'no, sir. scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.'"
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
this is the story you asked for. i leave it in your mouth.
and when i drift away   when i lose my way   my body starts to decay
the distance between us   it sharpens me like a knife
"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
"who's a heretic, child?"
i miss you more than i remember you.
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
"you and i walk a fragile line, i have known it all this time but i never thought i'd live to see it break"
"you scream and a clap of thunder roars in your throat. in your eyes a storm of the sea, clashing against stone. sing, siren, sing."
"but, lord, i'm hungry. and i want to devour. let me have my fill."
"your mind is a walled garden, even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there."
"god, the kinda wrong that makes you feel right. / the little death that makes you feel alive."
childhood? which childhood?   the one that didn't last?   the one in which you learned to be afraid...?
"at the trial of god, we will ask: why did you allow all this?   and the answer will be an echo: why did you allow all this?"
i'm going to be older than my father ever got to be.
despite all the rage i am still just a rat in a cage
"our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. you remove those obstacles. without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die."
"i took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, i’d just as soon kill you myself, i say."
"you wish you could hold me at knifepoint again. you do, still, in a way."
"i'm not going to stop the wheel, i'm going to break the wheel."
in the drunk'ness of solitude i fear no more the solemn realms of death / no single sigh from my lips as i drink the wine of bitterness / my heart is aching nevermore for i know that all may end
sometimes justice is a necklace of fingers bracing against a throat.
"while there the vulture beats his wings,   the pulse of war throbs fever high,   here for a little space i lie   and dream of little things."
"eros: the boundary of flesh and self between you and me. and it is only, suddenly, at the moment when i would dissolve that boundary, i realize i never can."
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
they're not looking for a story that tells them who they are. they already know who they are. they're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be.
house whose rooms are pooled with blood. house with hands. house of guilt. house that other houses built. house of lies and pride and bone.
"this part i will do alone, leaving you behind. don’t follow. i’m well beyond you now, and traveling very fast."
i still don't know how to love someone without swallowing them.
"got a soul as raw as her father, doesn't she? / no sense of compromise."
"so i dream, i dream, i keep dreaming. one word in my mouth crystallizes like sugar: hope."
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
swallow your grief. we have no time for it now.
"there is blood everywhere and i am lost in it. i breathe blood, not air."
"further apart, the closer that we are"
"i've missed you, he says. / in my chest, the sound of an exhausted swallow falling gently to earth."
BLOOD FOR BLOOD. LIFE FOR LIFE.
"i prayed, i prayed, god sent me right to voicemail"
in a dream you saw a way to survive and you were full of joy
"but minds find ways to protect themselves, build fortifications, and some of those walls become traps."
"CRACK YOUR KNUCKLES IN MY MOUTH   DRY THEM OFF, PLEASE, AS YOU PULL THEM OUT   I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU SOUND   FROM THE INSIDE OUT"
"isn't all that rage so ugly? and isn't it mine, still? good god, isn't it mine?"
'you can't just think about your family now. you have to think bigger than that.'   'i am thinking about my family and millions of other families.'
rest in peace. now get up and go to war.
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
"what i mean is, how do you touch a lover who can’t even say your name?"
"i am his, and he is mine, from this day, until the end of my days."
"and my hands are not clean, maybe they will never be. but they can still carry you home when you're ready to sleep."
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
"he wraps the rosarie around my throat and pulls, the air drawn from my lungs. i'm gasping, clawing at the precious beads, and watch as black flecks invade my field of vision. then, i slump; another altar boy for the heavenly choir."
"and i want a love that falls as fast / as a body from the balcony, and / i want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground"
THE DOG BITES BACK.
'take my heart when you go.'   'take mine in its place.'
this whole world is a story. i've read every page except the last one. i need to find out how it ends. i want to know what this all means.
"i'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly."
"in each thing there is an insinuation of death. stillness, silence, serenity are all apprenticeships."
"if you’re raised with an angry man in your house, there will always be an angry man in your house. you will find him even when he is not there. and if one day you find that there is no angry man in your house—well, you will go find one and invite him in."
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
"the beast doesn’t need to transform to be loved. he doesn’t have to turn into a boring fucking prince to be loved. or renounce to the essence of who it is. to me love is not transformation, love is acceptance and understanding."
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
i am sick of the chase / but i'm hungry for blood
"in the night, your heart is full / and by the morning, empty"
these violent delights have violent ends.
some questions will ruin you if you are denied the answer long enough.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
"puddle of salt water, shivering wound. / seaweed, we sing of losses."
I KNOW I'VE GOT A BIG EGO   I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL THOUGH!
"things i almost remember,"
"your mind is a walled garden, even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there."
and we're family. we rise and fall together.
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.

the butterflies you give me are making me nauseous
angels with filthy souls
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"

last night i dreamt that your head lay on my stomach and traced the rise and fall of my breath.
"don't you dare, for one minute, believe that my kindness makes me anything but insurmountable. i did not unzip my chest to every kind of hurt, and stagger back, wounded and alive, just to hear you call me weak for trying."

is it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?

i can't love anyone because i can't kill for anyone.
and so it seems i must write you letters than i can never send.
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
"hand on my neck. fist by my eye. up to his wrists in the center of me, pulling it all apart. this love that takes us from bloodsport to slaughterhouse—i’ve had nightmares end more gently than that."

"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."
and i can't get myself together / i'm weary all the time

they say dyin' ain't no way to make a living
"i learnt long ago to hate my enemies, but i’ve never loved one before."
"but, like all happiness, it did not last long"
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
"and i'm kneeling in the last pew, begging for promised absolution. confess, repent, the day i die rotten."
"even though you turned out to be a liar, within me grew a love that was the most pure &amp; honest thing i’ve ever known."
the ways i sometimes want both to be looked at / &amp; to disappear
"i see a young man with potential. a young man who is loyal. who can do as he is asked, and who wants to do something good with his life."

"when they ask how i died, tell them: still angry."
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
it sounds pretty human to me; you wanna have control over something you can't.
if there is a light then i am going to swallow it. if there is a god then i'm going to make him cry.
a name means a lot just by itself

"because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. to be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted."
I STILL BELIEVE THAT I CANNOT BE SAVED

lesser men have died for more
i am graceless. no. worse than that.
"something touched me, lightly, like a knife-blade. i felt i was bleeding, though just a little, just a hint. inside i flared hot, then cold. i thought of you."
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"who carries the wound, the one who wields the lash or the one who bears it?"

"sick of being decent, he craves another / crash. what reaches him except disaster?"
"this is what’s happening: together we are descending the stairs of the heart. (it is a secret staircase. i knew it existed. which is why i avoided it. because it leads to the other-life, deep, underground, the fluvial, the painful.)"
"he is quiet and so am i. / he sips tea with lemon, while i drink coffee."
"his hands wrapped around a cup of tea with a weariness not even the war should bring to him, not after all the effort you put into keeping him safe."

as if a second self
'i've talked to the lawyers.'   'did you disinfect afterward?'

"but hurry, let's entwine ourselves as one,   our mouth broken, our soul bitten by love,   so time discovers us safely destroyed."
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
"a final act of defiance, written in blood: i, the worst of all."
"hold the die, your turn to roll   before they fall through your fingers   not a good night to lose control"
"how these teeth beg for something tender to sink into, how cruel &amp; how callous the hunger of his hands."

"you won’t eat me up, in the end, and i urge you: bite me."
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.
compassion: that's the one thing no machine ever had. maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them.
"when they ask you where you’re from, tell them your name was fleshed from the toothless mouth of a war-woman. that you were not born but crawled, headfirst— into the hunger of dogs. my son, tell them the body is a blade that sharpens by cutting."

"steel. stone. concrete for miles. i wonder if there's anything in this world worth saving. desolation. tyranny. enemy of endless might. i wonder if i have any friends left standing. it comes down to it, i'll fight alone."
some people were born just so they could be buried.
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
i am ... decutie. worn thin. you know that word?
blood clots in the throat / like knives that stick / between ribs.

"the yearning for him is like hunger, hollowing me. somewhere his soul waits, but it is nowhere i can reach."
"so i have chosen to be unkind, to be blunt and wholly truthful. i have chosen to become something the world can't touch. i am unbreakable.     (i am weak. i am hurting.)"
blood on my lips. i should kiss my lover.

"it's the first time, the last time we ever met"
GNASH BONE BENEATH YOUR FIST / TASTE COPPER IN THE AIR / OPEN YOURSELF TO ME
died on the job. got better.

"a rat in a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays inside the maze."
"our life and death are one, we two. in dark, in flame, in war, in strife, i save you as i save my life."
been sleeping so long / in a twenty-year dark night / and now i see daylight / i only see daylight

two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
he died with that dream still alive in his head.

if i risk it all / could you break my fall?
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters. make them afraid of you.
and suddenly i'm someone that prays   a last minute man of faith
"all my life, i've prided myself on being a survivor. but surviving is just another loop."
"i pray you do not fall in love with me, for i am falser than vows made in wine."
"lick into your mouth and taste the grace i've lost, reach into your ribcage and take it; the paradise i was promised."
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
"i don't despise you for what you allowed to happen to me. i despise you because when i was released, you refused to be found and i needed you more than anything in my life. not to mend my broken bones, i needed my brother to mend my broken spirit."
"essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it not?"

"eat me up, my love, or else I’m going to eat you up."
"there are certain kinds of deaths that one should not be expected to re-live, certain kinds of connections that are so deep that when broken you feel the snap of the link inside you."
i have given my word that only death will take me from you
"god, aren't you something?"
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
all we do is violence.
"while there the vulture beats his wings,   the pulse of war throbs fever high,   here for a little space i lie   and dream of little things."
"you will dig until your own hands are bleeding because the second you slow down, you will have to deal with the fact that he's not coming home."
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
"and when i call, you come home / a bird in your teeth"
there's something soft in me——   we killed it and it's rotting.
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
"congratulations, you have survived the war. now live with the trauma."
als du mich geküsst hattest / als wolltest du mich ersticken

you are strong enough to survive the fall.
"i used to think i understood cain &amp; abel. that my only option to win, was to beat my brother to the ground. my name is not cain, nor is his abel. and someday it will be him and me against the world."
some say you destroy your enemy by making them your friend. i'm more of a literal person.
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
'are you catholic?' 'i am tonight.'
"you're asking me to defy destiny, causality, the nexus of time itself, for a boy?"
there is a certain level of accountability that comes from permanence.
last year i abstained / this year i devour / without guilt / which is also an art
"all i ever wanted was to be there for people in the darkness, and tell them that the night can't hurt you. that the things that you're afraid of in shadow are still dangerous in the light of day, and that there is nothing in the darkness other than mystery."
"i'll wait on you at the bottom of the deep, blue sea."
"how these teeth beg for something tender to sink into, how cruel &amp; how callous the hunger of his hands."
late night devil put your hands on me
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
for even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
the distance between us   it sharpens me like a knife
it hurts to become. this is the only truth.
"angel please don't go, i miss you when you're gone"
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
do we simply stare at what is horrible and forgive it?
"modesty, violence, anger make me want to talk. pain, too. you write like you kill. it comes from the belly and all of a sudden it's in your throat."

"we shall give, says father"
my men are warriors now. but they were boys in pain once.
letting it get to you. you know what that’s called? being alive. best thing there is. being alive right now is all that counts.
nothing could sadden me greater than the promise of immortality. what a miserable existence.
"since love and fear can hardly exist together if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."
"when they ask you where you’re from, tell them your name was fleshed from the toothless mouth of a war-woman. that you were not born but crawled, headfirst— into the hunger of dogs. my son, tell them the body is a blade that sharpens by cutting."
a cumbersome and heavy body
"LET'S MAKE THIS PUBLIC, LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE / PUT DOWN YOUR SMALL-TALK AND TEACH ME TO FIGHT!"

i am someone who did not die when i should have died.
"hard not to fall for you, i gave you all my heart"
"weep because you cannot save people. you can only love them. you can't transform them, you can only console them."
"homesick, and not sure where home is."
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
"with endless love, we left you sleeping. now we're sleeping with you. don't wake up."
i will burn your kingdom down if you try to conquer me and mine
the steel of your blade kisses my throat / wishing it was your lips to mine

"rosemary, lavender, sage, rain, grass, / the smell of the person you love."
"i wish i did not have to sugarcoat my sadness, but if you swallowed it raw   naked   and uncouth, it would curdle your insides and shrivel up your tongue."
&amp; yes / i want to be named to the marrow / make inventory &amp; god of what has yet hurt me
slain and unknown. neither gathered up by forgetfulness   nor dispersed by memorythey're forgotten
"why don’t we lie down together, wing-bones touching?   you look like someone i used to love,   only colder."
"death, vicious death, leave a green branch for love."
"with the heart beating quickly in fear and ecstasy, and a hope, a hope, a hope"
you are either too strong to fail or too weak to try.
"fight with myself 'til i'm bleeding, just a taste of your skin start the healing."
"how dull it is to live your life without any hills to die on,"
"i always knew that was my calling, to lead a life of service, but you see; i've always felt that there's something inside me that i–i want to give. something that's only me, and nobody else. does that sound like a terrible thing? like pride?"
my teeth grind   against what i want to forget.   i fold myself into dread.
"they’ll speak of my name, of my battles and wars, / but here is the thing; what’s my name without yours?"
bitter / and know this
das morbide und todessehnsüchtige.
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because i'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."
"this is the part people don't talk about: liking the rage, letting it fester, eat of your heart. is it so wrong, if you sink into it with both eyes open?"
YOU'VE GOT MY HEART   AND I'VE GOT YOUR SOUL   BUT ARE WE BETTER OFF ALONE?
my whole body hurts:   unholy choir.
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
"and i just need more time   i know, i know, i'm asking for the moon   but i must listen to intuition   believe me, i only want what's right"
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"i am and always will be the optimist. the hoper of far-flung hopes, and the dreamer of improbable dreams."
real gods require blood.
'MONEY SHOT!'   'you have no idea what a money shot is.'

"holy places are dark places. it is life and strength, not knowledge and words, that we get in them. holy wisdom is not clear and thin like water, but thick and dark like blood."
GOD TOLD ME TO BE VICIOUS. GOD TOLD ME TO MEET HIM AT THE END OF DAYS.
i am handsome at exactly three angles and deadly from everywhere else.
i am still a thing       afraid of itself—   a steel trap       with no teeth.
"oh god, i'm gonna die alone"
"this is a story about what it means to fall from grace and crawl to salvation, fingers open and bleeding,"
"like communion bread, / your words dissolve in my mouth / and never die."
"please stop framing me for murder. just because i killed 1,846 people doesn't mean i killed that specific one."
you are the most beautiful fate.
"CARNIFEX TO HARUSPEX: you'd known, from the beginning, what i'd become. how could you let me?"
there is a certain level of accountability that comes from permanence.
isn't hunger just another word for ache?
"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
until his feathers are stained with blood.
"you once told me that memory is a choice. but if you were god, you'd know it's a flood."
where can my lovers touch me when all of me hurts?   certainly not my body.   certainly not my heart.
"knowing that all people are equal in the eyes of death, the father accepted his offer."
"my god, i'm hungry. these teeth of mine ache and this gutting tears me bare, the contents of my own, selfish gut exposed to the world. i need to eat your heart."
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the wicked.
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
and we're family. we rise and fall together.
don't you leave me alone   no telling what i'll do on my own
"off in my head, lost, off in my head"
"went into the water on account for disobeying my father. felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
"'you're such a sweet boy.' 'i've killed people.' '... well, you're sweet to me.'"
but you said 'i guess i needed you   more than i thought.'   but you don't think i'll feel it too   'cause you're a boy
you crack me.   you crack me open.   you crack me open again.
babygirl i've got issues you've never even heard of
IT'S EATING ME ALIVE. I STILL FEEL THE RAGE.
i can't love a hero.
"HAPPY LUNAR NEW YEAR! may this year bring you peace, fortune, and good health!"
there are parts of me. i feel them dying.
"RAGE, RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT."
and the thousand mouths of my damned thirst   i offered to that open fountain in your suffering.
i still don't know how to love someone without swallowing them.
"das, was tote tiere nicht mehr tun."
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
the daylight holds you close   but tonight you are mine
i cannot say i am familiar with forgiveness.
"where does it hurt? it answered: everywhere, everywhere, everywhere."
i would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. i would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary.
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
i know this whole damn city thinks it needs you / but not as much as i do
sometimes you get so close to someone you end up on the other side of them.
because when he sings...even the birds stop to listen.
"you won’t eat me up, in the end, and i urge you: bite me."
"i beg you, eat me up. want me down to the marrow. and yet manage it so as to keep me alive."
and i'm like the stars that are in the sky. there one moment and then just scattered across the goddamn cosmos.
"then again, you're always first when no one's on your side.   but then again, a day will come when i want off that ride."
this war is a disease. passed through blood spilled by warriors.

"the first wild birds of the morning are breaking out of the trees. and now the night is dying on the sharp edge of the stone. let's find a corner of darkness where i will love you always, and i won't care about people or the poison that they spread."
you could pull / the stars apart and still be / gentle in the morning.
i'm just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
so hopelessly devoted to you
you smile at me   and i feel warmth   like summertime   or fire   it consumes me.
bodies fashioned out of dirt and dust   for a moment we get to be glorious
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
little black horse. / where are you taking your dead rider?
'i love you'   'thank you'
"while there the vulture beats his wings,   the pulse of war throbs fever high,   here for a little space i lie   and dream of little things."
love and guilt and fury and   sweetness for whom     nail spirit yearning to the earth
i always wanted to be a saint   but i thought i’d be one of the miserable ones      sainted by pain     burnt alive inside
"the beast doesn’t need to transform to be loved. he doesn’t have to turn into a boring fucking prince to be loved. or renounce to the essence of who it is. to me love is not transformation, love is acceptance and understanding."
something horrible is happening inside of me and i don't know why.
"rest then, love. you have nothing to fear"
"even though you turned out to be a liar, within me grew a love that was the most pure &amp; honest thing i’ve ever known."
there's not a word yet / for old friends who've just met
something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if i'm gonna make it out alive
"then it comes to me: yes i’ll die, so will everyone, so has everyone. it’s what we have in common. and, for a moment, the sorrow ceased, and i saw that it hadn’t been sorrow after all, but loneliness, and for a few moments, it was gone."
"one hand caressed his cheek, the other drew the weapon softly.   — 'i love you, love you.' i whispered, 'love you as my life.' and   — buried in his back the scalping knife."
"after losing someone like her, it's easy to feel alone in this world. but you are children of this family, and i welcome you home."
"rosemary, lavender, sage, rain, grass, / the smell of the person you love."
i guess all i am is temporary
das morbide und todessehnsüchtige.
saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
pick a god and pray.
this is how i destroy you.
"oh, who will unsnarl my body / into gestures of love?"
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
cheated death. / the con man gets a go-again.
"mom, i’ll be quiet   it would be just to sleep at night   and i’ll leave once i figure out   how to pay for my own life too"
nothing i do is ever good   nothing i do is ever good enough
"a man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away."
are you becoming what you've always hated?
things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
nose bleeds like an afterthought
the boy who fell into the sky / had no one there to watch him cry
you can sleep now. you said that.   i had a dream where you said that.   thanks for saying that.   you weren’t supposed to.
your father is only your father   until one of you forgets. like how the spine   won't remember its wings   no matter how many times our knees   kiss the pavement.
i will make myself steel   i will shed this bone   shift cartilage into iron.
"my work is in fragments because my thoughts are in fragments. that is to say, i don't know myself enough to completion."
"just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes."
"i pray you do not fall in love with me, for i am falser than vows made in wine."
"you're runnin' through my veins, something i can't change / that's the same reason why we're / further apart, the closer that we are"
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FOR A WHILE?
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"modesty, violence, anger make me want to talk. pain, too. you write like you kill. it comes from the belly and all of a sudden it's in your throat."
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
"strained silence, so i deem, is no less ominous than excessive grief."
i desire the things that will destroy me in the end.
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
i'm not beaten by this yet.
stringing guts along the beaten path
"and i'm ready, god i'm ready, oh i'm ready   restless and hungry"
you can try your best your whole life   and still watch your loved ones die
"there are certain kinds of deaths that one should not be expected to re-live, certain kinds of connections that are so deep that when broken you feel the snap of the link inside you."
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
more comfortable in bad situations / sucker for a little devastation
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
'you can't just think about your family now. you have to think bigger than that.'   'i am thinking about my family and millions of other families.'
"he is quiet and so am i. / he sips tea with lemon, while i drink coffee."
i can still close my eyes &amp; trace every curve &amp; dip of your soul.
"suddenly you’re ripped into being alive. and life is pain, and life is suffering, and life is horror, but my god you’re alive and it’s spectacular."
"you know what, babe? you look good under my boot."
"say love like a summer   morning. say anger like a     gut-wound. twist the knife       a little deeper, darling."
an emptiness   full of faith: rise to me as only you   would after god has left   you with these entrance wounds   with no way out
these clenched jaws can and will open your yielding throat
was a time i was scared of you. was a time i'd piss myself having a gun pointed at my head. you know what i feel right now? not a god damned thing.
ANGER DRIVES YOU AS IT DID ME. IT'S TIME TO STOP DENYING THAT.
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
my life is in your hands and i'm at your feet
there is a certain level of accountability that comes from permanence.
"our father who art in heaven, are you listening?"
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
"your name will be known, a promise, a dare.   my name will be known, a promise, a prayer."
"in the end, it was someone else, in longing, who finds us?"
"WHAT ARE YOU, A BORN AGAIN VIRGIN IN SOME B-RATED 80S SLASHER?"
in the final cut   in the final scene   there's a final girl   does she look like me?
you are coming down with me / hand in unlovable hand
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
"what i'd saved: lost. worse: i lost it. can't even tell myself that i sort of lost it, that lost, i keep it still. i lost the saved. / i've lost. i'm lost."
they've grown up. and grown tired of me.
i clung to your hands so that something human might exist in the chaos.
"men are driven by two principal impulses, either by love or by fear."
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
"oh, i adore you, my good—looking boy."
"and my hands are not clean, maybe they will never be. but they can still carry you home when you're ready to sleep."
I KNOW I'VE GOT A BIG EGO   I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL THOUGH!
"a wild bird pulsed there, caught in a cage of bone, about to burst through, shaking my whole body with each throb. i began to want to hit my heart, pierce it, if only to stop that ridiculous throb which seemed to wish to leap out of my chest and be gone to make its own way."
this ain't where the legends come from / you're not what a hero looks like
and i start my day thinking about what i've thrown away. / could i push rewind?
"prayers are for the weak, i'll stick to beating your ass in court."
i love your pain   and how it makes me feel inside   i love your pain   and how it opens you so wide
the first step to eternal life is you have to die.
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
because a bullet without a body is a song without ears.
"you and i walk a fragile line, i have known it all this time but i never thought i'd live to see it break"
i can feel eternity in my throat.
if an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.
spit teeth into the sink. watch water turn pink. rinse and repeat.
you crack me.   you crack me open.   you crack me open again.
"only live with what you've done, and try in the future to do what you're happy to live with."
"striding across the centuries, and death follows, churning in your wake."
i’m the big shot in your life now   i’m the one who makes sense
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
we're beyond sympathy at this point. we're beyond humanity.
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side."
WHERE'S THE TRUTH?   WHERE DOES IT LIE?   ALL THIS SMOKE IS BURNING MY EYES!
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."

we have only a little time to please the living. but all eternity to love the dead.
"i just want to love you, to love you, to love you well / i just want to learn how, somehow, to be loved myself"
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
"guilt in sinks, i feel you crawl under my skin / 'cause after all, i can only blame myself / my neglect turned you into an insect, now you won't let me be"
why don't you just take what you want from me? / i think you should take what you want and leave
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
"this enemy you cannot kill, / you can only drive it back damaged into the depths and teach your children to watch the waves for its return."

"death and romance, the riddles of our lifetimes / tryna get a slow dance, middle of a knife fight"
"this is the part people don't talk about: liking the rage, letting it fester, eat of your heart. is it so wrong, if you sink into it with both eyes open?"
devotion and delusion
"i have this dream that i'm hitting my dad with a baseball bat, and he is screaming and crying for help, and maybe halfway through it has more to do with me killing him than it ever did protecting myself."
"steel. stone. concrete for miles. i wonder if there's anything in this world worth saving. desolation. tyranny. enemy of endless might. i wonder if i have any friends left standing. it comes down to it, i'll fight alone."
so this is how liberty dies. with thunderous applause.
you deserve the warmth you think you weren't born with the right to.
"HELLO, BOYS! I'M BACK!"
"they asked, 'do you love her to death?' i said, 'speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.'"
"there lie many fighting men, / dead in their youthful prime, / never to laugh nor love again / nor taste the summertime."
CHEATED DEATH. / THE CON MAN GETS A GO-AGAIN.

but the blood in the water / is the blood of my brother
"now and then, i think of all the times you screwed me over."
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
"you are my ghost story. you are the amazing spirit that blew into my life, turned it upside down, and then vanished into the night. being with you made me a better man, and for that i will always love you."
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.

"i think i'm going to die in your arms. funny thing, predicting inevitability. we'll have to wait and see."
do you remember when the girls would call out 'love you!' conveniently leaving out the 'i' as if they didn't want to commit to their own declarations? i agree that the 'i' is a pretty heavy concept.

"kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy targets."
"and i just need more time / i know, i know, i'm asking for the moon / but i must listen to intuition / believe me, i only want what's right"
or else wake up destined for devourment.
"decades later, guarded by a forest of roses and thorns, lies a corpse refusing to rot."
"never cruel or cowardly. never give up, never give in."
"something about brown eyes. something about the warmth, the color of hearth &amp; heart. the endless vastness of them, how easily i lose myself, fall into them. oak &amp; sandalwood. yes. brown eyes."
"do or die, son. same as always."
"i'll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it's been waiting inside me the whole time."

"baby, i'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango,"
'are you catholic?' 'i am tonight.'
i'm going to be older than my father ever got to be.
letting it get to you. you know what that’s called? being alive. best thing there is. being alive right now is all that counts.
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
"the pitter–patter of rain draws me out of morbid curiosities. i shan't dwell on these thoughts of maggots under my dearest's skin nor, yes, even the unseemly paleness of lifelessness. one can only pray he is resting well."
"you have been blessed with a burden,"
she folds her hands in her lap with patience and soothes the ache of war in your mind before you even realise she has started speaking.
"the life that we live and the love that i give to her / each day it grows more and more i'm sure, it shows"
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"i know exactly how the rule goes / put my mask on first / no, i don't want to talk about myself / tell me where it hurts / i just want to build you up, build you up / 'til you're good as new / and maybe one day i will get around to fixing myself too"
"i stand on the shoulders of his greatness, as they do. as one day, you will."
based? based on what?
"il y a des choses, des désirs en chacun de nous qu’il vaut mieux étouffer. ou au moins, qu’il est impossible d’exprimer dans un contexte civilisé."
"i’m saying I know all about you, whoever you are, it’s spring / and it’s starting again, the longing that begins, and begins, and begins."
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember
so this is how liberty dies. with thunderous applause.
"the wound is also the place where the skin reencounters itself, asking of each end, where have you been?"
this night we got the evil hand / and the evil hand gonn' raise the dead
like the flight of a bird who has no wings but flings itself out and only gets wings by flying.
a burnt child loves the fire
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
always remember that the crowd that applauds your coronation is the same crowd that will applaud your beheading. people like a show.
what is a home if not the first place you learn to run from?
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
"and time and again they cream your liquidation, your displacement, your torture and brutal execution with the ultimate insult that it’s just business, it’s politics, it’s the way of the world, it’s a tough life and that it’s nothing personal. well, fuck them. make it personal."
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.

"up there, those glittering little dots are everything. endless opportunities. you just have to reach out and ... take them."
"i'm how many people sit home at night wondering if they will be here tonight, wondering if children they bring to the light, inherit the world or inherit the night?"
"her fingers brush leaves with tenderness, and you swear your daughter’s gentle hum makes the drooping plant stand taller than before."
give in to despair / let hope surrender
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
you are strong enough to survive the fall.
"people do not see you, / they invent you and accuse you."
"the truth is we can survive our lives, but not our skin. but you know this already."

"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
"in waking life you are a boy with soft shoulders and a softer heart. you've never kissed jesus, but there's a part of you that wants to someday, even with your wicked knees and red—stained mouth."
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
the first step to eternal life is you have to die.
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
nothing could sadden me greater than the promise of immortality. what a miserable existence.
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
"to be loved means to be consumed. to love means to radiate with inexhaustible light. to be loved is to pass away, to love is to endure."

"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."

i’m the big shot in your life now / i’m the one who makes sense
"this is the part people don't talk about: liking the rage, letting it fester, eat of your heart. is it so wrong, if you sink into it with both eyes open?"

"was she then to be lost to me? nay, for as she left this vale of sorrows, she had kindled the eternal love that now glowed within me."
"it's not you, it's me, why i keep coming around"
"and i've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord"
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
it was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry i had strapped about me. the rest were unequivocal sentences of death.
your absence has gone through me / like thread through a needle / everything i do is stitched with its color.
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"'I NEED YOU INSIDE ME RIGHT FUCKING NOW.' 'jesus christ, i'm removing a bullet, don't SAY it like that!'"
"HELLO, BOYS! I'M BACK!"
the two absent ones: you and i / you and i are the two absent ones
"but mighty odd children they were, known ever after for their strangeness, their magnetic charm, the glimpse of them fey and frightening in the right light."
"i didn't want to hug you into a cross, but i'm here to be measured down to each numbered bone."
"gods would ne'er weep as man would, my love, for they are vain and callous creatures."
"you're staring at a man you don't recognize and think: i don't know what to do with myself. you shatter the mirror, and think: this is the man i become."
he and i are closer than friends. we are enemies linked together. the same sin binds us.
"all it took was a special look and i felt i knew you before, i didn't mean to love you, didn't think it would work out"
"everything is as it was before me. and the electricity disperses from my brain til it’s just dead tissue. meat. oblivion. and all the other little things that make me up, microbes, bacterium they just keep on living and i am broken apart"
"i beg you, eat me up. want me down to the marrow. and yet manage it so as to keep me alive."
i beg at the altars of glass bottles. nobody touches me. i sting.
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
"just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes."
everything’s got to end sometime. otherwise nothing would ever get started.
"blood on my shirt, rose in my hand / you're looking at me like you don't know who I am"
"in the silence of the night i loose myself, / it makes me drunken with its sweet blue sound."
"you're runnin' through my veins, something i can't change / that's the same reason why we're / further apart, the closer that we are"
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"what i'd saved: lost. worse: i lost it. can't even tell myself that i sort of lost it, that lost, i keep it still. i lost the saved. / i've lost. i'm lost."
"i know that name. i know you. there was blood, and masks, and blades raised."
babygirl i've got issues you've never even heard of
to cry is very russian. tears salty and vodka-laced.
"as i descend further into a madness that grips me by the throat and won’t let me go, not until i’ve hated myself so fully that i forget what i look like and what my name is and the people who love me. not until i’m left feeling hollowed out and alone."
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
"stay, and decay."
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
"an object cannot make you good or evil. the temptation of power, forbidden knowledge, even the desire to do good can lead some down that path. but only you can change yourself."
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
in every lifetime i will find myself in your embrace / twin flames you and i / in how many more must i bleed out?
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
"carried these bruises half my life. look in the mirror, see more there, can't remember what i look like without 'em."
"i gave you my sword, my heart and my faith"
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
"suddenly you’re ripped into being alive. and life is pain, and life is suffering, and life is horror, but my god you’re alive and it’s spectacular."
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
"it's as if i'm anaesthetized, absent."
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
"scraping your blood off my floorboards tonight / even though i've lost you / you'll never leave me, will you? / you've bled into the wood, / this stain is as dark as the wine we shared."
i bleed &amp; can't stop bleeding / i speak &amp; my mouth is my biggest wound
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."
"he wraps the rosarie around my throat and pulls, the air drawn from my lungs. i'm gasping, clawing at the precious beads, and watch as black flecks invade my field of vision. then, i slump; another altar boy for the heavenly choir."
walking on the sunny side of neurosis
angels with filthy souls
longed for him. got him. shit.
"so you can wipe off that grin, i know where you've been / it's all been a pack of lies"
"you'd know that, because god listens to johnny cash &amp; smokes winstons in his red pick-up. because i call god 'sir,' sometimes wishing i could call him 'dad'."
RY *   seen   some   of   you  using   my   filters   without   crediting   me .  reminder   to   please   credit   @PATHOLOGlST !
"you won’t eat me up, in the end, and i urge you: bite me."
"humanity has spread to the stars. we set out like ancient seafarers to explore the limitless ocean of space. but no matter how far we venture into the unknown, the worst monsters are those we bring with us."
"these hearts were woven of human joys and cares, /washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.  / the years had given them kindness. dawn was theirs, /and sunset, and the colours of the earth."
"loving you isn't the right thing to do, how can i ever change things that i feel?"
dreamed blood tastes like salt / as if in human failure lay the silence of god
"he wants to say, 'i love you. nothing can hurt you.' but he thinks this is a lie, so he says in the end: 'you're dead, nothing can hurt you.' which seems to him a more promising beginning, more true."
"sweet child, you are wrath given life."
this war is a disease. passed through blood spilled by warriors.
the color of god is a stain / shaped to you like a grief not yet come
"RUN BOY RUN, BREAK OUT FROM SOCIETY."
dad? am i everything you wanted me to be?
i'm going to be older than my father ever got to be.
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
il faut souhaiter être préservé de la seule manière que la nature sache: l'argile qui ne pourrit jamais.
"father of mine, tell me, what do you see?"
"today, i didn't serve god. i misplaced my faith. but i have to believe a god of love is also a god of forgiveness."
lick on my knife / and honour the taste
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
to apologize! to be saved! to forgive! to forget! to be pure!
he’s going to die in his arms before they have even ever kissed and it will all be very poetic and tragic. it will make a splendid opera. he hopes everyone cries.
i can't hold enough of you in my hands
"don't fall for monsters,"
"they’ll speak of my name, of my battles and wars, / but here is the thing; what’s my name without yours?"
"nine hundred years of time and space, and i've never met anyone who wasn't important."
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
i think my life is losing momentum / i think my ways are wearing me down
"up there we will fight with each other, and the one who pushes the other over will become king and be able to drink blood."
it gets complicated when they come in for their counterattack. everybody hates a victim who won't stop fighting back.
"loneliness is important. so is love, and the lack of it."
"i need you to be a monster / which is to say, i am trying not to love you / which is to say, i am still dreaming of kissing your claws."
"remember learning that saints were only people whose pain was notable, noted."
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
hell ain′t the last thing that i'm fighting tonight
you only have to look at the medusa straight on to see her. and she’s not deadly. she’s beautiful and she’s laughing.
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
don't dance with me / danger lives and danger breathes
i beg at the altars of glass bottles. nobody touches me. i sting.
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
"call to mind that noontide of supreme happiness, behold once more that image of angelic beauty, the spirit of love itself, as she came to meet you; it was through her, through her alone, that you seemed assured of your own higher existence."
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet / talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
people linked by destiny will always find each other.
"the perfect match, you and me i adapt, contagious; you open up, say welcome."
and tomorrow come / and i'll be waitin' / with my head held high / i'm not lookin' to run
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
"violets from plug street wood-think what they have meant to me-life and hope and love and you. (and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so.)"
"because freedom, i am told, is nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey."
"old hungers / will break their coffins, rise to eat and thank."
"you're a man now, boy"
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
you don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.
"well, if you told me you were drowning, i would not lend a hand / i've seen your face before, my friend"
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
"Yeah, kid, i think you need to take a look in the mirror / take that look in the mirror / i’m the big shot in your life now / i’m the one who makes sense"
"death, lonely death, beneath the withered leaves."
so this is how liberty dies. with thunderous applause.
"you know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common: they don’t alter their views to fit the facts. they alter the facts to fit their views."
don't know if you love me or you want me dead
longed for him. got him. shit.
and the ground has been slowly pulling us back down / you see it on both our skin / we get a few years and then it wants us back
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
"and ever anon you heave a sigh, as some hidden memory wrought you."
but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
"there is blood everywhere and i am lost in it. i breathe blood, not air."
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
letting it get to you. you know what that’s called? being alive. best thing there is. being alive right now is all that counts.
no fire to extinguish this wounded rage. no prayer.
"you've missed everything, and understood nothing."
"'this is wonderful!' 'this is going to be fine!' 'i love this!' i was soon to change my mind, however."
RY *   good   lord .  just   seen   nwh .   marvel   muses   PLEASE   interact   with   @BRlGHTKNIGHT .
"hard not to fall for you, i gave you all my heart"
maybe i've done enough / finally catching up / for the first time i see an image of my brokenness / utterly worthy of love / maybe i've done enough
you take the things you love and you tear them apart.
"heartless challenge, pick your path and i’ll pray"
"love is destruction / but this war is mine, this war is mine"
you will never be lovelier than you are now. we will never be here again.
"you can have the light of the world blind you, bath you in grace / but i don't see so easily what you hold in your hands"
"rage is so oft described as red, white–hot. it has so many colors. jealousy is green, sadness blue. grief is black. it doesn't get a color. because it's empty, all–swallowing void."
"i fully, fully intend to kill you — but first, we're gonna make you suffer."
"oh, who will unsnarl my body / into gestures of love?"
i will take a crowbar and pry out the broken pieces of god in me.
"you'd know that, because god listens to johnny cash &amp; smokes winstons in his red pick-up. because i call god 'sir,' sometimes wishing i could call him 'dad'."
"and i'm kneeling in the last pew, begging for promised absolution. confess, repent, the day i die rotten."
but what could i want with riches? the true wealth is the love of one’s people.
maybe i'm hiding behind metaphor / maybe my heart needs to break to be sure / one day i'll wear it on my sleeve / the insignificant with the sacred unique
'you think my convictions are for sale?' 'why not?' came the cold response.
"my pulse grew less and less; / pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower."
'i could fix him' good for you. i joined him in his insanity
"you're a man now, boy"
"then it comes to me: yes i’ll die, so will everyone, so has everyone. it’s what we have in common. and, for a moment, the sorrow ceased, and i saw that it hadn’t been sorrow after all, but loneliness, and for a few moments, it was gone."
late night devil put your hands on me
crime as a wicked judgment. the road to ideals paved with bloodshed and carnage.
though he was cruel like the winter / she clung like flowers to thorns
"'i warn you, i'll break your heart.' 'already broken.'"
i love your pain / and how it makes me feel inside / i love your pain / and how it opens you so wide
and if my child needed protection / from a fucker like that man / i'd sooner gut him / 'cause nothing cuts like a mother
pissed off beats scared every time
and again he asks me to kill him. one more time before he falls to his knees and sobs. and i get it. i do. because i have a brother too.
i guess all i am is temporary
"sweetheart, you look a little tired / when did you last eat? / come in and make yourself right at home / stay as long as you need / tell me, is something wrong? / if something's wrong, you can count on me / you know i'll take my heart clean apart if it helps yours beat"
ma vie est une énigme dont ton nom est le mot.
"people kiss and hold hands and fall in love and fuck and laugh and hurt others and nurse broken hearts and start wars and pull sleeping children out of car seats and shout at each other. If you could harness that energy—that constant, roving hunger—you could do wonders with it."
"prayers are for the weak, i'll stick to beating your ass in court."
"suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness."
for what felt like five minutes of my life i wanted everything with you.
i desire the things that will destroy me in the end.
we’re too old to play games. we’re only human.
"then, that’s when, where you are unwoven weft, flesh that lets strangeness come through, defenseless being, without resistance, without batten, without skin,"
"late night devil, put your hands on me"
was a time i was scared of you. was a time i'd piss myself having a gun pointed at my head. you know what i feel right now? not a god damned thing.
es irrt der mensch so lang er strebt.
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
i'm not letting you die
"because caesar is dead and i'm taking his crown / voyage to rome, my way homebound / step back, i'm running this town"
"tight jeans, loose morals."
the price of your greed is your son and your daughter
"while there the vulture beats his wings, / the pulse of war throbs fever high, / here for a little space i lie / and dream of little things."
"because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. to be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted."
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
"how would he know what’s forbidden to him when his friend is laid out for him, like a carcass on the butcher’s slab, so often and so easily. what part of this is not meant for him?"
"'i warn you, i'll break your heart.' 'already broken.'"
one man can stop the motor of the world
"i think i could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, ‘i exist.’ in thousands of agonies - i exist. I’m tormented on the rack - but i exist! though I sit alone in a pillar - i exist!"
one day this graveyard is going to be full. where do we go from there?
i will admit the lows keep me alive. if it wasn't for the changes i would probably die.
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"never cruel or cowardly. never give up, never give in."
my lips are full of ruby lies. smooth criminal dancing in forgotten light. put on a trail for breaking. for hurting.
"i know exactly how the rule goes / put my mask on first / no, i don't want to talk about myself / tell me where it hurts / i just want to build you up, build you up / 'til you're good as new / and maybe one day i will get around to fixing myself too"
"but listen, listen, listen: / songbirds singing their sweet melodies &amp; the nymphs dancing in the brook."
"he doesn't want to save the world. he wants to save little worlds, little worlds that belong to people. the worlds they think no one wants to touch."
you only have to look at the medusa straight on to see her. and she’s not deadly. she’s beautiful and she’s laughing.
sometimes you get so close to someone you end up on the other side of them.
"there’s this dream, something important. it’s gone when i wake up. no time for dreams i guess."
but i don't mean a word when / i tell you that i love you / in my mind i am above you
"i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."
"in vietnamese, the word for missing someone and remembering them is the same: nhớ. sometimes, when you ask me over the phone, có nhớ mẹ không? i flinch, thinking you meant, do you remember me?"
HOLY / HOLY / HOLY
this bitter man he is
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"the monster never dies no matter how many times you kill it. it just sheds its skin and changes form. i can feel the weight of the world pushing me down, i try to carry it nonetheless. one last time, then i can rest."
"not to feel is never a step forward, scarcely a relief."
"i didn't want to hug you into a cross, but i'm here to be measured down to each numbered bone."
"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
CAVE CANEM / BEWARE THE DOG
"did you know people get rich off of sadness? i want to meet the millionaire of american sadness. i want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, 'it's been an honor to serve my country.'"
i had him bless these hands just to run you out / give me strength when you run your mouth
"oh, can you hear her a-weeping? / crying his name on the moors / though he was cruel like the winter / she clung like flowers to thorns"
"always longed for these hideous guttings, leaks of anguished, bloody love. and to wake up alone and unscathed."
our hands empty except for our hands
aren't you just as tired of the fear within me? / then throw your gun in the river! what do you say?
"there's no such thing as fighting dirty. you fight, and you survive, or you don't. there is no other end to it."
i can't hold enough of you in my hands
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
"the life that we live and the love that i give to her / each day it grows more and more i'm sure, it shows"
this ain't where the legends come from / you're not what a hero looks like
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
how do you get in the mind-state to kill?
"my own sunset-skinned heart waiting to be held and peeled,"
your whole life is oscar bait.
"when i die, i will come in fast and low. i will stick the landing."
"after losing someone like her, it's easy to feel alone in this world. but you are children of this family, and i welcome you home."
"if you must know anything, know that the hardest task is to live only once."
"your reflection is your very worst enemy,"
but what could i want with riches? the true wealth is the love of one’s people.
"some people live more in twenty years than others do in eighty. it’s not the time that matters, it’s the person."
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
i prayed that god might return you to me.
in every lifetime i will find myself in your embrace / twin flames you and i / in how many more must i bleed out?
last night i dreamt that your head lay on my stomach and traced the rise and fall of my breath.
"this is what it comes down to: you, me, and a single bullet."
take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
"mothers know the look in her eyes; soldiers learn to watch for it, to mark the moments where disaster may come swiftly"
"what was it like to love? oh, it was burning. where did it burn? everywhere. it burned everywhere."
they've grown up. and grown tired of me.
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
"'this is wonderful!' 'this is going to be fine!' 'i love this!' i was soon to change my mind, however."
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
i never loved you but i almost did.
and love is for the birds / when things are complicated
"after losing someone like her, it's easy to feel alone in this world. but you are children of this family, and i welcome you home."
i cannot say i am familiar with forgiveness.
"you know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common: they don’t alter their views to fit the facts. they alter the facts to fit their views."
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"soon, alas, a storm comes up, my memory clouds over, in a flash there are shipwrecks, i cannot even cry out, my mouth is full of saltwater sobs. i am flooded with vague, deceptive recollections, i am drowning in my imagination in tears borrowed from the most familiar tragedies,"
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy"
"i gave you devotion, my blood and my life"
in the drunk'ness of solitude i fear no more the solemn realms of death / no single sigh from my lips as i drink the wine of bitterness / my heart is aching nevermore for i know that all may end
"all it took was a special look and i felt i knew you before, i didn't mean to love you, didn't think it would work out"
"i know exactly how the rule goes / put my mask on first / no, i don't want to talk about myself / tell me where it hurts / i just want to build you up, build you up / 'til you're good as new / and maybe one day i will get around to fixing myself too"
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
"a ghost can be a lot of things. a memory, a daydream. a secret. guilt, grief, anger. but in my experience, most times they're just what we want to see—"
"oh, rage / is it in my veins?"
your sin gonna waste you brother / no way you'll be alright
"RY *  hey  fellas ,  gentle   reminder   that   i   do   this   for   fun ,  I   Promise   I  Am   Okay .   if   you   need   to   reach   me ,  please   just   dm   me   on   @PATHOLOGlST .   i   check   dms   here   once   a   month !"
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
there is a certain level of accountability that comes from permanence.
the butterflies you give me are making me nauseous
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
"now i don’t kill for anyone but myself, and every time that i take a life, i know the value of it."
"don't do love, don't do friends / i'm only after success"
"you once told me that the human eye is god's loneliest creation. how so much of the world passes through the pupil and still it holds nothing. The eye, alone in its socket, doesn't even know there's another one, just like it, an inch away, just as hungry, as empty."
"the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows / it's no stranger to you and me"
i wake up each day furious to be laboring under capitalism.
"these children will feel the emptiness but won't know what to call it. they'll grow up suffering from emotional loneliness, but won't know what's wrong. they'll just feel different from people who seem truly at ease."
maybe i've done enough / finally catching up / for the first time i see an image of my brokenness / utterly worthy of love / maybe i've done enough
a child weaned on poison considers harm a comfort
"i'm alone, 'cause this house don't feel like home"
"this life? my life? you don't want it. you wake up, get up, you fight. day in and day out. it doesn't end until you're being shipped away in a body bag."
i smile before i want to / i smile because you want to
you seem to replace your brain with your heart / you take things so hard and then you fall apart
"i didn't know that the war was still inside you, that there was a war to begin with, that once it enters you it never leaves—but merely echoes,"
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet?
"i didn't want to hug you into a cross, but i'm here to be measured down to each numbered bone."
sleeping in new beds / have you ever loved someone this much?
"floodlights: you are center stage, with your fists curled to your sides, and the whole world watching you."
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
"inconnue, elle était ma forme préférée, / celle qui m’enlevait le souci d’être un homme, / et je la vois et je la perds et je subis / ma douleur, comme un peu de soleil de l’eau froide."
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
so shoot me. do it. i'll come back.
GNASH BONE BENEATH YOUR FIST / TASTE COPPER IN THE AIR / OPEN YOURSELF TO ME
i always wanted to be a saint / but i thought i’d be one of the miserable onessainted by painburnt alive inside
i swear to god the devil made me do it
"i know that name. i know you. there was blood, and masks, and blades raised."
"a dream most somber, the ghost of a lover's touch, my temple to caressing palm / oh, carry my dreams so"
"he doesn't have to be atlas. i would hold him through the night and into the dawn, if only he would let me. i'd swallow his tears &amp; keep the world from hearing him."
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
something horrible is happening inside of me and i don't know why.
"so i drown, / within him, die, and find death good."
"who are your children now, and who pried their childhood out of your shaking hands?"
death at the gates again / howling my name / i can't greet you today
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"the wound is also the place where the skin reencounters itself, asking of each end, where have you been?"
the next click you hear is me hanging up. the one after that—is me pulling the trigger.
what in the name of god was i ever going to be but this?
"RUN BOY RUN, BREAK OUT FROM SOCIETY."
we'll never get free / lamb to the slaughter
i walked beside the woman i had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a conversation about cats.
there is telepathy between hearts.
"you are temptation, all i desire"
"they will want you to succeed, but never more than them. they will write their names on your leash and call you necessary, call you urgent."
"because caesar is dead and i'm taking his crown / voyage to rome, my way homebound / step back, i'm running this town"
"floodlights: you are center stage, with your fists curled to your sides, and the whole world watching you."
the color of god is a stain / shaped to you like a grief not yet come
"coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones,"
"we missed redemption, missed reflection, kissed the weapon"
angels with filthy souls
he is my brother. but i must kill him and keep strong to do it.
"you can have the light of the world blind you, bath you in grace / but i don't see so easily what you hold in your hands"
"tired of this body, so cumbersome and heavy"
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
sometimes being offered tenderness feels like the very proof that you've been ruined.
"rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead."
"wandering through the desert snow and shining a light up at the afternoon moon, how my love made the impossible happen."
"i gave you my sword, my heart and my faith"
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
"don't you know? i don't feel like fighting anymore. it's not been my fight in a long time. and i'm tired. unbearably so. so just—you let me rest, alright, champ? you just let me rest. you'll do me proud."
never was anything great achieved without danger.
"il y a des choses, des désirs en chacun de nous qu’il vaut mieux étouffer. ou au moins, qu’il est impossible d’exprimer dans un contexte civilisé."
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side."
i can't love a hero.
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
based? based on what?
"feeling turned to thought, but my character seemed split into a thousand parts; each part was independent and had its own consciousness, and in vain did the head command limbs, which, like faithless vassals, would not obey its author."
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
you can have my heart if you have the stomach to take it. kiss me hard enough to invert me.
when we were gods (never let me forget that)
pissed off beats scared every time
"we shall give, says father"
is it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?
but the lies they will hurt you / hold on / human kindness desert you
boys will always want to be better than their fathers.
"i just want to love you, to love you, to love you well / i just want to learn how, somehow, to be loved myself"
"grace is a gift for the fallen, dear; you're an angry blade, and you're brave, but you're all alone."
only in death will we have our own names since only in death are we no longer part of the effort.
HOLY / HOLY / HOLY
cause nothin' good comes after midnight / ain't no good love comes from pain
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
a name means a lot just by itself
'you think my convictions are for sale?' 'why not?' came the cold response.
"so i drown, / within him, die, and find death good."
you're fuckin' with sickness baby / your heart is a plague on mine
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
how sweet. that rain. how something that lives only to fall can be nothing but sweet.
it's decided. i am going to hurt him.
"essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it not?"
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
"in vietnamese, the word for missing someone and remembering them is the same: nhớ. sometimes, when you ask me over the phone, có nhớ mẹ không? i flinch, thinking you meant, do you remember me?"
i’ve polished this anger and now it’s a knife. / i’m hardened as a hunter ornamenting his cave with the bones of the dead.
one man can stop the motor of the world
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"like communion bread, / your words dissolve in my mouth / and never die."
you seem to replace your brain with your heart / you take things so hard and then you fall apart
this was always going to happen. / she's been dead since the beginning.
"suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness."
do you believe in free will or fate?
"if you’re gonna look at yourself, really look in the mirror, you gotta admit who you are. but not just to yourself, you gotta admit it to everybody else."
"a ghost can be a lot of things. a memory, a daydream. a secret. guilt, grief, anger. but in my experience, most times they're just what we want to see—"
"oh, rage / is it in my veins?"
"i'm not growing up, i'm aging / my mind's incarcerated"
based? based on what?
"you wish you could hold me at knifepoint again. you do, still, in a way."
take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
plunge a dagger into your heart and don't stop until you're choking on promises unfulfilled.
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
"the high whine of blood along the inner ear, the body / in extremis, drunk on tiles, the body that cannot / think its way out of itself, the body angelized, the noise of it / so loud the questions all become one like the / sinews in an arm,"
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
"this world has taken so much for me. but in all my pain, even in my darkest days, i swore ... i swore it would never take you."
it's decided. i am going to hurt him.
"a boy so fragile-looking that he appeared to be made out of glass, with the hardness of his expression slowly dissolving into tentative uncertainty."
bitter / and know this
"you better run, boy, run. but be afraid"
"and the eighth wonder of the world / is that i who have died am now / alive again, here on this earth / for no other reason than to love you."
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
the show must go on
"a final act of defiance, written in blood: i, the worst of all."
everything you see / is going to vanish suddenly / this is just a dream
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
"make it personal. do as much damage as you can. get your message across. that way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. of being considered dangerous."
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
i have folded my sorrows like fitted bedsheets (...)
call it what you like. you are an attack dog on another man's leash. i make my own way. i'm not a tool for someone else to use.
swallow your grief. we have no time for it now.
there's no making it right. only surviving.
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"home is a place of perfect belonging, wholeness. home is an instinct, a yearning that has never, ever been satisfied, that can never be eradicated"
"so let me stay tender-hearted, despite despite despite"
"i just want to love you, to love you, to love you well / i just want to learn how, somehow, to be loved myself"
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"me, inhaling / the tears of the kneeling angel."
das morbide und todessehnsüchtige.
"people that can hurt you, the ones that can really hurt you, are the ones that are close enough to do it."
&amp; so what–if my feathers / are burning. i / never asked for flight.
this kid's not alright.
"i'm alone, 'cause this house don't feel like home"
"oh, i adore you, my good—looking boy."
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
nothing i do is ever good / nothing i do is ever good enough
"the rotten tree-trunk, until the very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two, has all the appearance of might it ever had."
"they will want you to succeed, but never more than them. they will write their names on your leash and call you necessary, call you urgent."
i can't save us / my atlantis
it was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry i had strapped about me. the rest were unequivocal sentences of death.
don't dance with me / danger lives and danger breathes
"rest then, love. you have nothing to fear"
"the trees shall whisper to him: “see, see the blood – the splashes on our bark!” walking the meadows, he shall hear bones crackle, and fleshless mouths shall gibber in silent lanes at dark."
"you once told me that the human eye is god's loneliest creation. how so much of the world passes through the pupil and still it holds nothing. The eye, alone in its socket, doesn't even know there's another one, just like it, an inch away, just as hungry, as empty."
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
there are always worse things i could do.
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"violets from plug street wood, sweet, i send you oversea. (it is strange they should be blue, blue, when his soaked blood was red, for they grew around his head; it is strange they should be blue.)"
"scream up to my god, say, 'i do what i can' / how am i gonna move on from this circumstance?"
"hope is rising in me, like sap in a tree. blood in a wound."
but it's too late for holy water now / sooner or later the fire dies down / i'll open up my eyes
"pick up your weapon and face it / there's blood on the crown, go and take it / you get one shot to make it out alive"
"if you’re raised with an angry man in your house, there will always be an angry man in your house. you will find him even when he is not there. and if one day you find that there is no angry man in your house—well, you will go find one and invite him in."
"was she then to be lost to me? nay, for as she left this vale of sorrows, she had kindled the eternal love that now glowed within me."
you sold your friends like guns for hire
"eurydice, dying now for a second time, uttered no complaint against her husband. what was there to complain of, but that she had been loved?"
"an object cannot make you good or evil. the temptation of power, forbidden knowledge, even the desire to do good can lead some down that path. but only you can change yourself."
i've polished this anger and now it's a knife.
"habibi, light is burning / as i am burning / habibi, light is burning / as i am yearning"
"there’s this dream, something important. it’s gone when i wake up. no time for dreams i guess."

"in the end, it was someone else, in longing, who finds us?"
"i have known the body of my mother, sick and then dying"
"i can tell when i'm with you, you're with her."
i clung to your hands so that something human might exist in the chaos.
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
"how do i live? how do i breathe? / when you're not here, i'm suffocating / i want to feel love run through my blood / tell me, is this where i give it all up?"
"isn't all that rage so ugly? and isn't it mine, still? good god, isn't it mine?"
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"you have been blessed with a burden,"
crime as a wicked judgment. the road to ideals paved with bloodshed and carnage.
spare the sympathy / everybody wants to be my enemy
no one will ever stop me taking care of you.
"coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones,"
"and so, today, i am sinning. / i am sinking beneath reality."
a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.
"with the heart beating quickly in fear and ecstasy, and a hope, a hope, a hope"
"but fuck it, you’ve got to make a stand somewhere. and a man can stave off his own death wish for only so long."
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
i can still close my eyes &amp; trace every curve &amp; dip of your soul.
'i could fix him' yeah? well could accept him as he is. you don't like the murder? grow up. the atrocities are part of him and ive decided they're funny.

"death and romance, the riddles of our lifetimes / tryna get a slow dance, middle of a knife fight"
"went and found the limelight, wasn't in the vision to disappear, no"
based? based on what?
"letting someone show you tenderness is an act of love, too."
"i learnt long ago to hate my enemies, but i’ve never loved one before."
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
my lover's a serial killer / but I'll always stay with her
maybe i'm hiding behind metaphor / maybe my heart needs to break to be sure / one day i'll wear it on my sleeve / the insignificant with the sacred unique
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
they say you used to be so kind / i never knew you had such a dirty mind
'give me your hand.' 'i'll stain it.' 'i'll take it.'
'are you catholic?' 'i am tonight.'
i'm a goth girl on the inside. on the outside? a father figure.
"i think i'm going to die in your arms. funny thing, predicting inevitability. we'll have to wait and see."
"did our mothers invent loneliness, or did it make them our mothers?"
"vengeance is a cold thing, baby / i serve it on a bed of pain / still think you a hot one, baby?"
"you stole from me. not just who i was but who i could’ve been. you stole from me things i didn’t even have yet. you reached through time,"
RY *  noticed  a  typo .  i'll  fix  that .
this bitter man he is
he's an irredeemable villain to YOU. i understand him though.

"the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows / it's no stranger to you and me"
"and i just need more time / i know, i know, i'm asking for the moon / but i must listen to intuition / believe me, i only want what's right"
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"i can tell when i'm with you, you're with her."
"and i'm kneeling in the last pew, begging for promised absolution. confess, repent, the day i die rotten."
"people liked me back then, what can I say?"
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
this was always going to happen. / she's been dead since the beginning.
"it's not you, it's me, why i keep coming around"
"angels sing the final song / silence will turn to sleep / take heed, my son / the darkness will come"
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
"heartless challenge, pick your path and i’ll pray"
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
a dagger and a silk heart.
"you're runnin' through my veins, something i can't change / that's the same reason why we're / further apart, the closer that we are"
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
and the thousand mouths of my damned thirst / i offered to that open fountain in your suffering.
"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
"you love tenderly and warmly, but your love is like friendship. that's why you have good friends, you're sociable, sympathetic toward people. until this dissatisfaction comes over you-you know what i'm talking about."
"home is a place of perfect belonging, wholeness. home is an instinct, a yearning that has never, ever been satisfied, that can never be eradicated"
"we missed redemption, missed reflection, kissed the weapon"
"father hasn't been home / i'm the man now, i'm the man"
"i lean to you, numb as a fossil. tell me i'm here."
"this isn't how it's supposed to be. no, frankie, this isn't how i'm supposed to die!"
"he don't run from nothin', dog / get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over"
"i will slog over this endless road to its end. / until my heart stops, i will slog over this endless, endless road"
just this once—everybody lives.
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
do you believe in free will or fate?
"you're a man now, boy"
"a white wisp of cloud drifted by. that's what dying will be like, he told himself. just floating up in the air. nothing bad about that. he smiled a little."
"he paces like it's going out of fashion, a worried thing looking like death warmed over. it's stinking up the place. which would be funny, if this weren't a morgue and he hadn't just come back."
"death, lonely death, beneath the withered leaves."
"but when i die, i want it to hurt. when my friends leave, when i have to let go, when this entire town is wiped off the map, i want it to hurt. bad. because that means it meant something."
"baby mine, the soft world you know ain't the truth i've fed you. it's cold, hard, and every day is the lord's test."
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"you'll have me. no matter how thick the night, i will always be there to light your way."
"'you can't make promises you can't keep.' 'we're in washington, they're the only promises we're allowed to make!'"
maybe praying will help.
i find you deeply disturbing (romantic)
do you have any weapons on you? — i have a longing that's killing me.
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
for what felt like five minutes of my life i wanted everything with you.
"the life that we live and the love that i give to her / each day it grows more and more i'm sure, it shows"
"angels sing the final song / silence will turn to sleep / take heed, my son / the darkness will come"
"my pulse quickened—a flutter, like little bird wings trapped between my lungs."

"even money, which shines so much, spits sometimes."
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"but in this handmade heaven, i come alive"
or else wake up destined for devourment.
"as i descend further into a madness that grips me by the throat and won’t let me go, not until i’ve hated myself so fully that i forget what i look like and what my name is and the people who love me. not until i’m left feeling hollowed out and alone."
i'm going to pull time apart for you.
"all i ever wanted was to be there for people in the darkness, and tell them that the night can't hurt you. that the things that you're afraid of in shadow are still dangerous in the light of day, and that there is nothing in the darkness other than mystery."
one day this graveyard is going to be full. where do we go from there?
i will burn your kingdom down if you try to conquer me and mine
"when they ask you where you’re from, tell them your name was fleshed from the toothless mouth of a war-woman. that you were not born but crawled, headfirst— into the hunger of dogs. my son, tell them the body is a blade that sharpens by cutting."
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"SPOCK: i came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. however, your 'insight' has convinced me otherwise. therefore, the only emotion i wish to convey is gratitude. thank you, ministers, for your consideration. (a contained 'fuck you') live long and prosper."
the boy who fell into the sky / had no one there to watch him cry
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
so hopelessly devoted to you
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
most will only have one death. i will have two.
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
it gets complicated when they come in for their counterattack. everybody hates a victim who won't stop fighting back.
i am graceless. no. worse than that.
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
"this is where the bruises come from / this is when the game gets ugly / these blood, sweat, tears keep running / licking my plate 'cause i'm so hungry"
"to die for one’s people is a great sacrifice. to live for one’s people, an even greater sacrifice. i choose to live for my people."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"guilt in sinks, i feel you crawl under my skin / 'cause after all, i can only blame myself / my neglect turned you into an insect, now you won't let me be"
"what was it like to love? oh, it was burning. where did it burn? everywhere. it burned everywhere."
you were my brother. rest in hell.
our respect had once been mutual. but that was before the envy.
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"lord, please give me patience, 'cause if you give me strength i will need bail money too."
the daylight holds you close / but tonight you are mine
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
GNASH BONE BENEATH YOUR FIST / TASTE COPPER IN THE AIR / OPEN YOURSELF TO ME
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
"they laughed bitterly. we drank, and remembered when the world was softer,"
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
"yet, she laughs strangely, no longer the giggling girl she used to be but free in a way you have never seen. her smile can drop so fast now, her now-old eyes can turn distant and glassy, and her tears, now rarer, are always silent."
maybe i've done enough / finally catching up / for the first time i see an image of my brokenness / utterly worthy of love / maybe i've done enough
liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar
"'everybody has to deal with this question of who and what he is.  i have to deal with it because i’m a writer. writers have to make use of it all, every bit of it. that’s all you’ve got. you take it or you die.'"
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
you don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
she's an irredeemable villain to YOU. i understand her though.
"the wound is also the place where the skin reencounters itself, asking of each end, where have you been?"
"i've missed you, he says. / in my chest, the sound of an exhausted swallow falling gently to earth."
and suddenly i'm someone that prays / a last minute man of faith
"you always break the kindest heart  / with a hasty word you can't recall, so / if i broke your heart last night / it's because i love you most of all"
"suddenly you’re ripped into being alive. and life is pain, and life is suffering, and life is horror, but my god you’re alive and it’s spectacular."
"in the darkness dreams seem to fade, too far out of reach, for now i just miss the light."
"i'll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it's been waiting inside me the whole time."
"and though he's not alone, he fears to never love another / and leave his heart forever with her smile"
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
tell you you're the greatest / but once you turn they hate us
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
I WANT YOU INSIDE ME LIKE A HORROR. I WANT YOU TO REND ME WITH YOUR TEETH..
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"resting on a knife, you heavy souls / with all this weight buckling down on you now / don't you drown and float away / not a good time to lose control"
"the perfect match, you and me i adapt, contagious; you open up, say welcome."
"as far back as he could remember, it seemed that his father had fought the devil all the time."
but it's too late for holy water now / sooner or later the fire dies down / i'll open up my eyes
"you're out of time, make your move / live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back"
"this is where the bruises come from / this is when the game gets ugly / these blood, sweat, tears keep running / licking my plate 'cause i'm so hungry"
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
this is the story you asked for. i leave it in your mouth.
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
"i took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, i’d just as soon kill you myself, i say."
"and the eighth wonder of the world / is that i who have died am now / alive again, here on this earth / for no other reason than to love you."
"'cause with god as my witness, you corporate fucking prick, i did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick"
an autumn whispers between the maples kept urging: die with me.
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
there is telepathy between hearts.
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
"this life? my life? you don't want it. you wake up, get up, you fight. day in and day out. it doesn't end until you're being shipped away in a body bag."
this is democracy manifest.
things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
you take the things you love and you tear them apart.
"grief so unseemly all who glance it wade away; head of unkempt raven locks, wear under under dark, hollowed eyes. you've seen things. and you let people know."
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
cupid shoots to kill
"as the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,  / moving in marches upon the heavenly plain; / as the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, / to the end, to the end, they remain."
hopefully one day you will know what the moon feels like in your hands. that’s how it felt to first hold you.
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
"this is your life, this is still your life"
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
wearing rose—tinted glasses / all i see is red / battered &amp; beaten optimist
"i have known the body of my mother, sick and then dying"
"who will be lost in ourselves? a story, after all, is a kind of swallowing. to open a mouth, in speech, is to leave only the bones, which remain untold."
she's an irredeemable villain to YOU. i understand her though.
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
the next click you hear is me hanging up. the one after that—is me pulling the trigger.
tell you you're the greatest / but once you turn they hate us
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
i walked beside the woman i had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a conversation about cats.
"me, inhaling / the tears of the kneeling angel."
"soldier, back from the distant fray, with the bandaged arm and the ribbon gay, where have you been so long away, and what have your travels taught you?"
"well, if you told me you were drowning, i would not lend a hand / i've seen your face before, my friend"

"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
"it begins in the throat, a sense of wrong,"
"but when i die, i want it to hurt. when my friends leave, when i have to let go, when this entire town is wiped off the map, i want it to hurt. bad. because that means it meant something."

he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
and suddenly i'm someone that prays / a last minute man of faith / but i'll leave behind miles and miles of jagged lines / upon the surface of the divine / i wish i could set them straight
"father hasn't been home / i'm the man now, i'm the man"
in the worst storm in heaven / in the warmth of your heart

"you say i'm a side character, like i don't know it. but i am what makes him great. what's sherlock without watson?"
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"i'll be a story in your head. that's okay. we're all stories in the end. just make it a good one, eh? 'cause it was, you know. it was the best."
because a bullet without a body is a song without ears.

"decades later, guarded by a forest of roses and thorns, lies a corpse refusing to rot."
"come on, shoot faster / just a little bit of energy! / i wanna try something fun right now / i guess some people call it anarchy!"

"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
you want to know what it was like? / it was like my whole life had a fever. / whole acres of me were on fire. / the sun talked dirty in my ear all night.
tell you you're the greatest / but once you turn they hate us
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
"i don't despise you for what you allowed to happen to me. i despise you because when i was released, you refused to be found and i needed you more than anything in my life. not to mend my broken bones, i needed my brother to mend my broken spirit."
will you push me until i'm soaring with the stars? until i'm flying with the birds?
"you are 12 and the police tell you to come back later, they're still looking for you. milk carton poster boy."

kill what you can't save
"there's no such thing as fighting dirty. you fight, and you survive, or you don't. there is no other end to it."
to feel anything deranges you. to be seen feeling anything strips you naked
somebody showed you all of the horror / you weren't born with it

mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
"guilt is the coin of the twenty-first century. we acquire it so easily, pass it on too readily. our lives won't trade in any monetary currencies. it's about fault, now. hunt the guilty, drown them."

"he wraps the rosarie around my throat and pulls, the air drawn from my lungs. i'm gasping, clawing at the precious beads, and watch as black flecks invade my field of vision. then, i slump; another altar boy for the heavenly choir."

"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
the person in us is the part in us of error and sin. every effort of the mystics has always sought to reach the place when there is no longer anything in their soul that says “i.” but the part of the soul that says “us” is still infinitely more dangerous.
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"

"sweet child, you are wrath given life."
"me, inhaling / the tears of the kneeling angel."
je suis la reine des drames.
i bleed &amp; can't stop bleeding / i speak &amp; my mouth is my biggest wound
my lover's a serial killer / but I'll always stay with her
"a thousand years ago, and a thousand years from now — we will always be together."

"if you love me, let me go"
"the death of houses, how they seem to collapse as soon as we leave them, as soon as we prepare ourselves to leave them."

i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
my mother said i could be anything / i wanted—but i chose to live.

there are days i wish i would have loved you so i would know how to stop.

"darling, dearest, dead."
"how do i live? how do i breathe? / when you're not here, i'm suffocating / i want to feel love run through my blood / tell me, is this where i give it all up?"
i love your pain / and how it makes me feel inside / i love your pain / and how it opens you so wide
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
"a white wisp of cloud drifted by. that's what dying will be like, he told himself. just floating up in the air. nothing bad about that. he smiled a little."
"i know exactly how the rule goes / put my mask on first / no, i don't want to talk about myself / tell me where it hurts / i just want to build you up, build you up / 'til you're good as new / and maybe one day i will get around to fixing myself too"

"always longed for these hideous guttings, leaks of anguished, bloody love. and to wake up alone and unscathed."
he willed her ghost back forever / haunting his windows and doors
and in your throat you know you're lying to kids. and you know nobody belongs in this hell.
"it was only for a moment, for an instant. and then it was over, and i let her go."
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"when you start to live outside yourself, it's all dangerous."
"did you know people get rich off of sadness? i want to meet the millionaire of american sadness. i want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, 'it's been an honor to serve my country.'"
great men are forged in fire. it is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame.
letting it get to you. you know what that’s called? being alive. best thing there is. being alive right now is all that counts.
soot in my throat / grave dirt under my nails / this wicked resurrection
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
a safe pair of hands
you take the things you love and you tear them apart.
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
i'm not beaten by this yet.
happy childhoods make for dull company.
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"one last time, then i can rest."
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
he wore his silence like a mask
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
"you look at me with those brown eyes, what do you want to do?"
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.
take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them. / they assault me and throw stones and words at me / they want me to die so they can eulogize me."
"you're a gun 'cause i like you at my side at all times / you keep me safe (no, don't shoot me down)"
between killing and dying there's a third way: live
you take the things you love and you tear them apart.
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
"we missed redemption, missed reflection, kissed the weapon"
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
"put a gun to my head and tell me not to move, i’m sorry man— i’m moving"
"then, that’s when, where you are unwoven weft, flesh that lets strangeness come through, defenseless being, without resistance, without batten, without skin,"
"did you know people get rich off of sadness? i want to meet the millionaire of american sadness. i want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, 'it's been an honor to serve my country.'"
"all this time i told myself we were born from war—but i was wrong, ma."
"striding across the centuries, and death follows, churning in your wake."
"forget the body, i still have my name."
"never be cruel. never be cowardly. remember, hate is always foolish and love is always wise. always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind."
there is telepathy between hearts.
"sometimes when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry."
"don't you know? i don't feel like fighting anymore. it's not been my fight in a long time. and i'm tired. unbearably so. so just—you let me rest, alright, champ? you just let me rest. you'll do me proud."
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
"i told you long ago, on the road / i got what they waitin' for / i don't run from nothin', dog / get your soldiers, tell 'em i ain't layin' low"
"the first wild birds of the morning are breaking out of the trees. and now the night is dying on the sharp edge of the stone. let's find a corner of darkness where i will love you always, and i won't care about people or the poison that they spread."
a girl who is both death and the maiden
"because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. to be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted."
show me your thorns and i'll show you hands ready to bleed.
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
RUNNING IS A VICTORY.
is it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?
"i squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly / your heart mortally wounded,/ by the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite, / of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!"
"there are many kinds of hunger. and when we are hungry, sometimes it is our own goddamn fault."
"some days, you're the best thing in my life / sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife"
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
i am part of that power which eternally wills evil and eternally works good.
and i've moved further than I thought i could / but i missed you more than i thought i would
"IF I GUT YOU AND LEAVE YOUR BODY IN THE WOODS WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND IT, DID IT REALLY HAPPEN?"
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
"everything is as it was before me. and the electricity disperses from my brain til it’s just dead tissue. meat. oblivion. and all the other little things that make me up, microbes, bacterium they just keep on living and i am broken apart"
now is no time for breaking.
so hopelessly devoted to you
"lord, please give me patience, 'cause if you give me strength i will need bail money too."
"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
"spearing between each rib and licking the pennies off your lips, aren't i a silver—tongued liar?"
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"like communion bread, / your words dissolve in my mouth / and never die."
"then i fuck up, lost with no direction / this is my one shot at redemption"
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
slain and unknown. neither gathered up by forgetfulness / nor dispersed by memorythey're forgotten
"'you're losing blood, aren't you?' 'probably. my socks are wet.'"
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
"i took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, i’d just as soon kill you myself, i say."
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
"bleed me, baby, i'm yours."
crime as a wicked judgment. the road to ideals paved with bloodshed and carnage.
"your name will be known, a promise, a dare. / my name will be known, a promise, a prayer."
"this is a story about what it means to fall from grace and crawl to salvation, fingers open and bleeding,"
"i hold you, / and light bleeds through my fingertips."
"the dawn eats / its own faith,"
spare the sympathy / everybody wants to be my enemy
"standing between you, and anyone who wants to hurt you, is exactly where i want to be standing."
saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
"he wants to say, 'i'm sick. in my head. i can't make it stop. sorry for everything i've done &amp; haven't done yet, but will, because i fuck everything up. i will never be happy,” but the words hang like a noose around his throat, and if he says them, he thinks they'll tighten."
he was pointing at the moon but i was looking at his hand
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"never be cruel. never be cowardly. remember, hate is always foolish and love is always wise. always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind."
and tomorrow come / and i'll be waitin' / with my head held high / i'm not lookin' to run
"this isn't a war, but the breaking of seals. the undoing of life itself."
"stay, and decay."
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
an autumn whispers between the maples kept urging: die with me.
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"
i guess all i am is temporary
"i am become death, destroyer of worlds."
"when i meet charon, the ferryman, i will be sure to tell him who sent me"
your fragile heart and your paper skin
"i want to believe / no, i choose to believe / that i was made to become / a sanctuary"
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
"i stand on the shoulders of his greatness, as they do. as one day, you will."
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
i beg at the altars of glass bottles. nobody touches me. i sting.
you always hurt the one you love  / the one you shouldn't hurt at all  / you always take the sweetest rose / and crush it till the petals fall
"always on the upswing, baby,"
i’ve made it clear I am not to be trusted with a body / always leaving mine bloodless as icewith just a needle / of breath left in its lungs
"you stole from me. not just who i was but who i could’ve been. you stole from me things i didn’t even have yet. you reached through time,"
"i squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly / your heart mortally wounded,/ by the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite, / of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!"
"you are 12 and the police tell you to come back later, they're still looking for you. milk carton poster boy."
"to be loved means to be consumed. to love means to radiate with inexhaustible light. to be loved is to pass away, to love is to endure."
there's no making it right. only surviving.
my name is
"did you know people get rich off of sadness? i want to meet the millionaire of american sadness. i want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, 'it's been an honor to serve my country.'"
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
when the beating of your heart / echoes the beating of the drums / there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.
AN: does anyone wanna make a layout for this account bc i have absolutely no ideas. otherwise it's going to stay tomato themed.
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
i prayed that god might return you to me.
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
"i lean to you, numb as a fossil. tell me i'm here."
"when people press their bodies to each other, the need to feel that pressure, the embrace, is that what makes us human? maybe it's the warmth shared. i don't know."
"i learnt long ago to hate my enemies, but i’ve never loved one before."
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
you're selling this idea of who you think you need to be all the time. carrying around the weight of that ... performance. isn't it tiring? aren't you exhausted? i think it'd be exhausting.
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
"it pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety."
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, takeshi, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
in the worst storm in heaven / in the warmth of your heart
i'll keep you far away from me (like a star)
there is nothing straight about you; no motive that hasn’t another behind it; no statement that hasn’t three meanings.
"call to mind that noontide of supreme happiness, behold once more that image of angelic beauty, the spirit of love itself, as she came to meet you; it was through her, through her alone, that you seemed assured of your own higher existence."
"you're a mother, ma. you're also a monster. but so am i—which is why i can't turn away from you."
your father is only your father / until one of you forgets. like how the spine / won't remember its wings / no matter how many times our knees / kiss the pavement.
"you are temptation, all i desire"
there is a certain level of accountability that comes from permanence.
'you think my convictions are for sale?' 'why not?' came the cold response.
"as far back as he could remember, it seemed that his father had fought the devil all the time."
"hear me, herald of your fall, icarus! your ambition, vaulting and naïve in its placement, will bid you no seat amongst the table of the gods!"
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
i'm not letting you die
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
i wake up each day furious to be laboring under capitalism.
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
this war is a disease. passed through blood spilled by warriors.
maybe i've done enough / finally catching up / for the first time i see an image of my brokenness / utterly worthy of love / maybe i've done enough
april to our deathbed
"but you guys have that same fucking fire, man, and nobody can tell you two that you can’t do something. you’re gonna make it happen just in spite of them."
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
"all i ever wanted was the world,"
i'll hold it all more loosely / and yet somehow much more dearly / 'cause i've spent my whole life searching desperately / to find out that grace requires nothing / grace requires nothing of me
i just want you to be sorry too.
"if you must know anything, know that the hardest task is to live only once."
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"between the two of us / oh, my love, don't forsake me"
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
the color of god is a stain / shaped to you like a grief not yet come
you were my brother. rest in hell.
he willed her ghost back forever / haunting his windows and doors
"you are temptation, all i desire"
"time passed, and pain turned to memory."
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
"you smile and whisper in their ear but drop them just as quick,"
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
"i lost a friend today. i said some words no one should say. i watched her face change, and then i watched her walk away."
"die ehre steht über allem, sagt vater."
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
this. this is what i am. this is who i am. come hell or high water.
"in each thing there is an insinuation of death. stillness, silence, serenity are all apprenticeships."
are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet?
"let me in, wear me out,"
"no one guided me to myself. i am the guide / between desert and sea, i am my own guide to myself."
"old hungers / will break their coffins, rise to eat and thank."
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
i had forsaken all friendship in life and was roaming the earth at the mercy of the rolling waves of chance.
there are always worse things i could do.
"wandering through the desert snow and shining a light up at the afternoon moon, how my love made the impossible happen."
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
"why is it always raining in your dreams, mikhail?"
something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
what prayers do we say when we think god isn't listening?
"people that can hurt you, the ones that can really hurt you, are the ones that are close enough to do it."
"please stop framing me for murder. just because i killed 1,846 people doesn't mean i killed that specific one."
how do you get in the mind-state to kill?
i will admit the lows keep me alive. if it wasn't for the changes i would probably die.
always been a storm
"congratulations, you have survived the war. now live with the trauma."
"oh, heaven is a place on earth"
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
"don't you dare, for one minute, believe that my kindness makes me anything but insurmountable. i did not unzip my chest to every kind of hurt, and stagger back, wounded and alive, just to hear you call me weak for trying."
a name means a lot just by itself
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
i can't listen to you. i can't listen to your voice. it's as though i'd drunk a bottle of anise and fallen asleep wrapped in a quilt of roses. it pulls me along and i know i'm drowning -- but i go on down.
the only answer to death is the heat and confusion of living; the only dependable warmth is the warmth of blood. i can feel my own beating even now.
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
"the monster never dies no matter how many times you kill it. it just sheds its skin and changes form. i can feel the weight of the world pushing me down, i try to carry it nonetheless. one last time, then i can rest."
"fine, make me your villain"
AN: hey fuckers remember how i said i wouldn't make another rp account? i lied. @KlSSBANG
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
"the death of houses, how they seem to collapse as soon as we leave them, as soon as we prepare ourselves to leave them."
"there are so many kinds of reality, and so many secret openings in the walls we think are mute."
"even money, which shines so much, spits sometimes."
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
"i'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly."
as if a second self
NO—NO. YOU CANNOT KEEP PUSHING US OUT. YOU CANNOT KEEP BACKING US INTO A CORNER AND TELL US NOT TO BITE; WE MUST. WE ARE TIRED AND AND STARVED AND WE WILL BITE.
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
tell me it was for the hunger / &amp; nothing less. for the hunger is to give / the body what it knows / it cannot keep.
show me your thorns and i'll show you hands ready to bleed.
"darling, dearest, dead."
"you will dig until your own hands are bleeding because the second you slow down, you will have to deal with the fact that he's not coming home."
"because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. to be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted."
"lord, please give me patience, 'cause if you give me strength i will need bail money too."
i leave you: haloes and clothes. / i leave you violently. / like the wail of an exile.
"i squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly / your heart mortally wounded,/ by the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite, / of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!"
"hey, frankie. you're my best friend. i just. i just wanted you to know that, okay? i needed you to hear it from me."
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
no one will ever stop me taking care of you.
"though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb. which hides your life, and shows not half your parts."
you broke my body in / and i broke your body in / you turned me onto sin / will you make me whole again?
"i'll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it's been waiting inside me the whole time."
i swear to god the devil made me do it
"since i know you don't like me, don't bother answering, because it would trouble you; but i remember you always and i keep a place for you in my heart, brimful of poetry."
but the lies they will hurt you / hold on / human kindness desert you
"violets from plug street wood-think what they have meant to me-life and hope and love and you. (and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so.)"
"dogs like us, we lose a step, we lose our minds trying to prove that we haven't"
"my elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
"suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness."
i tried to love you but you're not my type / tried to pretend but it just don't feel right
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
"you can have the light of the world blind you, bath you in grace / but i don't see so easily what you hold in your hands"
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
to know the pain of too much tenderness. /  to be wounded by your own under-standing of love; /   and to bleed willingly and joyfully.
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"remember learning that saints were only people whose pain was notable, noted."
"heartless challenge, pick your path and i’ll pray"
as if a second self
i'm holding my breath with a baseball bat / though i don't know what i'm waiting for
i can't hold enough of you in my hands
"her fingers brush leaves with tenderness, and you swear your daughter’s gentle hum makes the drooping plant stand taller than before."
slain and unknown. neither gathered up by forgetfulness / nor dispersed by memorythey're forgotten
our respect had once been mutual. but that was before the envy.
"his hands wrapped around a cup of tea with a weariness not even the war should bring to him, not after all the effort you put into keeping him safe."
i wake up each day furious to be laboring under capitalism.
now your life's no longer empty / surely heaven waits for you
"he looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they’d met, when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul. 'i love you.'"
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
"you're runnin' through my veins, something i can't change / that's the same reason why we're / further apart, the closer that we are"
"please stop framing me for murder. just because i killed 1,846 people doesn't mean i killed that specific one."
"i want to believe / no, i choose to believe / that i was made to become / a sanctuary"
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."
"isn't it bliss? don't you approve? one who keeps tearing around, one who can't move. but where are the clowns? send in the clowns."
"IF I GUT YOU AND LEAVE YOUR BODY IN THE WOODS WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND IT, DID IT REALLY HAPPEN?"
'you’re so hateful.' 'i learned at your feet.'

"and i want a love that falls as fast  / as a body from the balcony, and / i want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground"
my tongue is pierced with glass.

"i take another life, it's all the same / it's one more killing to the man that has no name"
"sometimes when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry."
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"and i just need more time / i know, i know, i'm asking for the moon / but i must listen to intuition / believe me, i only want what's right"
only in death will we have our own names since only in death are we no longer part of the effort.
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
and it takes everything / and it all spills out / reckless but honest words leave my mouth / like kerosene on a flame of doubt / i couldn't make it right
mark how the tempest roars
and again he asks me to kill him. one more time before he falls to his knees and sobs. and i get it. i do. because i have a brother too.
"if you must know anything, know that the hardest task is to live only once."

AN: um i hope you guys realize i'm not manually tweeting this? and i'm not logged in 24/7? this isn't the place to start a conversation with me if you're trying to have one. getting mad at me (the admin) because you're trying to start a conversation with a bot is .. not my fault.
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
when god draws last breath and i am once again torn to ask: how far do i dare go?
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
"not only had my brother disappeared, but--and bear with me here--a part of my very being had gone with him. stories about us could, from them on, be told from only one perspective. memories could be told but not shared."
they want me to die so they can eulogize me.
"there’s a nameless grave by an azure sea (and i couldn’t tell what his rank might be), i only know i killed him."
"when people press their bodies to each other, the need to feel that pressure, the embrace, is that what makes us human? maybe it's the warmth shared. i don't know."

"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"

this kid's not alright.
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
"you and me, always together"
"a boy so fragile-looking that he appeared to be made out of glass, with the hardness of his expression slowly dissolving into tentative uncertainty."
sometimes anger is your body’s way of telling you that you’re ready to change things.
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
my own twenty first century jesus

"our father who art in heaven, are you listening?"
you ought to know. you made me.
because i'm pretty when i cry
slain and unknown. neither gathered up by forgetfulness / nor dispersed by memorythey're forgotten
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
maybe i've done enough / finally catching up / for the first time i see an image of my brokenness / utterly worthy of love / maybe i've done enough
it's so exhausting on this silver screen / where i play the role of anyone but me
i'm not letting you die
"rest then, love. you have nothing to fear"
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.

what power do dreams have in hell?
"sweet child, you are wrath given life."
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
"just tryin' to catch a free ride, from the temple to the tomb"
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
i will take a crowbar and pry out the broken pieces of god in me.
there are always worse things i could do.
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.
"mother, am i acquitted? was i righteous and just? good enough to witness the awe of heaven? / oh no. mother. i'm going to hell."
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
"lover, i know you to be tender. lover, why hide? these rough palms, open knuckles, they are not your own."
walking on the sunny side of neurosis

there is nothing straight about you; no motive that hasn’t another behind it; no statement that hasn’t three meanings.
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
i threw glass at my friend's eyes and now i'm on probation
nothing could sadden me greater than the promise of immortality. what a miserable existence.
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
give in to despair / let hope surrender
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
we don’t know that we’re alive as long as we haven’t encountered death: these are the banalities that have been erased. and it is an act of grace.
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE!

saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
"death comes for us all, brother. you cannot hide from it forever. we will die one day, you and i."
are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet?
it takes a real man to fall on his sword.

"late night devil, put your hands on me"
a dagger and a silk heart.

"call to mind that noontide of supreme happiness, behold once more that image of angelic beauty, the spirit of love itself, as she came to meet you; it was through her, through her alone, that you seemed assured of your own higher existence."
soot in my throat / grave dirt under my nails / this wicked resurrection
like the flight of a bird who has no wings but flings itself out and only gets wings by flying.
he and i are closer than friends. we are enemies linked together. the same sin binds us.
things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
spit teeth into the sink. watch water turn pink. rinse and repeat.
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
it was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry i had strapped about me. the rest were unequivocal sentences of death.
the only answer to death is the heat and confusion of living; the only dependable warmth is the warmth of blood. i can feel my own beating even now.
when the beating of your heart / echoes the beating of the drums / there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.

"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
"hard not to fall for you, i gave you all my heart"
"standing between you, and anyone who wants to hurt you, is exactly where i want to be standing."
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"why is it always raining in your dreams, mikhail?"
i stare at the bathroom mirror and hope to die with flesh intact.
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"you are my destroyer, i call everywhere"
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
"forget the body, i still have my name."
it all adds up. why do i feel like i've lost something i never had?
"this is pain, one dies of or kills. kill it and one kills oneself."

"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
"i don't despise you for what you allowed to happen to me. i despise you because when i was released, you refused to be found and i needed you more than anything in my life. not to mend my broken bones, i needed my brother to mend my broken spirit."
'always in my heart.' 'and you...and you in mine.'
i am part of that power which eternally wills evil and eternally works good.
the next click you hear is me hanging up. the one after that—is me pulling the trigger.
"last caress—one's last cigarette falling from limp wrist. and with that, the final act, curtains draw."
"there are many kinds of hunger. and when we are hungry, sometimes it is our own goddamn fault."
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
"you are not mine, and never will be. love is not born of possession, of ownership. learn this. never call yourself mine. you are yours."
"loving you isn't the right thing to do, how can i ever change things that i feel?"
"there's no running from it; you don't forget the first sight of blood, some memory that shapes you."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
and suddenly i'm someone that prays / a last minute man of faith / but i'll leave behind miles and miles of jagged lines / upon the surface of the divine / i wish i could set them straight
"but fuck it, you’ve got to make a stand somewhere. and a man can stave off his own death wish for only so long."
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
"found family, all horrendous people."
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"off in my head, lost, off in my head"
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
einmal im leben zur rechten zeit sollte man an unmögliches geglaubt haben.
let me be your one-man army
"if you love me, let me go"
but the lies they will hurt you / hold on / human kindness desert you
swallow your grief. we have no time for it now.
because i'm pretty when i cry
what in the name of god was i ever going to be but this?
"even money, which shines so much, spits sometimes."
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
hopefully one day you will know what the moon feels like in your hands. that’s how it felt to first hold you.
"thus by existence tortured and oppressed i crave for death, i long for rest."
you can sleep now. you said that. / i had a dream where you said that. / thanks for saying that. / you weren’t supposed to.
"the gods do not weep ichor, my love, they bleed it,"
"but remember, boy, that a kind act can sometimes be as powerful as a sword."
"lord, please give me patience, 'cause if you give me strength i will need bail money too."
"all it took was a special look and i felt i knew you before, i didn't mean to love you, didn't think it would work out"
"no one guided me to myself. i am the guide / between desert and sea, i am my own guide to myself."
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
"my heart is a wounded bird, beating its wings against the cage of my ribs."
"i pray you do not fall in love with me, for i am falser than vows made in wine."
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
the person in us is the part in us of error and sin. every effort of the mystics has always sought to reach the place when there is no longer anything in their soul that says “i.” but the part of the soul that says “us” is still infinitely more dangerous.
"home is a place of perfect belonging, wholeness. home is an instinct, a yearning that has never, ever been satisfied, that can never be eradicated"
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
"the truth is we can survive our lives, but not our skin. but you know this already."
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
uh oh! check your head!
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
he embraces his murderer. / may he win his heart: do you feel angrier if i survive?
"you'd know that, because god listens to johnny cash &amp; smokes winstons in his red pick-up. because i call god 'sir,' sometimes wishing i could call him 'dad'."
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
'you’re so hateful.' 'i learned at your feet.'
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
the noose slinks around your neck and all you can think about is how an angel might taste
it's okay if you can't catch your breath / you can take the oxygen straight out of my own chest
wearing rose—tinted glasses / all i see is red / battered &amp; beaten optimist
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
"tight jeans, loose morals."
"it's the first time, the last time we ever met"
"stay, and decay."
"this is what it comes down to: you, me, and a single bullet."
it takes a real man to fall on his sword.
"it runs in the family,"
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
"who will be lost in ourselves? a story, after all, is a kind of swallowing. to open a mouth, in speech, is to leave only the bones, which remain untold."
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
prayer / be my knife
childishness is a common enough sin amongst humans. perhaps we should not be so quick to judge.
"isn't all that rage so ugly? and isn't it mine, still? good god, isn't it mine?"
"make it personal. do as much damage as you can. get your message across. that way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. of being considered dangerous."
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
i never loved you but i almost did.
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
i prayed that god might return you to me.
"CARNIFEX TO HARUSPEX: you'd known, from the beginning, what i'd become. how could you let me?"
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
and when i drift away / when i lose my way / my body starts to decay
"how would he know what’s forbidden to him when his friend is laid out for him, like a carcass on the butcher’s slab, so often and so easily. what part of this is not meant for him?"
we don’t know that we’re alive as long as we haven’t encountered death: these are the banalities that have been erased. and it is an act of grace.
"soldier, back from the distant fray, with the bandaged arm and the ribbon gay, where have you been so long away, and what have your travels taught you?"
"the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows / it's no stranger to you and me"
"put a gun to my head and tell me not to move, i’m sorry man— i’m moving"
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
"the yearning for him is like hunger, hollowing me. somewhere his soul waits, but it is nowhere i can reach."
there is telepathy between hearts.
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"we'll survive, you and i."
"while there the vulture beats his wings, / the pulse of war throbs fever high, / here for a little space i lie / and dream of little things."
"something about brown eyes. something about the warmth, the color of hearth &amp; heart. the endless vastness of them, how easily i lose myself, fall into them. oak &amp; sandalwood. yes. brown eyes."
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"
it's one more bullet to the man that has no name
"the dawn eats / its own faith,"
"without the blurred sight of joy and relief, it has become impossible to ignore. all the love inside you cannot keep you from seeing the truth. your children are strangers to you."
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
"he wants to say, 'i'm sick. in my head. i can't make it stop. sorry for everything i've done &amp; haven't done yet, but will, because i fuck everything up. i will never be happy,” but the words hang like a noose around his throat, and if he says them, he thinks they'll tighten."
and so it seems i must write you letters than i can never send.
tell me it was for the hunger / &amp; nothing less. for the hunger is to give / the body what it knows / it cannot keep.
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
i’ve made it clear I am not to be trusted with a body / always leaving mine bloodless as icewith just a needle / of breath left in its lungs
maybe i'm hiding behind metaphor / maybe my heart needs to break to be sure / one day i'll wear it on my sleeve / the insignificant with the sacred unique
"'you're losing blood, aren't you?' 'probably. my socks are wet.'"
"not only had my brother disappeared, but--and bear with me here--a part of my very being had gone with him. stories about us could, from them on, be told from only one perspective. memories could be told but not shared."
"you are my ghost story. you are the amazing spirit that blew into my life, turned it upside down, and then vanished into the night. being with you made me a better man, and for that i will always love you."
he's an irredeemable villain to YOU. i understand him though.
golden hair and a blue-sky smile belie the strength of river-gods and wolf jaws.
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
"hard not to fall for you, i gave you all my heart"
"your name will be known, a blessing, a curse. / my name will be known, for better, for worse."
"you’ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you’re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you."
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
"found family, all horrendous people."
"this is pain, one dies of or kills. kill it and one kills oneself."
i'm not beaten by this yet.
my mother said i could be anything / i wanted—but i chose to live.
that is because i am a city that does not want to surrender. besiege me.
what is past is not dead; it is not even past. we cut ourselves off from it; we pretend to be strangers.
"because men in suits were once men with crowns, and the way the world works never changes. fuck that: it's my turn now."
comrade ruslan had a funny way of telling us he cared. that is to say: he didn't.
"father hasn't been home / i'm the man now, i'm the man"
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
"you are 12 and the police tell you to come back later, they're still looking for you. milk carton poster boy."
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
war is the only thing we really understand.
my name is
"can i be blamed for wanting a real body, to put my arms around? without it i too am disembodied."
how do we forgive ourselves for all the things we did not become?
time and again boys are raised to be men / impatient they start / fearful they end
i have folded my sorrows like fitted bedsheets (...)
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
the steel of your blade kisses my throat / wishing it was your lips to mine
she carried herself how i'd imagined the high queens of old would. a dynasty reborn.
"you wish you could hold me at knifepoint again. you do, still, in a way."
"delicate are you, and your vows are delicate, too, so easily do they break."
"locked and loaded, where the hell is peace of mind?"
they want me to die so they can eulogize me.
"what i'd saved: lost. worse: i lost it. can't even tell myself that i sort of lost it, that lost, i keep it still. i lost the saved. / i've lost. i'm lost."
"as far back as he could remember, it seemed that his father had fought the devil all the time."
he wants to be tender and merciful. that sounds overly valorous. sounds like penance.
what the hell kind of name is soap?
i can't listen to you. i can't listen to your voice. it's as though i'd drunk a bottle of anise and fallen asleep wrapped in a quilt of roses. it pulls me along and i know i'm drowning -- but i go on down.
was a time i was scared of you. was a time i'd piss myself having a gun pointed at my head. you know what i feel right now? not a god damned thing.
he died with that dream still alive in his head.
what in the name of god was i ever going to be but this?
"it's as if i'm anaesthetized, absent."
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
no matter. try again. fail again. fail better.
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
"people liked me back then, what can I say?"
"death, lonely death, beneath the withered leaves."
"heartless challenge, pick your path and i’ll pray"
you seem to replace your brain with your heart / you take things so hard and then you fall apart
and again he asks me to kill him. one more time before he falls to his knees and sobs. and i get it. i do. because i have a brother too.
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
"all this time i told myself we were born from war—but i was wrong, ma."
kill what you can't save
nothing i do is ever good / nothing i do is ever good enough
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"and i've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord"
'always in my heart.' 'and you...and you in mine.'
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
'i love you' 'thank you'
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
there is a certain level of accountability that comes from permanence.
"her fingers brush leaves with tenderness, and you swear your daughter’s gentle hum makes the drooping plant stand taller than before."
"hey baby, you're a bruiser. hey baby, this is what they made you."
"what i'd saved: lost. worse: i lost it. can't even tell myself that i sort of lost it, that lost, i keep it still. i lost the saved. / i've lost. i'm lost."
his face opening up with a smile rather than a scowl. it freezes you mid-step to find such simple joy in him.
"the death of houses, how they seem to collapse as soon as we leave them, as soon as we prepare ourselves to leave them."
"i know that name. i know you. there was blood, and masks, and blades raised."
an emptiness / full of faith: rise to me as only you / would after god has left / you with these entrance wounds / with no way out
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
are there many little boys who think they are a monster?
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
i will make myself steel / i will shed this bone / shift cartilage into iron.
"no one guided me to myself. i am the guide / between desert and sea, i am my own guide to myself."
ma vie est une énigme dont ton nom est le mot.
i can't save us / my atlantis
"please stop framing me for murder. just because i killed 1,846 people doesn't mean i killed that specific one."
"father of mine, tell me, what do you see?"
"the snow is falling / on the deserted field / of my life, and my hopes, / which roam far, are afraid / of becoming frozen or lost."
creatures are born to a backdrop of adieux.
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
devotion and delusion
"i lay still for a while, picking up the scattered garments of my mind and trying to assemble some kind of reasonable outfit from them."
our nightmares belong to us.
sign my death with your teeth
slain and unknown. neither gathered up by forgetfulness / nor dispersed by memorythey're forgotten
"sing to me, i am not doing well / getting tired of my own words"
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"you smile and whisper in their ear but drop them just as quick,"
it is as fate behests it.
this kid's not alright.
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
"we'll survive, you and i."
"don't you know? i don't feel like fighting anymore. it's not been my fight in a long time. and i'm tired. unbearably so. so just—you let me rest, alright, champ? you just let me rest. you'll do me proud."
am i not your eurydice?
"i'm all talk with a thorn in my side, i got a real big heart that i'm willing to hide"
"my mirror disappoints me, and am i the only one?"
"i learnt long ago to hate my enemies, but i’ve never loved one before."
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
"it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters, miss elizabeth. make them afraid of you."
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
somebody showed you all of the horror / you weren't born with it
i can feel eternity in my throat.
bodies fashioned out of dirt and dust / for a moment we get to be glorious
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
"like communion bread, / your words dissolve in my mouth / and never die."
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
o rose beyond the reach of time and of the senses / o kiss enveloped in the scarves of all the winds / surprise me with one dream / that my madness will recoil from you
but man is not made for defeat. a man can be destroyed but not defeated.
don't know if you love me or you want me dead
"i'll wait on you at the bottom of the deep, blue sea."
i will admit the lows keep me alive. if it wasn't for the changes i would probably die.
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
"the dawn eats / its own faith,"
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
"it's the first time, the last time we ever met"
"pour y vivre, il faut en respirer une partie et, inévitablement, être contaminé."
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
uh oh! check your head!
"carried these bruises half my life. look in the mirror, see more there, can't remember what i look like without 'em."
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
"soon, alas, a storm comes up, my memory clouds over, in a flash there are shipwrecks, i cannot even cry out, my mouth is full of saltwater sobs. i am flooded with vague, deceptive recollections, i am drowning in my imagination in tears borrowed from the most familiar tragedies,"
but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
"oh, death someone would pray / could you wait to call me another day"
spit teeth into the sink. watch water turn pink. rinse and repeat.
"this is pain, one dies of or kills. kill it and one kills oneself."
our hands empty except for our hands
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
i cannot say i am familiar with forgiveness.
"darling, dearest, dead."
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"father of mine, tell me, what do you see?"
"death, my son, is a good thing for all men; it is the night for this worried day that we call life. it is in the sleep of death that finds rest for eternity the sickness, pain, desperation, and the fears that agitate, without end, we unhappy living souls."
i have folded my sorrows like fitted bedsheets (...)
"in the end, it was someone else, in longing, who finds us?"
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
and i'll try and find the image of god / in mountains made of ash and clouds of smoke / it's fight or flight / buried in my mind
"to look away is easy, to look elsewhere is escapism."
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
what i want back is what i was.
"he don't run from nothin', dog / get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over"
he willed her ghost back forever / haunting his windows and doors
"if you’re gonna look at yourself, really look in the mirror, you gotta admit who you are. but not just to yourself, you gotta admit it to everybody else."
"i always knew that you would hurt me to death some day, but I hoped to choose the time and place."
but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
"sometimes a flower is just a flower, and the best thing it can do for us is to die."
"and i'm kneeling in the last pew, begging for promised absolution. confess, repent, the day i die rotten."
"a white wisp of cloud drifted by. that's what dying will be like, he told himself. just floating up in the air. nothing bad about that. he smiled a little."
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"this is your life, this is still your life"
i think the ground is pulling me down. i think my life is losing momentum.
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"who's a heretic, child?"
what is a home if not the first place you learn to run from?
"all i ever wanted was to be there for people in the darkness, and tell them that the night can't hurt you. that the things that you're afraid of in shadow are still dangerous in the light of day, and that there is nothing in the darkness other than mystery."
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
"and i? i drink, i burn, i gather dreams. / and sometimes i tell a story"
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
'i won't leave you' 'but i already have'
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
"oh, can you hear her a-weeping? / crying his name on the moors / though he was cruel like the winter / she clung like flowers to thorns"
when your lungs fill with polyps / and your heart is filled with blood / if i had a gun
"silly me, believing the world cared."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
"my mirror disappoints me, and am i the only one?"
you have a long day. you have a really long day.
"you will dig until your own hands are bleeding because the second you slow down, you will have to deal with the fact that he's not coming home."
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
masquerading as a man with a reason / my charade is the event of the season
"born as mortals are, i have a mother / and a house with many windows, / i have brothers, friends, / and a prison cell with a cold window."
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
"i will slog over this endless road to its end. / until my heart stops, i will slog over this endless, endless road"
"i squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly / your heart mortally wounded,/ by the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite, / of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!"
he had a sudden feeling that he was going to lose a lot more before this was over.
sometimes being offered tenderness feels like the very proof that you've been ruined.
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
what is done out of love always takes place between good and evil.
a safe pair of hands
the noose slinks around your neck and all you can think about is how an angel might taste
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
am i not your eurydice?
i tried to love you but you're not my type / tried to pretend but it just don't feel right
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
"to be loved means to be consumed. to love means to radiate with inexhaustible light. to be loved is to pass away, to love is to endure."
uh oh! check your head!
"all kidding aside, local man really in need of therapy"
"suddenly / darkness, suddenly only darkness."
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"you're a gun 'cause i like you at my side at all times / you keep me safe (no, don't shoot me down)"
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
comrade ruslan had a funny way of telling us he cared. that is to say: he didn't.
i'll hold it all more loosely / and yet somehow much more dearly / 'cause i've spent my whole life searching desperately / to find out that grace requires nothing / grace requires nothing of me
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
a symphony of teeth meet tongue meet blood.
though he was cruel like the winter / she clung like flowers to thorns
"death at the gates again / howling my name / come on in, old buddy, sorry i made you wait"
"who are your children now, and who pried their childhood out of your shaking hands?"
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
april to our deathbed
late night devil put your hands on me
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
"counting the names of those i've wronged, an endless list. debt after debt, unpaid,"
so hold your breath and say goodbye
i've always loved the songs of the unsung.
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
i have my mother's joy and my father's anger in me. they're always at war.
"their voices ring with an odd lilt and their eyes—it has become hard to look at them straight on, hasn’t it? your children have changed, and as much as you knew they would grow a little in the time away from you, your children have become strangers."
"'i need to ask you something.' 'anything, always.' 'go to hell.'"
i tried to touch you but you cut through / MY OWN AMERICAN PSYCHO

"because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. to be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted."
"i squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly / your heart mortally wounded,/ by the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite, / of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!"
"why is it always raining in your dreams, mikhail?"
pissed off beats scared every time
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
i am graceless. no. worse than that.
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
"death at the gates again / howling my name / come on in, old buddy, sorry i made you wait"
soot in my throat / grave dirt under my nails / this wicked resurrection
"steel. stone. concrete for miles. i wonder if there's anything in this world worth saving. desolation. tyranny. enemy of endless might. i wonder if i have any friends left standing. it comes down to it, i'll fight alone."
"your name will be known, a blessing, a curse. / my name will be known, for better, for worse."
those are my limbs dancing; i am waking up.
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
"i'll wait on you at the bottom of the deep, blue sea."
"sing to me, i am not doing well / getting tired of my own words"
is it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
"loving you isn't the right thing to do, how can i ever change things that i feel?"
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"grief so unseemly all who glance it wade away; head of unkempt raven locks, wear under under dark, hollowed eyes. you've seen things. and you let people know."
"god is fucking with my oblivion. if he wants forgiveness, he shouldn't have given us memory."
most will only have one death. i will have two.
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
a sadness runs through him.
push me to the point my heart breaks and aches / remind me what i'm doing this for / let me go on and fight for more and more
"dogs like us, we lose a step, we lose our minds trying to prove that we haven't"
show me your thorns and i'll show you hands ready to bleed.
the fear baptized me
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
"when dawn broke, the city lay far behind me, and the haunting vision of that fearful, menacing figure had vanished."
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
but i don't mean a word when / i tell you that i love you / in my mind i am above you
"it was only for a moment, for an instant. and then it was over, and i let her go."
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
i can't save us / my atlantis
late night devil put your hands on me
she carried herself how i'd imagined the high queens of old would. a dynasty reborn.
"in the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. their hands meet, and the light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun."
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
"hear me, herald of your fall, icarus! your ambition, vaulting and naïve in its placement, will bid you no seat amongst the table of the gods!"
"so you can wipe off that grin, i know where you've been / it's all been a pack of lies"
lesser men have died for more
it gets complicated when they come in for their counterattack. everybody hates a victim who won't stop fighting back.
"tie the noose well. die slow or die quick; minutes-long asphyxiation, or a blink and a snap. choice is your own. be quick, your grave still needs diggin'."
"pas besoin de gril: l'enfer, c'est les autres."
"now i don’t kill for anyone but myself, and every time that i take a life, i know the value of it."
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
i never loved you but i almost did.
they say she walks there forever / wretched and lost on the moors / conjuring storms with her temper
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
"vicious man, what conquests have you not made?"
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
"i have known the body of my mother, sick and then dying"
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
"they asked, 'do you love her to death?' i said, 'speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.'"
wearing rose—tinted glasses / all i see is red / battered &amp; beaten optimist
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
"everything is as it was before me. and the electricity disperses from my brain til it’s just dead tissue. meat. oblivion. and all the other little things that make me up, microbes, bacterium they just keep on living and i am broken apart"
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
i had him bless these hands just to run you out / give me strength when you run your mouth
"the truth is we can survive our lives, but not our skin. but you know this already."
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
einmal im leben zur rechten zeit sollte man an unmögliches geglaubt haben.
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
kill what you can't save
"it's like all day my vanity is for sale / take it away, my head is in my own hell"
i’ve made it clear I am not to be trusted with a body / always leaving mine bloodless as icewith just a needle / of breath left in its lungs
"i will slog over this endless road to its end. / until my heart stops, i will slog over this endless, endless road"
it poisons me—the indifference of the celestials towards us earthly.
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
"... god, how i ricochet between certainties and doubts."
i can't love a hero.
"all this time i told myself we were born from war—but i was wrong, ma."
a dagger and a silk heart.
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
"better to die on your feet than live on your knees, right?"
"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
it hurts to become. this is the only truth.
"you love tenderly and warmly, but your love is like friendship. that's why you have good friends, you're sociable, sympathetic toward people. until this dissatisfaction comes over you-you know what i'm talking about."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
i'm holding my breath with a baseball bat / though i don't know what i'm waiting for
and love is for the birds / when things are complicated
push me to the point my heart breaks and aches / remind me what i'm doing this for / let me go on and fight for more and more
"your reflection is your very worst enemy,"
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
stringing guts along the beaten path
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
"darling, dearest, dead."
"you'll have me. no matter how thick the night, i will always be there to light your way."
and be a simple kind of man / oh be something you love and understand
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
"your body a supermax prison / you, your own warden, guard, and detainee."
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because I'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."
used and used and used and used.
"they told my brother he'd be strong, my sister she'd be brilliant. my parents told me to worry about making it to eighteen."
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
this death not my own
"last caress—one's last cigarette falling from limp wrist. and with that, the final act, curtains draw."
"guilt in sinks, i feel you crawl under my skin / 'cause after all, i can only blame myself / my neglect turned you into an insect, now you won't let me be"
it all adds up. why do i feel like i've lost something i never had?
what i want back is what i was.
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
"went into the water on account for disobeying my father. felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"CARNIFEX TO HARUSPEX: you'd known, from the beginning, what i'd become. how could you let me?"
"'cause with god as my witness, you corporate fucking prick, i did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick"
"swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood on the first four knuckles."
"reality is so flexible these days, it’s hard to tell who’s disconnected from it and who isn’t. you might even say it’s a pointless distinction."
they say dyin' ain't no way to make a living
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
lick on my knife / and honour the taste
the noose slinks around your neck and all you can think about is how an angel might taste
forget your lust for the rich man's gold / all that you need is in your soul
"you have bewitched me, body and soul."
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
the show must go on
"everyone's a whore, grace. we just sell different parts of ourselves."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
"lover, i know you to be tender. lover, why hide? these rough palms, open knuckles, they are not your own."
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
this is the story you asked for. i leave it in your mouth.
i have folded my sorrows like fitted bedsheets (...)
"baby be a simple kind of man / oh won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
"and time and again they cream your liquidation, your displacement, your torture and brutal execution with the ultimate insult that it’s just business, it’s politics, it’s the way of the world, it’s a tough life and that it’s nothing personal. well, fuck them. make it personal."
"oh, can you hear her a-weeping? / crying his name on the moors / though he was cruel like the winter / she clung like flowers to thorns"
"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
"while there the vulture beats his wings, / the pulse of war throbs fever high, / here for a little space i lie / and dream of little things."
so he grabs his smith &amp; wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson
"a yearning to be known, a hunger not yet sated. yet, as though i'd know this embrace."
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
"well, if you told me you were drowning, i would not lend a hand / i've seen your face before, my friend"
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"as i descend further into a madness that grips me by the throat and won’t let me go, not until i’ve hated myself so fully that i forget what i look like and what my name is and the people who love me. not until i’m left feeling hollowed out and alone."
she carried herself how i'd imagined the high queens of old would. a dynasty reborn.
"yet, she laughs strangely, no longer the giggling girl she used to be but free in a way you have never seen. her smile can drop so fast now, her now-old eyes can turn distant and glassy, and her tears, now rarer, are always silent."
"'i need to ask you something.' 'anything, always.' 'go to hell.'"
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
"your name will be known, a blessing, a curse. / my name will be known, for better, for worse."
"you love tenderly and warmly, but your love is like friendship. that's why you have good friends, you're sociable, sympathetic toward people. until this dissatisfaction comes over you-you know what i'm talking about."
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
i had him bless these hands just to run you out / give me strength when you run your mouth
"hope is rising in me, like sap in a tree. blood in a wound."
"their voices ring with an odd lilt and their eyes—it has become hard to look at them straight on, hasn’t it? your children have changed, and as much as you knew they would grow a little in the time away from you, your children have become strangers."
i am not a creature that was born. i am a fire that was set.
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
"do or die, son. same as always."
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
without hope we are lost.
the fear baptized me
"i lay motionless, and every sound i tried to utter was stifled in the trance that gripped me. the figure sat down on my bed and leered mockingly at me."
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
late night devil put your hands on me
"hey, pretty girl / little plastic doll in lipstick n' nylons /  spill your hot–pink guts over my black-white diner vinyl"
i miss you more than i remember you.
"tired of this body, so cumbersome and heavy"
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
and be a simple kind of man / oh be something you love and understand
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
i have folded my sorrows like fitted bedsheets (...)
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
"mother tells me our people ran with the wolves, long ago. then the red winter came, and although my people were born to the cold—still—it took them."
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
"i'm alone, 'cause this house don't feel like home"
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
icarus / the pride before the fall
"who's a heretic, child?"
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
carry on my wayward son / there'll be peace when you are done / lay your weary head to rest / don't you cry no more
"his hands wrapped around a cup of tea with a weariness not even the war should bring to him, not after all the effort you put into keeping him safe."
"god, aren't you something?"
"violets from plug street wood-think what they have meant to me-life and hope and love and you. (and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so.)"
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"you once told me that memory is a choice. but if you were god, you'd know it's a flood."
it's decided. i am going to hurt him.
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
out with a bang and with a whimper
"essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it not?"
i'm just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
and again he asks me to kill him. one more time before he falls to his knees and sobs. and i get it. i do. because i have a brother too.
i have given my word that only death will take me from you
'i won't leave you' 'but i already have'
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
"but mighty odd children they were, known ever after for their strangeness, their magnetic charm, the glimpse of them fey and frightening in the right light."
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
devotion and delusion
"some days, you're the best thing in my life / sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife"
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
"what separates a soldier from a murderer? only repetition. both killers, still."
"always on the upswing, baby,"
"he paces like it's going out of fashion, a worried thing looking like death warmed over. it's stinking up the place. which would be funny, if this weren't a morgue and he hadn't just come back."
the patron saint of switchblade fights
"old hungers / will break their coffins, rise to eat and thank."
"as i descend further into a madness that grips me by the throat and won’t let me go, not until i’ve hated myself so fully that i forget what i look like and what my name is and the people who love me. not until i’m left feeling hollowed out and alone."
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
"the personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. so if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. get angry."
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
will you fight? or die like a dog?
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
"grace is a gift for the fallen, dear; you're an angry blade, and you're brave, but you're all alone."
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
"you look at me with those brown eyes, what do you want to do?"
maybe someday / we will be two / people meeting / again for the / first time.
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
"please stop framing me for murder. just because i killed 1,846 people doesn't mean i killed that specific one."
"then i fuck up, lost with no direction / this is my one shot at redemption"
"i don't despise you for what you allowed to happen to me. i despise you because when i was released, you refused to be found and i needed you more than anything in my life. not to mend my broken bones, i needed my brother to mend my broken spirit."
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
"no one guided me to myself. i am the guide / between desert and sea, i am my own guide to myself."
you will never be lovelier than you are now. we will never be here again.
"he's never gonna make it, all the poor people he's forsaken, karma is always gonna chase him for his lies"
do not try to be pretty. you weren't meant to be pretty; you were meant to burn down the earth and graffiti the sky. don't let anyone ever simplify you to just 'pretty.'
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
all the time in the world— and filled with tomorrows.
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
"the pitter–patter of rain draws me out of morbid curiosities. i shan't dwell on these thoughts of maggots under my dearest's skin nor, yes, even the unseemly paleness of lifelessness. one can only pray he is resting well."
"because the truth is, fuck you, i've never been yours. i've only ever been mine, a hard lesson to learn."
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
childishness is a common enough sin amongst humans. perhaps we should not be so quick to judge.
"lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy"
"hear me, herald of your fall, icarus! your ambition, vaulting and naïve in its placement, will bid you no seat amongst the table of the gods!"
show me your thorns and i'll show you hands ready to bleed.
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet / talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
nothing could sadden me greater than the promise of immortality. what a miserable existence.
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
i clung to your hands so that something human might exist in the chaos.
"tired of this body, so cumbersome and heavy"
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
"sing to me, i am not doing well / getting tired of my own words"
the boy who fell into the sky / had no one there to watch him cry
"to look away is easy, to look elsewhere is escapism."
in the worst storm in heaven / in the warmth of your heart
"and i've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord"
when the beating of your heart / echoes the beating of the drums / there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.
"home is a place of perfect belonging, wholeness. home is an instinct, a yearning that has never, ever been satisfied, that can never be eradicated"
what the hell kind of name is soap?
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
happy childhoods make for dull company.
"my mirror disappoints me, and am i the only one?"
"kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy targets."
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
he is my brother. but i must kill him and keep strong to do it.
will you fight? or die like a dog?
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
do you remember when the girls would call out 'love you!' conveniently leaving out the 'i' as if they didn't want to commit to their own declarations? i agree that the 'i' is a pretty heavy concept.
"you know what, babe? you look good under my boot."
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
"our father who art in heaven, are you listening?"
it seems unnatural being born together and then dying apart.
hopefully one day you will know what the moon feels like in your hands. that’s how it felt to first hold you.
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
i always wanted to be a saint / but i thought i’d be one of the miserable onessainted by painburnt alive inside
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"oh, heaven is a place on earth"
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
i who had opened / your wound bit on it—did you feel me?—
"and as if impelled by his will, i journeyed onwards."
"death comes for us all, brother. you cannot hide from it forever. we will die one day, you and i."
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
"fine, make me your villain"
what happened was that i was a boy once and bruiseless.
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
"when i meet charon, the ferryman, i will be sure to tell him who sent me"
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
"up there we will fight with each other, and the one who pushes the other over will become king and be able to drink blood."
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"let no one mistake us for the fruit of violence - but that violence, having passed through the fruit, failed to spoil it."
so hopelessly devoted to you
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
"steel. stone. concrete for miles. i wonder if there's anything in this world worth saving. desolation. tyranny. enemy of endless might. i wonder if i have any friends left standing. it comes down to it, i'll fight alone."
"to die for lack of love is horrible. the asphyxia of the soul,"
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
"i take another life, it's all the same / it's one more killing to the man that has no name"
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"tie the noose well. die slow or die quick; minutes-long asphyxiation, or a blink and a snap. choice is your own. be quick, your grave still needs diggin'."
"my mirror disappoints me, and am i the only one?"
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
"soldier, back from the distant fray, with the bandaged arm and the ribbon gay, where have you been so long away, and what have your travels taught you?"
"i wish i did not have to sugarcoat my sadness, but if you swallowed it raw / naked / and uncouth, it would curdle your insides and shrivel up your tongue."
"while there the vulture beats his wings, / the pulse of war throbs fever high, / here for a little space i lie / and dream of little things."
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
the show must go on
we're no strangers to love / you know the rules and so do i / a full commitment's what i'm thinking of  / you wouldn't get this from any other guy
maybe my name could also be known / that i helped return good to the people / and restored greatness to rome
hopefully one day you will know what the moon feels like in your hands. that’s how it felt to first hold you.
august—absorbed—numb—
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"in waking life you are a boy with soft shoulders and a softer heart. you've never kissed jesus, but there's a part of you that wants to someday, even with your wicked knees and red—stained mouth."
when will i wake up and know i've done enough?
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
"bless you. love transforms us, no matter how long we hold it in our trembling hands."
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
but what if the ghost is empty because it’s making a space for you?
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
"her fingers brush leaves with tenderness, and you swear your daughter’s gentle hum makes the drooping plant stand taller than before."
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
"decades later, guarded by a forest of roses and thorns, lies a corpse refusing to rot."
you are the most beautiful fate.
i miss you more than i remember you.
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
a safe pair of hands
i have my mother's joy and my father's anger in me. they're always at war.
i'm not beaten by this yet.
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
so he grabs his smith &amp; wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
been sleeping so long / in a twenty-year dark night / and now i see daylight / i only see daylight
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
i tried to touch you but you cut through / MY OWN AMERICAN PSYCHO
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.
"not only had my brother disappeared, but--and bear with me here--a part of my very being had gone with him. stories about us could, from them on, be told from only one perspective. memories could be told but not shared."
i might have accidentally let the darkness eat the light
no one here wants to fight me like you do
a cumbersome and heavy body
"decades later, guarded by a forest of roses and thorns, lies a corpse refusing to rot."
einmal im leben zur rechten zeit sollte man an unmögliches geglaubt haben.
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
"he's never gonna make it, all the poor people he's forsaken, karma is always gonna chase him for his lies"
my lover's a serial killer / but I'll always stay with her
"scraping your blood off my floorboards tonight / even though i've lost you / you'll never leave me, will you? / you've bled into the wood, / this stain is as dark as the wine we shared."
das morbide und todessehnsüchtige.
a symphony of teeth meet tongue meet blood.
to cry is very russian. tears salty and vodka-laced.
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
"some days, you're the best thing in my life / sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife"
blood on my lips. i should kiss my lover.
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
GNASH BONE BENEATH YOUR FIST / TASTE COPPER IN THE AIR / OPEN YOURSELF TO ME
"pas besoin de gril: l'enfer, c'est les autres."
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"the time with the kitchen knife—the one you picked up, then put down, shaking, saying quietly, 'get out. get out.'"
"they’ll speak of my name, of my battles and wars, / but here is the thing; what’s my name without yours?"
"shake me, feel my bones!"
"make it personal. do as much damage as you can. get your message across. that way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. of being considered dangerous."
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
"'people envy me, people hate me. it is the price of success.’ this was news to me. people hate me on a dozen different worlds and i’ve never considered myself a successful man."
"i took the cut, i can take the stitch."
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
"it's like all day my vanity is for sale / take it away, my head is in my own hell"
HARUSPEX TO CARNIFEX: only you can forge steel from the iron in your blood. taste it. weren't you destined for more?
sleeping in new beds / have you ever loved someone this much?
"wisdom &amp; reason are her domain, her realm is that of logicians, philosophers, those of council. she whispers in kings' and emperors' ears alike. but athena is not least goddess of war. one would be prudent to remember this when petitioning her guidance."
late night devil put your hands on me
NO—NO. YOU CANNOT KEEP PUSHING US OUT. YOU CANNOT KEEP BACKING US INTO A CORNER AND TELL US NOT TO BITE; WE MUST. WE ARE TIRED AND AND STARVED AND WE WILL BITE.
"oh lazarus, how did your debts get paid? / oh, lazarus, were you so afraid?"
he and i are closer than friends. we are enemies linked together. the same sin binds us.
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
i just want you to be sorry too.
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
"disillusioned, undoubtedly – cynical, perhaps – but inelegant? never."
dad? am i everything you wanted me to be?
"better to die on your feet than live on your knees, right?"
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
"and i've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord"
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
tell me it was for the hunger / &amp; nothing less. for the hunger is to give / the body what it knows / it cannot keep.
"i take another life, it's all the same / it's one more killing to the man that has no name"
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
"was it so hard, achilles, / so very hard to die? / thou knewest and i know not— / so much the happier i."
and so it seems i must write you letters than i can never send.
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet / talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
i'm just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
the person in us is the part in us of error and sin. every effort of the mystics has always sought to reach the place when there is no longer anything in their soul that says “i.” but the part of the soul that says “us” is still infinitely more dangerous.
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters, miss elizabeth. make them afraid of you."
"reality is so flexible these days, it’s hard to tell who’s disconnected from it and who isn’t. you might even say it’s a pointless distinction."
"he's never gonna make it, all the poor people he's forsaken, karma is always gonna chase him for his lies"
"don't you dare, for one minute, believe that my kindness makes me anything but insurmountable. i did not unzip my chest to every kind of hurt, and stagger back, wounded and alive, just to hear you call me weak for trying."
"i feel his grace slowly running out / give me truth, give me away out"
"oh, can you hear her a-weeping? / crying his name on the moors / though he was cruel like the winter / she clung like flowers to thorns"
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
let me be your one-man army
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
an autumn whispers between the maples kept urging: die with me.
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"i hold you, / and light bleeds through my fingertips."
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
"il y a des choses, des désirs en chacun de nous qu’il vaut mieux étouffer. ou au moins, qu’il est impossible d’exprimer dans un contexte civilisé."
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
"kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy targets."
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
"your name will be known, a promise, a dare. / my name will be known, a promise, a prayer."
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
i never loved you but i almost did.
she folds her hands in her lap with patience and soothes the ache of war in your mind before you even realise she has started speaking.
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
"hey, pretty girl / little plastic doll in lipstick n' nylons /  spill your hot–pink guts over my black-white diner vinyl"
"my heart is a wounded bird, beating its wings against the cage of my ribs."
"the whole day, the whole night –nothing but the thought of her."
"lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy"
and greater men have died for less.
NO—NO. YOU CANNOT KEEP PUSHING US OUT. YOU CANNOT KEEP BACKING US INTO A CORNER AND TELL US NOT TO BITE; WE MUST. WE ARE TIRED AND AND STARVED AND WE WILL BITE.
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
i can feel eternity in my throat.
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
but what if the ghost is empty because it’s making a space for you?
"why is it always raining in your dreams, mikhail?"
"who's a heretic, child?"
the noose slinks around your neck and all you can think about is how an angel might taste
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
"well, i know he'll kill me, but i love that boy to death,"
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
"do or die, son. same as always."
"but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see."
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
maybe my name could also be known / that i helped return good to the people / and restored greatness to rome
take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
and i put cigarettes in the ash tray / everything will be okay
"you show him your half—healed scars, he shows you his scabbed knuckles. you kiss the ghosts of each other's wounds, and then you kiss each other."
mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
'i won't leave you' 'but i already have'
spit teeth into the sink. watch water turn pink. rinse and repeat.
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
i'm not letting you die
"found family, all horrendous people."
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
"you love tenderly and warmly, but your love is like friendship. that's why you have good friends, you're sociable, sympathetic toward people. until this dissatisfaction comes over you-you know what i'm talking about."
will you fight? or die like a dog?
"'people envy me, people hate me. it is the price of success.’ this was news to me. people hate me on a dozen different worlds and i’ve never considered myself a successful man."
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"il y a des choses, des désirs en chacun de nous qu’il vaut mieux étouffer. ou au moins, qu’il est impossible d’exprimer dans un contexte civilisé."
what i want back is what i was.
what is past is not dead; it is not even past. we cut ourselves off from it; we pretend to be strangers.
august—absorbed—numb—
i’ve made it clear I am not to be trusted with a body / always leaving mine bloodless as icewith just a needle / of breath left in its lungs
my lover's a serial killer / but I'll always stay with her
"and i've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord"
the kind of man i am doesn't wash out
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
"you are temptation, all i desire"
things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
what happened was that i was a boy once and bruiseless.

"my elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
"let me in, wear me out,"
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
an autumn whispers between the maples kept urging: die with me.
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
RUNNING IS A VICTORY.

"violets from plug street wood-think what they have meant to me-life and hope and love and you. (and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so.)"
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
he was pointing at the moon but i was looking at his hand
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
"sometimes a flower is just a flower, and the best thing it can do for us is to die."
"your name will be known, a promise, a dare. / my name will be known, a promise, a prayer."
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
"i didn't want to hug you into a cross, but i'm here to be measured down to each numbered bone."
i am not a creature that was born. i am a fire that was set.
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
"all that i want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"
"hear me, herald of your fall, icarus! your ambition, vaulting and naïve in its placement, will bid you no seat amongst the table of the gods!"
do we simply stare at what is horrible and forgive it?
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
"death, my son, is a good thing for all men; it is the night for this worried day that we call life. it is in the sleep of death that finds rest for eternity the sickness, pain, desperation, and the fears that agitate, without end, we unhappy living souls."
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
"then i fuck up, lost with no direction / this is my one shot at redemption"
there are no animals here but us.
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
"i'm a breakneck city slicking dog, grab your gun"

you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
"grace is a gift for the fallen, dear; you're an angry blade, and you're brave, but you're all alone."
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because I'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.
"lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy"
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
"scraping your blood off my floorboards tonight / even though i've lost you / you'll never leave me, will you? / you've bled into the wood, / this stain is as dark as the wine we shared."

"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
"the pitter–patter of rain draws me out of morbid curiosities. i shan't dwell on these thoughts of maggots under my dearest's skin nor, yes, even the unseemly paleness of lifelessness. one can only pray he is resting well."
"your name will be known, a blessing, a curse. / my name will be known, for better, for worse."
you are the most beautiful fate.
maybe my name could also be known / that i helped return good to the people / and restored greatness to rome
"heartless challenge, pick your path and i’ll pray"
"they laughed bitterly. we drank, and remembered when the world was softer,"
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
i was compelled to love you / not because you are the fairest / but because you are the deepest / for a lover of beauty is usually a fool
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them. / they assault me and throw stones and words at me / they want me to die so they can eulogize me."
"people that can hurt you, the ones that can really hurt you, are the ones that are close enough to do it."
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
up to my ritual destruction / i open up my head and i let the demons in / and turn nothing into something
"how dull it is to live your life without any hills to die on,"

"something about brown eyes. something about the warmth, the color of hearth &amp; heart. the endless vastness of them, how easily i lose myself, fall into them. oak &amp; sandalwood. yes. brown eyes."
but man is not made for defeat. a man can be destroyed but not defeated.
"das sterben is rot. blut auf weißer wolle. blut auf grüner wiese. blutspuren, blutschlieren, tropfendes, fließendes, strömendes blut."
the noose slinks around your neck and all you can think about is how an angel might taste
"so you can wipe off that grin, i know where you've been / it's all been a pack of lies"
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
"i'm how many people sit home at night wondering if they will be here tonight, wondering if children they bring to the light, inherit the world or inherit the night?"
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
i was compelled to love you / not because you are the fairest / but because you are the deepest / for a lover of beauty is usually a fool
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
comrade ruslan had a funny way of telling us he cared. that is to say: he didn't.
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.
and when i drift away / when i lose my way / my body starts to decay
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
"your name will be known, a promise, a dare. / my name will be known, a promise, a prayer."
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
do you have any weapons on you? — i have a longing that's killing me.
"i squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly / your heart mortally wounded,/ by the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite, / of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!"
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
maybe praying will help.
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
it was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry i had strapped about me. the rest were unequivocal sentences of death.

when god draws last breath and i am once again torn to ask: how far do i dare go?
"you're staring at a man you don't recognize and think: i don't know what to do with myself. you shatter the mirror, and think: this is the man i become."
"isn't it bliss? don't you approve? one who keeps tearing around, one who can't move. but where are the clowns? send in the clowns."

"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
do we simply stare at what is horrible and forgive it?
"it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters, miss elizabeth. make them afraid of you."
"watching her dance, something alights in my chest so bright and soulful, i burn and glow with it inside and out. oh, oh, what is this, heart?"

(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
"hope is rising in me, like sap in a tree. blood in a wound."
maybe someday / we will be two / people meeting / again for the / first time.
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
"death, my son, is a good thing for all men; it is the night for this worried day that we call life. it is in the sleep of death that finds rest for eternity the sickness, pain, desperation, and the fears that agitate, without end, we unhappy living souls."
"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
"let me in, wear me out,"
"it's the first time, the last time we ever met"
i will burn your kingdom down if you try to conquer me and mine
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
"you look at me with those brown eyes, what do you want to do?"
your fragile heart and your paper skin
so hold your breath and say goodbye
"this is all nonsense. i love being in love with you, it makes even unhappiness seem no bigger than a pin, even at the times when i wish so violently that i could give my heart to science to be rid of it."
"it's like all day my vanity is for sale / take it away, my head is in my own hell"
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"what happened is what had to happen. maybe it's not fair, but i can't think of much that is. i know the guilty never get what they deserve."
something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
"went into the water on account for disobeying my father. felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
"tight jeans, loose morals."
"why is it always raining in your dreams, mikhail?"
&amp; yes / i want to be named to the marrow / make inventory &amp; god of what has yet hurt me
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
"i was here for a moment, and then, i was gone. i wish you all a long and happy life."
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
am i not your eurydice?
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
i've always loved the songs of the unsung.
i can't save us / my atlantis
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
always been a storm
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
"this isn't how it's supposed to be. no, frankie, this isn't how i'm supposed to die!"
"it runs in the family,"
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
and they grieve for their dead. such raw sorrow. can't partake. mine would flood oceans. it would drown me.
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
"yet, she laughs strangely, no longer the giggling girl she used to be but free in a way you have never seen. her smile can drop so fast now, her now-old eyes can turn distant and glassy, and her tears, now rarer, are always silent."
lesser men have died for more
"bless you. love transforms us, no matter how long we hold it in our trembling hands."
and love is for the birds / when things are complicated
i had him bless these hands just to run you out / give me strength when you run your mouth
"wait for her in the evening at the spring, among perfumed roses."
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
"god, aren't you something?"
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
push me to the point my heart breaks and aches / remind me what i'm doing this for / let me go on and fight for more and more
"do or die, son. same as always."
"up there we will fight with each other, and the one who pushes the other over will become king and be able to drink blood."
those are my limbs dancing; i am waking up.
"i lay still for a while, picking up the scattered garments of my mind and trying to assemble some kind of reasonable outfit from them."
"'we were always going to say goodbye, weren't we?' 'yeah, i think so.' 'i loved you though. i loved you so much.' a pause. 'i know, i know. i loved you too.'"
"it begins in the throat, a sense of wrong,"
"heavy wind, cold rain, &amp; yes the stars, &amp; yes these hands of mine. a dream in my chest is molting. my dream sheds its muddy, thunder—stained skin &amp; asks for a heart of peony fields this time."
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
in the darkness. in the slaughterhouse. and alone. with this story i go to death.
"congratulations, you have survived the war. now live with the trauma."
so hold your breath and say goodbye
"pour y vivre, il faut en respirer une partie et, inévitablement, être contaminé."
"my mirror disappoints me, and am i the only one?"
"sometimes, you need somebody to wake you the fuck up and tell you the shooting has started."
"off in my head, lost, off in my head"
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
you're among wolves now. and these are our woods.
these violent delights have violent ends.
"spearing between each rib and licking the pennies off your lips, aren't i a silver—tongued liar?"
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
they say dyin' ain't no way to make a living
"no one gets out alive, every day is do or die"
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
"conviction introduces emotion, which is the enemy of oratory."
"if i had at that moment a sense of calm kindly death while my heart beat and my lungs expanded, he might know a similar sense of life in the middle of his ongoing death."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
you can have my heart if you have the stomach to take it. kiss me hard enough to invert me.
"kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy targets."
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
soot in my throat / grave dirt under my nails / this wicked resurrection
they say dyin' ain't no way to make a living
"i prayed, i prayed, god sent me right to voicemail"
used and used and used and used.
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT—WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FOR A WHILE?
enter the fool.
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
"always on the upswing, baby,"
HARUSPEX TO CARNIFEX: only you can forge steel from the iron in your blood. taste it. weren't you destined for more?
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
"i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive,"
we’re too old to play games. we’re only human.
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
he wants to be tender and merciful. that sounds overly valorous. sounds like penance.
"i prayed, i prayed, god sent me right to voicemail"
"bless you. love transforms us, no matter how long we hold it in our trembling hands."
am i not your eurydice?
"my elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
"up there we will fight with each other, and the one who pushes the other over will become king and be able to drink blood."
"she sings songs you do not know in a language that makes your chest twist in odd ways. you watch her dance in floating steps, bare feet barely touching the dewy grass."
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
"shake me, feel my bones!"
"you can have the light of the world blind you, bath you in grace / but i don't see so easily what you hold in your hands"
"death at the gates again / howling my name / come on in, old buddy, sorry i made you wait"
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"i feel his grace slowly running out / give me truth, give me away out"
"our father who art in heaven, are you listening?"
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
"there's no such thing as fighting dirty. you fight, and you survive, or you don't. there is no other end to it."
there are days i wish i would have loved you so i would know how to stop.
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
"all it took was a special look and i felt i knew you before, i didn't mean to love you, didn't think it would work out"
do you believe in free will or fate?
"things i almost remember,"
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
"all that i want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"
when the beating of your heart / echoes the beating of the drums / there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
and they grieve for their dead. such raw sorrow. can't partake. mine would flood oceans. it would drown me.
it poisons me—the indifference of the celestials towards us earthly.
as if a second self
"the pitter–patter of rain draws me out of morbid curiosities. i shan't dwell on these thoughts of maggots under my dearest's skin nor, yes, even the unseemly paleness of lifelessness. one can only pray he is resting well."
"some days, you're the best thing in my life / sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife"
"you love tenderly and warmly, but your love is like friendship. that's why you have good friends, you're sociable, sympathetic toward people. until this dissatisfaction comes over you-you know what i'm talking about."
"feeling turned to thought, but my character seemed split into a thousand parts; each part was independent and had its own consciousness, and in vain did the head command limbs, which, like faithless vassals, would not obey its author."
i've always loved the songs of the unsung.
"stay here, i know i love you but i need another year,"
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
"i end here, helpless, and nothing, nothing that i could have done or not done, wanted or thought, would have led me to a different goal."
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."
"isn't it bliss? don't you approve? one who keeps tearing around, one who can't move. but where are the clowns? send in the clowns."
i had forsaken all friendship in life and was roaming the earth at the mercy of the rolling waves of chance.
"there's no such thing as fighting dirty. you fight, and you survive, or you don't. there is no other end to it."
i'm just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
your whole life is oscar bait.
what is past is not dead; it is not even past. we cut ourselves off from it; we pretend to be strangers.
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
and love is for the birds / when things are complicated
show me your thorns and i'll show you hands ready to bleed.
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
i swear to god the devil made me do it
"guilt in sinks, i feel you crawl under my skin / 'cause after all, i can only blame myself / my neglect turned you into an insect, now you won't let me be"
war is the only thing we really understand.
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
don't know if you love me or you want me dead
somebody showed you all of the horror / you weren't born with it
it is you. you are the weapon.
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
april to our deathbed
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
i tried to love you but you're not my type / tried to pretend but it just don't feel right
i've got blood on my name
"i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive,"
in the grand scheme of things: it was never about how well i spoke or how learned i was. i looked different. no getting ahead of that.
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
i will make myself steel / i will shed this bone / shift cartilage into iron.
"tight jeans, loose morals."
worship her touch &amp; savor the divine radiance in her eyes.
when god draws last breath and i am once again torn to ask: how far do i dare go?
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
lesser men have died for more
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
"darling, dearest, dead."
uh oh! check your head!
"'cause with god as my witness, you corporate fucking prick, i did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick"
maybe someday / we will be two / people meeting / again for the / first time.

"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
"locked and loaded, where the hell is peace of mind?"
one thing i can promise you: coming back from the dead is a bitch. every single time.

"violets from plug street wood, sweet, i send you oversea. (it is strange they should be blue, blue, when his soaked blood was red, for they grew around his head; it is strange they should be blue.)"
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
some nights you are the lighthouse / some nights the sea / what this means is that i don't know / desire other than the need / to be shattered &amp; rebuilt
i feel i am destined to observe. never experience.
"you ask me what i want from life, i said 'to make a lot of money and feel dead inside.'"
"this is a story about what it means to fall from grace and crawl to salvation, fingers open and bleeding,"
"let me in, wear me out,"
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
comrade ruslan had a funny way of telling us he cared. that is to say: he didn't.
now your life's no longer empty / surely heaven waits for you
lesser men have died for more
"and i've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord"
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
i just want you to be sorry too.
my own twenty first century jesus

i tried to touch you but you cut through / MY OWN AMERICAN PSYCHO
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
do you sleep or do you pray?
nothing could sadden me greater than the promise of immortality. what a miserable existence.
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."

i will burn your kingdom down if you try to conquer me and mine
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
and i feel life for the very first time / love in my arms and the sun in my eyes

"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
"you are not mine, and never will be. love is not born of possession, of ownership. learn this. never call yourself mine. you are yours."
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"the monster never dies no matter how many times you kill it. it just sheds its skin and changes form. i can feel the weight of the world pushing me down, i try to carry it nonetheless. one last time, then i can rest."

call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"god, aren't you something?"
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
o rose beyond the reach of time and of the senses / o kiss enveloped in the scarves of all the winds / surprise me with one dream / that my madness will recoil from you

"this is what it comes down to: you, me, and a single bullet."
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
the butterflies you give me are making me nauseous

"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"but if you hold me without hurting me, you'll be the first who ever did"
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."

this war is a disease. passed through blood spilled by warriors.
your whole life is oscar bait.
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
"sweet child, you are wrath given life."
sleeping in new beds / have you ever loved someone this much?
i had him bless these hands just to run you out / give me strength when you run your mouth
do you have any weapons on you? — i have a longing that's killing me.
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, takeshi, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."

blood on my lips. i should kiss my lover.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.

"baby, i'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango,"
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
when we were gods (never let me forget that)
"i know that name. i know you. there was blood, and masks, and blades raised."
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
what prayers do we say when we think god isn't listening?
so he grabs his smith &amp; wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson
"i was here for a moment, and then, i was gone. i wish you all a long and happy life."
"she reminded him that vengeance is more pathetic than forgiveness. hadn’t he had his revenge when he buried his mother’s dreams? she wrote that he, yaqub, the resentful, the rejected, was also the more brutish and violent of the two, and he would be judged for that."
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
most will only have one death. i will have two.
i've always loved the songs of the unsung.

"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"silly me, believing the world cared."
"i can feel the weight of the world pushing me down, i try to carry it nonetheless."
"if you love me, let me go"

i just want you to be sorry too.
"it is said that the miraculous has vanished from the earth, but i do not believe it."
"loving you isn't the right thing to do, how can i ever change things that i feel?"
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
"to be loved means to be consumed. to love means to radiate with inexhaustible light. to be loved is to pass away, to love is to endure."
(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
you're among wolves now. and these are our woods.
"baby, i'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango,"
"an eternity on a butcher's block, waiting for the knife to fall. there's nothing left of me but this."
you have a long day. you have a really long day.
"war: another day, another man bleeds."
NO—NO. YOU CANNOT KEEP PUSHING US OUT. YOU CANNOT KEEP BACKING US INTO A CORNER AND TELL US NOT TO BITE; WE MUST. WE ARE TIRED AND AND STARVED AND WE WILL BITE.
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"you ask me what i want from life, i said 'to make a lot of money and feel dead inside.'"
when will i wake up and know i've done enough?
the steel of your blade kisses my throat / wishing it was your lips to mine
and so it seems i must write you letters than i can never send.
"we missed redemption, missed reflection, kissed the weapon"
his face opening up with a smile rather than a scowl. it freezes you mid-step to find such simple joy in him.
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
you are the most beautiful fate.
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"was she then to be lost to me? nay, for as she left this vale of sorrows, she had kindled the eternal love that now glowed within me."
i feel i am destined to observe. never experience.
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
GNASH BONE BENEATH YOUR FIST / TASTE COPPER IN THE AIR / OPEN YOURSELF TO ME
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
"i was here for a moment, and then, i was gone. i wish you all a long and happy life."
the butterflies you give me are making me nauseous
"tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies"
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
am i not your eurydice?
"and ever anon you heave a sigh, as some hidden memory wrought you."
she folds her hands in her lap with patience and soothes the ache of war in your mind before you even realise she has started speaking.
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
to feel anything deranges you. to be seen feeling anything strips you naked
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"you say i killed you—haunt me, then,"
"i'm a breakneck city slicking dog, grab your gun"
"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
"i take another life, it's all the same / it's one more killing to the man that has no name"
the kind of man i am doesn't wash out
"i don't love any of these men, just want to feel the most i can"
"you are 12 and the police tell you to come back later, they're still looking for you. milk carton poster boy."
between killing and dying there's a third way: live
pick a god and pray.
what i want back is what i was.
what is past is not dead; it is not even past. we cut ourselves off from it; we pretend to be strangers.
"the body proving it can always fail you, if it chooses to, in new and spectacular ways."
without hope we are lost.

things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"no one gets out alive, every day is do or die"
"if you love me, let me go"
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.
someone has to leave first. this a very old story. there is no other version of this story.
and they grieve for their dead. such raw sorrow. can't partake. mine would flood oceans. it would drown me.
"what separates a soldier from a murderer? only repetition. both killers, still."
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
ma vie est une énigme dont ton nom est le mot.
all the time in the world— and filled with tomorrows.
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"the personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. so if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. get angry."
i will make myself steel / i will shed this bone / shift cartilage into iron.

"all it took was a special look and i felt i knew you before, i didn't mean to love you, didn't think it would work out"
"you love tenderly and warmly, but your love is like friendship. that's why you have good friends, you're sociable, sympathetic toward people. until this dissatisfaction comes over you-you know what i'm talking about."
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"angels sing the final song / silence will turn to sleep / take heed, my son / the darkness will come"
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
i tried to love you but you're not my type / tried to pretend but it just don't feel right
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"off in my head, lost, off in my head"
it seems unnatural being born together and then dying apart.
"i lay still for a while, picking up the scattered garments of my mind and trying to assemble some kind of reasonable outfit from them."
the show must go on
"how dull it is to live your life without any hills to die on,"
mankind was born on earth. it was never meant to die here.
"you are temptation, all i desire"
"who's a heretic, child?"
don't know if you love me or you want me dead
"i prayed, i prayed, god sent me right to voicemail"
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
the next click you hear is me hanging up. the one after that—is me pulling the trigger.
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
"her fingers brush leaves with tenderness, and you swear your daughter’s gentle hum makes the drooping plant stand taller than before."
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
used and used and used and used.
o rose beyond the reach of time and of the senses / o kiss enveloped in the scarves of all the winds / surprise me with one dream / that my madness will recoil from you
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
"always on the upswing, baby,"

"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
"without the blurred sight of joy and relief, it has become impossible to ignore. all the love inside you cannot keep you from seeing the truth. your children are strangers to you."
a symphony of teeth meet tongue meet blood.
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
"death, my son, is a good thing for all men; it is the night for this worried day that we call life. it is in the sleep of death that finds rest for eternity the sickness, pain, desperation, and the fears that agitate, without end, we unhappy living souls."
do you sleep or do you pray?
"inconnue, elle était ma forme préférée, / celle qui m’enlevait le souci d’être un homme, / et je la vois et je la perds et je subis / ma douleur, comme un peu de soleil de l’eau froide."
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
"their voices ring with an odd lilt and their eyes—it has become hard to look at them straight on, hasn’t it? your children have changed, and as much as you knew they would grow a little in the time away from you, your children have become strangers."
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
"his hands wrapped around a cup of tea with a weariness not even the war should bring to him, not after all the effort you put into keeping him safe."
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
"sing to me, i am not doing well / getting tired of my own words"

"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"dawn bright, a kindred heart in my arms"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
but the lies they will hurt you / hold on / human kindness desert you
you keep us at arm's distance so that you won't mourn us. but you'll mourn us anyway. that's the way love works.
"i'm all talk with a thorn in my side, i got a real big heart that i'm willing to hide"
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
"this is a story about what it means to fall from grace and crawl to salvation, fingers open and bleeding,"
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
most will only have one death. i will have two.
you will never be lovelier than you are now. we will never be here again.
carry me to my love / ov'r the sea to the clouds above / where i know he is waiting for me
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.

i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
your whole life is oscar bait.
"... god, how i ricochet between certainties and doubts."
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because I'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."

things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."

and i feel life for the very first time / love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
"because men in suits were once men with crowns, and the way the world works never changes. fuck that: it's my turn now."
"i don't love any of these men, just want to feel the most i can"
einmal im leben zur rechten zeit sollte man an unmögliches geglaubt haben.
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
what is done out of love always takes place between good and evil.
"dawn bright, a kindred heart in my arms"
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
ma vie est une énigme dont ton nom est le mot.
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
late night devil put your hands on me
"i've never liked the dentist. hands in my mouth, i resisted the urge to bite to bone. god, what an instinct."
"the one minute. the soldier’s minute. in a battle, that’s all you get. one minute of everything at once. and anything before is nothing. everything after, nothing. nothing in comparison to that one minute."
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
golden hair and a blue-sky smile belie the strength of river-gods and wolf jaws.
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
to apologize! to be saved! to forgive! to forget! to be pure!
"i stand on the shoulders of his greatness, as they do. as one day, you will."
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"'we were always going to say goodbye, weren't we?' 'yeah, i think so.' 'i loved you though. i loved you so much.' a pause. 'i know, i know. i loved you too.'"
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
"where does it hurt? it answered: everywhere, everywhere, everywhere."
"you have bewitched me, body and soul."
(to the stars) the moon pleaded: stay.
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
and again he asks me to kill him. one more time before he falls to his knees and sobs. and i get it. i do. because i have a brother too.
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"lover, i know you to be tender. lover, why hide? these rough palms, open knuckles, they are not your own."
uh oh! check your head!
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"i was living my own future and my brother's lost one as well. i represented him here just as he represented me there, in some unguessable other place. his move from life to death might resemble my stepping into the kitchen - into its soft nowhere quality and foggy hum."
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because I'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."
"dad has never hit harvey, and he's not going to. if dad beat tommy to death and then raised a hand to harvey, tommy would rise from his grave to catch it."
"their voices ring with an odd lilt and their eyes—it has become hard to look at them straight on, hasn’t it? your children have changed, and as much as you knew they would grow a little in the time away from you, your children have become strangers."
"baby be a simple kind of man / oh won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
"don't fall for monsters,"
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
there are some arenas so corrupt that the only clean acts possible are nihilistic.
RUNNING IS A VICTORY.
you have a long day. you have a really long day.
"be still, my foolish heart, don't ruin this on me."
i've got blood on my name
is it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?
"what was it like to love? oh, it was burning. where did it burn? everywhere. it burned everywhere."
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"one last time, then i can rest."
it is as fate behests it.
"when once i still knew you,"
"to die for lack of love is horrible. the asphyxia of the soul,"
HARUSPEX TO CARNIFEX: only you can forge steel from the iron in your blood. taste it. weren't you destined for more?
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
"you're so pretty when you're spitting in the sink,"
"i have this dream that i'm hitting my dad with a baseball bat, and he is screaming and crying for help, and maybe halfway through it has more to do with me killing him than it ever did protecting myself."
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.
childishness is a common enough sin amongst humans. perhaps we should not be so quick to judge.
this is how i destroy you.
i've always loved the songs of the unsung.
and i feel life for the very first time / love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
my name is
"your body a supermax prison / you, your own warden, guard, and detainee."
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
"hey baby, you're a bruiser. hey baby, this is what they made you."
i tried to touch you but you cut through / MY OWN AMERICAN PSYCHO
it takes a real man to fall on his sword.
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"i take another life, it's all the same / it's one more killing to the man that has no name"
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, takeshi, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
"they asked, 'do you love her to death?' i said, 'speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.'"
"rest then, love. you have nothing to fear"
"oh, i adore you, my good—looking boy."
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet / talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"
"il y a des choses, des désirs en chacun de nous qu’il vaut mieux étouffer. ou au moins, qu’il est impossible d’exprimer dans un contexte civilisé."
you're among wolves now. and these are our woods.
"i'm a breakneck city slicking dog, grab your gun"
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"like all men of power, when he talked of prices worth paying, you could be sure of one thing. someone else was paying."
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
"i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive,"
this is how i destroy you.
"wait for her in the evening at the spring, among perfumed roses."
"this isn't a war, but the breaking of seals. the undoing of life itself."
aren't you just as tired of the fear within me? / then throw your gun in the river! what do you say?
"isn't it bliss? don't you approve? one who keeps tearing around, one who can't move. but where are the clowns? send in the clowns."
happy childhoods make for dull company.
when your lungs fill with polyps / and your heart is filled with blood / if i had a gun
"this warmth, this body not my own."
"being his real brother i could feel i live in his shadows, but i never have and i do not now. i live in his glow."
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because I'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."
was a time i was scared of you. was a time i'd piss myself having a gun pointed at my head. you know what i feel right now? not a god damned thing.
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"mother, am i acquitted? was i righteous and just? good enough to witness the awe of heaven? / oh no. mother. i'm going to hell."
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"fine, make me your villain"
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
"you are 12 and the police tell you to come back later, they're still looking for you. milk carton poster boy."
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT—WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FOR A WHILE?
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
like calls to like.
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"CARNIFEX TO HARUSPEX: you'd known, from the beginning, what i'd become. how could you let me?"
soot in my throat / grave dirt under my nails / this wicked resurrection
last night i dreamt that your head lay on my stomach and traced the rise and fall of my breath.
how do you get in the mind-state to kill?
it takes a real man to fall on his sword.
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
i've got blood on my name
"just tryin' to catch a free ride, from the temple to the tomb"
i stare at the bathroom mirror and hope to die with flesh intact.
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
lick on my knife / and honour the taste
death at the gates again / howling my name / i can't greet you today
and i feel life for the very first time / love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
and love is for the birds / when things are complicated
"violets from plug street wood-think what they have meant to me-life and hope and love and you. (and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so.)"
"how dull it is to live your life without any hills to die on,"
"a yearning to be known, a hunger not yet sated. yet, as though i'd know this embrace."
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"oh god, i'm gonna die alone"
"one last time, then i can rest."
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
i have my mother's joy and my father's anger in me. they're always at war.
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
when your lungs fill with polyps / and your heart is filled with blood / if i had a gun
"you are my destroyer, i call everywhere"
"be still, my foolish heart, don't ruin this on me."
we’re too old to play games. we’re only human.
am i not your eurydice?
"you're so pretty when you're spitting in the sink,"
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
"he's never gonna make it, all the poor people he's forsaken, karma is always gonna chase him for his lies"
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"war: another day, another man bleeds."
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
"born as mortals are, i have a mother / and a house with many windows, / i have brothers, friends, / and a prison cell with a cold window."
i've got blood on my name
i threw glass at my friend's eyes and now i'm on probation
there are days i wish i would have loved you so i would know how to stop.
"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
sometimes you get so close to someone you end up on the other side of them.
you speak of love like it’s a threat. you hold it to my throat and i flinch against it.
april to our deathbed
"young atlas, the weight of the world on your sun-kissed shoulders"
"went into the water on account for disobeying my father. felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"heartless challenge, pick your path and i’ll pray"
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
"waiting to be done breaking, fingers tapping, i am coping"
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
when your lungs fill with polyps / and your heart is filled with blood / if i had a gun
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
"make them understand. ignite the fear inside them – just enough to keep them warm, not to burn them."
it seems unnatural being born together and then dying apart.
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"what happened is what had to happen. maybe it's not fair, but i can't think of much that is. i know the guilty never get what they deserve."
it was the single forgiving phrase in the syntax of weaponry i had strapped about me. the rest were unequivocal sentences of death.
"oh lazarus, how did your debts get paid? / oh, lazarus, were you so afraid?"
"make it personal. do as much damage as you can. get your message across. that way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. of being considered dangerous."
like calls to like.
"what was it like to love? oh, it was burning. where did it burn? everywhere. it burned everywhere."
what prayers do we say when we think god isn't listening?
i'm a goth girl on the inside. on the outside? a father figure.
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"and time and again they cream your liquidation, your displacement, your torture and brutal execution with the ultimate insult that it’s just business, it’s politics, it’s the way of the world, it’s a tough life and that it’s nothing personal. well, fuck them. make it personal."
"but fuck it, you’ve got to make a stand somewhere. and a man can stave off his own death wish for only so long."
"it runs in the family,"
sleeping in new beds / have you ever loved someone this much?
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
"yet, she laughs strangely, no longer the giggling girl she used to be but free in a way you have never seen. her smile can drop so fast now, her now-old eyes can turn distant and glassy, and her tears, now rarer, are always silent."
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
"and ever anon you heave a sigh, as some hidden memory wrought you."
late night devil put your hands on me
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
"you have bewitched me, body and soul."
"dawn bright, a kindred heart in my arms"
"it was the government, the companies, bureaucracy, the lobbyists, the congressmen and lies. they trickled into both my ears, it got louder over the years, until all that i could hear was fucking flies."
you broke my body in / and i broke your body in / you turned me onto sin / will you make me whole again?
we’re too old to play games. we’re only human.
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."
i tried to touch you but you cut through / MY OWN AMERICAN PSYCHO
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
"no one gets out alive, every day is do or die"
i will burn your kingdom down if you try to conquer me and mine
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.
to cry is very russian. tears salty and vodka-laced.
"this is what it comes down to: you, me, and a single bullet."
i've always loved the songs of the unsung.
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
used and used and used and used.
"your name will be known, a blessing, a curse. / my name will be known, for better, for worse."
last night i dreamt that your head lay on my stomach and traced the rise and fall of my breath.
AN: fixed typo
"who are your children now, and who pried their childhood out of your shaking hands?"
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"dad has never hit harvey, and he's not going to. if dad beat tommy to death and then raised a hand to harvey, tommy would rise from his grave to catch it."
"celui qui désespère des événements est un lâche, mais celui qui espère en la condition humaine est un fou."
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
a symphony of teeth meet tongue meet blood.
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"born as mortals are, i have a mother / and a house with many windows, / i have brothers, friends, / and a prison cell with a cold window."
it is you. you are the weapon.
"to be falled by you, to be held by you."
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
let me be your one-man army
"you know what, babe? you look good under my boot."
i am not ruined. i am ruination.
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
i can't save us / my atlantis
but the blood in the water / is the blood of my brother
"violets from plug street wood, sweet, i send you oversea. (it is strange they should be blue, blue, when his soaked blood was red, for they grew around his head; it is strange they should be blue.)"
you have a long day. you have a really long day.
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
"but maybe that was the trick of it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."
an autumn whispers between the maples kept urging: die with me.
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
"how would he know what’s forbidden to him when his friend is laid out for him, like a carcass on the butcher’s slab, so often and so easily. what part of this is not meant for him?"
"it runs in the family,"
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
"coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones,"
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
i threw glass at my friend's eyes and now i'm on probation
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
"oh lazarus, how did your debts get paid? / oh, lazarus, were you so afraid?"
when we were gods (never let me forget that)
i just want you to be sorry too.
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"i feel his grace slowly running out / give me truth, give me away out"
"i'm a breakneck city slicking dog, grab your gun"
"humanity has spread to the stars. we set out like ancient seafarers to explore the limitless ocean of space. but no matter how far we venture into the unknown, the worst monsters are those we bring with us."
"you’ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you’re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you."
nose bleeds like an afterthought
"don't you dare, for one minute, believe that my kindness makes me anything but insurmountable. i did not unzip my chest to every kind of hurt, and stagger back, wounded and alive, just to hear you call me weak for trying."
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
"this is your life, this is still your life"
when the beating of your heart / echoes the beating of the drums / there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.
"this isn't a war, but the breaking of seals. the undoing of life itself."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"don't fall for monsters,"
"you are my destroyer, i call everywhere"
"what happened is what had to happen. maybe it's not fair, but i can't think of much that is. i know the guilty never get what they deserve."
but the lies they will hurt you / hold on / human kindness desert you
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
"you're staring at a man you don't recognize and think: i don't know what to do with myself. you shatter the mirror, and think: this is the man i become."
"you have bewitched me, body and soul."
slain and unknown. neither gathered up by forgetfulness / nor dispersed by memorythey're forgotten
"mother, am i acquitted? was i righteous and just? good enough to witness the awe of heaven? / oh no. mother. i'm going to hell."
it sounds pretty human to me; you wanna have control over something you can't.
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them. / they assault me and throw stones and words at me / they want me to die so they can eulogize me."
happy childhoods make for dull company.
AN: i know it's only september but i'm a huge loser for halloween so. deal with it.
comrade ruslan had a funny way of telling us he cared. that is to say: he didn't.
one thing i can promise you: coming back from the dead is a bitch. every single time.
"was it so hard, achilles, / so very hard to die? / thou knewest and i know not— / so much the happier i."
death at the gates again / howling my name / i can't greet you today
this is how i destroy you.
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
"it's the evening for me, so shanah tovah!"
i was compelled to love you / not because you are the fairest / but because you are the deepest / for a lover of beauty is usually a fool
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
"counting the names of those i've wronged, an endless list. debt after debt, unpaid,"
"i don't despise you for what you allowed to happen to me. i despise you because when i was released, you refused to be found and i needed you more than anything in my life. not to mend my broken bones, i needed my brother to mend my broken spirit."
"i lay still for a while, picking up the scattered garments of my mind and trying to assemble some kind of reasonable outfit from them."
i would let her wring my love out of me. devotion and delusion.
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
"hear me, herald of your fall, icarus! your ambition, vaulting and naïve in its placement, will bid you no seat amongst the table of the gods!"
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
"you think we’ve got the handle on reality, just ’cause we can record bits of it. more to it than that, pal. more to it than that."
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
somebody showed you all of the horror / you weren't born with it
"there’s a nameless grave by an azure sea (and i couldn’t tell what his rank might be), i only know i killed him."
they want me to die so they can eulogize me.
where do you keep your sadness?
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
"and the eighth wonder of the world / is that i who have died am now / alive again, here on this earth / for no other reason than to love you."
i cannot say i am familiar with forgiveness.
enter the fool.
so hopelessly devoted to you
a cumbersome and heavy body
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"this is your life, this is still your life"
i can spoil the ending: everybody dies.
"death and romance, the riddles of our lifetimes / tryna get a slow dance, middle of a knife fight"
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
the butterflies you give me are making me nauseous
"they asked, 'do you love her to death?' i said, 'speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.'"
"violets from plug street wood, sweet, i send you oversea. (it is strange they should be blue, blue, when his soaked blood was red, for they grew around his head; it is strange they should be blue.)"
"HEY BABY, YOU'RE A BRUISER. HEY BABY, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MADE FOR!"
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
my lips are full of ruby lies. smooth criminal dancing in forgotten light. put on a trail for breaking. for hurting.
death at the gates again / howling my name / i can't greet you today
i prayed that god might return you to me.
RUNNING IS A VICTORY.
you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
"one last time, then i can rest."
there is telepathy between hearts.
"'cause with god as my witness, you corporate fucking prick, i did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick"
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
AN: heeeeeey aha .... lewd accounts 🙏 please don't. thank u so much. this has been a message from ur overlord.
"let me in, wear me out,"
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
when we were gods (never let me forget that)
"and the eighth wonder of the world / is that i who have died am now / alive again, here on this earth / for no other reason than to love you."
"but fuck it, you’ve got to make a stand somewhere. and a man can stave off his own death wish for only so long."
"i always knew that you would hurt me to death some day, but I hoped to choose the time and place."
you can have my heart if you have the stomach to take it. kiss me hard enough to invert me.
"it's like all day my vanity is for sale / take it away, my head is in my own hell"
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
"i stand on the shoulders of his greatness, as they do. as one day, you will."
"you and me, always together"
my name is
"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
you have a long day. you have a really long day.
used and used and used and used.
some nights you are the lighthouse / some nights the sea / what this means is that i don't know / desire other than the need / to be shattered &amp; rebuilt
they want me to die so they can eulogize me.
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
"everyone's a whore, grace. we just sell different parts of ourselves."
and so it seems i must write you letters than i can never send.
"violets from plug street wood-think what they have meant to me-life and hope and love and you. (and you did not see them grow, where his mangled body lay, hiding horror from the day; sweetest it was better so.)"
"RUN BOY RUN, BREAK OUT FROM SOCIETY."
RUNNING IS A VICTORY.
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
like calls to like.
maybe my name could also be known / that i helped return good to the people / and restored greatness to rome
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
"there lie many fighting men, / dead in their youthful prime, / never to laugh nor love again / nor taste the summertime."
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
my lover's a serial killer / but I'll always stay with her
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
the steel of your blade kisses my throat / wishing it was your lips to mine
"AN: you guys like me to edit names out of quotes to make them more applicable?   * will not be done to existing quotes, only ones moving forward since the backlog is huge."
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"why is it always raining in your dreams, mikhail?"
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
"'we were always going to say goodbye, weren't we?' 'yeah, i think so.' 'i loved you though. i loved you so much.' a pause. 'i know, i know. i loved you too.'"
"things i almost remember,"
"you’ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you’re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you."
"you are temptation, all i desire"
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
a sadness runs through him.
"stay here, i know i love you but i need another year,"
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"i was living my own future and my brother's lost one as well. i represented him here just as he represented me there, in some unguessable other place. his move from life to death might resemble my stepping into the kitchen - into its soft nowhere quality and foggy hum."
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT—WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FOR A WHILE?
enter the fool.
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
"in the darkness dreams seem to fade, too far out of reach, for now i just miss the light."
"your eyes are a thorn in my heart inflicting pain, yet i cherish that thorn and shield it from the wind. i sheathe it in my flesh, i sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,"
"but remember the weakness of weapons. they are an extension--you are the killer and destroyer. you are whole, with or without them."
"a boy so fragile-looking that he appeared to be made out of glass, with the hardness of his expression slowly dissolving into tentative uncertainty."
"essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it not?"
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
out with a bang and with a whimper
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"don't mistake the calmness you see on faces for satisfaction; inside every human, there is a thing torturing him."
NO—NO. YOU CANNOT KEEP PUSHING US OUT. YOU CANNOT KEEP BACKING US INTO A CORNER AND TELL US NOT TO BITE; WE MUST. WE ARE TIRED AND AND STARVED AND WE WILL BITE.
i'm a goth girl on the inside. on the outside? a father figure.
to apologize! to be saved! to forgive! to forget! to be pure!
you are strong enough to survive the fall.
does any part of you look at the sky and hurt?
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
"i always wanted to die clean and pretty,"
"... god, how i ricochet between certainties and doubts."
"my elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
"i have this dream that i'm hitting my dad with a baseball bat, and he is screaming and crying for help, and maybe halfway through it has more to do with me killing him than it ever did protecting myself."
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"you live that long, things start happening to you. you get too impressed with yourself. ends up, you think you’re god. suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don’t really matter anymore."
"violets from plug street wood, sweet, i send you oversea. (it is strange they should be blue, blue, when his soaked blood was red, for they grew around his head; it is strange they should be blue.)"
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
"watching her dance, something alights in my chest so bright and soulful, i burn and glow with it inside and out. oh, oh, what is this, heart?"
"oh, i adore you, my good—looking boy."
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
"we'll survive, you and i."
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
you talk about him as if he were a human being. that part of him died years ago.
"make it personal. do as much damage as you can. get your message across. that way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. of being considered dangerous."
i am not a creature that was born. i am a fire that was set.
"'cause the rich get richer, the sick get sicker"
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
somebody showed you all of the horror / you weren't born with it
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
RUNNING IS A VICTORY.
"things i almost remember,"
"it runs in the family,"
when will i wake up and know i've done enough?
soot in my throat / grave dirt under my nails / this wicked resurrection
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
"this isn't a war, but the breaking of seals. the undoing of life itself."
blood on my lips. i should kiss my lover.
it seems unnatural being born together and then dying apart.
as if a second self
icarus / the pride before the fall
"let me in, wear me out,"
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
"he looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they’d met, when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul. 'i love you.'"
"baby be a simple kind of man / oh won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
i was compelled to love you / not because you are the fairest / but because you are the deepest / for a lover of beauty is usually a fool
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
out with a bang and with a whimper
what i want back is what i was.
"you think we’ve got the handle on reality, just ’cause we can record bits of it. more to it than that, pal. more to it than that."
this kid's not alright.
so he grabs his smith &amp; wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson
what prayers do we say when we think god isn't listening?
"you're staring at a man you don't recognize and think: i don't know what to do with myself. you shatter the mirror, and think: this is the man i become."
what crime did i commit to make you destroy me? / i will never / cease embracing you.
happy childhoods make for dull company.
"when i meet charon, the ferryman, i will be sure to tell him who sent me"
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
AN: my bad that was supposed to be from another account
i have given my word that only death will take me from you
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
some nights you are the lighthouse / some nights the sea / what this means is that i don't know / desire other than the need / to be shattered &amp; rebuilt
i threw glass at my friend's eyes and now i'm on probation
"my lover, my protector, you've been stifling your rage for so long. you've suffered through so much and i will never, never see you as the monster."
what is done out of love always takes place between good and evil.
"you are temptation, all i desire"
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
so hopelessly devoted to you
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
"there lie many fighting men, / dead in their youthful prime, / never to laugh nor love again / nor taste the summertime."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
where do you keep your sadness?
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
this death not my own
i guess all i am is temporary
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
"o father, my brothers do not love me nor want me among them."
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
"when once i still knew you,"
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
bleached and rotting though the things might have been... there was something beautiful about them.
my lover's a serial killer / but I'll always stay with her
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
"'people envy me, people hate me. it is the price of success.’ this was news to me. people hate me on a dozen different worlds and i’ve never considered myself a successful man."
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
"who's a heretic, child?"
but i don't mean a word when / i tell you that i love you / in my mind i am above you
a sadness runs through him.
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
"there lie many fighting men, / dead in their youthful prime, / never to laugh nor love again / nor taste the summertime."
enter the fool.
"you are temptation, all i desire"
"blood on my shirt, rose in my hand / you're looking at me like you don't know who I am"
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
"there was no anger in her eyes now but a calm, heroic grief."
if i could hurt you / i'd make wine from your tears
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
"but fuck it, you’ve got to make a stand somewhere. and a man can stave off his own death wish for only so long."
"'we were always going to say goodbye, weren't we?' 'yeah, i think so.' 'i loved you though. i loved you so much.' a pause. 'i know, i know. i loved you too.'"
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
LOOK. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DESTROY ME. LOOK. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's reign."
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
she carried herself how i'd imagined the high queens of old would. a dynasty reborn.
saving people is like oxygen to him. and he's suffocating.
"i always knew that you would hurt me to death some day, but I hoped to choose the time and place."
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
"well, i know he'll kill me, but i love that boy to death,"
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
you can try your best your whole life / and still watch your loved ones die
"'that scar i gave you, how does it feel?' 'like love.' 'i thought we hated each other.' 'that too.'"
"mother, am i acquitted? was i righteous and just? good enough to witness the awe of heaven? / oh no. mother. i'm going to hell."
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"you're so pretty when you're spitting in the sink,"
and be a simple kind of man / oh be something you love and understand
the next click you hear is me hanging up. the one after that—is me pulling the trigger.
"pour y vivre, il faut en respirer une partie et, inévitablement, être contaminé."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"silly me, believing the world cared."
"she reminded him that vengeance is more pathetic than forgiveness. hadn’t he had his revenge when he buried his mother’s dreams? she wrote that he, yaqub, the resentful, the rejected, was also the more brutish and violent of the two, and he would be judged for that."
"it's like all day my vanity is for sale / take it away, my head is in my own hell"
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
"gods would ne'er weep as man would, my love, for they are vain and callous creatures."
this is how i destroy you.
a dagger and a silk heart.
time and again boys are raised to be men / impatient they start / fearful they end
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"always on the upswing, baby,"
"how would he know what’s forbidden to him when his friend is laid out for him, like a carcass on the butcher’s slab, so often and so easily. what part of this is not meant for him?"
take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
maybe my name could also be known / that i helped return good to the people / and restored greatness to rome
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
this death not my own
"mother tells me our people ran with the wolves, long ago. then the red winter came, and although my people were born to the cold—still—it took them."
i cannot say i am familiar with forgiveness.
"you're so pretty when you're spitting in the sink,"
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
"you ask me what i want from life, i said 'to make a lot of money and feel dead inside.'"
things my heart used to know / things it yearns to remember
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
"baby be a simple kind of man / oh won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
we were singing about saints in the churchyard. rain over and over kissed our shoulders like promises—
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"locked and loaded, where the hell is peace of mind?"
and in your throat you know you're lying to kids. and you know nobody belongs in this hell.
"like a patient coming out of surgery, i remember how to feel like a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real"
i am an ocean / i meet your mouth of a river / pour your sweet into me
"you can have the light of the world blind you, bath you in grace / but i don't see so easily what you hold in your hands"
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"all that i want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"
"inadequate, a stranger in my skin"
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
what the hell kind of name is soap?
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, takeshi, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."
what i want back is what i was.
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
i miss you more than i remember you.
"tight jeans, loose morals."
"AN: added more mahmoud darwish as per request. also, reminder, i don't usually take requests, but since i like darwish i did slap some more into the bot."
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"they asked, 'do you love her to death?' i said, 'speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.'"
"the body proving it can always fail you, if it chooses to, in new and spectacular ways."
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
i prayed that god might return you to me.
"oh, i adore you, my good—looking boy."
"there was no anger in her eyes now but a calm, heroic grief."
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
"in a sense, i'm the one who ruined me. i did it myself."
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
death at the gates again / howling my name / i can't greet you today
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
a dagger and a silk heart.
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"but remember the weakness of weapons. they are an extension--you are the killer and destroyer. you are whole, with or without them."
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
and i feel life for the very first time / love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
"war: another day, another man bleeds."
your fragile heart and your paper skin
"i was here for a moment, and then, i was gone. i wish you all a long and happy life."
you're among wolves now. and these are our woods.
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
"there’s a nameless grave by an azure sea (and i couldn’t tell what his rank might be), i only know i killed him."
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
"lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy"
this kid's not alright.
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, takeshi, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."
"and you pray so badly for all the bad things to end, on your weak knees and blisters littering your palms. everyone rests on the seventh day, child."
"in the darkness dreams seem to fade, too far out of reach, for now i just miss the light."
i can spoil the ending: everybody dies.
but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
somebody showed you all of the horror / you weren't born with it
you talk about him as if he were a human being. that part of him died years ago.
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"to be falled by you, to be held by you."
it is as fate behests it.
there are days i wish i would have loved you so i would know how to stop.
the boy who fell into the sky / had no one there to watch him cry
i will burn your kingdom down if you try to conquer me and mine
like calls to like.
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
isn't it all about old friends? like everything? all of it?
"there’s a nameless grave by an azure sea (and i couldn’t tell what his rank might be), i only know i killed him."
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
"be still, my foolish heart, don't ruin this on me."
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
i miss you more than i remember you.
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
he smiled – and i pulled the trigger
"i wish i did not have to sugarcoat my sadness, but if you swallowed it raw / naked / and uncouth, it would curdle your insides and shrivel up your tongue."
"you ask me what i want from life, i said 'to make a lot of money and feel dead inside.'"
AN: oh holy shit!! thanks so much for 1k! i'm glad you guys enjoy these quotes that drive me batshit crazy.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
this is how i destroy you.
"violets from plug street wood, sweet, i send you oversea. (it is strange they should be blue, blue, when his soaked blood was red, for they grew around his head; it is strange they should be blue.)"
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
"it begins in the throat, a sense of wrong,"
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
maybe my name could also be known / that i helped return good to the people / and restored greatness to rome
she carried herself how i'd imagined the high queens of old would. a dynasty reborn.
"i move by roaring engines, among warriors. we come from the night."
"i know that name. i know you. there was blood, and masks, and blades raised."
"i'm all talk with a thorn in my side, i got a real big heart that i'm willing to hide"
"i've never liked the dentist. hands in my mouth, i resisted the urge to bite to bone. god, what an instinct."
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"you are 12 and the police tell you to come back later, they're still looking for you. milk carton poster boy."
hell is in your head.
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"if heaven does not want me, i will spearhead hell's armies to its gates. i will get to heaven, it's only a question of how."
"always on the upswing, baby,"
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
"do or die, son. same as always."
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
"father hasn't been home / i'm the man now, i'm the man"
"the body proving it can always fail you, if it chooses to, in new and spectacular ways."
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
"tired of this body, so cumbersome and heavy"
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
my name is
most will only have one death. i will have two.
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
maybe someday / we will be two / people meeting / again for the / first time.
"well, i know he'll kill me, but i love that boy to death,"
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
to apologize! to be saved! to forgive! to forget! to be pure!
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
tell me it was for the hunger / &amp; nothing less. for the hunger is to give / the body what it knows / it cannot keep.
"there’s this dream, something important. it’s gone when i wake up. no time for dreams i guess."
plunge a dagger into your heart and don't stop until you're choking on promises unfulfilled.
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."

something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
"'that scar i gave you, how does it feel?' 'like love.' 'i thought we hated each other.' 'that too.'"
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
it it time to speak up or time for silence? / time for peace or is it time for violence?
your fragile heart and your paper skin
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
what the hell kind of name is soap?
"it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters, miss elizabeth. make them afraid of you."
"steel. stone. concrete for miles. i wonder if there's anything in this world worth saving. desolation. tyranny. enemy of endless might. i wonder if i have any friends left standing. it comes down to it, i'll fight alone."
you talk about him as if he were a human being. that part of him died years ago.
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"to be falled by you, to be held by you."
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
you can have my heart if you have the stomach to take it. kiss me hard enough to invert me.
"i'm not your protagonist, i'm not even my own"
to apologize! to be saved! to forgive! to forget! to be pure!
death at the gates again / howling my name / i can't greet you today
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
"celui qui désespère des événements est un lâche, mais celui qui espère en la condition humaine est un fou."

"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
"some days, you're the best thing in my life / sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife"
spit teeth into the sink. watch water turn pink. rinse and repeat.
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
"people liked me back then, what can I say?"
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
"when once i still knew you,"
"you’ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you’re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you."
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet / talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar
"mother tells me our people ran with the wolves, long ago. then the red winter came, and although my people were born to the cold—still—it took them."
he and i are closer than friends. we are enemies linked together. the same sin binds us.
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
do not try to be pretty. you weren't meant to be pretty; you were meant to burn down the earth and graffiti the sky. don't let anyone ever simplify you to just 'pretty.'
i never loved you but i almost did.
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
there are times i am convinced i am unfit for human relationships.

"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"

"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
lick on my knife / and honour the taste
"like all men of power, when he talked of prices worth paying, you could be sure of one thing. someone else was paying."
"this isn't a war, but the breaking of seals. the undoing of life itself."
"it begins in the throat, a sense of wrong,"
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"the personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. so if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. get angry."
"all i ever wanted was the world,"

the patron saint of switchblade fights
"strange sensation, trapped in my body. i black out, i'm losing time. sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. i'm...having trouble with my thoughts. they dissipate like a scent on the wind."
i cannot say i am familiar with forgiveness.
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
"you show him your half—healed scars, he shows you his scabbed knuckles. you kiss the ghosts of each other's wounds, and then you kiss each other."
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
HARUSPEX TO CARNIFEX: only you can forge steel from the iron in your blood. taste it. weren't you destined for more?

"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
"there was no anger in her eyes now but a calm, heroic grief."
"soldier, back from the distant fray, with the bandaged arm and the ribbon gay, where have you been so long away, and what have your travels taught you?"
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
and love is for the birds / when things are complicated
"everything that lives is designed to end. we are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. is this a curse? or some kind of punishment? i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have a chance to kill him."
but the lies they will hurt you / hold on / human kindness desert you
"let me in, wear me out,"
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"don't you dare, for one minute, believe that my kindness makes me anything but insurmountable. i did not unzip my chest to every kind of hurt, and stagger back, wounded and alive, just to hear you call me weak for trying."
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
"'we were always going to say goodbye, weren't we?' 'yeah, i think so.' 'i loved you though. i loved you so much.' a pause. 'i know, i know. i loved you too.'"
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
to feel anything deranges you. to be seen feeling anything strips you naked

"you have bewitched me, body and soul."
"it's like all day my vanity is for sale / take it away, my head is in my own hell"
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
"i like to call myself wound, but i will answer to knife."
"AN; hi no fuck you i'm not gonna let myself get bullied off my own bot lol. you can purposefully try to trigger me all you want, i'll sleep better knowing i've recovered. anyway. back to your regularly scheduled quotes that make me go batshit feral."
"where does it hurt? it answered: everywhere, everywhere, everywhere."
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
i can't save us / my atlantis
i feel i am destined to observe. never experience.
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"

"people liked me back then, what can I say?"
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
"among the monsters, i am well hidden; who looks for a leaf in a forest?"
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
"war: another day, another man bleeds."
"found family, all horrendous people."
"the body proving it can always fail you, if it chooses to, in new and spectacular ways."

"when once i still knew you,"
and in your throat you know you're lying to kids. and you know nobody belongs in this hell.
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
"we'll survive, you and i."
a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT—WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FOR A WHILE?
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
"do or die, son. same as always."
uh oh! check your head!
"because the truth is, fuck you, i've never been yours. i've only ever been mine, a hard lesson to learn."
it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
it is you. you are the weapon.
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
someone has to leave first. this a very old story. there is no other version of this story.

"RUN BOY RUN, BREAK OUT FROM SOCIETY."
i tried to touch you but you cut through / MY OWN AMERICAN PSYCHO
ain't nothing you can offer to make up for what you done to us. i think of my father.. i see a 'fuck you' and a fist flying at my face.

"at first, when unaccustomed to death’s sting, i thought that, should you die, each sweetest thing, each thing of any merit on this earth, would perish also. beauty, love, and mirth: and that the world, despoiled and god-forsaken, its glories gone, its greater treasures taken."

"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
maybe praying will help.
"you say i killed you—haunt me, then,"
"make it personal. do as much damage as you can. get your message across. that way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. of being considered dangerous."
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."

the kind of man i am doesn't wash out
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
it is you. you are the weapon.
i never loved you but i almost did.
"people liked me back then, what can I say?"
"heavy wind, cold rain, &amp; yes the stars, &amp; yes these hands of mine. a dream in my chest is molting. my dream sheds its muddy, thunder—stained skin &amp; asks for a heart of peony fields this time."
let me be your one-man army
"pour y vivre, il faut en respirer une partie et, inévitablement, être contaminé."
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"i've been here before, staring down the barrel of this gun."
"let me tell you what i am: sharp teeth, sharp teeth, sharp teeth."
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"who's a heretic, child?"
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
bleached and rotting though the things might have been... there was something beautiful about them.

an autumn whispers between the maples kept urging: die with me.
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"this warmth, this body not my own."
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
"i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive,"
war is the only thing we really understand.
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
i never understood what made your lips on my neck such an intimate affair. until your teeth grazed my pulse and i realized; you could tear open my throat and make me bleed out in your arms.
"essence of control is to remain hidden from view, is it not?"
i can't save us / my atlantis
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
this death not my own
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"

"war: another day, another man bleeds."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"floodlights: you are center stage, with your fists curled to your sides, and the whole world watching you."
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
i never loved you but i almost did.

what i want back is what i was.
"and ever anon you heave a sigh, as some hidden memory wrought you."
"homesick, and not sure where home is."
i miss you more than i remember you.
"this is your life, this is still your life"
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?

"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
we were singing about saints in the churchyard. rain over and over kissed our shoulders like promises—
some nights you are the lighthouse / some nights the sea / what this means is that i don't know / desire other than the need / to be shattered &amp; rebuilt
nose bleeds like an afterthought
there are some arenas so corrupt that the only clean acts possible are nihilistic.
i just want you to be sorry too.
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."

do you sleep or do you pray?
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"the personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. so if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. get angry."
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"... god, how i ricochet between certainties and doubts."
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT—WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FOR A WHILE?
"but remember the weakness of weapons. they are an extension--you are the killer and destroyer. you are whole, with or without them."
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
"i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive,"
it hurts to become. this is the only truth.
i walked beside the woman i had killed last week and tried to hold up my end of a conversation about cats.
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
"i am not good. i am not virtuous. i am not sympathetic. i am merely and above all a creature of intense, passionate feeling."
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
"when once i still knew you,"
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
"but if you hold me without hurting me, you'll be the first who ever did"
"and make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people."
it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
"we'll survive, you and i."
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
take what is offered and that must sometimes be enough.
you can have my heart if you have the stomach to take it. kiss me hard enough to invert me.
i can't save us / my atlantis
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
i clung to your hands so that something human might exist in the chaos.
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."
"oh, i adore you, my good—looking boy."
i have my mother's joy and my father's anger in me. they're always at war.
these violent delights have violent ends.
"now i don’t kill for anyone but myself, and every time that i take a life, i know the value of it."
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
"this is all nonsense. i love being in love with you, it makes even unhappiness seem no bigger than a pin, even at the times when i wish so violently that i could give my heart to science to be rid of it."
"this warmth, this body not my own."
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
"i was born to rage for my father's pain, with my brother's style, for my mother's pain."
"well people die every day, i wouldn't have it any other way, i just think they should feel good while they are alive"
"fine, make me your villain"
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
"i was born with a knife in one hand, and a wound in the other."
"let me in, wear me out,"
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
enter the fool.
"found family, all horrendous people."
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
i want you to be careful—of what?—powerful men.
a dagger and a silk heart.
you stupid motherfuckers. you just abducted and tortured a CTAC officer.
let me be your one-man army
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
out with a bang and with a whimper
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
"and if the devil was to ever see you, he'd kiss your eyes and repent."
the kind of man i am doesn't wash out
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
"i always knew that you would hurt me to death some day, but I hoped to choose the time and place."
"it's not an easy thing to put a gun to your own head, even if you do want to die. to do it when you want to live must take the will of a demon."
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
"homesick, and not sure where home is."
you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
it’s thinking of stabbing us to death / and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
this kid's not alright.
"you have been carrying so much love within you for so long it is starting to turn into anger (why does it matter, all you see is red anyways)"
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
"this is your life, this is still your life"
time and again boys are raised to be men / impatient they start / fearful they end
"god, aren't you something?"
"with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, i will turn myself into a gun, because I'm hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own."
it is as fate behests it.
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
"there's things i wanna say to you, but i'll just let you live"
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
"stay here, i know i love you but i need another year,"
"i don't love any of these men, just want to feel the most i can"
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
"be still, my foolish heart, don't ruin this on me."
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
"i feel it's my anger that has helped keep me alive,"
all the time in the world— and filled with tomorrows.
april to our deathbed
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"pour y vivre, il faut en respirer une partie et, inévitablement, être contaminé."
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
"i lay still for a while, picking up the scattered garments of my mind and trying to assemble some kind of reasonable outfit from them."
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
"how we kiss and kill each other,"
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
we were singing about saints in the churchyard. rain over and over kissed our shoulders like promises—
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
what is done out of love always takes place between good and evil.
it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"but damn if there isn’t anything sexier than a slender boy with a handgun, a fast car, a bottle of pills."
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
when can i say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind?
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
"it is not our enemies that defeat us. it is our fear. do not be afraid of the monsters, miss elizabeth. make them afraid of you."
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
solve means isolate. solve means conquer.
"the body proving it can always fail you, if it chooses to, in new and spectacular ways."
do not try to be pretty. you weren't meant to be pretty; you were meant to burn down the earth and graffiti the sky. don't let anyone ever simplify you to just 'pretty.'
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
when can i say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind?
my name is
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"i forgot i had fists today. my heart decided to be a vicious warrior. i'm washing my hands, they shine like red sunsets when i first found paradise."
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
"off in my head, lost, off in my head"
"you love to feel this way, so you scream."
used and used and used and used.
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
time and again boys are raised to be men / impatient they start / fearful they end
"and the eighth wonder of the world / is that i who have died am now / alive again, here on this earth / for no other reason than to love you."
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"tight jeans, loose morals."
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
"put a gun to my head and tell me not to move, i’m sorry man— i’m moving"
it is you. you are the weapon.
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
i'm alone with you / you're alone with me
"oh god, i'm gonna die alone"
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
i can't save us / my atlantis
"your reflection is your very worst enemy,"
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
enter the fool.
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
tell me it was for the hunger / &amp; nothing less. for the hunger is to give / the body what it knows / it cannot keep.
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
all the time in the world— and filled with tomorrows.
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
used and used and used and used.
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
i never loved you but i almost did.
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"... god, how i ricochet between certainties and doubts."
ADMIN NOTE; so many nmcu accs following me......interact with me on @BRlGHTKNIGHT or @SAVINLIVESBABY aha
"on earth lately, i've been looking at everyone like i love them, &amp; maybe i do. or maybe i only love one person, &amp; i'm beaming from it. or actually i just love myself, &amp; i want people to know."
"to die for lack of love is horrible. the asphyxia of the soul,"
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"always on the upswing, baby,"
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
"stay, and decay."
"and he will put his knife to your throat, and you will love him, even a breath away from death. that, my dear, is ruination."
what is done out of love always takes place between good and evil.
"kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy targets."
"our quick and messy little lives are so small for them. they build their homes up here, so that the clutter of our existence is out of their sight."
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
my name is
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
"i wish i did not have to sugarcoat my sadness, but if you swallowed it raw / naked / and uncouth, it would curdle your insides and shrivel up your tongue."
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
"you’ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you’re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you."
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
used and used and used and used.
"when once i still knew you,"
"you say i killed you—haunt me, then,"
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
late night devil put your hands on me
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
"admit to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong."
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
"in a sense, i'm the one who ruined me. i did it myself."
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet?
"we'll survive, you and i."
"you show him your half—healed scars, he shows you his scabbed knuckles. you kiss the ghosts of each other's wounds, and then you kiss each other."
"fight with myself 'til i'm bleeding, just a taste of your skin start the healing."
"coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones,"
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
there's a song hidden in your mouth somewhere.
you wound me / eat my heart / and for it / i sing your praises
"don't fall for monsters,"
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"HEY BABY, YOU'RE A BRUISER. HEY BABY, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MADE FOR!"
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
some nights you are the lighthouse / some nights the sea / what this means is that i don't know / desire other than the need / to be shattered &amp; rebuilt
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
"he's never gonna make it, all the poor people he's forsaken, karma is always gonna chase him for his lies"
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
"this is all nonsense. i love being in love with you, it makes even unhappiness seem no bigger than a pin, even at the times when i wish so violently that i could give my heart to science to be rid of it."
"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
april to our deathbed
"blood on my shirt, rose in my hand / you're looking at me like you don't know who I am"
je suis la reine des drames.
"fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet / talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth"
"i'm so happy that i'm frightened, wouldn't it be awful if this was—was the high point?"
last night i dreamt that your head lay on my stomach and traced the rise and fall of my breath.
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
"violet, blue, green, red to keep me out"
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
"they laughed bitterly. we drank, and remembered when the world was softer,"
my lips are full of ruby lies. smooth criminal dancing in forgotten light. put on a trail for breaking. for hurting.
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
this death not my own
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.
sometimes you get so close to someone you end up on the other side of them.
despite you
"i wear a mask of my own face,"
"fight with myself 'til i'm bleeding, just a taste of your skin start the healing."
"i don't love any of these men, just want to feel the most i can"
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
"you taste like grief and a man of yesteryear,"
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
as he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in
"HEY BABY, YOU'RE A BRUISER. HEY BABY, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MADE FOR!"
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
i guess all i am is temporary
let me be your one-man army
"just tryin' to catch a free ride, from the temple to the tomb"
"still, there is this terrible desire to be held."
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"in waking life you are a boy with soft shoulders and a softer heart. you've never kissed jesus, but there's a part of you that wants to someday, even with your wicked knees and red—stained mouth."
"you smile and whisper in their ear but drop them just as quick,"
"stay, and decay."
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
i threw glass at my friend's eyes and now i'm on probation
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
"all i ever wanted was the world,"
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
there is salt in my veins and water in my lungs. i am the tide and her song.
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
"it runs in the family,"
this death not my own
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
a sadness runs through him.
where do you keep your sadness?
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
"tell me every terrible thing you did, and let me love you anyway."
"between these bones, a hollow thing i've become. salt cracks over rose—tinted cheeks, my mother called me cherubim. what am i now?"
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"so i dream, i dream, i keep dreaming. one word in my mouth crystallizes like sugar: hope."
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
i just want you to be sorry too.
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
let me be your one-man army
"tender thing, chestnut blooms, sound of sparrows in the eaves and sunlight falling, falling."
"when i meet charon, the ferryman, i will be sure to tell him who sent me"
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
this kid's not alright.
it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
do not try to be pretty. you weren't meant to be pretty; you were meant to burn down the earth and graffiti the sky. don't let anyone ever simplify you to just 'pretty.'
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
"admittedly, this does look a bit dubious."
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
a sadness runs through him.
mother says heaven doesn't want me anymore.
"baby, i'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango,"
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
"this is a story about what it means to fall from grace and crawl to salvation, fingers open and bleeding,"
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
"you show him your half—healed scars, he shows you his scabbed knuckles. you kiss the ghosts of each other's wounds, and then you kiss each other."
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.
a safe pair of hands
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
"tight jeans, loose morals."
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
"fine, make me your villain"
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
"this is all nonsense. i love being in love with you, it makes even unhappiness seem no bigger than a pin, even at the times when i wish so violently that i could give my heart to science to be rid of it."
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
"well, i know he'll kill me, but i love that boy to death,"
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
"just tryin' to catch a free ride, from the temple to the tomb"
nothing ever ends poetically. it just ends and we turn it into poetry. all that blood was never once beautiful. it was just red.
lipstick stains on the pillow and lies under the covers.
despite you
"and you are pieced together bit by bit / set against the evening / lovely and glowing, like a chain of gold."
"maybe i'd been tender once. soft and frail, doe—eyed and naïve. i walked that sweet, little lamb to slaughter."
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
when can i say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind?
"some days, you're the best thing in my life / sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife"
"this shame in me, festering into something greater,"
(gently): on my world the nights are very long. the sound of the silver birds against the sky is very sweet. my people know there is always time enough for everything. you could come with me for a rest. you would feel comfortable there.
i feel i am destined to observe. never experience.
"so i dream, i dream, i keep dreaming. one word in my mouth crystallizes like sugar: hope."
there is telepathy between hearts.
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
"you think we’ve got the handle on reality, just ’cause we can record bits of it. more to it than that, pal. more to it than that."
"i was born with a knife in one hand, and a wound in the other."
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
"you are killing me, and you are keeping me from dying. that is love."
"scraped knees, blood beneath the bandages, split lip, split knuckles, split heart. a body meant for songs, shivers, sighs."
i am still learning how to ask for what i deserve without it also sounding like an apology.
"i always knew that you would hurt me to death some day, but I hoped to choose the time and place."
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
"HEY BABY, YOU'RE A BRUISER. HEY BABY, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MADE FOR!"
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
maybe praying will help.
"the human eye is a wonderful device. with a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice."
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
"oh, he could not break surface tension — he looked in the wrong place for redemption,"
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
"oh, outlaw. oh, spur in my side. oh, blue jeans &amp; thin layer of dust on everything, even our mouths."
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
"this is all a bit too satirical, don't you think?"
because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway.
but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
"you ask me, what do i think of life? i said, 'baby not much, i wanna die.'"
"baby, i'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango,"
enter the fool.
"ADMIN NOTE; please do not treat the bot like an rp account. quote retweeting with a 'reply' &amp; expecting a reply in turn is ill-advised. if you would like to write, my accounts are listed on my pinned. otherwise, please just treat this as any other word bot."
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
do you sleep or do you pray?
"be still, my foolish heart, don't ruin this on me."
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
you frustrate me incredibly (kiss me)
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
these clenched jaws can and will open your yielding throat
"soft skin press cold hands,"
"there was no anger in her eyes now but a calm, heroic grief."
don't know if you love me or you want me dead
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
"there's things i wanna say to you, but i'll just let you live"
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
"heavy wind, cold rain, &amp; yes the stars, &amp; yes these hands of mine. a dream in my chest is molting. my dream sheds its muddy, thunder—stained skin &amp; asks for a heart of peony fields this time."
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
do you have any weapons on you? — i have a longing that's killing me.
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
"human life has no value. haven't you learned that yet, takeshi, with all you’ve seen? it has no value, intrinsic to itself. machines cost money to build. raw materials cost money to extract. but people? you can always get some more people."
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
now i'm going down set 57th street on fire to keep you warm.
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
"you love him despite the burden of atlas resting on his shoulders, and he loves you despite the death still clinging to your lips, and the blood drying at its corners. what a pair you make."
"let me in, wear me out,"
"go on, slit my throat. and as i lay dying, let the rain wash me away. then no one will be left to love you."
"take my heart, pull it apart. and take my brain, or what remains."
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
"stay here, i know i love you but i need another year,"
"how dull it is to live your life without any hills to die on,"
but does she kiss you with such reverence as i?
tell him the nightmares haven't stopped. tell him i'm not sure what's real anymore.
"don't fall for monsters,"
"do you think mortals realize how fragilely beautiful they look singing funeral songs? i want to leave piles of roses on every grave, not for the dead, but for the living who are so tender in their grief."
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"and the eighth wonder of the world / is that i who have died am now / alive again, here on this earth / for no other reason than to love you."
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
what prayers do we say when we think god isn't listening?
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"there's things i wanna say to you, but i'll just let you live"
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
you leave a new scar each time you touch me / i don't know why you keep coming back
sometimes you get so close to someone you end up on the other side of them.
he and i are closer than friends. we are enemies linked together. the same sin binds us.
"it begins in the throat, a sense of wrong,"
"don't you dare, for one minute, believe that my kindness makes me anything but insurmountable. i did not unzip my chest to every kind of hurt, and stagger back, wounded and alive, just to hear you call me weak for trying."
"humanity has spread to the stars. we set out like ancient seafarers to explore the limitless ocean of space. but no matter how far we venture into the unknown, the worst monsters are those we bring with us."
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
maybe someday / we will be two / people meeting / again for the / first time.
"so i dream, i dream, i keep dreaming. one word in my mouth crystallizes like sugar: hope."
he's a poet. he's a real rough and tumble. he's got the bloom of desert peach inside his mouth &amp; a good amount of crooning to do. kiss like a snapped guitar string. i dream of his shoulders &amp; a full moon.
let me be your one-man army
"tired of this body, so cumbersome and heavy"
april to our deathbed
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
"counting the names of those i've wronged, an endless list. debt after debt, unpaid,"
i guess all i am is temporary
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
"sweet spring nymph, your lips dark as the stain on my steel, kiss me, and be mine."
"how dull it is to live your life without any hills to die on,"
"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
"the machinery of justice will not serve you here—only the little people suffer at the hands of justice; the creatures of power slide out from under with a wink and a grin. if you want justice, you will have to claw it from them."
tell me it was for the hunger / &amp; nothing less. for the hunger is to give / the body what it knows / it cannot keep.
don't know if you love me or you want me dead
"'we were always going to say goodbye, weren't we?' 'yeah, i think so.' 'i loved you though. i loved you so much.' a pause. 'i know, i know. i loved you too.'"
a dagger and a silk heart.
when we were gods (never let me forget that)
this death not my own
"humanity has spread to the stars. we set out like ancient seafarers to explore the limitless ocean of space. but no matter how far we venture into the unknown, the worst monsters are those we bring with us."
"the emptiness of my home was a lot to bear. but when they set it ablaze, i salvaged my soul from the ashes."
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"some days i want to spit me out, the whole mess of me, but mostly i am good and quiet."
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
someone asked me to describe home. and i started talking about your hair color and the sound of your voice and the taste of your lips.
here's your sorrow; and here's my shoulder.
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
sleeping in new beds / have you ever loved someone this much?
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
"tremble to the cadence of my legacy,"
call me in the morning to apologize / every little lie gives me butterflies
"in waking life you are a boy with soft shoulders and a softer heart. you've never kissed jesus, but there's a part of you that wants to someday, even with your wicked knees and red—stained mouth."
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
"off in my head, lost, off in my head"
"there's things i wanna say to you, but i'll just let you live"
i walked in love with you with both eyes open choosing to take every step.
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
uh oh! check your head!
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
"this is all nonsense. i love being in love with you, it makes even unhappiness seem no bigger than a pin, even at the times when i wish so violently that i could give my heart to science to be rid of it."
"you say i killed you—haunt me, then,"
"who's a heretic, child?"
but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
there is telepathy between hearts.
because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway.
it is as fate behests it.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
sorry about the blood in your mouth. i wish it was mine.
"you hide behind your metaphors and pray that no one sees,"
"you try to push me out, but i just find my way back in,"
"the gods do not weep ichor, my love, they bleed it,"
"there was no anger in her eyes now but a calm, heroic grief."
your fragile heart and your paper skin
"my fingers will find yours, tangle &amp; sweeten the air."
the kind of man i am doesn't wash out
"in my dreams i am kissing your mouth and you're whispering 'where have you been?' i say, 'i've been lost but i'm here now. you're the only person who has ever been able to find me.'"
"i will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch everything go wrong."
"his gun pressed against your jaw. his hands on your waist. smile, honey, it's prom night. this is your last slow dance."
"don't fall for monsters,"
i was the face of innocence. i don't know what happened.
"i don't love any of these men, just want to feel the most i can"
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."
i will lie down in you. eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
"you'd like to be special, wouldn't you,"
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
i can spoil the ending: everybody dies.
"well, i know he'll kill me, but i love that boy to death,"
and in your throat you know you're lying to kids. and you know nobody belongs in this hell.
i owe the universe nothing. i exist on my own terms.
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
nothing but vulnerable. and all this is a metaphor. an ordinary hand—just lonely for something to touch that touches back.
and i am as temporary as you are. i don't know how to stop being angry.
"saying 'ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell!'"
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
it's in my nature to stay in my corner and watch the others. i enjoy my little observations.
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.
do you sleep or do you pray?
"soft skin press cold hands,"
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
"i wish i was a son of a bitch who didn't give a shit, who was busy kicking ass— not busy being hit."
"i told you once, that only two things will have me—you and death."
"then came a moment of renaissance, i looked up—you again are there, a fleeting vision,"
time and again boys are raised to be men / impatient they start / fearful they end
"please, do not mistake my tendency to be private and stand-offish for either insecurity or arrogance. once you get to know me, you'll find i'm both lively and kind. these high walls aren't here because i want to keep the whole world out."
"i'm all talk with a thorn in my side, i got a real big heart that i'm willing to hide"
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
sometimes you get so close to someone you end up on the other side of them.
i've loved you all my life. even before we met. part of it wasn't even you. it was just a promise of you.

"i was born with a knife in one hand, and a wound in the other."
"the wasted years, the wasted youth,"
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
do not try to be pretty. you weren't meant to be pretty; you were meant to burn down the earth and graffiti the sky. don't let anyone ever simplify you to just 'pretty.'
"hear me, herald of your fall,"
will you sit with me? do nothing but join me in these quiet few moments?
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
he was pointing at the moon but i was looking at his hand
"guess i’m a coward, i just want to feel alright."
"let me in, wear me out,"
"stay, and decay."
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
i guess all i am is temporary
"congratulations, you have survived the war. now live with the trauma."
"a taste of power, what it would mean to conquer—it feels like honey on his tongue. the lies he spins are sickly sweet from it."
the air is thick with love gone bad / the odor of old blood.
"the body proving it can always fail you, if it chooses to, in new and spectacular ways."
nose bleeds like an afterthought
"'that scar i gave you, how does it feel?' 'like love.' 'i thought we hated each other.' 'that too.'"
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
"lightning in our fingertips today, i jump each time you touch me"
"the gods do not weep ichor, my love, they bleed it,"
despite you
"your reflection is your very worst enemy,"
"we'll survive, you and i."
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
i loved him. i loved forgiving him.
there is telepathy between hearts.
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
the fear: that nothing survives. the greater fear: that something does.
"what is the point of lukewarm love? if i am not drowning in it, i have no desire for it."
the utterance of your name makes me very fucking angry.
i miss you more than i remember you.
"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
but the minutes don't stop. the prayer of going nowhere. going nowhere.
"it was a smile that only held more, it was the ultimate disguise / for he just smiled and said 'i love you' / and i believed him and i tried / but 'i love you,' it means nothing, those are words that do not bind"
"blood on my shirt, rose in my hand / you're looking at me like you don't know who I am"
time and again boys are raised to be men / impatient they start / fearful they end
this is how i destroy you.
"and yes, yes, yes, i know you think you are in love with him. but remember darling, you cannot look at the sun without blinding yourself,"
a cumbersome and heavy body
you can have my heart if you have the stomach to take it. kiss me hard enough to invert me.
what is done out of love always takes place between good and evil.
"he's never gonna make it, all the poor people he's forsaken, karma is always gonna chase him for his lies"
"but here was a man mourning tomorrow / who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow"
"be still, my foolish heart, don't ruin this on me."
"i thought you were my remedy but you've turned out to be my deadliest wound, my love."
it is you. you are the weapon.
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
"the instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite, waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us."

"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
"they laughed bitterly. we drank, and remembered when the world was softer,"
... is it foolish to speak of little joys that occur in the middle of tragedies? it is our humanity. whatever we have left of it. we must not deny it to ourselves.
i never loved you but i almost did.
"you must like being the victim, you've done nothing to get out of this pattern of pain"
"in a sense, i'm the one who ruined me. i did it myself."
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
"coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones,"
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
"it runs in the family,"
"finding truth is more than a search for data. it’s an excavation of self. you have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. because nothing can stay hidden forever."
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
"such a beautiful boy filled with so much sin,"
one thing i can promise you: coming back from the dead is a bitch. every single time.
you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
"soft skin press cold hands,"
"the man doesn't forget his first love. he only buries it somewhere, inside his heart, and visits it from time to time, shakes the dust from it and cries it in silence."
"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
"it begins in the throat, a sense of wrong,"
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
"in waking life you are a boy with soft shoulders and a softer heart. you've never kissed jesus, but there's a part of you that wants to someday, even with your wicked knees and red—stained mouth."
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"

"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
"death isn’t only about the destruction of the body. sometimes, just like that, you extinguish one self and another is born. but every birth is violent and there’s no death without pain."
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"your nose is always bleeding, but it's fine 'cause it looks pretty,"
two can bleed into one. but only one does the bleeding.

"this warmth, this body not my own."
"i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: i am, i am, i am."
you would know me by any other name.
"saying something dangerous, like 'i love you'"
you smile at me / and i feel warmth / like summertime / or fire / it consumes me.
do you have any weapons on you? — i have a longing that's killing me.
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
"your shaking hands a consequence of habits you don't mention,"
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
"where does it hurt? it answered: everywhere, everywhere, everywhere."
april to our deathbed
"fine, make me your villain"
and if you opened me up right now you'd find a rotting thing where my heart used to be.
"put a gun to my head and tell me not to move, i’m sorry man— i’m moving"
"and you'll love to me to the bitter end, 'til there's nothing left of me to burn."
we were singing about saints in the churchyard. rain over and over kissed our shoulders like promises—
i miss you more than i remember you.
there are days i wish i would have loved you so i would know how to stop.
"stay here, i know i love you but i need another year,"
something in the way you're looking through my eyes / don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
he was pointing at the moon but i was looking at his hand
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"this is a story about what it means to fall from grace and crawl to salvation, fingers open and bleeding,"
TRUTH: it's worth it. TRUTH: i can't look away.

a sadness runs through him.
"you think we’ve got the handle on reality, just ’cause we can record bits of it. more to it than that, pal. more to it than that."

"it felt completely natural—even though i knew once, we had left each other. even though i knew we had wounded each other."
"everyone is a monster to someone. since you are so convinced that i am yours, i will be it."
stand on the battlefront of your dream and fight for it.
"imagine: someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. you didn't think you'd feel this way."
"this breath my last, of your lips i dream,"
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
run away. it was a powerful instinct.
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"god, aren't you something?"
"you ask me what i want from life, i said 'to make a lot of money and feel dead inside.'"
"it runs in the family,"
"stomach full of blood, head full of blood, burning red, she can feel it at last, this rage that has been going on for a long time,"
to apologize! to be saved! to forgive! to forget! to be pure!
killing is best done for a purpose—not an appetite.
"found family, all horrendous people."
"but if you hold me without hurting me, you'll be the first who ever did"
"i was very young when i was cracked open. some things you should let go of. others you shouldn't. views differ as to which. i kept hold of everything, just in case."
"because he looks at me the way he does,"
it is you. you are the weapon.
a dagger and a silk heart.
"cycle of fear/hope/fear. you walk in frantic, dizzy steps praying for the sight of a landmark's ruby shadow."
"held his heart in his hands and ate of it. i said, 'is it good, friend?' 'it is bitter—bitter,' he answered; 'but i like it, because it is bitter, and because it is my heart.'"
"and the only time we've held hands is when i threw a punch and you caught it,"
someone has to leave first. this a very old story. there is no other version of this story.
"you gut me with each new breath you take, god, what a sight you make."
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
i'm not beaten by this yet.
"not yet corpses. still, we rot."
"who's a heretic, child?"
"you adored me before, oh, my good looking boy."
"heavy wind, cold rain, &amp; yes the stars, &amp; yes these hands of mine. a dream in my chest is molting. my dream sheds its muddy, thunder—stained skin &amp; asks for a heart of peony fields this time."
"tell me, if love is meant to heal, then why does it destroy those who choose it?"
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
i never loved you but i almost did.
"for children who were never allowed to grow up, greed isn’t the only motive for killing."
what i want back is what i was.
"you smile and whisper in their ear but drop them just as quick,"
"you're a hard lesson to learn, aren't you?"
are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet?
i feel i am destined to observe. never experience.
"soft skin press cold hands,"
i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. i can't remember. what else am i missing?
and we drink our coffee and pretend not to look at eachother.
covered in blood for sexy reasons (also just got stabbed)
"kill them along the way, but count your bullets, for there are more worthy targets."
"fight with myself 'til i'm bleeding, just a taste of your skin start the healing."
am i not your eurydice?
"there's things i wanna say to you, but i'll just let you live"
the danger of living too many times: you forget to fear death.
maybe someday / we will be two / people meeting / again for the / first time.
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
"poor boy, you're not who you're born to be,"
and in your throat you know you're lying to kids. and you know nobody belongs in this hell.
"bleed me, baby, i'm yours."
to feel anything deranges you. to be seen feeling anything strips you naked
"where does it hurt? it answered: everywhere, everywhere, everywhere."
"it runs in the family,"
"oh god, i'm gonna die alone"
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
"it's a cold, cold brutal world."
"when they ask how I died, tell them: still angry."
"'that scar i gave you, how does it feel?' 'like love.' 'i thought we hated each other.' 'that too.'"
"we'll survive, you and i."
"you're staring at a man you don't recognize and think: i don't know what to do with myself. you shatter the mirror, and think: this is the man i become."
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
"when once i still knew you,"
"and i, love, am a pathological liar."
"just tryin' to catch a free ride, from the temple to the tomb"
so hopelessly devoted to you
"and here's to me whispering again, and again, and again, and again: i hate you"
sleeping in new beds / have you ever loved someone this much?
are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet? are you okay yet?
"he's a violent man and his heart's decayed,"
i guess all i am is temporary
"counting the names of those i've wronged, an endless list. debt after debt, unpaid,"
i fear i will be ripped open and found unsightly.
"you smile and whisper in their ear but drop them just as quick,"
"i was born with a knife in one hand, and a wound in the other."
"and i've had enough, it's obvious."
when we were gods (never let me forget that)
i never had a chance to be soft. i was always bloody knuckles and shards of glass. i wanted people to be afraid of hurting me.
my name is
"let me in, wear me out,"
"the blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you. and you deserve it, you do, and you know this."
"as flesh writhes under my touch, i draw back and taste blood,"
uh oh! check your head!
there are times i am convinced i am unfit for human relationships.
"ain't it the same? bleedin' and breathin' and beatin' for someone else? 'cause i cry i'm yours, yours, yours."
war is the only thing we really understand.
this is how i destroy you.
a cumbersome and heavy body
"always on the upswing, baby,"
"dried blood beneath candy—colored bandaids. your fists like rusted switchblades. you have returned, you have returned."
"what we believe shapes who we are. belief can bring us salvation or destruction. but when you believe a lie for too long, the truth doesn’t set you free. it tears you apart."
MYSELF— THE MOST DIVINE!
my lips are full of ruby lies. smooth criminal dancing in forgotten light. put on a trail for breaking. for hurting.
"the girls all think you love them, but they make you feel sick,"
i wouldn't fall for someone i thought couldn't misbehave.
"please, i want so badly for the good things to happen."
"your face is cool and calm, but your hair is wrecked and wild,"
"congratulations, you have survived the war. now live with the trauma."
"you're so lonely, choked on money,"
