Lying on the table dead
Coroner
Completes his task

Examining the wretched stiff
Suicide
The likely cause

Behind closed doors the change
Begins
Then it grows
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver

Coroner returns to notice
Subtle change
How can this be?

Must be his imagination
The man's been dead
For several days

The change continues after hours
Different face
Mutilation of the cadaver
Soon the corpse will change its shape
Who is it?

Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver

The coroner returns and sees
The body has truly changed
The corpse has stolen his face
And now he loses his mind

<i>[Solo: Pat]</i>

<i>[Solo: Jack]</i>

Shocking evolution
Mutation of the cadaver
Hideous conversion
Mutation of the cadaver
Postmortem upheaval
Mutation of the cadaver
Awful transformation
Mutation of the cadaver
Gruesome reconstruction
Mutation of the cadaver
