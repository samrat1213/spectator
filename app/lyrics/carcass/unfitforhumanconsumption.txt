Seductive lymphandetitis
Delectable septic metritis
Tempting glanders jaundice
For human consumption unfit

Paltable melanosis
Aromatic mastitis
Saporous brucellosis
Cry havoc and let slip

Salivating
At the leash straining
The cadaver dogs
Devouring

Appetising
Diseased gastric dining
The cadaver dogs
In cold blood

Indulging in sarcocysts
Epicurean pericarditis
Cariosus tender and lean
After all you are what you eat

Unfit for human consumption
An appetite for bovine destruction
A manifesto for mutilation
Manifests in your own dereliction

The dogs of cruror released
On severed carnage feed
Cadaver dogs rapidly bay and seethe
Canine, ulunating, feverishly inhaling
the scent of human debris

Indulgent lymphandetitis
Aromatic mastitis
Corrosive carcase rotten and obscene
After all you are what you eat
