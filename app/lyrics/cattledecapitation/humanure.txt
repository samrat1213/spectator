The human body, in its systematic nature,
Has 3 primary objectives:

1) Procreate
2) Food Intake
3) The elimination of waste

This is the human equation
One half is feces, the other mammal
The human as shit.

This is what you've become
The end result of human stupidity
Another mesh of flesh with no dignity
A solid waste with dull neuronal activity

2000 years from now
They'll discover our copralite
Learn of disease and parasite
Enough to know what made us tick
Enough to make them sick

Anatomy...
Scatanthropology...
The study of man

Micturate - here's to your health
Defecate - upon the self
Felch - the goddamn sphinct and
Gurgle - it's disgusting contents

Playing king of the hill
On a mountain of manure
On a planet called earth
Mirroring what we're worth

We are nothing but a failure
Evolution took a shit
In my heart, through these eyes
Humankind in its own shit resides.

2000 years from now
They'll examine our copralite
Gain perspective and insight
Enough to know what made us tick and
That we're made of shit
