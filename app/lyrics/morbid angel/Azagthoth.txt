Azagthoth LyricsLocked deep beyond the gate
Lost within the stars
Realm of ancient ones
Malignant ones
Against the light
Power of the blackened sky
Hateful spawn
"We are the chasm depths"
Come forth ancient ones, Tiamat Kutulu
Rise, greed the cursed with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With your infernal grasp
A scorn from the Absu
Kutulu snaps his jaws
Cauldron burns and receives
Crushing the voice of the tyrants
Raise the horns in blasphemy
