This Means War LyricsSavagery - as judgment days arrive
Long we have waited for this time
How many brothers fallen?
How many kept alive as slaves for the wicked few?
'Tis time for reparations
'Tis time to settle scores
This time we give no warning
This means war!
Savagery - 'tis now our spirit overflows
War - our minds are focused; we are one!
Hear now the winds of change
A force to obviate
All the enemies naked now
All the smoke gone and all their mirrors are broken
Lost - empires crumble; destiny
Behold! I crusader no retreat
Years of complacency on the part of the mob
Feeding on lies
So slothed, so full this is it
Restless
And tolerance nearing its peak
Woe to the next ones who push us to far
Our love is now replaced by war
Live cannot be spared, our victory at hand
And by my hand I slay the first
And the last will follow as we watch these wickeds bleed
No rest for the soldiers 'till the purge is done
No salvation until we drench this earth1Embed
