A hot Sunday morning
Dad took little Bruce to amusement park
The boy wasquerulous
He wanted to ride on a merry-go-round
Dad would do anything for his offspring, wouldn't he?
The machine got moving
It gathered momentum
Bruce was already 9 meters over the ground
Dad looked up... and suddenly he got shocked
A gear of the merry-go-round cracked
Father's eyes watched his son's head knocks against the ground
But it's not over
A two and a half ton axle dropped onto the kid
Dad ran up so fast that his son's brain smeared his festive jacket
The boy's intestines decorated the amusement park glamourEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
