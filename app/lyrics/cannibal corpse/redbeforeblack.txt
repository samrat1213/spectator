Knives brought the blood
That's on the ground
Blood will paint the sky
Into darkness

Overtorture lacerated sacrificial decimation
Overviolent mutilation brutally eviscerated
Dead beyond dead

Red before black
Made to suffer through the torture
Red then black into the unknown
With no coming back
Red before black
Disemboweling frantically
Pure ecstasy pure misery
Blood flows from the attack

Cut for the blood
Dried on the ground
Blood painted the sky
Through the darkness

Overviolent mutilation brutally eviscerated
Overkilling eradicated monumental crimson staining
Dead beyond dead

Red before black
Made to suffer through the torture
Red then black into the unknown
With no coming back
Red before black
Disemboweling frantically
Pure ecstasy pure misery
Blood flows from the attack

Bleed before death bleed during death bleed after death
Perpetual bloodshed onslaught through hatred

Overtorture lacerated sacrificial decimation
Overviolent mutilation brutally eviscerated
Dead beyond dead

Red before black
Made to suffer through the torture
Red then black into the unknown
With no coming back
Red before black
Disemboweling frantically
Pure ecstasy pure misery
Blood flows from the attack
