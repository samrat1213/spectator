These are the lights in heaven burning out, you see
Your walk with your invisible man ran short
When you realized that there's nobody there

You looked into the mirror, and saw no one there 
They're burning out, you see.

And you realized that the thought of this was schizophrenic
When you talk to your self at night
So you like your book of stories?
That's all they are
Nothing more then fairy tales
Just lies

So you closed the book
That you never read
Just pretended to
In front of all your friends

You can be my cold sensation 

That's all they are!

These are the lights in heaven burning out, you see
When you realized that there's nobody there

YOUR BOOK IS FULL OF LIES!
