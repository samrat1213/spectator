Inflammable, dangerous, impossible aliment
It must be suffering
Deadly pain
Life will not come back

Peritonitis, abscesses, divited tissue, the stomach breaks
Bile is gushing from the flesh
Day by day mind is dying

Infectious, cruel stench by virus of pancreas
Bile is gushing from the flesh
Day by day mind is dying

Peritonitis causes attack of internal nervous cells
Pain is meddling with quiet life, it's time to die and scream
Peritonitis causes attack of internal nervous cells
Pain is meddling with quiet life, it's time to die and scream

He says his prayers
He doesn't want to die
But soon he will be gone
And soon he will dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
