Crimes of passion
Ruled his mind
The anger inside
Compassion he will never find

The pain and pleasure
Of the blade
And he loved
The screams she made

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Because the anger
Burned within

Unfaithful
He saw it in her eyes
They wouldn't hide
Betrayal and her wicked lies

Confessions
From a dying man
Listen now
And understand

Shadows
In the night
Pain
That summons fright

He looked
Into her eyes
And tells her
Tonight she dies

But to you
I must confess
That when she died
She was the best
