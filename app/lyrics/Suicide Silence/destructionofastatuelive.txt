As... I look up to you
A cold carved stone, that I look up to for guidance
now you're lost smashed to pieces by this hammer I have
with this I swear you'll crumble, reaping what I have, cold cry
your face, your guidance won't be in vein, last time
your face, not again! Forget your face?
I count this watching crumbling down, from the sky and with this hammer you will crumble!
from the sky, you will crumble,
from the sky, destroy such beauty, count the lies on my own fingertips,
destroy such beauty, death awaits
destroy such beauty! Please forgive me
