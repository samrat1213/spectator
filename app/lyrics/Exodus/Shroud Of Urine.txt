Christ on a cross
Such a symbol of loss
Since what seems like the dawn of time
It's just an engine of grief
Yeah, a bloody belief
One that has no reason or rhyme
You're cruci-fucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock

I believe in nothing
Least of all in the word of shit
So hide in your shroud of urine
Because I can't take the smell of it

God isn't great
Just an icon of hate
Intolerance and despise
Believe in me
And I will set you free
I never heard a bigger pack of lies
It's ludicrous
That any one of us
Would want to be led by the blind
It's all in vain
It'll be your bane
If you're looking for the divine
I believe in nothing
Least of all in the word of shit
So hide in your shroud of urine
Because I can't take the smell of it

Forgive and forget
Such an empty threat
Religion at the end of the blade
The insanity
Of Christianity
Is just a fucking masquerade
You're cruci-fucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock

I believe in nothing
Least of all in the word of shit
So hide in your shroud of urine
Because I can't take the smell of itEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
