I'm two steps away
So why don't you kill me?

Invite me over
It won't take much
When it feels no one else is here

I am helpless to this dream we're in
I am helpless in your nightmare

I'm two steps away
So why don't you kill me?

Now we're in
I won't take long
Now I know no one else is here

I am helpless to this dream we're in
I am helpless in your nightmare

I'm two steps away
So why don't you kill me?
I'm two steps away
So why don't you kill...

Kill me
Don't hide
Urges
Inside

Reflection shows me hate
Reflection shows your death

Invite me over
It won't take much
You know you could stop it
So why don't you kill me?

I'm two steps away

Burning with hate

So why don't you kill me?
