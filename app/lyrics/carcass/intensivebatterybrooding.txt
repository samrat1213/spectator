A blue peafowl soaring
Silent deadly dormant lied
Spreading its plummage
Incendiary armed and primed
Timer ticking

Peafowl rising
Awakes from its slumbering state
Short fuse smouldering
A world of pain to detonate
To devastate

Scalding concussing
Defeathered broiler - foul game
Ornate unstable
Incubating charged despot of disdain

A blue peacock - desolation in its wake
A blue peacock - fragmenting laying waste

You'd better handle with care now
A sleeping mongrel best to lie
Controlled atmosphere killing
A tactical device that's benign
Device ticking

Countdown sequenced
There is no turning back
Time is the true grand leveller
Shattering your crystal habitat

Scalding concussing
Defeathered broiler - foul game
Ornate unstable
Incubating charged despot of disdain

A blue peacock - desolation in its wake
A plump blue peacock - fragmenting laying waste
A blue peacock - desolation in its wake
A blue peacock - about to blow up in your face

Intensive poultry battery brooding
Critical mass approaching cruelly

A numbed ground zero with no shelter
Fold before time the true grand leveller

Deflagration without warning
Over your grave will ride a thousand horses

You reap the whirlwind of what you sowed
I'll laugh as your world implodes

Ha
