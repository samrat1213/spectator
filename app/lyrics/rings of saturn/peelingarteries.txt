Communication disrupted, scramble to the streets now fleeing like cowards
Mortals encased by an unworldly bacterium
Abruptly the heavens divide, and a portal appears
Families abducted, anatomy examined from the core

Strategically peeling all the arteries
Observing the effects deliberately
Strategically peeling all the arteries
Observing the effects deliberately

The instruments used now brandished in blood

Demons of this alien race now rise and conquer
Those who lie above the waste are scattered and ensnared
Bones will now be liquified as saliva dissolves
To quench the thirst that provoked this deadly encounter

A horrific display of carnage
Those who survive, transported to our realm

Communication disrupted, scramble to the streets now fleeing like cowards
Mortals encased by an unworldly bacterium
Abruptly the heavens divide, and a portal appears
Families abducted, anatomy examined from the core
