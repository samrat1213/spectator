I'm so irritated
Being kicked to the curb
Every time you open your mouth
You try to get in the last word

Those who live in glass houses
Should not be throwing stones
It all comes crashing down
You never left well enough alone

[Chorus]
Seasons come and treasons go
The more you hear, the less you know
So undeserved, no purpose served
All you do is fray my last nerve

So many excuses
Always laying the blame
You’re always pointing the finger
Adding fuel to the flame

Another slander, another slur
Another hollow apology
So many verbal abuses
Believe your own mythology
[Chorus]
Seasons come and treasons go
The more you hear, the less you know
So undeserved, no purpose served
All you do is fray my last nerve

[Solo Gary]
[Solo Lee]

I’ll never be your scapegoat
Quote unquote, your underling
Red light, left turn, you never learned
A crash fit for a king

[Chorus]
Seasons come and treasons go
The more you hear, the less you know
So undeserved, no purpose served
All you do is fray my last nerveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
