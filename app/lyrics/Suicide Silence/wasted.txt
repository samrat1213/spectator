You see I'm wasted
I can't quite get up yet

You see I'm wasted
I can't quite get up
Yet

You see my head's off resting in this delusional stare
You see I'm wasted
I can't quite get up yet
You see my head's off resting in this delusional stare

The room kept spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning
And I'm a fucking mess

So I closed my eyes
I shut them so tight
To witness explosions of pure color and beauty

The room kept spinning and spinning
I start to think a little differently at what we are

I watched the color drain from the world, that day 

We're so very insignificant 

With my eyes shut so tight
I'm still seeing all of this beautiful light 

The room kept spinning, and spinning, and spinning, and spinning
And I'm a fucking mess
We're so very insignificant

Embarrassment to molecules
