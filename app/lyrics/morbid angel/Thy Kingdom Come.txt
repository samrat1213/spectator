Thy Kingdom Come Lyrics
Restless minds beneath the ground
Through ghostly winds I hear the sound
Crying forth in ancient tongues
Eternal quest of vengeance
From tombs of scorn cadavers rise
Angered fury in their eyes
Solemn rage, a need to kill
Feasting on holy hordes

Evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
Burning holy images in life they were
Forced to hail
Eternal flames have purified their souls
Born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come

Twisted oath nodebliwith
Preying on those who seek the cross
Let none be pardoned for their crimes
Feeble race will die
Scripture burns in infamy
Tortured souls have been set free
Taunting he who sits on high
Pray thy kingdom come
Evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
Burning holy images in life they were
Forced to hail
Eternal flames have purified their souls
Born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come

Banished from the living
Bodies long decayed
Mass of resurrection
Sepulchers abandoned
Insurgent souls arise
Disseminating evil
Curse of devistation
Implored by hells command
Darkness rips the land
Morbid priests serenity
Sing praise
Thy kingdom is at hand

Twisted oath nodebliwith
Preying on those who seek the cross
Let none be pardoned for their crimes
Feeble race will die
Scripture burns in infamy
Tortured souls have been set free
Taunting he who sits on high
Pray thy kingdom come
Evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
Burning holy images in life they were
Forced to hail
Eternal flames have purified their souls
Born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom comeEmbed
