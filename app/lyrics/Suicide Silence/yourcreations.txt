So wake from ignorance and take up shield

For your creations, for your creations 

Protect your blood

A sick, sad, addiction to the ones who hold such innocence
And to the heart that beats with my blood
I am your shield
For your creations, for your creations 

So pick up and bare your arms
Fathers prepare your shields 

Slaughter the sick

Sick men of malice intent who feed off our young
Your peers to prey, your peers to prey
So crush the convicted predators to prey

So wake from ignorance and take up shield
For your creations, for your creations
Slaughter the sick, your peers to prey

Slaughter them 

And to the one that bleeds with my blood
I am your shield
And to the heart that bleeds with my blood
I am your shield
