"Don’t fucking block, unblock, reblock and then unblock me again and then have the nerve to tweet that people play games with you. Get fucked."
Not knowing where you stand with someone.
Cruel.
Our stubbornness is pathetic.
What an idiot I was.
I don’t trust it as far as I could throw it.
It’s very fishy.
Thanks for making it easier though.
Imagine having no one to be better for.
Ignore it and it’ll go away.
Entirely too fucking many around here.
I detest simps and narcissists.
Only about 50% are specifically about you today.
The trolling account is back.
No words are worse than the worst words.
And twist the blade.
Forever banished.
I dont want to do this.
I knew better.
Keep on doing it.
People who have people don’t get us.
"You go do you, whore,  like you’re relevant."
"Unblock me bitch, I dare you."
Absolved.
It’s all my problem to deal with.
Extinguish me.
I just want to get out of here.
I’m a big girl.
It’s my fault. I’m toxic. I know this.
"I don’t want to know people, know anything."
"I just want every  fucking thing in my life to leave me alone. I want non existence, non feeling."
Don’t force my hand.  Pull the trigger yourself.
You have people. I have none.
"These little twitter mind fucks live in your pretty little head, hon."
Stupid women.
You’re no better than the others who think they’re beyond reproach.
"Fuck you and your blocking, whore."
Just like everything.
"The stubbornness hurts not only yourself, I’ve come to realize."
Hello hello hello how low
Lucky you.
I can’t.
"Inhaling hurts, betrayed by breath"
"I have a date which I’m pinning everything on. Dangerous, I know."
Maladaptive.
It’s ok though.
"I lose more by leaving, but they lose more by staying."
I cannot wait to see the psychiatrist on the 1st of July and come out with a handful of pills. I’ll just show him my twitter streams of consciousness.

Hacker for hire?
Contaminated circles.
This is where I really hide.

Dead girl tweeting.
Don’t believe everything you read.
Irrationally existing.
God almighty I feel drowned.
Waiting for fucking death.
A dagger with my name on it.
Worthless.
Pathetic.
You don’t even deserve pity. You deserve pain.
Blood dreams.
"Every second is a slice deeper, another drop of blood"
Cyanide and sleep.
I wish I wasn’t.
Dig my grave.
"If you hate me, let me know."
Nothing but self destruction here.
"Honestly, just leave."
"Sleepwalk, sleep. Sleepwalk, sleep."
Another 12 hours to suffer before unconsciousness.
The abject misery of waking.
"I mean, I’ll put up with this shit because what else have I got to do."
Better off unconscious.
Midnight’s mourning.
She’s still a nasty wench.
Just reminding myself of all your faults.
I have less than anything. Nothing times a million.
I never wanted the world. But I still got ridiculously less.
The ridiculous cards some people try to play. Fuck off.
"Mute, block, fuck."
Get out of my fucking circle.
Whatever. Might go to sleep and not wake up.
Stop it.

Ruining everything.
Pull the trigger.
Tattered soul.
Invisible charm.
Trust no one.
Surrender.
Between violets and violence.
The pit of the abyss sits in my chest.
The amount of absence defines the importance.
Unplug.
How do I become a bird?
Stay back.
Infected.
Lapping misery.
Brittle thoughts.
I cannot see the light.
I don’t know how to escape.
Everlasting dissatisfaction.
I find myself thinking about it frequently.
Manipulation is as bad as lying.
I feel like blocking everyone so hard.
She’s back. You’ll be happy now.
Imagine staying with a husband who cheated.
Just wait til I sic my Qld police brother on her.
Nothing brings me joy. Simply nothing.
Textbook projection from the narcissistic whore.
"Tweeting threats from a locked account, apart from a few hours a day, is absolutely not hardcore 😆"
No idea why women end up enemies over men.
What the actual fuck.
"These thoughts make me feel so pathetic, which makes me have more of the thoughts so fuck you vicious cycles."
I wish I could say goodbye and mean it.
Where is death wish twitter?
You’ve plenty to play with anyway.
"And trust me, it’ll be less than zero."
I’ll give what I get.
"If I could easily do it, I would."
I need to find a way out.
Just stay the fuck away from me. You’re safer that way.
Everyone let’s you down in the end.
Another one comes out of the woodwork.
Too much nonexistent thinking.
Nothing to no one.
Shared diagnoses are a love language.
Narcissists anonymous
Hypocrites anonymous.
Besties.
Some people deserve to suffer.
Volatility and vileness.
Busy bitches.
Malignancy
Hate.
Are you still here?!!
It’s all fun and games until someone gets their tongue sliced out.
Keep a civil tongue.
In the bad books.
My true beauty will only be shown in death.
Ticking time bomb mind.
Take your own advice whore.
Stay on your leash.
Same tired vitriol.
Behaving 😉
Venomous.
Never enough.
Stop giving.
What a charmer 😂
😆😆😆
"You are not misunderstood, you’re malignant."
We all know the truth.
Shame.
Hopefully in restraints.
The whore is back.
"Haha nope, no lessons learnt"
Craving approval from everyone but me.
Brain death.
I hope you fucking finally learnt something.
I hate everyone but not nearly as much as I hate myself.
Fuck you/off
Actions. Words.
I’d rather be an abyss.
You realise your insignificance when the abyss gets more attention than you.
I feel like an eternal zombie.
I feel like I don’t want to breathe.
I feel over.
Lol
Shady af.
Scraping the bottom of the barrel hey.
Whatever.
Old habits die hard.  And I wish I could too.
Get the fuck away frm me.
Fuck this/you.
Imagine fighting over a boy.  Be better women. Honestly.
Two bitches in a pod.
Amateurish.
😂😂 Narcissists gonna narcissus.
I’m sorry you’re such a pathetic whore.  Truly.
Good for you.
Like you even have followers you need to shut up haha the creepy reply guys you mean?
"Two tough, jilted, jealous whores."
Whatever. I have valium.
People are just putrid and they don’t change and I honestly understand the need for some people to want to hurt others.
Just with an extra bitch tagging along!
"Old dogs, same tired tricks."
Calling a person ugly is a big reflection of someone’s vile soul.
Just fucking leave me to rot.
So much for friends.
A tell me again how I escape.
Disassociating harder.
Murder scene mouth.
We should all just get fucking lost.
Absence makes the heart grow black.
I fucking detest blue.
So sick of hearing the same bullshit.
Get. Lost.
I just want easy.
"If you use ‘fuck’ in every tweet to convey the strength of your words, please learn to English better."
Famous last words.
"As far as I can tell, there is no point."
"Yeah, that’s right. Block and fuck off. For good."
Fucking people seem to think if they ‘own’ their bad their damage just magically disappears. Fucking no.
I don’t want to do this alone anymore.
Fuck off with your jealous blocks.
"Yeah no, thanks"
I am utterly annoyed by the stupidity of people.
"This place is a cesspool of disgustingness. The bullshit of people, with no accountability, is vile."
If I ever get so pathetic as to ‘like’ heirloom tomatoes put a fucking bullet in me.
I’m no match.
People who tweet like they’re influencers or something 🤣
I just want one day to be easy.
"I’m so sick and tired of fighting everything, every day."
I’ve had two ‘good’ things happen to me in two days and I barely care.
It’s all you ever do anyway.
I need a person to talk to.  But I don’t even know where to start.
You make me hate myself.
I don’t know how to escape this.
You pair of fucking lunatics.
It’s easier to deal with your pain than mine.
I’ve become accustomed to your pain.
Why do people keep trying to inflict conversation and positivity on me?!
"All bark, no bite."
Give me a reason.
Just fyi
Iv had some dark thoughts lately. Not necessarily death but self harm.
"Like, why am I even giving you more chances."
Ugh I’m so angry with you right now.
Why? 😢
Ignore your reality.
"Check in with a ‘good morning babe’, a few hearts, a bit of small talk."
And you won’t learn a thing from this fucked up mess. I think you thrive on it actually.
"You do play a damn fine triple/quadruple life, I must admit."
"You’re determined to do what you want, head first, despite ruining those closest to you."
I would give anything to know the truth.
What an idiot you made of me.
To see people just living their life as if nothing happened hurts further.
At least the sweat is hiding my tears.
Heartless.
You have no idea how that flattens me.
Thank you. I see how it’s going to be.
I hope you’re happy.
Just kidding. I’m already dead inside.
It’s a beautiful day to die.
I want to change everything.
I have no flame to burn within.
I have nowhere to go.
Nothing helps. No one helps.
"I’m killing myself, physically and spiritually"
I don’t know how to stop.
I’m ignoring her so hard.
Manic stare.
Hah. As if you’ve changed.
I hate me. And you. And me.
I dont matter anyway.
Good. Fuck off.
Oh cringeworthy 😣
Don’t you get it?
Stay in your own lane.
Maybe he’s just not that into you.
He’s giving you just enough rope to hang yourself.
What a ridiculous circle jerk you participate in.
Same old tired reply bitches.
I’d rather be a basic bitch than a mouthy whore.
I hate you. And me.
It’s a quite awful feeling.
I’m at a point where I can’t see myself ever being ok again.
You’re actually embarrassing.
I remember things which get blatantly shattered by those who said them.
I’m so stuck.
Nothing is working. Nothing.
I’d rather hate.
"She’s cold, give her space. Only sometimes."
I’ll probably never feel ok again.
Whatever
"Haha don’t think you’re interesting because you think you’re weird. You’re just a stupid, attention-seeking divorcee."
Fucking ppl obsessed with followers and following and likes. Dumb.
I will stop.
You’re trash every night 😊
Shut up.
Circle jerks and mean girls.
Ever wished death upon someone?
Play the game.
I hate the people I’m around today.
My job makes me want to die tbh
"If I could, I would."
Mean girls give women an awful name.
It’s funny how drama follows certain people.
"I’d give my life to someone dying, who wants to live. Mine is wasted."
"I hate myself and everyone.  Just take me, please."
"I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place, up a river without a paddle and can’t see a light at the next of the tunnel."
Fantasizing about leaving.
Stupid girl.
"Yep, you made my day. Thanks."
"God almighty, what am I fucking doing?!"
I understand how people can stain or taint another. I feel it at times.
Good lord.  Get a clue.
Can’t abide lying.  Only my lying to myself.
Mouthy tarts.
Tangled up in indigo.
Don’t leave a paper trail. It’ll come back to haunt you.
I would prefer to be 100% not alive right now
"I want to crawl out, destroy everything."
Like an idiot.
And I fucking lap up the sermons.
My trampled soul.
My heart is pulp.
Why am I still conscious ffs
So stupid. So so so stupid letting people near me.
I should know better.
Crying myself to sleep and hoping to stay asleep forfuckingever
"Leave me to decay, back to the earth,"
Reigning over darkness and death.
My heart is an emotional wasteland.
This life is the most painful thing my soul has had to endure.
And my heart ruptured.
A river of poison runs through my veins.
Everything is too close.
Oh to be nothing.
I wish I was air.
I wish I would end.
People let me down.every. Single. One
I just want it to stop. Me to stop.
No one knows how much I think about leaving.
I want to leave. Everywhere.
Disappointment is all they ever lead to me.
I wish I would learn to stop letting people in.
I’m a broken bitch and that’s pretty much the conclusion.
I cannot even deal with the good people today.
I’m so hateful. Starting with myself.
I’m a bit fucking done.
Go play with you pals.
I need to freeze over.
I’m a pretty awful person. After hearing a summary of what I’ve done.
Thanks for the back up.
"“Here I am again, split into pieces. A mortal, rayless thing - dismembered. A failed ship at sailing, across the black black sea of love.”"
I want to be looked after. Or at least away from it.
Ive done everything for myself for 10 years. Ive dealt with too much death and trauma.
How can I get better without support. I cant. I
Years of suppression. I cannot see how I can overcome this. Hopeless. Heartless. Exhausted.
My damage is so deep. Ive only just realised.
"I want another lonely, defective loser to be with."
I just cant escape me. I wouldnt inflict myself on others.
I wrapped myself up in fairytales. They are coming undone.
When will it stop
Talk is bullshit.
This inescapable hell.
I just wish.
No one can help. Not even me.
I am epically alone. People who are not alone cannot understand.
I cant see to type. The blur of tears.
I never will be.
I am not ok.
"God, honestly, flee and die."
How does one stop feeling like they’re going to die? Hypothetically.
Poor girl having a hard time :(
Awww poor @broken_stems
What a mess.
The lost art of decency.
Deep diving for sincerity.
Playing with emotions and ghosts.
Unpretty.
Sleeping with your soul.
Stuck in your mind.
Flames mirrored in your eyes.
Snuff your candle out.
Ive hated you enough today.
Obliterate them.
You and your alts are all diseases.
Genetically predisposed to hate.
Wilderness mindset.
"Roots, bloody roots."
Find a new scratching post.
"Back off, bitches."
Malevolent incantations.
Dark curses inhabit me.
Every night I die and resurrect in the morning.
Vast tomes of beautiful necromancy.
4 or 5 or 6 personas deep.
The worst of the worst hide here.
"Ugly souls, pretty veneers."
This is not a pretty place.
Watch and learn.
Refuckingset
A storm of seething.
A landslide of loathing.
Caught in a flurry of thoughts.
Please continue.
You honestly kill me.
"When you know you’re on a bad path, but continue nonetheless."
My unspoken words sear my throat.
Hating. Hateful. Hated.
I try to cram her back in my mouth.
Empty and nothing.
Burn it all.
Wreck and ruin.
Just myself.
A desire to hurt.
Never enough.
Anger and frustration but also a smidge of sympathy.
I need a mass grave for your multiple dying personas.
Stop screeching about how you’re not hurt anymore.
I hate.
My hate is seething.
"Give me a single flower you picked, so I can put it in a glass half filled with water and remember you."
Raining down with paranoia and doubt.
Loosen your fangs.
Find another branch to cling to.
Just leave please.
Regressions and regrets.
Carving out my imperfections.
I won’t demand. And that’s probably my biggest issue.
Decay back into the earth.
I’m going to enter the woods one day and never return.
Just scream inside your heart.
The stench of your vapid desperation.
Send me you banished goddesses.
Scum.
Provoke me harder.
Strange creatures skulking.
Drawn to water.
Must escape the circles!
Nature is chaos.
Cease and desist.
Misremembered memories.
Eclipsed memories.
Mysteries of the eclipse.
Inevitably empty.
Carve the feelings out of me.
Love is a human weakness.
Give and get.
Find the equilibrium and hang on.
Flowers blooming in blood.
Play the game.
Human men. Hmph.
CGI emotions.
Rain the pain away.
"All bark, no bite."
Ghost stories and lullabies.
"A wreath of pretty, dead roses."
A canopy of petals.
A forest of souls.
Align your cells for battle.
Sequence the genomes.  Kill the virus.
The world is crumbling.
Choke on your prayers.
Save your prayers.
You are Mine.
Lord of You.
"Pray to noose, to flame, to blade."
There is a method to my madness.
Stormy mind.
Kill the envious moon.
Rain hell down from on high.
A huntress among us.
Bruised sky.
Screaming at the wind.  Screaming with the wind.
Dead directions showing the way.
Lunar melodies.
Haunted by life.
Stormy eyes.
I prefer your false gods.
Billowing clouds to replace my mind.
Shroud me with mist.
The nature is very damaged.
Servant of the moon.
The more I see the more I hate.
Gods and monsters.
Ruination is my game.
Archaic and apathetic attitude
My watery coffin. Eternally entombed.
"Ghosts whisper from behind trees, sighing and moaning your name."
"Rocks strewn, the evidence of life flung far and wide."
Weeds sprout between my ruins. Vines crawling over the ancient stone.
These circles are actually circles of hell.
"Graveyards of bones, plundered and picked over."
My ruins spread vast.
Bring all your souls.
Observe my ceremony.
A living myth.
Forever left unread.
Scriptures in a dead language.
"Picking through the debris, collecting souvenirs."
Haunting underworld civilizations.
Or quench mine.
Quench your thirst.
My ghosts are sleeping soundly.
An island inhabited by ghosts.
I am an island.
Reckless abandon.
Recklessly abandoned.
A calm place to lighten your load.
I just want to be a safe harbor.
Have had a brain ache all afternoon 😭
I want someone to play with my hair and caress me gently until I fall asleep.
Lyfe
"If you yell louder, you get what you want."
I want to not care.
I’ve never worried about my bad attitude until now. It’s hurting someone I don’t want to hurt.
"The tiredness, the heaviness."
I have that magical pre-sleep relaxation happening.
"Haunted horizons, Arcadian air"
"Menacing skies, subdued grounds."
I'd like to be missed like a flower misses the rain.
A million tiny stings to mend.
Nefarious thoughts are banned.
Silent wandering of life.
"Groaning trees, sighing flowers."
Plant your feet in the cool earth.  Ground yourself.
"I need to be more. More responsible for myself, body and soul. More able to ask for help. Mire willing to put in the hard work.  Just more."
I want to try and turn myself into a poster girl for good mental health
Wonderful winter weather! ❄️
Dull our souls.
Fling flowers and wish upon wine.
I need to get better at feelings.
I get so embarrassed by my human emotions. Mortified. Why do I feel like this? Is it a control issue? Showing perceived weakness?
It’s a good day to be a cat.
A rush of blood to the head.
A Viking tan.
Lily white.
The pallor of a corpse.
Spattered and congealed.
To be lost to terrestrial consciousness.
Twiddle the heart strings.
Stained with despair and adoring stars.
"Hello fellow ghost, weary with woe, with sorrowing."
In the murk and the mire.
Clutched in my tentacles of sorrow.
Done my crying for the day 💅
Time is irrelevant and extraneous right now. I hate it.
Bury them in a shallow grave.
Murder my emotions.
You like my stuff and I like your stuff.
I like your other account better.
Meow
Remnant words.
Whispers of ancient ruins.
Purring.
I see it all. Omnipresent.
Imagining the impact. Substantial.  Beautiful.
Daydreaming the chaos.
Tweet tweet
Might disintegrate into dust and float around for eternity.
Stuck in my Identity vs. Role Confusion stage.
Fiercely soothing.
"Glass heart, diamond mind."
"Petals flowing, pebbles sinking."
"A bellowing river, a whispering stream."
Onomatopoeia is fun. But I prefer alliteration and the rule of three.
Meowww
My adverserial coexistences.
My religion is peanut butter.
Weaponizing my melancholy.
Burner account.
Climactic repartee
Drown out the buzzing with whirring.
My mind is a worthy opponent.
"Push me away, I’ll want you harder."
"Give me black, and I’ll want white."
Ancient glimmer.
I burn bridges spectacular well.
Observed but not seen. Usually.
An empty vessel. Awsiring.
Waxing and waning through life.
Mitigate my circumstances.
Deletion to completion.
Reflective.
"Circular ripples, clear water mirroring."
Elemental reveries.
Stored thunder.
"Suppress, hold it in, don't give it air, don't give it life."
Be right. Do right. Eat right. Exercise right. Speak right.  Just live right.
Wake. Be. Sleep.
"The journey continues, soundlessly."
This place is a graveyard for psychopaths.
The cut. The depth.
Fuck off.
Your lying ugliness.  Grotesqueness.  Unpretty.
"I will not truck with psychology puns! Well, maybe just the really intelligent ones..."
Flowing clearly. Unencumbered.
Stagnant and dull. Monotonous.
Penning love notes with plumes soaked in blood.
Under your exomoon.
Plant my bones.
Meow
My palpable darkness.
My grave persona.
Note to self
Challenging souls.
I know you’re listening 🖤
"Ethereally lighted, frigid, beautiful."
A misty mountain life. Perfection.
Skipping stones.
Surreptitious anxiety.  Buried under bravado.
Ragingly calm.
Hang out on clouds.
Lustful liaisons.
Flirting with the universe.
Mission.
Suppression.
If I should die before I wake...
Synthetic slumber time.
We’re all tormented souls around here.
Heaviness pressed into every pore.
How much is too much?
"Zero principles, no self worth, do not deserve better. Thanks for the therapy."
Repugnantly emotional.
Emotionally repugnant.
A river to float on/drown in
Hanging pictures in the sky.
We should flourish in the darkness together.
"Denial is a warm spot, however unhealthy."
Shadows circling shadows.
Dusty petals as skin.
Effortless simplicity.
Exquisitely simple.
Cold and clear and pretty today.
"Whatever makes you feel better, honey."
"Come on, you’re smarter than that."
Continuing to interact with an ex someone you claim to still love and can’t get over is a long walk off a short pier.
Mmmmm nope. Sympathy just evaporated.
Multiple masks. One day they make you want to stop life and the next you feel a twinge of sympathy for them and their plight.
"Block, mute, delete, erase, move on."
Garnering sympathy and platitudes from randoms on the internet is sooooo 1990s.
I did used to enjoy your writing.  Shame it’s all smoke and mirrors.
Notification anticipation
Don’t worship false idols and by false idols I mean those building up their twitter empire.
A cleansing sanctuary for our souls.
Ancient ruins where my heart should be.
The wind is musical chaos.
Bones of the apostles.
Silently dying.
My scripted life.
I always just want it all.
I don’t share well.
I won’t swim upstream.
The shifting world. Moving away from me.
Consume my soul.
Nothing feels ok right now.
Essentially numb.
Numbness is my savior.
The only forgiveness I want is from myself.
Oh to live in a river.
Rippling and winding.
Skipping stones.
Trickling along.
Going through the motions.
Waning forevermore.
Hypocrisy bureaucracy.
Can I do this with life..??
I want a forest to die in.
To die by your side.
My soul cannot take any more.
I just want to float on a river for eternity.
"In a corner, without support."
Cascading down. Crashing over rocks. My bones and flowers and blood.
"A babbling brook, flowing with my blood."
Conduct the ritual upon my body.
Place pebbles on my closed eyes.
I guess they’ll find me soon. If not already.
"Destined to die young, one way or another."
"I mean, I’ve cried like three times today, that’s not healthy."
This place is awful for the mental health.
I’m so alone. Pathetically.
Waging war upon myself. Battling.
I only attack when provoked incessantly. And maliciously.
"If I could, I would.  Hurt you and myself. Body and soul."
My hate and desire to strike is palpable.
"Spilling, spurting, gushing forth."
Chaotically created.
Gaslighting hypocrites. Just. No.
My being is a wreckage.
My decrepit soul; disintegrating in the breeze.
My decaying bones.
My ancient soul has crumbled; my body tumbled.
"Drown me in petals, scatter my dust."
Flowing through you.
Some parts of us will never be ok ever again.
Reincarnate me.
The trees sigh. The flowers gasp.
Listening but not hearing. Looking but not seeing.
My mask is made of dust and vines.
Your incessant bleating has given me a brain ache.
Smother me with dead roses.
Wade into me.
My heart is a frozen puddle.
Show me how to exist.
The blood is love.
Cleanse your soul. Wash away your sins.
Dip your toes in my frigid waters.
I'd bathe in the river of unmindfulness.
Unrelatable.
A fiery flood. A river of flames.
Deliriously depressed.
The pain is heady.
Mustering souls.
Alien 👽
Rushing through the underworld.
Not a place of punishment.
Hahaha that’s a lie. I’ll swallow whatever rubbish you feed me.
I’m pretty much done with accepting words without actions.
A mass grave for twitter alts.
Scatter your petals with my bones.
I’ll flow into you.
Drown in me.
