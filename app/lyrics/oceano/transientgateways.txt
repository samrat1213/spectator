Behold luminescent spirals overhead, the hidden element of travel unveiled
A mythos of science few can comprehend nor possess

Connectivity of every outer realm
The axis where timelines intersect
Connectivity of every outer realm
The axis where timelines intersect

A transient gateway manipulating time and space
To harness its powers, one must ascend

Transported through the cosmos, projected to the furthest distance, crossing dimensions, who would you save?
Transported through the cosmos
Crossing dimensions, who would you save?

Would you even care to help?
Or throw such a gift away, to withhold for selfish embellishments?

Who would you save?

Would you remain light years away if you could warn an alien race of a shortened existence?
Burdened or does benevolence beckon?
Watch them die or open the portals
Open the portals!
