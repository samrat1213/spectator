Life is a prison.
Imagined by the demons within.
It's in your head, so get the fuck out!
And
Come see me!

I will give you every ounce of my being.
I will give you the strength.
I will give you every ounce of my being.
I will show you my strength.
So let it drain out!
Send every bit of that hate out to me.
We are here to make this moment eternal.
Just give me your hate.

I will give you every ounce of my being.
I will give you the strength.
I will give you every ounce of my being.
Just give me your hate.

We have been beaten down
We have been pushed aside

We sing these songs so that you don't die
We sing these songs for the broken down.
The beaten up and the pushed aside.
You aren't alone in this path of life.
We sing these songs, so you don't.
Die!
So you don't die!

I will show you a pit of redemption
A place where you can find your own.
We won't be tortured.
By the hatred.
Taken in arms we make hate our home.

We are the beaten and pushed aside!
We sing these songs so. You. Don't. die!
We are the beaten and pushed aside!
We sing these songs so. You. Don't. die!
Die!
We sing these songs
So. You. Don't. Die!

We sing these songs for the broken down.
The beaten up and pushed aside.
You aren't alone in this path of life.

We sing these songs so that you don't die
We sing these songs for the broken down.
The beaten up and pushed aside.
You aren't alone in this path of life.
We sing these songs
So. You. Don't.
You don't die!

We sing these songs so. You. Don't. Die!
