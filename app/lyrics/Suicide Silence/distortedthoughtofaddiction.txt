Last time you said I quit you lied
It was so hard to show a false emotion
That's when I slowly stopped to care

Inside my head laughing
Inside of your head you're sick
Inside of your head as perceived
Inside of your head you're sick

I shut my eyes and stopped to care
Your past, your conscience, won't be in vein
Your pain, your suffering, as your body starts to die
You'll remember every little thing away
I watched you suffocate
I watched you suffocate and die
Die

Won't you save me
Inside your head
You forget what's happening
Your God, your creation dies as I shut my eyes
Inside your head
You forget what's happening
