One billion and one ways to dispose of a corpse
I've become a professional misantrophage
In the annals of the promotion of pestilence
Nothing compares to the sights I could show you

My art, the body, gutted and stripped of its vertebrae
Like clay in my hands - now ready for re-sculpture
Like a cannibal, like a vulture
Waiting to pick clean your species, its cultures
Hastily recycling waste
Reducing you to paste

Smelting
Human
Pieces

Progressive
Man-made
Adhesives
Reduced to paste

Solvents
Acid
Mixture

Bonding
Cementing
Fixture

Manipulating human composition
Affix your picture to your gravestone with the glue we made out of you

Pounded
Into a mash
With skeletal ash
Turning into putty

The human
So many uses
Once drained of its juices
Perfect for home, boat or office...
<i>[solo]</i>
Kill the Sarx
Decimate what you are
<i>[solo]</i>

Salvaged osseous fragments
Future kevlar, plastics

A human gum fastened to an envelope
That I smelted from the skin of scrotums and labias
Its brainy texture provides excellent elasticity
This I'm no pervert.

Only humans
Simple cells

Fats, skin, intestine
Blood, bone, nails
Reduced to paste

Distillates, polymers, benzene
Aliphatic, silica chrystalline
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
Methylchloroisothiazolinone

My art - the body, mangled and raped of persona
Now clay in my hands, ready for re-sculpture
Like a cannibal, like a vulture
Waiting to pick clean your species, its cultures
Hastily recycling waste, reducing you to paste
