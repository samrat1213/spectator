Time keeps pushing
Time keeps fighting
Make sure that I can't stand on my feet
We all hide behind the veil
Of ego
Of ego
My strength is what tells me to let go
(Let it go)

When I die
When I die
It's all we think
I came here to live and breathe

When I die
When I die
It's all we think
I came here to live and breathe

This mind is haunted
This mind is stunted
No motivation to open my eyes and see
This creation in front of me
Is dirty
Is filthy

When I die
When I die
It's all we think
I came here to live and breathe

When I die
When I die
It's all we think
I came here to live and breathe

I cannot hide
From what I am inside
Sorrow will eat me if I don't try to survive

I won't die
I won't die
I am right here
I came here to live and breathe

I won't die
I won't die
I am right here
I came here to live and...

Breathe
Breathe
