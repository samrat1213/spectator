A 47 storeyed office building. Luxury working conditions. Day after day
Welfare is created. Working hours are out. Time to go back home and see the
Family. A bunch of people leave their posts. Somewhere up there they wait for
An elevstor to come. The door closes. The elevator moves down. Three seconds
Pass and horror begins. Steel ropes snap. The elevator falls quickly down
Brake system is out of order. The elevator crashes downstairs. The bunch of
People mingled with their intestines. Bowels form endless knots spotted with
Colourful brains. Heaps of eye-balls hanging loose on veinless. Bones get
Tangled up in the shock-absorbing springs. Clerks' ties are not far removed
From peritoneum lobes. ...an unexpected technology errorEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
