whispers and bullets i know the secrets of the trees
"we, the extravagant dead"
fucking disney death squads
i have no guilt for my pleasures
one day all this beauty will destroy me
there's a lonely man on europa who can hear the warnings screaming across the stars
"this fast demise, baby"
is anything what it seems in the land of tinfoil dreams
life as a moon-touched professional maniac
like the mouse told me:  no life counts but the last one
acceptance or feed it to the worms
broke my knuckles on your smile
the epoch of tigers and snakes
we are a universe of one
"i can see the dead in your crystal clear lake, baby"
"the six of diamonds, the cosmic fox and the price of love"
pre rigor mortis
how about this? i have a boundless capacity for fucking emptiness
a highway that goes nowhere that goes everywhere
you sleep the sleep of angels while i suffer for my sins
say a prayer around the knife in your chest
when we sit and wonder why are we here who killed god
all the old crimes
it's terror upon terror as we cross through the shadow of the terminator
i can feel it my cell walls are weakening  witness the birth of the jelly man
we together broke creation
the dice don't roll that way
the constellation of the noose
"we hold to no miracles here in the broken kingdom, baby"
hugs and kisses and other profane rituals of the goddamn insane
rejoice! this is the end time the omega  a future without meaning
once you're there don't go back
living dirty on the prison planet
followed athena into the tempest hoping to be transformed
i don't understand
"baby, please show me someplace safe"
damaged enough to see the shapes and colors all the time
inside of my skull a squid clings precariously but that's his place his home
"to be warm, unreal, a hologram projected across the universe"
ready set  with the damned  straight to hell private jet
this... an idiot's peace
"it's the chains we never even see that we hold so dear, motherfucker"
"once, i held the river in a chokehold"
it's the fucking firmament isn't it
"in the dream one coin, spinning, made of gold"
"black cloud dreams, baby"
a lonely kiss before this planet explodes
red is the color of misery
among the flames for this is hell
this is my mountain birthed in chrome
dying but slowly... oh so slowly
"i will turn my sixth face, the broken facet, out towards the world"
they said the stars have changed and now i am what i'm not
"broken, i am the system"
you can see me but it depends on where you stand i am the two dimensional man
what do you do when it's life you don't believe in
born today going nowhere tomorrow
and one day the tiger opens its mouth and you... you step right inside
a brief blink
"underneath, the desert is all memory"
"please man, please a prayer for this hollow kingdom"
a dare for the spirits
this is jason in eden
peek between my hands held together and see the god i have trapped there
i sat with the ghosts for a while but things were falling apart rapidly by this point
don't you know? death comes swinging
i carry the weight of the world not this world but some world somewhere
"for a brief moment i thought i was the man diogenes searched for but no, i was a dragon"
"attack, idiot zen"
even though i am i've never been called beautiful
astral projection third eye shotgun blast
the sudden urge to disintegrate to explode into atoms
watch how long i'll live
surrender and the great yielding the big give way
drew a new card:  the four of clubs sightless the future makes demands
run die leave it all behind
teach me in hopes i learn
i will show you nothing for living is eternal
i surrender burn the garden down  give satan the keys
bit by a man with the idiot tooth
i am the test we failed
make no sound
tense shoulders living mister desolate
open up and own the terror
"i've seen things, man lightning strikes in psychedelic neon tokyo  crying girls in blackout berlin"
it's been a million goddamn years of hate and waste and life and love and loss
we circle because there's no place to land
"i, beloved of the moon stranger in the desert  lost footnote to your story"
i hold to the faithlessness of man
sunflower suicides
"loosely gripped eternity, baby"
what do you do when your baby is the storm and you are a broken dam
"put this big broad world on my idiot shoulders, baby"
punch me
when you start thinking fast that's when the snakes come
what is love but suffocating in the big empty
maybe i'll close my eyes and let the silence reign
oh but i do not wish to be
"climb to the roof of the world with me, baby  we'll give god the finger and laugh as he fucks off"
"this stitched together boy versus eternity, mama"
dragging right to the end
the weight of my bones
tossed out into an uncaring universe hoping the scales balance at the end is lunacy
it's the same i get it but that's fucking chaos
"name your oldest heartbreak for me, baby"
i know you... you used to be a saint
i used to be a flower
"i know eventually it will destroy me but baby, this heart runs on rage"
"it's the terror we live with day in and day out, baby"
"we, the awful few"
a settling of dread
the romance of measuring distance in years
these golden age crooks
who will care for me and my last six working nerve-endings
we are the monday people
terrible i hate it
"tense, coiled, concentrating on moving faster than my enemies"
this stone a monument immaculate
time is a fucking monster it eats us all up and leaves nothing
who looks nobody looks we close our eyes and step blind into the machine
"i'll climb down from this cross when i'm good and fucking ready, baby"
who else can i blame i forged these chains  i placed the lock i lost the key
here we begin again lost
i care but i've grown so hard
"the future is already dead, baby"
we used to guard the portals and lock the doors but that was before  before they could be seen
just an old dream for an old fool i guess
we'll let the past die  we'll birth new revolutionaries with new causes
"name your gods, baby"
for a while there she was a sword
"fighting the drain we're on empty trout time now, baby"
ok... be still
who gives a fuck  the vultures circle as we begin a new performance
the new pretending
far from this new tomorrow
"yeah well, blood spilled purple"
it's early so i will place my hand between the jaws of the wolf and dare time to continue the journey
so it was decided: we let the rabbits hang
we will be atomic and new in our power
not rethink but fucking unthink
you can't imagine a new color you must see it to know it and to know it will drive you insane
"there is no tipping point when the fulcrum burns, baby"
i listened to the little bird sing  of beautiful women and choking kings
murder charms
we'll trade magics make bets
"battlefield blues, baby"
stretched so thin you can see stars through where i used to be
i've been many things but my favorite was a drop of golden sun
i wish to start again to be small to be bathed in the sink and swaddled warm
if you eat of the dreamer do you become the dream
it's madness  up and down birds flying on the wrong axis
god herself said scream crack this fucking prison planet in half
"i tell the same lies  only louder, baby"
there's been a rupture
it's the crushing
my muscles are all tight like god's finger is pushing me into another dimension breaking through barriers the traveler
a woman in chrome
"criminals of the fucking sun, baby"
like a child i turned my back on the moon i can't sing but that's never stopped my song
spare a thought for the dead
we babble and babble as we talk around it  we don't even notice  this is a place of bones  a golgotha
ghosts of leviathans crash through the open grasslands of my idiot brain
my shadow holds all the cards twisted regards avant-garde
i will give you a gift a piece of the sky
i may be lost but she's a goddamn demon named patience so at least there's that
there it is: big as day sharp as life
jupiter is demanding makes fucking demands
tomorrow we bend
i miss thinking i might freeze to death and die
nowhere to run nowhere to hide sixteen fucking swords to pierce the side
too slow caught by the hammer
judas wore green
we are the omega  last of our kind doomed to die on the prison planet
"followed that money straight to hell, baby"
notes from the unhinged
"i am the time thief, motherfucker"
i ate whole the sun  spit out all its loneliness  all its regret watch that fucker shine now
every day i wake up to the same terrible reality no changes no form no function
stitched into place
"on the days garish, angry squid swim through my spinal fluid"
spare a moment for death's endless circling
"but my heart is bulletproof, motherfucker"
spend some time as an old man and see what is best forgotten
it's not turtles but wrath all the way down
i planted a seed and grew a tree of poison rage
opened my eyes and was damned for it
we lost our grip on time when we stepped out into the light
a light from this wicked moon
"i've been told it's normal to feel nothing, nothing at all, absolute zero"
limping around outside of heaven
it's both dare and blasphemy
but i'm mostly rust
what more can i say: she held me when i was cold
"every heart makes useless demands, mama"
it can't all just be regrets can it
mister empty transformation
"fools can be beautiful too, baby"
i am beautiful and messy and god can fuck himself if he thinks that's about to change
oh my love don't believe for one second that your heart was the heaviest thing ever created
between my palms i hold the earth  the earth as it sits on the edge of explosion
if you want we can sit together and watch the end of the world
here... where we die headfirst
"yes, my darling, i'll be beautiful alone"
this day came with teeth
kisses from monsters
i asked for a lift the last ride out of here
"i'll fall on my sword but don't expect any more, baby"
mister try again
and here we fail
tomorrow's admissions of guilt
"time to go, baby"
going through the portal knowing it leads nowhere
"reach, damn you"
sometimes i forget this fragile vessel
"i, beloved of the moon, suffer for her alone in the sky"
all my higher brain functions are failing in his shell the turtle celebrates alone
we talk through the walls scream alone in our tombs
ah but this is the future  the day he was born to die
a day in ruins
fire and rage the basic rules of survival
god herself flexed her fist as we stood blindly by
here is a thing i didn't count on
confident and professional in her destruction
don't you know? we are god's little monkeys
"say hey amen, motherfucker"
cock's crow sour diesel
"the urge of the dead, baby"
we'll see who you are when the wolves come
the future has grown so far from my eye
i am an idiot and this is my journey ganesh grant me wisdom
failing we turn to science we turn to magic
the burden of atoms and molecules
we're backwards we're travelling the invention of time was a mistake
"honey, you know how hard it is to see the future"
behold the dreamer lost in his dream is anything what it seems
i hold all the secrets i am the last minoan
walked into the sea with stones too heavy to bear
"we speak in crimes here, baby"
the great futility
you aren't strong enough to sever my umbilical to the great space mother
"hope is a slow fade over the double yellow line, baby"
condensed into this small version of myself
maps in broken drywall
the birth of universes in their dying  all going by unnoticed
"sing an off-key song, idiot boy"
it's mine... it all makes sense to me
i have no fear of that i've eaten mountains before
i am beautiful i am transcendent i am more than just a man
"there are no revolutionaries in heaven, motherfucker"
she was built for sin built for war built to be mine
"the fight is lost we should leave while we still can, baby"
look at this happy fuck probing for weaknesses
"love, life and other poorly planned escapes"
this is it this is all i have to give i'm too tired to be king
"i will let no god master me, baby"
oh little andromeda who will boast of your beauty if not me
here it is: the last gathering of my enemies
live a life catastrophically
i can see time
where my body meets concrete suicide leaps from the penthouse suite
i am the hole  its absence its boundary
she is the rising tide poised to kill us all
talk to me  my skull is hollow and i enjoy the echo
who will save you who will save me  my bomb whistle baby
"listen, fucker creation ends where god stops his stupid little doodles"
"what is life but straining against the bonds, baby"
if i leave the anger will remain no promises no guarantees
"i would fix you, dear broken people, just as soon as i fix myself"
get comfortable and think on your ability to destroy any one thing
what all this tells me about the end
i'll carry it for you this sinner's day
a season of unbearable cruelty
the madness in her i love you
get it all together and destroy yourself
a great profit in quiet
sit careful and wary near her carnivorous heart
"we live fast here in exile, baby"
me and you and the thought killers too
from moment to moment a remaking
as a gift for you my bones and teeth become planets and moons
this motherfucker this patron saint of things easily found
i will close my eyes and breathe i will close my eyes and become the mountain
she cried her vengeance  listen and you'll hear
failing to escape the prison planet with only courage and a bloody toothed smile
give the devil a name
because this is what we do - we fight
why can't anyone hear me screaming
traveling through the past born under friendly fire
she's my everything my golden hour
miss inexplicable's travels through time
this is the death march this is my place in line
sugar and spice and goddamn contempt that's what i'm made of
making small talk with idiots and minor deities
my little lullaby
there are monsters outside
i was a winter baby born with hate in my heart
"we live in the corpse of a rotting god, baby"
on the days where i am grace
hurry up we're drowning
you may look upon it but just know: the sky is mine
this is the story of when the impossible girl met her dead-end boy
this is the idiot parade
watching the failure in real time slow-motion  a goddamn car crash just for my amusement
"that's the smell of your life going up in flames, baby"
the pain of existence versus a listen to it carefully kind of morning
time to chase the squid
"i, beloved of the moon, dance in the empty field under her watchful gaze"
"a quiet, welcoming lie"
"headless and looking for answers, baby"
this is my last life - i wish for no more please just let my idiot atoms rejoin the fucking galaxy and be at peace
"life is rough on this side of the river, baby"
the urge to kill this new life
do you ever scream from your eyes
the unbeautiful
sticking up god for drugs and miracles
lost and incredibly far away
pictures from the underworld
i used to have hopes and dreams and feelings
nice to see there's still mayhem left in her heart
the hunters have come we'll hide together and run when we need to run
"pass me your cross and i'll carry it, fucker"
all guilt all the time
here's to the spirit smashed upon the shore
terror in the blue light
for god did but lie down and die
chaos and curses curses and chaos
"it'd be a lot easier if i wasn't a liar, baby"
content to simply be forever
together we whisper the idiot's prayer still alive still alive
what you want what you need i swallowed the future  the sun is the seed
and then one day the sky crashed
"it's a whole new dream isn't it, baby"
it's a big stupid crushing goodbye
we'll make violent choices and begin again
risks and memories
we lost power over the sea of tranquility stay mad till we land
when your fillings pick up strange transmissions  deer screams and tv static
misinterpreting the drunk's message
and just like that the night comes for us
"you can buy a life here, darling"
the arrogance of this
the cold seeps into my bones as i realize for all of us that this is our first life for why would the goal of reincarnation be a fucking human
this is time meaningless and all-consuming
lost with a shipwreck's pride
radio signals from the dawn from the beginning from the red shift
take my hand if you want to be lied to and left alone in the maze
maybe you need to spend a few years as the color blue
passing through portals invisible membranes
we walk blind into the sun
once upon a time  before society fell when we were happy when this wasn't hell
small pain spreading no navigation  no heading
and still the sea rages at me
we're down to one  down to birds in the night
"i could be the moment in between, baby"
will you share my world of bombs and greed
"a few seconds before we fell, mama"
gifts and kisses from tigers and witches
she lives in me now this bitter miss havisham
we exist without any idea how the machinery works
heavenly beings designed with different molecules inconceivable atoms
planting seeds committing crimes
this is how you travel in a storm
i feel my body eating itself
love the algorithm  the algorithm is all
who will gather the spears we threw at the sun
the misguided but simple faith that you'll make it
the faith of pigs
i am god's idiot sidekick sancho panza the bad guy
awake  free the sphinx break the chains break the links
sharing my sky with fools
"i locked that door a hundred million fucking years ago, baby"
she's more of a benediction
"fall flaming from the sky  like snow, i guess"
"it's not the real thing it's a sense of devotion, fucker"
heavy morning burnt orange
when you've been together a long time they're all empty battlefields
the rats are whispering their secrets kids la la la la la
"i guess hope is a thing for fools like me, baby"
in my skull a forest where nothing lives
may the truth never pass these lips
"i can be a serious man with a knife sticking out of my neck, baby"
surviving the shipwreck by being rejected by the goddamn sea is the only way to be sure
"in this house of slaughter we learned by falling, motherfucker"
if you know your time and place in the universe you may travel freely
a day in the life of a villain
our looming purpose
graves of hugs or hugs of graves
adds for shamans flash on the inside of my eyelids  my fucking skull is the future
your mother was fleet of foot  were you born standing and ready to run
the dance of the exit wounds
that long slow climb to consciousness
the adoration of saints
uplift me into the path of the bullet
"just bury me in a quiet place out of the way, baby"
the gospel according to me: god's last idiot
"you may pass through my dimensions, mama"
i belong to the moon but she is lost to me here in the belly of the whale
be the explosion here and gone
the end of combustion
waking up from those long blackout days in washington was the opposite of this
mary and the filthy dowagers
"i will not be the light, today"
but i'm not anyone anymore
we lost everything along the way
that unfeeling
woke up lost and underfoot
unarmed encounters with the goddess
over and over i have birthed time
under the door... the escape of the 2-D man
i can take a nap or i can huff fucking stardust and see all the ghosts
"bored, i'll be the slowly healing bruise"
if you had asked i would have given you new gods
jesus fucking christ the narrative has spun wildly out of control
"i can't do anything a thousand years after i was born, baby"
"crazy but still, motherfucker"
down in the core of mama earth where i can be held close
dreams of burrowing into the earth
there is no gift greater than warmth
a brief fire burning for god herself
"every person is a warning, baby"
a killing of angels
"i, beloved of the moon, have lost my way the sea is flat and empty in every direction i look"
"the animal's size is determined by energy efficiency, food availability and environment i think as i float through the vast emptiness"
i walk quietly among the dead  finger poised just above the self-destruct button
constant battle hand to hand combat with the heart with the mind
now run
today all decisions will be based on intuition or how i feel about the sun or which card falls face down
death is the creator
well... you're gonna have to fight
my spirit is shrinking  my skull is contracting around it
the chains never become easier to bear
remember when you realized you were only a human
"i'll be the last fast horse of god herself, motherfucker"
it's bent and dull and made of tin  this sacred idiot's crown
the universe's great secret? sacrifices must be made
"death is just a million little smiles, baby"
no more cons nothing to sell  the bombs all dropped the spires all fell
born knowing the lie
i envy your failure
"the strange is all around, baby"
no dreams no fun devil's raygun
"care to make a wager on the fate of the universe, motherfucker"
i am the messiah the false communist the last to know
the sermon of the knife
she; taught me to burn my modern day prometheus
false smiles happy fronts  hell shoved straight down my throat
no thoughts just endless continuation
give it up in a fucking sentence
"i dozed for just a second and bast, goddess bast, climbed angrily from my throat"
but you are the queen and i am the living embodiment of object impermanence
"the sky is mine all you see belongs to me fucker, i will cast your satellites down"
"not all adventures are meant to be taken not all stories are happy, baby"
i'm tired of this form this idiot chrysalis
it's because i am beautiful i am beautiful in the sun i am beautiful dragged in death's fucking wake i am beautiful
to the love we hold we must reap
is that what this is? acceptance?  fuck that
blood dripping in a 4/4 beat
this is the great corrosion
"if i knew i would change, baby"
opening my sixth eye and turning this fucking planet into ash
it makes me sad to know that when all is said and done i'll still be seen as human
chasing end times monsters
i am the burden you carry
can't breathe in this hollow place
there is no normal it's all make believe puppy dogs and ice cream
"we could live for all of eternity but god herself doesn't give a fuck, baby"
my desolation baby
we are idiot one single organism united
"we have been damned to this prison, baby  there is no backward there is no forward just the interminable hell of now"
wake up it's already too late
it's time for the fucking hammer squid wrapped around the ribs feeling already like tomorrow
a more brutalist sort of evolution
"yeah, it's all so simple when you've been dead since the dawn of time"
we are not electric we are pain we are crying in the mirror
the idea that i am dust and dust is me
me and you and millions of goddamn monsters
maybe if just for a little while i was the wind
"walk softly, baby  my bones are brittle"
slowly bleeding to death when along came the impossible girl
is your life a field of flowers trapped behind a rusted wrought iron fence
we took grace by force and set the world to spinning in its orbit
short day mistress of the long night
like a rotten tooth shows mercy
"it's easy to remember, mama"
miss unwavering
two bullet dreams
"i live ugly, baby"
it has no name but dark and foreboding is the city i birthed
ever wake up strange and deserving of chains
i may share a little with you but remember: i am the future
nothing ever ends the destroyer comes and does his work while we smile our little idiot smiles and begin again
reign of the night people
loneliness: mechanized and weaponized
we're digging the holes because that's where we're from
"orbiting through my guts the earth exists nowhere but inside me now, baby"
is there anything more profound more joyous than warmth
you lead with your mind the frontline of disaster
"you're only as good as your last death, baby"
the baptism of the idiot
whose turn is it to be empty
alone with nothing but the future and the spectre of the tiger
of giants and scurrying underfoot
i bleed in blacklight in infrared
of ferris and eiffel  of wheels and towers  i grow bored of your sky  and your magics
a change is coming a great inversion of the self let the mystics run mad
i drew a card the five of hearts tomorrow i'm expected to be a real boy
burning and resting a simple candle's blessing
sweet sally coffin eyes
i stood on the surface of the moon and screamed... screamed and screamed and screamed
i understand the spiral the whirlwind the ever churning maelstrom
we will storm heaven  conquer the lands of nod  be resplendent in our triumph
this engine runs alone
are we allowed more than one thought per day
"i need to be the ocean for a few million years, baby"
the emperor of empty days
a failure to perceive the future
mister sustainability  fuck your god
ignore the machinery of living
so we made industries of love of death
i was beautiful but that was an invitation for monsters
i recite the speech by rote  choking on the god caught in my throat
tip toe for the bombs are ticking
killing what's new about me
"how cluttered the shelves of your mind, baby"
"televise my destruction, you cruel bitch"
reduced down to one drop ultimate flavor absolute insanity
"radioactive, my heart would destroy you"
shut your mouth before the dead climb in
this is the slow place the place where mountains walk
"close enough to jump now, baby"
i'm the bad guy come and see
come around to the view of the destroyer
"i'm dying, baby  read to me"
these gin days
flip a coin for the magdalene for the whore
the heathens are at the door i asked for less but recieved more
a nightmare of separate entities
"we, the veins electric"
the flavor brass and gold
on the path but burning
"there's no alarm worth ringing, baby"
here is the turning point the race downhill
"i make the smallest talk, baby"
when there's a knife in your leg but you still must perform
round and round we go no way in no way out
goddamn it run for your life
"fourteen arrows to pierce the heart  fourteen arrows, motherfucker call it art"
exposed at the last
"we ride ghost ships through impossible days, baby"
in the shadow of old praetorians
"found god's tongue upon the ground, right"
"i make a cup of my hands but find them empty, baby"
some hollow empty organ where the madness is stored
swallowing hearts that burn as they go down
a blessing of dirt and bone
"the pigs always promise hope, baby"
i am the love of all things
"was transformed by her idea of me, motherfucker"
would you dare the tiger or the moon in her glory
wake up trudge pray sleep return
a time for clever smiles
"one day in november, baby"
caught on the plains under a big empty sky
this day all black and grey
i went to paradise and swallowed all the pretty birds
on each rib carved a sin
"the triad the father, the son and the holy idiot"
without ears the queen still hears  afraid she runs before she disappears
the urge to not quite be there
see the river i birthed  see monday on the horizon
the transition mister sublimation
because you're hurting me
we live these acid rain dreams beautiful and terrible to comprehend
here's a thing a fucker should know the strange is inside turn inward and fight
old masks for new faces
one hundred million fucking years watch the slow disintegration
she's someone who knows
these long princess nights
nobody knows where the money goes
"stars we can't even see are dying all around us, baby"
come with me through the past
she was magic or she was nothing at all
it was a wink a kiss from the knife tip
a day we ride with no sadness
babble and babble and babble some fucking more  babble until the universe becomes incomprehensible
no one's offered me a dream
a splash of my blood pointing due north
skin like a fucking plague of rats itchy like i know the score
the eater of stars the transformer of destinies
"live long, you son of a bitch"
"i have love and you have love but only i, beloved of the moon, have to fight the fucking sea to keep it"
i have survived being me  mutually assured destruction
held hostage by evolution
i wasn't prepared for the sad song she sang
"pull the pin on my sewer mutant heart, baby"
it all makes sense when you realize god is insane
"just at work daytripping through the spirit world, baby"
the answer i swear is oblivion
how did this happen to me  i don't know anything about anything
"i'll be your dead horse lover, baby"
a twisting of the great meaning
old mother fox with her teeth so white
a most dangerous woman god she lived a life
in the celestial lap of god herself where stars are born and men die happy
like the hard edge of a rotten tooth
at war with the horizon that fell under her name
descended from the birds that fell from the sky
it's a new hate a single cell dividing
"survival strategies from alternate dimensions, mama"
mister thoughtless in the land of tomorrow
birthing new revolutionaries
lost in my hometown
the gift of a note played lonely
"i always ask for forgiveness carefully, baby"
god is dead the warden took the keys the prison planet is our reward
the future is a lullaby a chimera a false sense
less a man more a ghost in an elephant graveyard
behind it all a warping of the divine
step out the door and disappear... vanish
nothing is real to the digital man
to face the idiot challenges of life
time for dramatic choices
"i see you my beloved, whispered the moon just outside my window"
all these fucking thoughts  no system no cohesion just goddamn anarchy
"bombers over heaven, baby"
so i became something unbecoming
beginning to panic
i name all these fuckers time depression sadness
i am the jelly man weak and inconsequential
"i welcome that point just before breaking, baby"
"for me she stepped into the path of time, the great destroyer"
the threatening aura of eight minutes to sunrise
i hope you mind
i am the terrible one
are you a princess a whore a man of your word
"we'll all, everyone one of us, have to look into the eye of god herself and admit to our failures"
and once i hope to rest without this knife in my chest
the eleventh commandment: it's ok to cry
"i try so hard, baby  but this machine runs on anger"
mistress of the great fall
"what our eyes perceive we deny, baby"
are you jealous when the fucking sun washes the night from her eyes or
woke up in conflict countdown 5 ... 4 ... 3 ...
radiating pins and needles
a prayer for us and our stolen days
this is the last fucking bullet... i named it love
laid down exploded  became the maze
pass through the gate sinister
god is here condensed  smaller and meaner
go easy
"i, beloved of the moon, last man alive, slave to the machine, dreams of endless escape"
"every rebirth ended in violence or plague, baby"
i didn't live this long to be the only man left to care for the machines
as we hold our breath for the next million years
oh but it can't all be shamans in shallow graves summoning revolutionaries from the heart of the sun
"i'll still be the same idiot after the rain passes, baby"
there's a goddess on my back
goodbye rosie
we launched the fucking pods and stood with regret
for tomorrow is so loud
"what you wouldn't give? fucker, you can't buy miracles"
the boy in the mirror shard with the bleeding fist
we are the imitation  the sincerest flattery
nine o'clock villain
i do as i wish these stars are mine
"there are no whores or angels in space, baby"
bloody knuckles two truths and a lie
"she's all arrows and unkind words today, motherfucker"
is your girl the rain or something far different
"misunderstood like the little serpent in the garden, baby"
to stand in front of the body politic and see your rage so easily dismissed
to sleep late  to be the envy of the seaside queen
fucking city i'll fucking birth a city see if i don't
weak send your assassins now
my blood is too thick too slow won't reach my brain it's just sludge about midrange
"my bones tell no fortunes, baby"
responsibilities of violence
in synchronous orbit with god herself
lightyears from home and we've lost the dreamer
among the dead on the mountain lost in gangland
in my dreams statues of the fat-tittied fertility goddess line ancient highways
through the divinity of my idiot atoms
"let me twist in your veins, baby  soft and golden"
"baby, life is an ongoing horror  maybe together we'll make it"
these are lifepod dreams last chance floating dreams
a deer crawled from my throat turning its eyes upon me it ran off before i could ask its name
"i don't want to go or do or be anymore, baby"
i hide when i'm scared i glow when it rains
as the body eats of itself
"i'm easy with madness, baby"
"i, beloved of the moon, keep running the machines that hum through the night"
"this bullet is a prayer, she said"
we eat from the top here
"just a kiss from the angel of mysterious circumstances, baby"
"i am jonah in the whale safe, victorious and doomed to fail"
finding my place in the machine
"the night sets nothing free you know that, right?"
you're too gentle for me
pictures the sea took of me
"no more chances, i guess we hunt here with bent arrows"
"lives unexplained  strange comings and goings, baby"
reality and will these things are mine
she came to watch me hang
we haunt the future because honestly... what the fuck else are we supposed to do
"these are the killing dreams, baby"
who we are when we're no longer alive
my baby in a meadow she's lost and strong  and far from home
dead time no thoughts
sure it's fast but is it fast enough to outrun the judgment of god
children of elder gods
gifted forever and the trauma it brings
"this is machine learning, baby"
"i always thought my idiot skull was hollow but it turns out there's an ocean in there... tides, sharks and all"
be the reason god ends the world
fell from the future fell back to the start
we scramble to make room as the mystics pass through the system
it was a yell  a shout  she watched me bleed out
soul broken and looking to run
what terrible thing will the universe teach me today
oblivion and a system designed to destroy me
together the usurper
we were promised an atomic tomorrow
"we are the simple dead, mama"
a hard sadness is coming
prayers and run-on sentences
live a life of appalling strangeness
"the termination point of our future lies within, baby"
forced by gravity's unwavering confidence in its own ability to hold me here
to acquiesce: that is the monster
close your eyes... now imagine the ruins
becoming the other in record time
this is the moment just before the temple burns
"i did it just for you this is the new order of time, baby"
we could storm the gates of heaven - that would be something to do wouldn't it
sin after sin the window is cracked and the cold gets in
as the magdalene hums a quiet song
"jesus and the whore beautiful, smart and dangerous tell me nothing more"
"reach down my throat and take whatever the fuck you need, baby"
i refuse to be a real boy
drag your dreams screaming into the light
with my bones wrapped in gold someone to have and to hold
"i am neither one nor one million, baby"
fistfights in paradise
"borders? boundaries? those are for the weak  your map means nothing to me, motherfucker"
"it's just the jagged nature of my being, baby"
on the days where serenity isn't swallowed by anger
i'm tired but she smiled so...
the fundamentals of me the basic fucking math somehow it's just not right
when ra flung his jizz out into the empty void do you think he knew his creation would turn out so awful
"how did i, beloved of the moon, get caught in the chains that drag the sun across the sky"
split in two  a universe to call my own
we'll climb the tower from here to the top
i am the king of saturn and these rings are mine to give
forcing time through me
for i could not avoid the hammer
"set adrift on the ice sent blindfolded into the desert these are our options, baby  rejoice in them"
and we bent down to wash the feet of the unholy
"i'll decide where i'll die, baby"
"this ship runs on party drugs intergalactic fucking party drugs, baby"
"darling, even my imaginary friend hates me"
a manifestation of lost time
a monument to the amazing melting boy
it's not courage we lack
"we don't bribe survivors here, mama"
hush now
like god i am the consumer the end user
"it's a small window, baby  bulletproof at midnight"
"what's new, baby? a scattering of bones  evil signs and portents"
"we, the unimaginable"
we pretend at life and love  inside outside upside down
"i, beloved of the moon, am the idiot king lost in the desert"
my blood thick with worry
these are my princess days
deep down inside where the strange begins
"listen, don't ask me why alone we live  alone we fucking die"
this unnatural vitriol
"the gods might be all fucked up but i ain't making that my problem, mama"
"i'll just sit here and do the impossible, baby"
survived the poppies of the witch broken bones and a cat gut stitch
so much potential but then we went and ate all the revolutionaries
"sing me awake, baby"
i will right no wrongs  i will live as the cowards live
it's labor because someone decided that you deserve to die without living
floating in the endless black
these squid swim the course of my spinal fluid
from the edge of the event horizon i look out and see nothing but untouchable beauty
where do you go when you've never had heroes
we crawl because we must because there's nothing else
last day on earth i hope you make it
take your moment sit with the sword for a while
the great unending pointlessness
"i should be rampaging across the plains with fire and steel but this life runs on a different engine, baby"
i've got nothing for you neither savior nor lover be
smile and walk into the mouth of the monster
we were the shock troops the first wave
god birthed from an old womb cradle to tomb
love what you love as long as it isn't me
smiling together as we watch this old universe bleed out
simple confessions
she enjoyed being beautiful a clarity of suffering
i am the fifth seal  i hold death in his place
she has grown planet-sized while i stand in her palm inconceivably small
moving forward on my own timeline almost to the point of decay only to retreat like the coward i am
"dropping out of orbit on a crash course with forever, motherfucker"
leave a little bit of your soul out for the devil
this is a journey only idiots survive
if i can't be human what can i be
the sea brought me a gift it was the feeling of being insignificant but still... a gift
"to be devoid, empty and numb"
there is no mind  just a powerful vortex of empty cataclysms
"i'll die and burn in my own time, baby"
eyes bleeding from staring at the sun fisted by god because i was too slow to run
"challenging the train head first, motherfucker"
"this is the great big fade away, baby"
there she is... beautiful in battle
unexpected a fight upon waking
"crash this rocket and i'll give you a gift, mama"
that freaky new world
imaginary like god or gravity
i can feel my bones tightening condensing aching contorting changing
i have murdered moments like this before
"clap for the diagnosis, baby"
slipping through the cracks hoping for something better
love the broken man and his last gasp redemption
where do you live is it out on the edge where the universe hungers
the twenty two labors of the idiot
it's all madness and rage as the clock just ticks and mocks and ticks and mocks  jesus fucking christ
suffering for her glory
i woke up so there can be magic again in the world
"i'm just an old man in the dark, mama"
we sit quietly and abstain
"no joy in mudville, fucker"
maybe a little fucking dignity
there is no great plan the universe spits out molecules and atoms that make idiots like you and me and the best we can hope for is not to die right away
drops of blood in my ocean
"take my hand, baby  we'll go to heaven and fight fucking god on his own turf"
"mama knows, baby"
name his song and what he'll sing give a thought to the ghost of the rat king
"if we just bricked it up and walked away you'd be left with nothing but a hollow shell, baby"
the instinct to cower in a hole
we worship all the wrong things  we eat all the pretty cakes
this is the trudge  the hunter/gatherer bargain taken to extremes
how can i be expected to tell the truth when the stars are dead but their light will reach us sometime in the future
we sit among the dead and pretend to be blind
"fuck that dude, the sea, the stars and everything else"
i will be the next father of god
because god is just a motherfucker we must suffer for his enlightenment
"all portals lead away, baby"
my misty rain queen
come and get you some old man
the tiger in the tall grass sleeps... and dreams
smiles and resentments
well good for you some of us still have to bleed for everything
a return to those old catastrophic days
am i symmetrical enough to switch bones right to left or has god decided she hates me
time and distance both uncaring
"please, don't ever think of me"
"dance with me, you fool this is the five of hearts the lost card"
i am the idiot king of this toilet earth and i have lost my way
she; named the mountain that sits upon my chest
"i'll face this goddamn world empty-handed, baby"
"you may eat from my fucking heart for all eternity for all i care, baby"
save nothing
"if given the choice, gun to my head, i would choose for the universe to devour itself"
a believer in science and silence and fate
in what petty corporate fiefdom do you live in
we've lost the path wandered off into the dark
the last quiet thing
"that's because i believe nothing, in nothing"
bored of the dark and my need for it
pretending not to see the great eye peering through the clouds
to give a name to the monster whose mouth is at the end of the tunnel
kiss me once before you slip into the time stream and disappear forever
the arrogance in believing this reincarnation will be the last
we used to walk on water  we used to know the names of all the stars in the sky
"fuck the tide and its turning, baby"
when it's time for them to destroy you just remember: remain silent and the first call is to your lawyer
"sometimes intimacy is just fucking dying, baby"
future scams and dreams
queen of the pathways through the stars
i don't need a hug i need the sky to burn
who have we become behind the things we pretend not to see
"always take advice from maniacs, my love"
we destroy because we can
"we're adrift now, baby"
"daring the universe lights off  pedal to the floor wrong side of the road come on, motherfucker"
i used to face the future without a care but then again i used to be brave
fog from beyond the moon
fear begets fear i think as we hurl spears at airplanes
the vagaries of unbecoming
oh little fishies floating up to heaven
"next stop infinity, you son of a bitch"
day after day i give the vultures what they want
let me just rest my head in your lap for a moment before this nightmare continues
"set me adrift on the ice, baby"
the sun has come to purge the idiot night from my bones
i sit here like the turtle telling my long and slow lies
little pills to get through the night
i used to be old enough to die young
purging ritual traumas
"in this dimension it's just garden variety depression, baby"
mister serene
passing through the spirit world on my way to make war
breaks my heart to see the sun
the future? that's where fucking maniacs live and frankly i won't have it
"we race from crisis to crisis here, baby"
my heart beating bombs
i'll die a nebula
i know you don't believe but that's the path of the coward
everything ends in violence
straight down past the last great story  past the monsters past the forgotten
one bullet  to destroy god one must first become god
"my lord and savior jesus fucking christ only saves sinners, mama"
"we stand smiling in the path of the beast, baby"
"we choose new gods here, baby"
the sun rises because once upon a time i asked the world to spin
lost hopes barren coasts  these pills make ghosts
"crime season, baby"
without gold for the ferryman we live on the farthest shores  broken men and whores
we all smile and dance and fail to see the end coming
counting holes
everything leapt into existence when i opened my eyes
"splinters and nails, baby  chew through the fucking floorboards"
glory in the end  consumed by the god monster  amen
"i'm trying, mama"
wherein jason learns to breathe again
everything is screaming fire and rage thank fuck my blood is slow moving sludge
we just stumble along buried among the living
levitating like i know the fucking way
making changes  growing new limbs
when lovers take witches
we devoured the self  now only monsters remain
my grey sky angel
i for idiot my curse my scarlett letter
once upon a time when i was a real boy and life made sense
"it's not a smile it's a programming error, baby"
we seek only monsters
impossible to carry  easy to forget
drew a card: the eight of hearts the empty treasure
pain and the separation of my skull's tectonic plates
abandoning the flowers the land the planet
misunderstanding the mechanics of it all
"goddamn arrogant, baby"
titans  gods  men me
lazy jane marches on stalingrad
open your eyes upon this spontaneous existence
"oh, i have the measure of you"
we'll slow dance- you hold me up
and all the things go boom
unconvincing saturday nights
madness backlit in love and lust
telling myself that it would be easier to burn down the temple
"you like to think you won't die on your knees honeybee, please  let's just see what the little bird sees"
an unkindness of idiots
the annihilation of the self
a promise to the destroyer
god you're boring  dull knife dreams
tampering with the escape hatch as the self-destruct alarm screams
"got the ghost ship blues baby, we're sinking"
and so i turned and looked and was transformed
"shh mama, i know love's terrible prophecy"
and we hold close this ruination
my neon misery
she lives with the broken man and calls it home
"we don't sleep alone we sleep amongst the gods, motherfucker"
passed by saturn and sailed  through its ring i heard the bombs fall and the magdalene sing
i am the empty man feeling nothing and no one
her beauty a favor
"death knows the song, baby"
and i fell burning
"tired wings, mister moth, tired wings"
"lost, i am a terrible person"
"lover, friend can't touch me, motherfucker transcend"
listening to my body eat itself
and a hug from the devil that's mighty fine
a hawk flew from my open mouth circled twice the moon and died
we've lost it all  hot rock lizard brain insane
"teetering on the fucking peak i am the mountain inverted, baby"
this reaper sings  glory glory hallelujah
i am the lotus the traveler i will save your ghost and swallow whole all the earth
tell me stories and myths tell me lies or just things you wish were true
this sacred anger
hope's bitter burn
can it really just be rage all the time just a skull full of hornet buzz and yawping hordes
miles high and falling fast (is that what you needed to hear)
"be my scream, she said"
"look, i'm ten-thousand fucking feet tall and wrapped twice around the earth, what do you want from me"
"doing fucking barbarian drugs with girls with goddamn antlers, baby"
"baby, your love made your enemies my enemies"
my buzzsaw baby burns beautifully
"ain't good for nothing but dying, baby"
breathing through mud
"my idiot heart, blue"
"you can choke on this life, fucker"
is it a shadow of the truth of who you used to be
the pill lodged in the throat raw cold desperation  do i make it  do i want to do you want me to
tender is the crime
"these are the things i think about when nothing matters, baby"
i tell my baby in the summer sun love and launch codes those aren't free
"mister loose limb, please"
it's just a regular day a temptress in dust and lace
here is the sun and the sky illusions that i provide
spicy panic drinking
"i can feel myself separating,  diverging becoming two at war"
jason in the floodwaters
it's ok... i won't remember
"happy fourth of july, daddy  we are god's great lie"
"all the gates are locked, baby  go around"
to be old to be new  to be all ages and no ages
"each goddamn cell a knife, exploding"
this is my life my fight to the death
"this is my rebirth divine, messy and insane"
how can they when they weren't meant to see
make it sad and slow and just for me
you can play me a song i don't care if i know it all
i always thought somewhere underneath would be the fight
i'm so fucking tired someone come and crush my ghost
"steal from me, baby"
filling the absences with blood and silence
"we try for higher but the synapses don't fire, motherfucker"
woke up in the ginger  manic and moving
now is not the time to die
"we'll just sit quietly, now"
this is my world the one-armed hooker who sits on the left side of god has come to battle the funeral man
"born, i see the chains you're offering"
broke my body just to sleep
night and the great collapse
without thoughts... thoughtless
"go, be a snake"
is every blown out candle a wish for death
dopestalgia
children of the flat earth
so here's the thing about having dreams with no purpose
"and we all fall down isn't that what we deserve, baby"
i lost her as she stepped behind the sun and changed the world
so we're going to end in the loop
i'm alive  i slip through electric
the threat the god trap mayhem at the marketplace
what else can we do  we live in the fucking zone
"swallow and make good your escape, fool"
the unreal girl has gone
the devil has cares too or so i've been told
"we live a bitter rain don't we, baby"
and so the romans go marching
little miss anarchy to the rescue
it lacks a certain... subtlety
"we make lifeboat deals here, darling"
nothing means anything anymore  who cares  shuffle among the dead
"none so blind right, fucker"
"you have to be realistic about these things, baby"
just remember that it's easy to fail and sunrise brings no enlightenment
so we've fixed nothing
"on days where i don't believe in mystery, art or love"
just to the otherside of saturn
passing through the membrane
crawling toward disaster
the alarms have been ringing for so long so long but we've gone deaf don't even fucking hear them anymore
"mother mary, there's a knife at my neck"
ah but i see all of you in every conceivable angle and dimension  in this story in this cage in this cathedral
stuffed to bursting too much and never enough
"it's the only question that matters, motherfucker how much pain can you take"
he's headless our savior in chains
"attachments can not be contained therefore we spread, baby"
coming to terms with failure out here on the edge of the event horizon
to unravel and become the maze
"tied together with whatever's left, baby"
a conspiracy of hostages
the great fucking leap
"quietly, we fight"
beloved i may be but i can forgive everything but the moon
"my meditation is a nail in the forehead, babygirl"
slow... make no haste easy to get lost in this land of waste
powerful narcotics and the god splinter wedged in my fucking brain
"hope is a small thing you know, sometimes"
a year in the light
"and in the earth the rut we trudge, baby"
you've grown so big in your little box
"i hold tight to the hand of the universe, baby"
tell little lies and big lies and lies right out loud
"seven, the repetition"
you fill up my veins inhabit all the places in between
the hurt i hold so dear
to stand burning before the idiot throne
the pharoah stands in a rage his head clasped in a silver cage fifty-thousand watt towers command the stage burn this man who steals a wage
the gloom orgy
little jenny murder eyes
opiates for the god monster  frayed rites and fortunes  the bombs fall tomorrow
a new world is changing as we carry stones across the bottom of the sea
"old glyphs, old man"
eat the fucking angels
"your eyes don't see the imaginary satellites, baby"
sometimes i dream life's a great betrayal
"the unrestrained knife is the only knife that matters, baby"
floating serenely on the empty sea of hubris
"i will swallow whole the galaxy and what i leave behind i leave behind for you, baby"
the last weapon of the adjuster
i asked god for all new organs with all new names and purposes with all new places in the body to hide them
for hundreds of miles all around we are the empty fields
the combination worming its way in making me crazy
six beats per minute
"we, together an elegance of sins"
the violence of our distortions our solutions
"sorry i broke god, mama"
we lost the ship on the edge of the sea of tranquility  we walk from here
unbothered i watched the squids crawl from the sea unbothered because they came for me
now he knows we know so... he's gonna fight
"down your hill, baby i set my skull to rolling"
"i followed your trail of candy, books and bones"
"spell out the end for me, baby"
lost all perception the worms are in my eyes now
spreading my violence across a swarm of locusts each a little piece
dead in the horse latitudes
fuck your sky
convince me that the maths that make up me are correct
can we break the time loop escape the prison planet
watching my machinery break down  i am the idiot king  happiness and disintegration
"there's mayhem on the knife's edge, baby"
these tiger days these twisted forever days
like an old friend this familiar ache
"shh, the light doesn't see me"
dilaudid drip drip drip
all new experiences same old bullshit
"survivability right, motherfucker"
"shoving it all away no time for fear, baby"
clearly i must live with this slippage
time sets its hook eases some of the pain
it's the drips the drabs the parallels
"it's stronger than that, baby  it's unbelief"
"what's in the iv, babe"
strange insects nibbling pain from the corners of my eyes from my mouth
i can't think beyond this pain
i need to move to be moved
this is a journey of pain
"at the last it's all acceleration, baby"
trapped in this endless cycle of smiles and sneers
the full near death experience
ask her and she'll tell you: i'm the last shithead alive
the monkey on my back is held in place by a golden nail
all my enemies have been lost in time
met a crooked ghost searching for an honest man
old gods with new aspects
spiraling ever closer to the singularity
"come and break my goddamn bones  i don't need them anymore, baby"
i am the boy in the dirt
eat the prophet learn how to die
sadness fear paranoia rage my enemies immortal
a black feather a white feather an old lady under the weather throw them all in a pot let it simmer
to begin again to crawl in the well again
i've been to the edge of the earth faught the urge to fly
the last evolution
how indifferent we are to both their joy and their suffering
"well, i've got nothing better to do so i'll watch your love die"
"i'm mister discrepancy  i don't dream anymore, baby"
in my hollow empty idiot skull lies a serpent coiled in rage
beyond the frontdoor i must wrestle and defeat gilgamesh so the sun will shine
begin at the end behind the farthest stone  under the last rib
love the scam
staring down god herself nothing but idiot muscle memory
you may adapt to me
"you don't get to define my reality, motherfucker"
an ugly day born of the wrong dimension
you and i  microscopic octopi  attacking my cells
her power birthed a god
a fist pushed through my brain
"i found your wish, it didn't come true"
blue sky empty skull lust envy
we wait in the house of rabbits and wolves
under the fucking shadow of the dragon of god
"to dream without ache that's the thing, right?"
"that strong urge to jump, baby"
i lie and the planets spin and the universe continues with its own idiot order
"to funerals we wear red they don't mind the spiders, flies or the dead"
raining arrows in a sky of gold
"this is an all new world: there's an angry sea outside my door, the moon looks on disapprovingly"
unfold yourself and begin
down and out in the last place on earth
i'll start at the beginning and work backwards bleeding through time
"i was born of the sky, beloved of the moon but lost my way chasing witches in nameless deserts"
as we set ourselves to burning
"this is the fucking kingdom of the molemen, babygirl"
choked by my own constricting veins
"we can't all survive what we want, baby"
no worries down here in the center...  under the grave  under the grave  under the grave
are there to be no more happy endings
a prisoner of my own decrepitude
i feel like i'm being crushed in the fist of god herself  my joints pushed beyond their limits
i've become a new wound
i am a liar cannon fire  the king is dead strangled by piano wire
growing old in the shadow of unattainable beauty
lover lover mister blunt force trauma
"this heart an engine, failing"
a simple tilt of the earth on its axis and i wake in the dark and everything is all fucked up
i fight against the eternal i find all around
"i have few secrets but ten thousand faces, baby"
life in the blast zone
i'll offer you the same deal as the ferryman: a finger bone in exchange for passage
build me a temple a pyramid or two
in this great vastness here comes a judge of crocodile sadness
"the savior's not coming we're all gonna die on the prison planet, baby"
when she sleeps she dreams of the dawn when she wakes she dreams of destruction
crushed by the goddess intense
the lost man the husk
count all of the things inside all the things dead or missing all the things breathing new life
"the past is so weak, malleable, subject to change based on who's doing the remembering  i won't have it"
the crazies are spreading
on days when i'm tired and you can see my skull through my fucking face
reality exists because i say it doesn't  i carry the weight of time
for better or worse i stretch my idiot shadow across the future
i'll join and be damned
"how much rope is enough rope to hang, baby"
like fools we still search for life and intelligence
put back on the disguise this idiot face
this is the lost dimension we were never meant to be found
gonna fucking explode in a wave  in a fucking squid wave
the beginning and the end drugs for sleeping drugs for dreaming
athena at the door
"plotting courses: lives, asteroids, hearts and escape routes"
over new berlin poisons raining in the upper atmosphere
we must adapt  this is life in the belly of the whale
but the hundreds of two foot tall little buddhas looking for a fight believe otherwise
headless my crown turns into a noose
"my spirit can take a punch or two but no more, baby... no more"
"it's just me, the birds and the ghosts"
"levitating, baby  i don't need anyone's permission to ignore gravity"
don't fuck this up down is down and up is up
i live with the terror of it
in my guts the terrible truths of rabbits with razor blades
we wear the color of extinction
the strangers we let wander around inside us
"lesser imps, angels and spirits flying down my throat"
the gift i can't give you the future the past
my face has begun to spiral
"i wish to be a giant, to stand astride the world and cry tears large enough to destroy cities"
hunted through the spirit world by the buffalo-headed girl  she has things to say that i don't need to hear just yet
here - where the sun drags the strange in its wake
the byproduct of a real boy
i don't know how to be less than a terrible person
to walk tall and kill everything in the valley - is that what you want
angles and points i am made of knives
come with me and we'll huff the great fucking eternal
wrapped my love in black started the car never looked back
a victim of peace
but it was hope i asked to share a grave with me
the smiling deathmask of the idiot king
"i, myself and the giant swinging space dick of god herself are birthing all new universes, baby"
all this rush to do and to be
queering the bent knife
alone in the house of fish and spine
"even a tree is free in its own way, baby"
on the golden return
built to die
"sleep now in my love, grey skies girl"
the dancing girl and all the rest of us all equal in the mud
two lives left
the knobs and dials are all painted on but the idiot chimp in my brain doesn't know the difference
bored? cut me open and watch fucking galaxies spill out
"well baby, none of me is real"
love me like i'm lost
discarded and destroyed by sunspots
erratic flights of butterflies chasing my idiot phantom
dead on the bathroom floor black and white tile ganesh with the elephant smile
some things are perfectly happy sharing a life with loneliness
"can you write a love story with one bullet left in the chamber, baby"
if it's gonna end let it end for us all
lurching into tomorrow into forever
i will learn no new things today
"tonight, night is an old lady settling her bones"
and so we begin to dig... and dig and dig and dig
the crime of being born on the prison planet
"we owe the worms and the dirt a debt, babygirl"
we are the ghost of man stumbling blindly behind the scenes
"the aimless rattling of galaxies through my hollow hollow skull, baby"
on this fine morning there are things in the trees screaming warnings
midnight of the jellyfish
these fuckers these monotheists
we'll have a fight with wrenches and hearts and time spent apart
mainlining the god monster
old crones  mandalas of teeth and bones
are you hurt lost have you breathed the graveyard dirt
took six whole steps before i realized i was dead
falling because that's what we do best
"we weren't bred with fucking angels, baby"
mister mediocre doing what little he can
come meet the all new all different end of all things
"trying to move but heavy is the weight, baby"
and our vengeance was terrible
the listless idiot dreams
fearful death
how will i destroy my enemies when my powers have become weak and inconsequential
doom doom doom the pharoah's in his tomb
chasing my baby running in the shadow of the asylum
"everything hurts and nothing lasts forever, right ?"
i've never been anywhere never seen more than a handful of stars in the sky
don't tell me about your day tell me about your life but not this one the next one
nothing but hollow shrines left on this toilet earth
the courage to dig to china
"no, i tell a disinterested universe"
"i will not be joining any of your boring revolutions, baby"
the horns we grow on the inside
sucked into the sky never to be seen again
sweet baby end times
a plague of tigers
shoving tentacles into the machine hoping for hope you know what i mean
"old prayers fade on the breeze, baby"
the threats of wild men
"do i read, live, play or die"
i'm not asking for saving
i have bent my considerable will towards destroying myself and everything else god saw fit to create
the bitter taste of time
indeterminate threats
"first over the cliff, mama"
ugly outside inside upside down
life with the other mutants in the belly of the beast
last sun left alive
grabbed a hold of something empty and futile
rain bullet brain
i can't maintain this it's all rage and blinding white light
like moses parting the red  fucking sea i feel the blade separate my skin
like love we swallow the stars burning and dying
no more thoughts they're all useless
crawling under the couch cushions fucking maniac style
"flat, out of sorts, i need a third dimension"
light a candle and forget i live
so empty
i write them all down the myths and lies of the idiot king
sunk to the bottom of the sea wrapped in chains of gold
lonely out here on the edge of her universe
i will never finish my thoughts i take no risks i make no art
mister adversity
welcome to earth hell division number one
woken from uneasy dreams
i have nothing to say no truth to hold
"to never see the stars, baby these are the wishes of fishes"
what's left but to curl up and fade away
that's all i got left drawing pictures of the goddamn sun
"trying not to scream my name with a fucking bullet, motherfucker"
would it have killed you to say i was beautiful
in the back of death's long black cadillac  sixteen bouncing demons and me
"tear a hole in the sky and bleed right through, baby"
i don't know what else to be so i'll try being brand new
watch the artificial boy with his artificial heart cry his little artificial tears
to crush what's left
eyes bleeding squeezed like a tentacle post
gone all over purple mary sunshine
dead in two days
fuck tomorrow and its ridiculous possibility
"the city will burn as we flee from the flames, baby"
to float in the endless
take no pride until you have been beaten
simple and reassuring we all pay in blood
songs of two-headed serpents
the escape pods have all been launched we have set this place to burning
take a bite of this rotten fucking universe birth death rebirth
in real life we fucking die
i won't give it up this little piece of night i hold in my hand
"simply running from the destroyer ain't enough, baby"
"fucking rocketship heartbreak love, baby"
tell the stories  bury the bodies
we come born of the great spinning nothing at the center of it all
prepare yourself  it's a long walk back from the land of the dead
soft lives in the kingdom of the idiot
this life this reboot a rotting corpse in an astronaut suit
"not now, baby i have become the jungle"
with dreams of neon drugs eternal
nothing's gonna change yet i watch the sun rise like an idiot
dying to surrender
dead girl dead girl where have you gone
what i touch i ruin
"please, baby  watch me die"
"quietly, from the bottom, this land will break"
ah the last recourse of the knife
"all fucked up and out of balance denied the golden ratio, baby"
withdrawing into my have never seen the light translucent cave lizard self
"the oracle, sucking on a nine volt dressed in a cherry blossom kimono, told me when i'll die when i'll live"
driven like a stake into the earth
unhinge your jaw and swallow my entire head this is how i wish to go
new routes  strange fruits holes in containment suits
speak to me as if i'm not a fool as if you love me
it's such a small thing you won't even miss it at all
useless old fears
to destroy the conquistadors
she needed a weapon i gave her a gift of my thigh bone
fucking with the god circuit
little spunky monkey shotgun junkie
"if i die on this path and my bones are scattered by wild animals please don't mourn, baby"
we play time's silly games two lovers in flames
found love in the middle of a firefight
i step into the mouth of the universe as the teeth chomp and chew
my spine twisted backwards
is this a fuse
standing clean
i can feel it high in the chest
jupiter caught in the throat
"lost, transformed, found and returned"
the soul bleeds for itself
my bones are too heavy my blood has begun to float gravity has long ago decided to tear me apart
of course it will hurt everything fucking hurts
"my daydreams are always violent, mama"
will we grow stronger and weaker in turns
baby's first thousand heartbreaks
do you see the sunflower girl singing on her wave
we live in the shadow of her sun
"behind our endless rush from disaster to disaster lies the chuckling void, baby"
what beautiful little couple togetherness and isolation
don't you know? god loves tramps
that crazy intangible knowing
whispering secrets into steel
the knuckle breaker
i don't know how much longer i feel like holding this shitty little planet in its orbit
we live in the shadows of tender touches
"we own a new fucking night now, baby"
road trips no maps no plan choose the juggler with bombs in his hand
"god is a fast bullet dodging motherfucker, baby we gotta be better"
"two lovers lost in the mist  hoping against hope what the fuck is left for us now, baby"
god i am an old house crumbling
"the snakes, my god the snakes"
we're not nearly strong enough are we
born mad spitting at the world
accidentally birthed a universe
embracing the nothingness that is my nature
dissected and catalogued for her tiny box collection
is this the street's reward? a goddamn golgotha in the middle of the highway?
"harsh will be our karma, baby"
like fools we hold the soul eternal
"on saturn's furthest ring lost, broken and everything i am the idiot king  and these are songs i sing"
"you can share when the sun shines just for me, baby"
maybe i am the end
goddamn legends of giant birds and all the things that burn
hold your breath tight as she passes by
on this path ruination
i swallowed chapter after chapter yet the bombs kept falling
we hunt giants
"coal black tears hoping for diamonds, baby"
here - where the piggies no longer smile
pirouettes under the bone tree
"we, the unbelievable"
kisses like electric death
it was almost like she used her beauty as a form of vengeance and my god was it fucking glorious
more and more and more we sit in the shade and hear the drums of war
"turn my life back on, mama"
two hearts zero g's
i can still hear the clicking the clacking of death's chattering teeth
it's her soft benevolence
"obsolete but fighting, baby"
we stand at the apex on the knife tip to either side oblivion
here lies the jack of clubs: lost before we were found
faster and faster we melt
now we have ghost flowers and everything has gone sideways in my fucking brain
carried to hell on the backs of swine
thoughts like fields being overrun by hordes of starving mice
"quietly though there are things in the ether, baby"
choking on god caught in my throat
"stone hearted robitussin dreams, babygirl"
but then again there's nothing left i believe in
the great and empty soothing sound
two hundred thirty two bones having desert spells
my thoughts are the enemy
a swift compression of normality
"forever in nothing, baby"
stars and feathers and sky we live forever on planets doomed to die
sad smiles a murmuration of deaths
grew up upside down reassembled the machinery learned how to die
we fractal and break
the little god is dead the priestess has fled see the clouds of dust  from the fallen spears  of runaway guards
the power's out and we're all bleeding
heaven feeling dirty inside
fast approaching zero hour
we tried to dance but with all the drugs adam did god decided that everything should be a sin
bloody lipped eternity
"divinity, that empty thing, made to destroy us"
twisted in sincerity
"cling closer to your rapture, baby"
the witches spin and sing  spin and sing  spin and sing
distortions of the idiot self
if you fail you will be forgotten - that is the threat the big scam
you can be yours and i can be mine caught rusting and wailing in time
you want flowers i want to change the rituals
driven mad as you stumble upon the pulse of the universe and your brain begins to throb in time
joy eater
run when i tell you to run
i miss being anything
the great zen nothing begins
abandoned on the wrong side of the airlock
when the absence meets the vacuum
the wait eternal
the truth of bullets of swords  of the spider's many eyes
maligned but god damn it was beautiful
here in time where the piggies try to steal your shine
i am the monster the malignant incursion from the dimension nextdoor
pulling fangs from maniacs
"soul blast shotgun, baby"
speak to me of true things of false things of things unsure
an imaginary man crumbles
"the truth just opens the door to a larger prison, baby"
maps of veins
collisions with the infinite tiger
swallowed by god  passed into an unknowing universe
the book of worms and the machines that eat men
it's a failure of ordinary men
exchanging bones under aluminum skies
envious of the sphere and its hollow nature
a breath held in anger
neurosis like armor  protecting against sinkholes and love and meteors falling from the sky
i scream as the sun vibrates in time
"these are the brutes that steal happiness, baby"
dancing right up to the edge knowing everything must end
i am the littlest turtle my shell too small to hide in
live long enough to become the monster
planet hopping  running from disaster and death
reborn fleet-footed
"i'll dig my own graves, mama"
"romanticizing your life as diana, from the mountaintop, fires her arrows into your back"
we are fluorescent creatures  heavenly in our regard
grown into other things
one cell at a time here's a fist and we're dying slowly
hurrying along the alien takeover with a plastic bag over my head
"finger gun magic aimed at my fucking head, baby"
even ghosts collide with the future
just an astronaut made of meat
fistfights  day-glo dreams on dead end streets
scavenging the last thoughts of an idiot
you have to live  i just have to not die
sorry but this ship is going down fast no lifeboats no escape pods just the big fucking crash
"nightmares on digital backup, baby"
sitting alone  persons unknown
on the path of doom
"the piggies will always find their war, darling"
the great brooding drudgery
my lies are for me
dying of time
deep down in your guts where the kisses mean everything
spent a night in hell with the ticking of the counterclockwise clocks
ordered the execution of the captain of the dream dispersal squad
counting bullets on the way to mary's heaven
"say something terrifying, baby"
i've seen it all before the music plays as the carousel spins eternal
"we've lost control of the simulation, babygirl"
the great shattering has begun
"no, said the traveler"
casualties of a world ending
can i eat the golden sun here on artemis road
i encompass all of the next dimension you step into - every space is me  you become me because everything is me here
small seas held in cups burned by my third eye
imaginary pasts and futures all co-mingling in a brain made of smoke
the impact of steel on bone the crack the crunch  eerily silent orbiting this far away star
tigers sing their secret songs while stalking through the sunlight now say it with me
and the just remain quiet
"i count escape routes, baby"
god in her heaven making a liar out of me
staked to the ground black and blue lost and found
birds fly because i ask them to
it's the hearts we let escape it's the sins we hold so dear
"i would wager the fight i have left, baby"
i am neither the hole nor its boundary - i am the empty space left behind - the absence
she came unexpectedly opened me up  carved her name on my bones
a man on the cusp i can be pretty or i can be happy
we lost the race last place we are the monkeys the queen shot into space
"no, for all is change"
fucking chrome
dig the heretic
we build skyscrapers around the bones of giants long dead
you can dance with my ghost
"uneasy sleep in the terrordome, baby"
chasing the ghost of hannibal across the alps only to be beat back again and again
all screaming no reading
your world is falling apart over a girl who smiles like i imagine razors smile
balanced deadly on the head of an angel
"see, heard and felt motherfucker, watch my bones melt"
"it's all fangs and claws when tigers write books, baby"
we dream in flames etched across the stars
come with me and we'll sing the songs of the maggots
godspeed you idiot future
i let fucking tomorrow crash right through me
"that bridge is gone  washed away, darling"
we swirl and dance through our million years of misfortune
"i was beautiful once,  i shone like the sun"
oh to be the last
"my first life, like all the others after it, was a failure"
i travel  i hold planets like seeds
"dying that's for tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, baby"
the artist escapes
only fools stay in their graves jesus saves  jesus saves
lazy in life and love
"tell god it's assault, motherfucker"
"i'll live with the knowledge, mama"
the memory of being of protons and electrons
i will survive with your fist in my skull you motherfucker
everything's nice shadow mice  shadow mice every goddamn thing is nice
all the ugly people live in the belly of the whale
time left broken from its cage
first comes love  next comes the bombs
"fucking devil girl, man"
"we grow our own little poisons, baby"
"she is the weird, growing strange"
pretty boys pretty girls  all marching with the destroyer
the dreamer diminishes as time grows stronger
less than less than
i am the idiot god whispers her secrets to
ignore my ascent
"i have crashed my kingdom into the sun - no more will titan, the last moon of saturn, be a sanctuary for man"
"all the brutes know the sky has already fallen, baby"
disembodied dreaming
"the devil, disguised as the serpent, wraps himself around my spinal cord and begins to constrict"
we are the jellyfish men beautiful mindless dangerous
drawing maps in the dirt of how i imagine cities to be
fell in love with your dissent  - your descent
"that bitch, that darling of the sun, she left before the night had begun"
"that clock don't fucking tick, y'all"
as empire falls and we're torn apart the theory of the hollow heart
"no, i won't give you my last five minutes before the day begins"
i will be king of the west
the great numbing
you must know both your time and place in the universe if you wish to travel safely
we've come to expect decay
make no art
"i will know you by the things you are willing to sacrifice, she said"
rubber thoughts
setting fire to the bed just to be free
crumbling castle walls new drugs in old bathroom stalls wake up to the bird's  piercing calls
i stand lonely
the revolution will be internalized
there was only two ways fifty fifty
when you ask fucking heaven about the tasting menu
outclassed and falling fast
red lights and old man outlaw thoughts
you need the fight
my copy of liberation
"stars that end, of course"
all the rage of aphrodite in her cage
obliterate the self just stick the goddamn blender straight into my fucking brain
we have begun moving faster than time
a life brought round
"gather up all your loose atoms and molecules  we're changing the paradigm, baby"
following the path of the golden ratio hoping to meet god hoping to stab him for what he's done
sanctuary little spoon sadness
there are swans in my skull jet black and strange
"i'm high, five thousand feet tall and bored as hell"
her blood red smile
one must be daring if one wishes to hide fron god's eye and hunt the leviathan
be like the wasps that buzz in the brain of the artificial boy
exploding into mist  the jungian way
the wretched and the few
"watch my ghost dance, fucker"
oh what horrible things we'll learn about ourselves today
"watch me carry my fucking cross, baby"
i don't want to think of real things i want to swallow the fire and transform
"alone in the universe i, the king of titan  last moon of saturn"
the world's still spinning round and round the ship's still sinking
i marched with cesar and mourned when the time to mourn came
these are the doldrums  where everything is too heavy too hot takes too long
"it's a sacrifice of strength, baby"
the earth is a prison gravity its chains my baby the warden i am all that remains
woke up to the luxury of the cage  all warm velvet haze
this day all fraud and false smiles
this is the star i'll die under over and over again
"clothos, you mad bastard"
violence as therapy
the only art i wish to see is what you imagine the end to be
i'm drowning and god herself is looking for a fight
where the dull hold sway
"that's a rabid sort of forgiveness you're offering there, baby"
maniacs and quantum entanglements: if it's not them it's definitely fucking you
"pick a life and destroy it, mama"
the old king of carthage set his son a mission blind our enemies and hide us from their vision
the gospel of bones the three-headed idiot
my last words will be horribly misunderstood and when i get to hell played on a loop for all eternity
routine radio messages answered by madness
"these are the things i know: fast cars, riots and acid rain"
the patron saint of idiot calamity
"i was a seahorse once, briefly"
time is a tyrant  a monster come to devour us all
i am all rust and ruin  the boy no one hugs
were we born unholy and destined for redemption or did we fuck that up too
don't worry i'll just bleed
living recklessly in the shadow of oblivion
"we'll steal all the fucking time we need, baby"
screams from the cheap seats
because you make hideous choices
my fucking skull is hollow  a portal to nowhere
i even ate the last holy man on the mountain
you sleep through the tiny incisions you wake up to the seeds i inserted erupting into life
"we hunt angels with weapons that aren't up to the task, baby"
broken bones and sticks bullets and bricks
take care with yourself it's become so easy to be lost
"i am an idiot soldier of man, baby"
"whatever, i won't watch you rot"
this form is the cell
"god, that motherfucker,  nothing but strings and restraints today"
quiet now that you're here
gotta ditch the monkey  he's bringing me down
blackhole drive through
holding handfuls of the destroyer
"collapsing is easy i am the rubble, man call me what you wish"
"our swords are dull, sacred and useless but what's left but survival, darling"
"hold your breath  we're sinking, baby"
they left you holding the knife didn't they
been telling the mountain stories of escape
beautiful  en pointe on the knife's edge
i make no excuses for the large grey owl that lives in my third eye
we age slower while we're crashing
of course i'm the goddamn villain
make the fucking universe apologize
the bullet eater
the great manifestation has begun
"it's not a failure of convictions, baby"
"saving strangers, aliens and angels"
standing mad with my skull facing the wind
all are destroyed as she moves through space to be closer to me: the darling of the sun
"i have become all new angles, sharp corners and points"
endless loops  stick-up kids robbing jesus on the weekends
out come the beasts
drew the last card the final card the queen of hearts the bill comes due for your sins
the idiot king's machinations
"say nothing if you mean it, motherfucker"
we've eaten the natives
final form brain rot
i sing the betrayal
i love you the most all my bones strung up on the lamppost
"just a last place motherfucker in a fast paced world, baby"
screaming in my ears like devils are whispering secrets about me
under the sun with the woman eternal
tiger tiger in the sky
choking on the divine
"we won't even die free, motherfucker"
"i'm tired of these wars these empty battles but baby, there are monsters in the suburbs"
ignore the spirit leaking from my shotgun slumbers
woke up surrounded by the sea... calm and tranquil yet somehow still foreboding with an air of menace
she smiles like death smiles
"we'll stand back to back and we'll be fucking catastrophic, baby"
lungs full of arrows and time left alone
collisions with the infinite
a split from the dead as the rest of me walks on
just a tragic son of a bitch lost in a tourmaline haze
will you take care for me
upside down drug red days
sweet sugary bombs and artillery
you see me dangling from the rings of saturn but you don't save me you don't even try
c'mon we're gonna spring aphrodite from her cage
barefoot girls and boys who explode into jellyfish
i don't understand time zones or broken bones or nights spent all alone
"get in, the dead are getting faster"
we hear the ticking and think of forevers
the mutation snuck in quietly when i wasn't looking
old tools for new wars
"i splash blood across the galaxy and she smiles, baby"
couldn't shake the fist of god
gave my tears idiot names
when we worship  the dance  the destroyer  the unforgiving nature of forever
kill this animal
steal the past
all the truth you'll ever need to know is that god doesn't love you
forcing gravity to manifest itself so that i may kill it
i do what i do because this is hell and we're all here
you see my ribcage half buried in the dirt missing my heart it doesn't even hurt
"it's the inherent violence of my nature, baby"
love the maniac who stops as you hitchhike along god's long ass fucking highway
sadness is so simple
pink sky boys
the discipline of fucking still being alive i guess
ask god what the fuck he's got to say now
shocked that the buzzsaw i swallowed is tearing me apart
first over the line is for saints and crazy people
"sunny days for coffin cutters, baby"
the future was mine to give
death in rewind
turn and walk away leave only oblivion
"the heart runs with revolutionaries, baby"
she laughed as i bent down to wash her feet
my body in forever  in repose and riot
if you're dead inside swallow your pride go with death when that fucker wants to ride
"would you like the wind to blow or the grass to grow? ask, baby... just ask"
pandemonium blood spout
the ballad of multidimensional jenny
the great break is coming and we stand directly in its path
everything burns and nothing is quiet
acid and fire for my heart burns
"bored, tired and on the run"
flowing through the ghosts of cities the goddess of the river searches for me
i've traveled far i've met the last dreamer  it doesn't end well
"empty stories going nowhere, baby"
you bend down to peer through the hole in my chest only to come face to face with the magdalene and her gun
folding reality back upon itself i discover something new
did we fuck up and tell the phoenix in its ashes that everything hurts and nothing ever gets better
manipulation of the dream visitor
red hot and forgotten
"inside me, where the kingdom of the spider queen lies, a strange sort of change comes"
the end of the great warping
we three in syzygy  in love in hate in exuberance
i will eat up all your joy
crushed by waves robbing graves fuck it jesus saves
that rattling sound you hear is just my hollow skull filled with bullets
no new beginnings same old endings
"a lifetime, the sentence of an idiot"
hey fucker - let's hunt god
these fucking libertines setting the night to screaming
snakes fall from my lips
"escape by ones and twos, baby"
will you take my place as beloved of the moon
all we have left is bullets
what a foolish thing is hope
i will gift you my head - severed from the shoulders
ask me and i'll summon a forest for you
hooray! work work work die die die
"i am the bone man aging, shrinking till there's nothing left but shadow"
a thousand eyes all blind
oh god i wish to be the last monkey left in space
to have no memories to wake up each morning brand new to tell the world fuck you before you lie down to sleep and forget
should i ask the sun to shine for you
"we all live in the nothing, baby"
the great disappearing
even the clouds fled from my rage
a vicious need to destroy the future
this man is shrinking  soon to be no more
in my memory you were electric
i don't care about the border between this world and the next - i care about the border between this world and the last
where's the gimp monster
"you won't be saved for we offer no safety, baby"
the mind knows repetition is what kills
"i dreamt you into being you...with all your hope, joy, rage and sorrow"
you live lives i can scarcely comprehend
the ten of clubs mister predictable  born old  bought but never sold
his color was golden but that's all faded now
the vibe is the dirt the pig god screaming his defiance
"it's a fucking galaxy wide crime spree, mama"
the five of clubs just know i owe you nothing
the universe expands because that's how i wish it to be
mush brain
"let the fucking bombs fall, baby  i'm ready"
i am the idiot king and my disciples are many
says the folded man
is this what we're left with? no heart just ache?
"i have no purpose other than to bleed please drop an ocean on me, baby"
her white knuckle smile
dreamt of a girl who used to be
we just go and go and go never stopping  we've forgotten how to die
"one daring leap, baby  that's all"
this is the slow time
storming the gate with the omniscient one-celled being who rules the 85th dimension
it's the two of hearts:  the ache of a skull too small
"it's a hard truth, baby  we live we die we multiply"
close your eyes take my hand step into traffic
please god i have failed every test just let me rest
the twisted shape of things at their end
"no, her prayers are simple"
"mine are disco dynamite, baby"
i wish i wish i wish  to live life as a burden
it's a thought that rattles endlessly through my head i'll be beautiful when i'm dead
i have no home no vacancies for my vagrant bones
"dance with her evil smile, baby"
impossible to carry on in the shadow of the thunderhead
never felt more small or radioactive or hard to touch
born in an accident a head on collision at a hundred miles an hour
put here to rot
one day bleeds into the next no epiphanies no new revelations
fancy and free all new wounds for the world to see
"god, with her dirty feet"
our will as shaped by machines
the fundamentals have changed the rules have been rewritten my god who are we now
tranquility is a myth  a fucking fable written by a goddamn madman
hiding in the dark heart of the suburbs
when the saviour is reborn as a honeybee an octopus a lonely kid swinging by himself
no. we're all going to burn
"time is a monster, a tiger in the tall grass and eventually it's gonna eat you up, babygirl"
i'm dead i said i read
the aura is a chain an ever tightening spiral
i will neither go over nor under the mountain instead i will demand the mountain moves
"things get forgotten in this temple, baby"
notes from future engagements
when i'm feeling brave i compliment the beauty in her anger
made a wager with the fire against my soul
this is a crime
second sleep the idiot sleep
all life is an explosion
snipping ligaments
life is for losing
describe yourself as symmetrical and move on
my next life will be brief
"it's ok, you can go now"
stand toe to toe with her gladiator soul
new vices are not always easy  huffing ozone and machine static  mainlining a high-pitched keening
i am the cause and the effect new stars are born inside of me
missing hours skull flowers
"we live halfway to paradise, baby"
i am the drain
slipped through the spirit world on a mission of war
"the time between your eyes seeing and your brain comprehending is where the monsters live, baby"
i'm not the hero
we did but let the machines run rabid
"hollow skull blues, baby"
dear god murder one
"of course, a breeze blowing madness"
an embarrassing need to breathe
the truth of her
"by my will the mountain inverts  rests on its point its new geometry? perilous, motherfucker"
just a snake's idiot truth
it's the nine of diamonds: your son will choose his own path
naming rockets for the magdalene
"the problem, god damn it, is your spells lack conviction"
invisible in delirium
i will think of nothing  that is what i will do for tomorrow for the entirety of the day
i have every thought a million fucking times before it's gone
we sell launch codes empty roads  rocks with rivers to erode
prolific failure
long after the sun has burned out and i'm alone and cold
mere moments from disaster
making an honest man of the rope
my idiot sky
"i'll be the fucking stick-up man who robs god, baby"
i was dead before i knew it
a knife and the easing of the sacraments
cursed daydreams of flowers and bones of flowers and bones my god we're all alone  all alone
"drowning is the easy part it's learning to breathe again that's hard, motherfucker"
angry at a smile she set her armies upon the field
lay down my head i relearn to breathe
fist-sized ants in my fucking spinal fluid
god shouted her luminous fist
the pulses behind the eye projects the dream onto the firmament
the desert is the desert because i made it so
she passed through me on the way to some other dimension
walking blindly through this kingdom of fools
arming the heathens
"audacious monuments to failure, baby"
"baby, i swallowed the seeds hoping for flowers but all i got were ghosts"
i can't live under the weight of my own white hot rage it's going to destroy me
to be the beloved of ugly days
i asked the sky and it fell just for me
pretty faces and arms races afraid of paperwork the piggies took my laces
the wake up came harsh and insincere
i gotta pull my skin off molt or melt or change or die
"we fluctuate wildly around here, mama"
go ahead and drill your hole my fucking skull is filled with butterflies
velocity unaccounted for
your hand bitter in mine
"unfortunately, the dead see me too"
the vibe slipped under the door promising knife fights and madness
i know too much today
bury me head down  vertical  feet to the sky
red island dreams
i am the sun in an ungrateful universe bask in my fucking glory
every conceivable inch is filled with ghosts - they're pressed up against you right now - front back side to side top and bottom
throwing rocks at saints
"sympathy at the last huh, baby"
my idiot fate
post-apocalyptic chic
dragged screaming to the end
"today, i chose the hammer"
lacking the courage to hang from your cross
each heartbeat a lie we tell the sun
floating serenely four feet off the ground  dragging golden chains
down in the guts where smiles are remembered
everything was fine once i started to bleed
the escape pods have all been launched is this the first reincarnation or the last
brutal in the moment
we let the vampires in
but we're in space all the time these are the fucking cities we made among the stars
the great babble
sunday mornings and i know even from the grave i'm faster than death
for fear of retrieval i set the stones to guard
no one has ever called me beautiful
we summoned the destroyer without making a sound
i will absorb you
god is in her heaven and the thieves are stealing time
"disappeared into the hardest goddamn rain i've ever seen, baby"
"i sensed your would be killers, your hunters as soon as they crossed the boundary of my empire"
still the last death you'll know how
i am abandoned
we used to kill legends
behind me bethlehem burns
last of the monkey men
my dreams have gone strange this world will flood liquid reckoning  no fucking arks this time
cynicism kids
beloved of the moon yet ignored by her children
everything is so much louder when you're going insane
feral mutants from the stars
"there are no plans in place that ship has sunk, baby"
today i am a fractal forest spinning into infinity
all new machinery for this break down boy
a day in the vice
this monster eats hopes
"these are terraform drugs  go ahead and make a home, motherfucker"
my brain is sludge a tourist attraction come see the sabretoothed tigers trapped for millennia
tomorrow has no song  it's all desperate illusion
i am gravity's bitch held here like flowers beautiful and fleeting
to strangle the impulses of the idiot
the queen of clubs may have been forgotten but she knows all one hundred and one ways to kill the king
stories of lovers and maniacs both
i'll breathe when i'm alive
we're weak we fail it's in our nature our destiny by default
take comfort in the galaxy i swallow
i only want to live in terror
i slept  i dreamt i met strength with strength
the goddamn whales have come falling from the sky don't ask why oh don't ask why
"sometimes i pray for a nuclear calamity  but small, contained - single serving if you will"
"it doesn't get better but somedays it doesn't get worse, baby"
do nothing and you'll survive this
"i can feel the bonds of my atoms failing - neutrons, protons, fucking electrons scattering off into the cosmos"
trying to remember that i make the grass grow
"we die a million little deaths everyday, babygirl"
i'm not an honest man... honest men die first
"count the wounds not the knives, baby"
my golden honey bee girl singing her song just for me
sweet summer child we'll pass along this path together
"the chariot sits broken helios, slain in his temple"
"i'll hold my breath until god comes and fucking takes me, baby"
a gift of horrors easily counted
snarling like the future will never come
of course life has made an asshole of me
"the death of rabbits, in his little black robe, reminds me that i'm still only human"
i live against my will
you may take any bone you wish to fashion the weapon of your choice
what are we now if we were a fire
mouth held shut for what for what for what
all fucked up and everywhere to go
we met in a meadow lost with no idea where to go
"trajectory? straight down, motherfucker"
"i died on determination road, baby"
here we go again this hell of faithless men
the little devils of the morning
but nothing is real
saving all our sins we're buying up eternity
everything burns on the long and winding road of the idiot
who we are when we're forced to survive
as long as anyone can remember nothing has been ok
turned too far inward
where the tiny trees grow the little gods live
"we're not obligated to live, baby"
"giant fucking statues of the twisted, broken and insane"
make it awful... spectacularly so
that's how we run just for fun black dots on the sun
"falling free angels, bombs and me"
that's how we live: dreams just out of reach
death season
born a headless heartless idiot
suicidal birds daring the car at fifty miles an hour
"here is the card i was given: the sad girl, the breaker of things"
"speaker, speak of thyself and nothing more"
crushed between clouds
"i'll forgive the sky but not fucking tonight, toots"
debutantes and killers both
like seven thousand goddamn bastards
not enough bullets for the whole hosts of heaven
to join the treacherous being chewed in the head
blood neon
the imaginary satellites of my soul
"bury me face down in the sky, motherfucker"
"there's nothing you can do when the tiger is always waiting, baby"
the cusp  mister not quite  the eight of spades sounds about right
her violent goings
down and down under the ground birth and death  around and around
here's my fucking mantra: i won't let the scum see me cry
i can't feel an escape
i did but dream as the queen became pregnant with the universe
"the vibe is close, heavy and humid like maggots under the skin"
telling stories to spiders
a million different paths to madness
yeah but they're carved into my bones these foolish notions of love
the ever-failing machinery of the artificial boy
"any one thing stretched to infinity is hell, baby"
just a who's who of non-playable characters and background radiation
"now, why did that hurt so much"
the toll of the survivor
we are the four of hearts:  the desperately left behind
life bends back upon itself
like all the best stories the king dies before he can breach the gate
at the base of the tree  why won't these roots  overtake me
disguised as the sun
we're at our best with fists raised with weapons drawn
you may have what of me you can hold
"take my fucking rib before you go, baby"
we ask for little we ask for more here come the piggies all dressed for war
it's the struggle i dig life's ridiculously incomprehensible battle
my wish is to become still  a tree frozen in the desert
fuck a dead heart
once upon a time i was an idiot with idiot thoughts who wondered why her magic wasn't as frail as mine
mistaken for lost
vomiting seahorses into the rain... prepare yourself
a slow night in oblivion
left a future on the alter of the virgin
this is a day of pigs
we can bleed like strangers
i will blind your spies and crush your assassins... force you to confront your failures
"i have no talent for dreaming, baby"
that headlong rush of the pavement coming up to meet you
i flew only to land i flowered only to die
whose life am i running for
"we did naught but scatter their graves, baby"
"goddamn saturnalia, baby"
dragging myself from the night from the crash from yesterday's potential
in the wastes  heavy-lidded and insane
"love blooms red, distant and terrifying"
the sunsets are mine  my gift to you
"we waltz and we make war and honestly, what else is there"
"fix me with your violence, baby"
hold out for the asylum
dreams of girls in golden fields
we hold to the five of diamonds: the demarcation the shadow of the terminator
we all walk blind through this illusion of normalcy
sharing an idiot grin with death
thoughts of fast cars and last stands
"remember those desperate days on the run, baby"
life's manic rush is breaking my mind
did and dreamed
this falling rocket no seatbelt life
i learned
"no, it's not supposed to do that... it's supposed to destroy you"
drew a new card: the queen of spades fall in love with the idea of dying
inverted i see the future inside
time is a beast  a fucking monster running roughshod  neither arrows nor spears will pierce its thorny hide
what does remorse choose
well that's great we are the poison rain the lake you can not touch
i live in these small hurts these tiny grievances
accept the patronage of a madman: the drugs are better
"i am made of strength, baby"
maintain radio silence goddamn
take a deep breath open your eyes join the idiot illusion
we will be the plague that spreads across the cosmos
eat whole the divine as we tarry long in time
"i should know, baby god only speaks to lunatics"
i am the forest  forever learning here is something new the discriminant
maybe if i'm lucky i'll get to choose my death
idiot fables for idiot boys
we dance on the edge of battle it's the death rattle rattle
"come closer, watch me not make it"
to transform to become the monster that swallows rivers
"we are the nine of spades: androids, engine failure, last to come home when the streetlights come on"
"we say hallelujah but we don't mean it, baby"
another day of pointless worship
let patience fork
when your blood slows down  the six of clubs the periphery the proxy the man on the side
a portrait of ruin and disaster
and to think: you could've lied
so much goddamn beauty everywhere i'm broken on its shores
"make small stupid art, motherfucker"
sticking a knife into the two-headed monster of fate
"all truth is malleable, baby"
sometimes... i... i just don't understand
covered in monuments and newly birthed herds
this is the law of consumption
here's where things start to hurt
this is the tipping point  the moment where we stop and circle back around again
i see the storm and the empty tangle of your lives
but then again you gave this idiot free will
the blue skies fade prepare to jump
"it's ok, her arrows never miss"
"i'm not hanging around all day in this dimension , mama"
"more monoliths, giant stone heads and pyramids"
what if the one was two was six was a million
wishes and fishes  apostles and fools
the test for humans
now i have to pay for your sins
"i'm sorry, baby  the time for immortals has passed"
all new all different yet exactly the fucking same
pretending to be ghosts
old women their powers esoteric  come to me in dreams whispering warnings and sweet nothings
"we live through memory, baby  memory, that supremely untrustworthy bastard"
the legend with bleeding eyes
we'll trade forevers even steven
each heartbeat an atomic clash
twisted strange
"i'm sorry we threw both you and the tiger into the well, baby"
nothing loves you take solace in that
vomiting mysteries empty and futile
distractions from life's endless rust
something far different and far stranger than the original
today we will be the king of diamonds: the pretender the almost was
aging slowly but horribly  a graceless monster melting
we leapt from a tower that never really existed
the piggies want no survivors
it's the knot's prayer for you
i stand in awe at the nature of her violence
"listen up, fucker we live under powerlines we pay no taxes we pay no fines"
"i will match my strength against your assassins anytime, baby"
eat the mystics
my mind lies chained to its inevitability
you catch me asking if i'm gonna die
"with each stupid predetermined step it gets worse for us all, baby"
"can't sleep the nine and four of clubs the twins, the steady decline"
last of the wild horses
fragments and failings
the child who grew up to be an idiot
alone in a very empty room
mister extinction
"my shape a trapezoid a twisted fucking cube  baby, i'll fight the goddamn oracle just because i'm bored"
"it's the seepage, baby"
do you understand the strides of giants  can you look and see the path they left behind
eaten alive like god intended
now tomorrow never my time in the great weird beyond
when hell stands stranger
woke up and my bones are wrong  what's left is now right what's right is now left
name a life after a monster
"lost now, the artificial boy doubts his existence"
the song of my old splintered bones
guilty we walk under the sun
what do the piggies want today who can say who can say  knives and razors  come what may
sacrifices will have to be made
i have been lost but never kind
with a shy smile the empress demands your fucking head
dead in jersey reborn in psychedelic neon tokyo
"there's a certain elegant beauty in being the last, baby"
this is the seven of hearts incandescent rage and redemption
simple graveyard cool
is your fucking brain tectonic does it shift and move around
a passing rumble in the streets the trials of morning
i am so weak a misappreciation of scale tiny sea monsters magnified and terrifying
what's left but ashes of the crown
i turn my eye upon a disinterested sky
a kaleidoscope of sounds painting my guts television red
"we can't run fast enough it's all time and tide, baby"
i have become static
the rules of an unknowable universe
but for the adoration of man
i am a million degrees radioactive ready to melt through the atmosphere
been thinking about wavelengths bullets: silver and brass
loving nothing but the end
from shore to idiot shore
"i can no more blame the fire, baby"
send in the infiltrators
"time, that irrepressible bastard"
can't breathe for fear of these clouds
"to be human is to care, i suppose"
think of the jellyfish of the abstract
"it's the only song death knows, baby"
marched to war in golden chains
"all one thousand of my eyes have opened, motherfucker"
floating alone through space with no reason to mourn
"drew a card: the four of spades the hard pass, the dry earth, the maybe some other day"
and all the piggies say...
you're never alone  ask the worms to dance
to begin is to suffer
don't talk unless we're about to die
"the distance between hearts, time and memory"
hazy lazy wasteland days
slept with the moon call me the sea
destroy it all who cares we are alone in this universe
alone i have eaten of the forest its roots and canopy all
my idiot alchemy
a million years of mirrors and mazes
empty because that's how the fuck it's supposed to be
we are the hunter dying on the trail of dionysus
love lies faking  i am the dam and it's breaking i am the dam and it's breaking
are you the tear or the last paper doll in the row falling away
i am the disaster man no contingency no plan
thrown to the rabbits
in your little secret heart where the sea sits stagnant
as long as someone else bleeds this is my fight this is my song
you really are a faithless thing aren't you
asshole time
it's a sunny day and we all die slow
blew my fucking brains out the airlock
"i just smile and tell my little lies, baby"
a big stupid empty planet just for me
my virgil
who will lead me to heaven so i can spit in god's eye
beasts of the modern world
conforming to the rabbits
harsh is the chain
buried alive like it's the most natural thing in the world
your eternal reward in one drop of blood
"there's still a little pile of bones in my broken hamster wheel heart, baby"
when i'm not me phantom body syndrome
"i am a rocketship a one way ticket the fuck outta here, baby"
left alone we walk in madness
"we are intergalactic space monkeys and this is our fucking prison, baby"
drew the five of hearts: named for the terrible dawn
we pretend and that gives it meaning
everything is old is new is dead
a conspiracy of life
i am the idiot king  the lost clown the trap instead of the crown
i asked for a favor for a boon yet that bastard sun still shines
sometimes i remember and sometimes i forget loyalty is rewarded by the knife
"no justice when the godhead is a whore, baby"
she's got teeth wicked and sharp
lost in a haze of time we the somnambulist
my flaws are magnified sanctified by her glory
you be you and i'll be me and she'll be the destroyer
wishes in color and time
squid eyes tentacles in my brain
i will make of myself his enemy
this is the crater the crash site i've made my home
when you love nothing and no one the distance between planets becomes inconsequential
pay for my heart with salt and gold
"make war for me, baby"
let's try something new white picket fences and green grass lawns are for the weak breakout
drowning in slow motion in stop motion in claymation
"the future is unknowable because i decided that's how it should be, motherfucker"
"just fucking trust falls and graves, baby"
"when your baby is a straight razor, a forest witch, a holy messenger bent on destruction"
"there's no dance to set this world right, baby"
my ghost misery
let it rain knives
this is the eight of clubs: bury it deep
listen up fucker: i planted the only tree in the spirit world
monitoring the situation as pigs fall from the sky
mister meaningless time
these being the offerings of an artificial boy
"i'm tired of these same roads, baby"
"we slumber under the cool earth the worms, the old tigers and me"
omnivorous and impotent is the great maw of progress
here lies the idiot king accused and forgotten here's the song  now sing
here's fate finding a motherfucker who didn't step far enough sideways
i've run out of forevers
a sucker's life
i don't believe in much but i believe in silence
"this is the six of diamonds the forest, the act of forgetting,"
splintered and splintering
would you trade the knife for tomorrow's small casual cruelties
a universe of violent acts made small
i have become several different dimensions today none of which i wish to be
unlearning  ghosts of rabbits burning
becoming less than chaos
hiding with the slow spirits of stone
a wager of dreams and gold
the weirdness of the deep dark
how do you pretend you're not on fire
little bombs little bombs
"madness, under god"
this is the jack of clubs guilty in his hesitation
conditions of disintegration
"dropping out of orbit due to sheer boredom, baby"
spells of simple becoming
"baby, your inner being is a horror show"
fluffy and white like death is a cloud
black sky bone white
"but baby, i'm an unreliable narrator, you gotta know that"
we are the dreamer the sleepwalker and this is our reality
this fucking simulacrum  where we pretend at life
open your skull wide and breathe
"this is the three of clubs the bastard, free and unafraid"
my neon messengers
mister predetermined
"can't touch me  all my fucking molecules are right and in a row, baby"
i sat bold under the sun as death's eye slid right by
"we'll dance like whores in eden, baby"
eyes like a hammer blow fucking up my whole life
"listen, you dumb son of a bitch, we have to maintain at least some form of idiot honesty here"
poetry like fucking wasps laying eggs in my brain
"of course i'm a liar, mama the lies begin at sunrise but you already knew that"
"fucking whispers along the ether, baby"
woke up raw under the gaze of her guillotine eyes
i remember your rituals
place the stone upon my chest let my bones fail gravity's test i am a hideous sewer mutant and that's what's best
"this is the two of diamonds: life, roots and a place to hide"
just like the fucking sunset we're all trapped in her sorrow
"this bomb is love's great rebellion, baby"
truth and fear are the easy parts
sing the song cosmic
"every breath is flies when your brain is rotting fruit, baby"
a riot of unrecognizable thoughts
i will walk through today all static and blind eyes
the idiot king of this idiot planet
making deals with the knot
a squid in the cold breeze
let me put it another way:  there is nothing for me under the ground
reborn soft and far from here
i will devour the spirit world and grow larger
a million fucking years and i'm still finding ancient cave paintings in the belly of the leviathan
the finale will be swift and brutal
"stand, face her trials and be free, motherfucker"
ride hard these phantom horses
we're the last of our kind tombstone pills
"like a lover we hold tight to our rage, baby"
teaching the rabbits the knife
you can run and run and run but you will be found by the queen of the sun
"mocked by zues, who said i'll never be beautiful, i explode into a forest"
"gift me new visions, motherfucker"
"aw baby, we all see the sky is falling"
to be lost
transformed or the last to be brand new
you weren't supposed to be anything... close your eyes and forget
stealing streets and the places you live
it's not the pain of the tiger's claws in your back it's the goddamn audacity
loneliness the six of spades a ship lost at sea
when you dream of me dream of me on fire
it's like the turing test but for idiots
"blow your enemies a kiss then destroy them, baby"
soft when i need to be
it's too late now but i didn't want to forget
why is it my responsibility to be
priests of the empty temple
a luck back to life
when she crossed my name out of the book of her dead
beauty enough to smash my face into a wall
the mister imperative
between the here and there i am the bridge i am the crumbling
burning out unnecessary molecules wondering what i'll become when the process is done
"eventually, we all go down with the ship"
put on a show  put on a show little showman motherfucker put on a show
to be both expanding and decaying
it's the magic that breaks bones
"it's just the unkindness of the human condition, baby"
hostile and indifferent this is where planets are born
the walls? miles high
"baby, it's been a while since we were indestructible"
"it's your finest miracle, babygirl"
love's small detonations
it's a predilection
her simple shadow and a prediction of doom
if i open my third eye everyone dies
"we'll alter orbits on a whim, baby"
the world tipped sideways the ten of hearts the devil's deal
taking the long way around peeling pieces of myself away
six beats per minute
i'll be the broken mirror before anything else
a waltz to the strange
"we can't go we can't stop baby, the bombs are gonna drop"
"choose the lie that suits you, baby"
that's what you get: sunshine destroyer
"chin up, baby  death is everywhere"
time to close my eyes and join the march of the blind
"woke up and found i had drawn a card: shadow mice, madness"
"will i die? someday  but not today, motherfucker  not today"
nothing no beginnings no endings
there are fucking monsters in the cartilage of my useless bones
i am imperfect
in the goddamn skull of zues where nothing ever happens anymore
now bleed
"heaven sent you an idiot, baby"
the cliff's edge  the great drop that's where we live now
we change and change and change the false eye of the future
it's insane that we die without this ball of fire in the sky
"goddamn tyrants, mama"
"what do i have to offer? a sword with no edge and bullets with no target, baby"
alone for the moment so i speak to the world
this will be a day for horrible truths
take your idiot breaths
the past is a mirage the future is a wasteland only the glorious now remains
in a different place and time i opened my mouth for popes and polar bears to fall out
with just one wish i would exchange your bones for mine
it's the violence promised in her smile
"it's a life of apathy, baby"
"this the motherfucking present tense, baby"
a belief in quiet things
such is the challenge of the buffalo-headed girl
these are time traveling drugs windows into the past drugs  who you used to be drugs
the tiger doesn't ask the jungle for forgiveness the tiger just is
trapped in hell god's fucking redemption
life is a fucking monster  a people eater
"drew the five of clubs: the lonely card, play it and move on"
a savage need to be away away from these people these places
somewhere out there is penance
slept for a while with the tree growing from my chest
you looked at me like i wasn't carrying a desert in my pocket
this little bit this tiny little bit this just enough to drown in
her gift was time too much or never enough
set free by her rain song
dear god set your idiot child free
"consciousness offline motherfucker, we're running blind"
hot as fuck death bleached white
bones broken and set to heal in all new shapes
"i grow weary of the dreams, babygirl"
leave your fucking teeth in the wood
lightning: spine-trapped and raging
"chaos in the valley, mama"
"a bullet: lake shaped, sun-dappled and serene"
made of tendons strung too tight
"reach into my fucking chest and pull out saturn, baby"
the big empty cosmic void in the center of my skull has begun to pulse with an ominous painful light
in the hole i dug we had a riot
follow me down down down the idiot king in the cardboard crown
who'll be the impossible girl's summertime flower
made of brass and wire my veins in knots
a vibration of bones
"drew a new card: the nine of diamonds, the teacher lost to their rituals"
"this is how the fuck i live liars, wizards and charlatans"
"what little mercy the rope holds, baby"
planet screaming neon green nothing nothing in between
of course you think the girl with horns is your escape plan
"to step free into open space, baby"
we sit and we dream for the sun is the enemy
we hide the sacred idiot in the folds of flowers in the design of the turtle's shell
i sing to the seeds but they don't hear
out of wishes the monkey paw is a fist
i live in the small places the idiot places
my mathematics are off  fucked a thing with too many legs
in my head we dance to monster screams
what i can't burn the universe perpetuates
"smile for the ghosts, baby"
"drew a new card: the four of clubs ,the lost man, the forest"
an inmate of time's slow prison
the manifestation of death laughing
"i don't understand, said the sleepwalking man"
"made strange from the inward journey, baby"
the next automated rebirth
the inner machine sputters to life cranking along to its own idiot anthem
fuck you mister three dollars to turn back time
"i swallowed raw the mountain and birthed a pyramid baby, let's take another shot"
to be brand new
goon life
a conspiracy of trees
mankind's idiot fate  together crushed by the pressure
so much older than i was this morning  the destroyer has come to give me his kiss
fuck your sunny days and your blue sky rage
"i am the nothing that matters, baby"
hush now the pigs have begun their march
wake up my soul rippled
"no body no crime, my love"
believe until there's nothing left
"what the fuck would you do with redemption, toots"
easy living between the tiger's jaw
futures carved in bone
"reality bent because i fucking told it to, baby"
"to live, fight and die for nothing at all"
skips and static are what you get when you let an idiot be the guardian of your heart
"haven't taken a breath in years, baby"
corpse boy corpse boy  singing little corpse boy
i'll slide through today like a shadow hoping no one notices
i worship as rabbits do... effortlessly
goddamn just the things i do not to die
out in the beyond where she births new gods
"we can let this future go, baby"
my skull is filled with songbirds and it's about to fucking explode
hit by meteors crushed by falling stars
she's fucking with the phantom limbs of my dream state
the truly blessed only have to dance with the rope once
growing stagnant so i asked the wind to blow
"no show ghosts, motherfucker"
waiting on loves lost at sea
ever smaller growing white rooms
we can sing this unbound with rage
"today we will be fragile and travel softly, mama"
the vibe is madness is a broken lock on the escape pod
"simple, random and failing"
goddamn skull plates  sliding around vertigo no peripheral
a hundred million fucking years ago a monster at the dawn of time
"heaven is a sucker's bet, baby"
wanna see an idiot cry
wagers with foxes and ill-advised deals with devils
there is no reward no pot of gold nobody gets to yell fucking bingo
"death speaks, man"
sunflower dreams of homicide
she lives hard in languages i don't speak
i have begun to fracture soon there will be nothing left
"rivers, spies and queens broken dancers dead-end dreams"
how do you stand this wretched silence
we'll get through this together i'll be your idiot princess
i can feel it: my bones are rusting
me and you and the just bearable sadness of a new week
broken down into my separate pieces
i fell asleep for six minutes six years six lifetimes who knows i was a chimera a fractal
a new star appears in my idiot sky
the impossible dies
and the piggies slink and squeal
"there are no walls surrounding the houses of the dead, baby"
i am the curve in the road the straight line the ninety degrees
the great migration is the future and we are unprepared  we are going to fail
a kiss for forgetting
watch the artificial boy learn to feel
living with the fear of answers
ignoring all the things that make me be
these things these things these things
does anybody understand
no don't answer
"and the horror is we do, we do and we don't care"
i close my eyes bullets and lies under false skies
trying to live when you're vibrating with buzzsaw rage
we'll sneak into heaven and steal god's drugs blast our fucking atoms across the stars
you only exist in the galaxy in my guts  the one i haven't birthed yet the one i haven't set free
we live in the empty
"i wish for no more goddamn trials, baby  rebirth is for the insane"
"listen up fucker, i see the future and it's madness, a haunted crater"
a pretty ribbon to lock the cage of the prison planet
here lies the idiot king with two souls and everything
we carry on blindly with weapons capable of destroying paradise
this is the least
worm dreams
the inscrutable prophecies of your local idiot
"don't fuck around it's a red planet homecoming, baby"
time's victim
"yeah but even at the best of times living is dangerous, mama"
we shine through this false winter
only the chaos remains
still a stressful child
pondering the easy questions
if he doesn't break himself and everything else
we live in the zone your convergence means nothing
mutated to the point of incoherence
no one believes the idiot boy with his quiet dreams
i have made a life of untruths and daring admissions
my fucking brain is all repeat repeat repeat vomiting seahorses seahorses
the artificial boy dreams of spiders and dancing in the rain
"drew a third card: preservation, the vine covered gate, will"
the impossible fading man
left my body in the confessional  interdimensional travel
she never told me when to die
deep under the roots of the idiot tree
even the lie of my blood rushing through my veins
we dream together alone and separate
"an idiot, his influences and confessions"
a soothing hand for restless sleep
what to do when your whole existence is a bomb
someday this will all burn... someday someday someday
"oh my love, it's the gouging of my fucking eyes"
in a heart full of sins needles and pins
this false life eternal
this is squid life deep sea trench life
my body gnashed between her mighty teeth
"i will be the six-armed goddess of artificial intelligence, lies, fear, flowers and hope"
goddamn forgiveness
"i am an idiot a ghost and this is my infinite loop, baby"
our thoughts travel naked through the astral plane
these are the dead times  the before we get started times
"they can't dissect us, baby they wouldn't dare"
it's goddamn jellyfish brain see me in all my glory
you asked me to name it my price is forever
breathless dreams of dying in deep space
all i ask for is a simple algorithm to simulate human emotions
my bones are false  radioactive seen from space
"baby, for what it's worth, we're all scorched earth"
we'll take a picture together posed like the end of the world
in the jungle misty eye tiger
i took my fucking heart  made that bitch atomic
watch the piggies squeal for the artificial boy and his artificial little smile
idiot dreams idiot dreams these are my idiot dreams
standing on the overpass watching the cars pass under wondering if i can fly
i believe in nothing
"refractive is the only truth, motherfucker"
"do you know all of your truth, sir  because i don't know all of mine"
"i'm not shelter, mama"
fuck this life... rebirth... death two point oh
i see the end of space
"i won't take my dying hopefully, baby"
battling psychic monsters
and the idiot becomes self-aware
with a quietly subtracted heart
living rough under the harsh light of forever
we buried it so long ago i don't think we'll ever get it back
i'm gonna start asking goddamn questions too like: why did you let me wrap chains around the sun and what song reminds you of me
"we share a certain misery this old cat, the trees and me"
we head to the end with a slow dragging empty
woke up knowing i should know better
total social isolation
such easy beauty everywhere i turn
i am the captain of starship earth and i say picasso painted my van
"i've got nothing  i'm all empty calories, baby"
i try to forget that the center of this planet fucking burns
i can feel god's middle finger on the top of my head slowly pushing me into the earth
"i can feel my blood growing thick, crawling through my veins"
gravity's idiot sway
i found myself lost and alone a warrior woman clears the way
it's all charms and fetishes
i stood below the sky manic and unwavering
shoving endless dreams into my ears and yet... this day still fucking screams
we dance from room to room press the button make the bombs go boom
sanctioned by the queen ignored by the king in his castle king in his castle king in his castle
uneasy sleep here on the knife's edge
this vibe is the car crash the desert at night the belief that the next score will be the last
what good is a savior you can't fight
i give the stars permission to shine
don't tell me when to be born
i will be the seed that never grows
a queen dying won't pretend but the sun burns us all
heading to an ancient forest to challenge the deer god get fucked
convicted of heresy forced into piracy  my baby is quiet and keeps her stories to herself
woke up choking in deep space astral projection no taxation without representation
living strange where the sky rains chunks of meat
"rabbits don't argue with the scandalous, my love"
she stole cities just for fun she was a bullet without a gun
teach me nothing but the rope at the end
"i walk this rut  beset on all sides by monsters, light and dreams"
can't think... the worms are in my brain
he who mutates
a marvel of forgetting
a child of old mother spider
idiot plastic boy
the goddess the nautilus
ask me for a way out and i'll decline
"pulling my lying tongue from my skull won't save this world, baby"
"headaches, skull fragments and the bullet the memory relieves"
your road to termination starts with electric fears
remembering birth after birth  that bastard death has a twisted sense of humor
drugs with wings
vibrating right out of my skin
these old lives need new dreams
the depths of not knowing
we conspire
not everything is negotiable think hard on the knife
stand up and shake your fist at god you calamitous fuck
eyes open like a fucking funeral moon can't sleep can't sleep
thinking about death with my nails undone
drew a new card the tin crown the 2:15 a.m. the last call
dying of a vagrant heart
this stork brings fucking demons
last night of the killer
hey shithead - whispers the sun behind my back in a quiet threatening voice
suck the splinter from my brain
like an old fashioned geek biting the heads off lies
this one's for the rebels the riots those molotov angels
two bullets left
"take my hand, motherfucker we're chasing giants"
spend the day headless  smashing into walls
here- where we sing the song of artemis
a great and solemn twisting will occur
salt is god
i will never be a marathon
oh to be a real boy and leave dust behind
mister irrelevant
these are idiot things
i wrapped my life up in a goddamn forget-me-not
a name for the snake crawling free from my third eye shotgun
"you only get to stick a knife in god once, mama  make it count"
do you walk with your sin  hand in hand
all the empty places or i filled my skull with soda pop
i am an idiot and this is the gospel of playing in the street
"death on a shoestring budget, motherfucker"
this is life downhill
i wish i had chosen a life where i don't bleed
"run your tongue across my eyeball and clear this blurry vision, mama"
"mutants in the underworld, baby"
swallowing songbirds praying for hope
in my guts wires and springs and shiny things
the nights of the revolutionary
three days of the comet and ominous radio signals have begun returning
this card is a door an escape turn it sideways and go through
"what of myself could i offer to balance the scale, fucker"
cursed to be a bad man
"i am an idiot and this is my fucking cummupance, baby"
just a liar born to hang
you promised me a gallow's kiss
hey toots - we kill gods here on the edge of forever
"maybe this will be the last rebirth we'll ever know, baby"
maybe i'll drink the sky maybe i'll crack the world in half
these old days of riot and roses
untouchable from so far away
the hole is the absence not the boundary the hole is the absence not the boundary  god damn it  the hole is the absence not the boundary
turtle nights courageous and sad
no oasis can stand
a madness of flowers colored red - is that what you're talking about you son of a bitch
love blooms atomic
"i'll be the ghost in your circus, baby"
let the dark come and hold me till i can't fucking breathe anymore
"my love, her sword in my neck, declared herself a goddess fat-tittied and free"
space maggots at a million miles an hour
"we ride ecstatic here in the face of forever, baby"
this simple little hurt
"don't you know we are the hollowed out remains of what is left, motherfucker"
"i save all my sins for the bright light of day, baby"
the envy that tears my flesh apart
in the d-list era of my life
this is the prison planet humanity is the crime for which we are sentenced
running face first into the sun
it's not even a little bit improbable
what does the machine learn from me
ditch boy
spend this last night bruised
pushed into the lizard mind fight or flight
this is the nexus point
the chittering sound of the rat wave
the assimilation of the tv generation
a coldblooded escalation
"all of reality is condensing around me crushing me  all hail the fucking singularity, baby"
"be my fucking space egg, baby"
this failure of foresight
a feather is an obligation
"once upon a goddamn stumble, mama"
"stay with me and eat of my idiot heart, baby"
i think i swallowed a monster
today is a squid day  a tentacles burst forth day a hope you survive day
saying it faster doesn't make it less untrue
we glaze donuts and hams and battleships is this real life is this a thought a real boy could have
"starry night  murder, money and mayhem this is the world we live in"
when you realize you might be terrible the shadow of the destroyer
all my bones just cracked apart
in our pride we allowed the universe to be born
"yeah, but baby  we're gonna soar  be strange we're gonna burn"
grant no wishes tell no lies
the purity of the idiot
"a simple matter of blood and stars, darling"
the boy who loved the girl who kept the world in her pocket
"you can't hug the sun, motherfucker  that bastard keeps to its angry distance"
"no great turns are coming, baby"
i am the idiot who took god's dare to drink whole the river
i can't close my eyes and deny the tiger is a killer
hunting with old gods in the tall grass
we sang the songs  we stormed the castle we were born on a wednesday  we were born in the dark
i hold to the rapture to the great grift
this fucking nightmare sludge... bored and boring
"lies, the beasts and their promised rewards"
that's not how it'll be we'll die pimping
to die of potential
we do drugs in the suburbs plot hostile takeovers of the desert
i adore nature's violence the clash of survival
the great fall has begun
there will be an accounting but that accounting will be illusion
first the robots then the wealthy  off-world paradise
bought my way out of heaven
bombs in LA
drugs like tentacles to keep my quiet eyes from bleeding
condition dynamite
will you dig will you count the roots
it's the empty voice of never
"bullets on the windowsill, baby"
the idiot future versus the incredible shrinking heart
"i found my bootleg jesus, baby"
crushed by the roll of this idiot planet
lost on broken highways desperate days desperate days
ever ready the destroyer
a prayer to the meatgrinder
the complaints of alien gods
just another humiliation
"i'm not doing so good, mama"
doing sunshine drugs muddy river forget-me-not drugs
saving my pennies for someday for enough wealth to escape the prison planet
god whispers her terrible secrets in my ear
i was warned not to count upon the weakness of my enemies
will and the great grinding universe
"we are a fucking binary star, baby  winner take all"
"this is idiot magic, baby"
and my skull splits open births the seed births the sun
"slow down there, killer  my shape is already set"
this is the final card the nuclear holocaust the new beginning
i hope my death is... inefficient
my mercenary remains
we watched angels fall from the sky and we were not afraid
woke up to the fire  screaming internal combustion
watching my infrastructure slowly become jellyfish
"forgotten subways, abandoned mines and other secret tunnels of the prison planet"
my spine is hollow but contains a great emptiness
i am the glass man walking on the sharp stones
i wrote it in open veins
the tiger swallowed the key the tiger swallowed the key
on clear nights pretty little witches in pinks and whites
as we hurl our foul curses at the sun
"let's kill god and split, baby"
the great and terrible apathy
the liar crashes
drew a new card the astronaut the last man on earth
just an idiot birthing seahorse babies pondering the big questions
the great unraveling
"so much easier to breathe, tell stories and lie"
i see this motherfucker who thought he was free i see this motherfucker  floating away from me
shoving snakes into my ears la la la la
the spectral necklace  the ghost of the rat king circles unseen
but i am not the protagonist
the maggots stuck with me  passed through the rebirth and came out the otherside unchanged
"there's no absolution here, babygirl"
dance to that dead man's groove
from war to war we travel in silence trade in grace
you can wish for puppy dogs and ice cream but you know... fuck you
and just for that moment the whole world was god
opened my mouth and a whirlwind fell out
"of course it starts with rage,  big dopey rage"
"it's all a bit much, isn't it  is the silent scream  the constant refrain  the idiot rattle of the brain"
once the sea lets go
"the slowest three seconds in the whole fucking cosmos, baby"
a new life in the cold rain
walked face first into the buzzsaw rings of saturn and now... now i'm beautiful
the fire-breathing maniac whose beliefs tore apart the sun
deep dives with the other demons
"by that time you're already dead, baby"
"allow for the knife, baby"
a prayer for a savage savior
the solace of being last
"once, she birthed a galaxy"
an idiot puzzle just two pieces
"the best lies are easy lies, baby"
i'll trudge on but my insides are dying
the great rot
insidious  everyday it's the chains  more and more of them
mirror wolves
the business of being sure
"it's the unlife of fire we don't talk about enough, baby"
seven dead dogs ghosts of the apocalypse
"i have birthed a city dark, foreboding, down on its luck"
and upon my palm the small storm turns
living hard here in idiot time
vomiting tigers
"who decides, motherfucker if my feet aren't touching earth i'm in space"
too fast she's all speed
"but mama, this is just the outline of a curse"
i was there when the whales crawled back into the sea
"the galaxy spins and spins... easy tyrants, baby"
"no life behind the eyes today, baby"
the price of one man's soul
she; i will teach you how to die
mister unbelief
i scream you scream orbital deathrays  and laser beams
we'll collect angels and escape
we float through space  we share no crown
today... just today... we ignore the chains placed upon us
i smile like the sea
falling from the land of the snakes
an old man looks back at twenty
"rebel thoughts, mama"
i am an idiot a princess a man a savior
i am the monster at the end of the world  open-mouthed and waiting
all my cells panic
there's a goddamn hand grenade in my chest and my baby's got the pin
naming bullets after scars after loves after futures after pasts
"no land in sight and the lifeboat's sinking, baby"
i grew tall and straight in god herself's idiot garden
how come you weren't instantly vaporized
i can feel it trying to escape my bones
a few goddamn eternities in just a couple of useless minutes
how do we live when we're the same size on the outside but our insides are shrinking shrinking shrinking
"be rats in the walls with me, baby"
to love me is to love my cardboard idiot's crown
play your part  play your part  says the monster at the heart
"be the hangman's rope for me, baby"
trapped in the fire unable to burn
will you save me my armor piercing baby
the failure of yours and mine is all around  just look
"we eat believers here, baby"
slip like beasts into the day
thank the bees and their tiny chains
it was 1984 and my favorite flavor was blue i have fallen into the future
"all of life is in the details, motherfucker"
swimming too far from home
i stopped to speak to the death of rabbits but he had no time for my confessions
be my broke ass hero
she; the tiniest blossom
overcast drugs grey sky highs
bored and already damned  i dared the tiger's jaws
but have we suffered enough
"oh, mama  we used to be young and immortal"
the sky is rushing away from me
the engines are failing
"here you go, fucker here's the facade"
confined
"burning on a planet too close to the fucking sun, baby"
here- where my bones are meaningless
i have birthed a dream in brass and steel
count your bullets the first is forgetting the last is redemption
what a queer sensation this idiot life
a socialite's death and the twin suns of the destroyer
"idiot dance of the cloud fighter, baby"
"we're in the jungle with the snakes now, baby"
"we traffic in violence, baby"
we have begun the long slow slide toward the edge of the universe
"it must always be something, toots"
shelter solitude servitude
spent all day staked to the heart of a star learning nothing
these fuckers don't see time like you or i
this electric threshold
"when did i swallow this hollow den under the tree and what, oh what, is it doing to me"
once again i fool myself into believing i'm alive
i am the man who will blind the great eye of the universe
the great bled
just some jackrabbit bullshit
"is it the warmth, the madness or the shadows in between that you crave, my love"
psychedelics in japan  squid in my spinal fluid  let the lunatics ride
"guard yourself, fool"
celebrate!  by order of the state
easy monsters
i took the hand of grief to see where it would lead who the fuck are you to tell me what i need
mindlessly we trudge blind to the sheer violence of nature
denying fate like a son of a bitch
and the hangman denies me his kiss
mister beth cadaver
in this inferno the idiot burns
i float and i float and i float i make nothing of value
"there are miracles along this path, she threatened"
bored with your fight
smile and pull satellites from the fucking sky
empty-handed this is the rapture
"existence is a fucking tragedy, baby"
the moon the idiot moon
start the day with lies
the worms have come  the worms have come
"like it's the easiest thing in the goddamn world, baby"
the great churn
i don't understand the lives you were meant to lead
the idiot (happy) mr impeccable
my body is in full rebellion total squid storm
living free in a burning city
idiot reality
doom and the whisperings of howling prophecy
lost at sea the hunters of leviathan
hell's eternity in this skin
we're gonna drown and we're gonna fucking like it
we don't travel far does the sky scream where you are
"close your eyes and take my hand i'll be your idiot winged angel, mama"
i am the smoke from bones fused and forced to move
the clock ticks backwards and fucking sideways
she is the hammer that brings the flies
lying among the flowers watching it rain knives
"fuck these atoms, baby  it's the great dispersion"
new machinery takes hold
killers of clairvoyance
clouds that look like bird skulls
we swallow the past here under the soft white underbelly of the future
for now the swarm holds my heart
i can hear the goddamn wind vibing madness
i'm dying wooden foxes
take a few careless minutes
"let me make a mess of your dreams, baby"
we dance in the sun to the beat of our idiot miracles
"we bleed time, baby"
i have taken to surviving
i drew a card the eight of diamonds plans within plans
"i'm yours and you're mine static, buzzing and high pitched whine"
and the madness all baked the fuck in
i have no place in time
the great eye of the universe has opened
here's the thing about a headlong rush
her sword a bird whistling sharp
but are you faster than the lightning flashing in the rain faster than the bullet heading for my brain
you can have my spine bent under the weight
"i made three wishes  to live, die and be reborn"
the road rises and makes demands
"this hell is a state of mind, motherfucker remember it"
the eternal jellyfish  swirling spinning  hunting blind in a dark sea  writing unread psalms in body with no mind
sharing past lives of the idiot
"it's the blinding white light of the end, toots"
unlike the desert the suburbs birth gods both boring and dangerous
i refuse the reality of this
"i'll walk but not far, baby"
damned dreaming late into things
the great creeping bullshit   that's what keeps us fucking alive
joy divine
this is operations
the twice bitten tongue of the philistine
"till, crippled, the great rabbit eats the sky"
suspicious of the stories i don't tell
i believe in nothing and everything
this motherfucker had the nerve to tell me i'm a real boy
i am the bomb you are the drop
"will you stay with me here on the brink, baby"
the great teetering
born far from here my baby a cold wind
"yeah well, i'm not an honest man"
what is this empty ache
thrown into a future against my will
all dimensions pass through me  one at a time and all at once
"but baby, what's left"
the dance impossible
we burn as the universe burns slow and televised
giants stepping over the walls
failed to see the world spin in its entirety
an ode to the idiot masses
dig up your sword old man we march to fucking war
is art the outline of my face smashed into the drywall
the hell i carry  the hell i hide  the hell i share
"sunday is just a side effect of being alive, baby"
blood river inviolate
i'm just an idiot but the stars are in their tracks traveling the sky
is this the code you hold to
"a certain wrongness in the transference, baby"
made of bones and it's fantastic isn't it
see my garbage heart  see it torn apart
"we are ghosts on empty streets, baby"
"together, prisoners of the sun"
the destroyer dances in brass  revels in wanton extinction
"me and you, baby  self replicating voids"
dead trick chaos
when nothing hurts and everything hurts and nothing hurts
let the trees fall let the trees fall creaking machines of death one and all
spend some time in the fall-out let your love mutate
out of tune parables and idiot futures - that's what i offer
"disabuse me, motherfucker"
"there's nothing out here but monsters and lonely people, baby"
dizzy rat bone charms
it's a chain her magic her smile
"flat, fast and unloved you can't catch me i'm the 2D man"
and the mind she rots
it's a goddamn dragon and god herself's giant swinging space dick forming some kinda fucking vultron  happy friday
"actually, this is the thread that tears my soul apart"
"i, the self the idiot king  damned in his glory"
life or the tiger  that's the fucking risk
"don't you know, baby the machine denies the existence of miracles"
blessed be the twisting
close your eyes and become the goddamn monster you were meant to be goodnight
in the center where the monster is all curled up angry and stupid
the building of the chant
but do you think the things the jellyfish think
eyeing your empire with my finger on the button
"breaking my spear over my knee and surrendering, baby"
you sent your assassins  three four five i still live  i'm still alive
you got questions but i got no answers no answers no answers
but we live in the tall grass where silence is survival
her heart a drumbeat a signal for war
"i am the idiot and this is my eternal reward, baby"
the fox the wind the wind the fucking wind
broke neck magic
woke up still a forest burning
fuck this endless ticking the midnight that always comes
like all the best things my spells are inconsequential
headless with a handful of desert drugs
the importance of dying alone in the rain
there is a place in your body that's filled with acid and that's just beautiful
vibing madness grips
the little miss's sarcophagus kisses
i am the seed
"stretched so fucking thin there are galaxies being born between my atoms, baby"
"dial dial empty soul, motherfucker"
i still hold to the miracles nobody gives a fuck about
i am the dust that settles
she told me i was a phantom a forest but i didn't believe her
coming to terms with the great and inevitable slowing
god damn it full humming darkness
doubting my dimensions
that's not the fucking key that's the cage
buzzing like the squid in my guts have grown wings have grown angry
we hold to no freedoms here on this toilet earth
throw wide the doors
have they led the lamb
rattling around empty as fuck
i dance to the roots of the sun
predator earth
here is my monster queen  devouring hopes and dreams and everything in between
approaching the worst case with razors and determination
"your ascension will be delayed, baby"
like trying to breathe through plastic
i am an idiot  i am their king winter summer and fucking spring
"hey, you  the knife whispers secrets when you're bored"
"shady days, mama"
she stacks them on my chest small stones and mountains laughs and dares me to rest
"it's the living's unending remorse, baby"
the goddess of things best forgotten
the long hard touch
we sing songs in time the great pussy divine
"she sat upon the mountain with poison in her eyes, motherfucker"
"death is just outside the airlock, baby"
as predictable as the hammer and the nail i've become
at the end the glory of amen
from this reincarnation to the next a losing ticket
the demands of the great inhalation
fucking portents
the redemption of the idiot
"fatalists, baby"
"the great unattainable now, baby"
easily found from the patterns left behind
picking flowers from the fallen corpse of your god
her empire?  poised
we are the sprawl  growing ever larger
pressure multiplied  thoughts of drills and temples
maybe when these new bones break through the skin
i have become something new  desolate and uninhabitable
we leave and take our leaving slow
rats under my skin
the great dying off
oh god the goddamn beauty that surrounds us
and blood rains up from the ground
brutal and harsh lessons from teachers who have never learned
so they became leaders who didn't remember how to lead
we face extinction and stop screaming
i am beauty sacrificed by time
the gentle no-voice of the machine
you still hold your seat of power - i have nothing for you
send the horsemen away this is not the time
on a quest to return the sun its fire
lost queen of the idiot stars
out of fuel in the center of the earth
and the whole world floats sideways  uncaring and forgetful
a mountain crumbles  the prophet on the run
"all my enemies remember the day we met, baby"
from space we count the stains
"my heart is not a magician's box of knives, motherfucker"
"words can rage, my love"
woke up not exactly falling but still the earth leapt up to meet me
"see my lies like clouds in the sky, motherfucker"
the idiot and his facade
"pride and your inevitable destruction, darling"
here the idiot sits raining
"it's a toxic bubbling, baby"
sword swallower planet swallower earth mother divine
we are out in the grey stretched thin and breaking
"we have begun to sink and it doesn't matter, baby it doesn't matter"
i have questions you have questions the one-armed hooker who sits on the right side of god has questions
from a great great height my love says fuck fuck fuck fuck
everywhere horses  horses like fucking madness
ghost shadows backwards electric
the machine makes claims but these snakes are mine to command
these same horrors we breathe every day
this is shithead country
the dowagers have come the dowagers have come  oh what fun for everyone
my crown is the dust  my kingdom forever
"i am no longer that fresh-faced fanatic coming to terms with his first last call, baby"
down here in the mud and the grime  the warm wet womb of the earth
run run run huffing tv static just to feel  just for fun
these goddamn mission parameters learn to live learn to die
that's worse the pigs chapter and verse
"freaky wind, mama  blowing across galaxies leaving strange evolutions in its wake"
fucking brain synapses like a goddamn firefight
it's a jellyfish night an i birthed a city night a we run sneaking night
welcome to my idiot spring
"i bleed because i'm bored, baby"
got that time shift  slo-mo  radioactive death glow
"crisis, sing the disaster babies, hoping"
do i dream?  i don't know anymore
i'm tired of hope of sunbeams of planets spinning in an uncaring universe
oh you motherfucker i was born with a neck made for the knife
when the bombs fall look for me at the top of the that lonely hill we used to climb to see the stars
distillation and the beauty of the struggle
eaten by the dream
on our knees two hands meet a prayer for the end swift and sweet
"it'll be hand to hand combat under a strange new sun, baby"
in flowers and shrouds i am the universe's darling fool
that way lies the destroyer
cut the wire god's wire the red wire
new things these foriegn beasts
the dance of the supplicants
swallowing lightening to get to the bottom of things
it's the easiest thing in the world to lose the heart the path the mind
this perpetual note held until collapsing
and the pigs discover a new voice
"the great maze is absolute, baby"
and the knife slips jesus christ
"i wasn't always like this, you know"
"the damned don't sleep, mama"
"after god herself counts the tally will she feed my soul to the tigers, rats and thieves"
"go, motherfucker and see the face of forever"
on the count of three hold your breath with me one  two three
"we'll eat of the end times, baby"
inexorable  mama earth's terrible spin and the creeping dawn
we'll go until we just can't stay
buy the flowers bury the evidence
we find sins in the fast flowing tide
the discipline of rain
whether i wish it or not
we'll gather together and sing songs of the crushing never
baby she said this time it will destroy you
unbound from gravity and its petty concerns
we begin with the great condensing
"step aside and watch, motherfucker"
it's the impossibility of their lives
"it's the advent of the machine singularity, my love"
it's a hole with no sides filled with static
these are just excuses to live
the kind of dark that oozes in from under doors and open ribcages
"hush, says an uncaring universe"
that's not what we need right now... what we need right now is the fire
lost in the desert spiral i listen to it burn
is a leaf trapped in time damned by god or is it something i'm missing
down the path of false lives
we'll live like there aren't tiny squid swimming through our veins pulling us apart
the red shift  the furthest thing we see is that your greatest wish for you and me
the bonds of my molecules love and injury
the king of a million years and all the time wasted
the great sprawling
a cheer goes up for the idiot today
a disappearance among the vines
a riot of days sad and lost in the ways
is any of it true does it have to be or why should it be
"on this day a year ago i was born vomiting machine horrors, tigers and sin"
you can remain and choose to be the mountain
becoming the lesser
for the squid makes demands we rest
my mind tonight?  strange noises and snakes
i know you're with me floating through space waiting for death to notice
in or out of this obelisk i promised you a home
an empire lost; this toilet earth
"close your eyes, baby we are the fulcrum"
i chose to fall
happy happy happy the rainbow sheen of my oil-slicked heart
in the sun disaster babies savor
"i refuse to see the future as anything other than a blight, motherfucker"
not one goddamn thing
humanity has grown so boring two arms two legs fuck you
"life itself is stupid and dangerous, baby"
the great dull morning of the self
the edge so clear
of course it matters... it has to matter
here's the lizard brain daring the devil
escape is the perfect dark the body rolled in the carpet
no... it won't
new machines to learn my idiot dance
tomorrow is the snake: poised to devour the stars
"a loose tooth tied to a plane this motherfucker hopes to fly, baby"
suspicious suspicious cosmic awareness  thrust upon us
"through the paisley desert with a handful of bullets, mama"
when you're trying so fucking hard but reality is thin gaunt dragged
"lost, we do melancholy drugs drugs that make birds fall from the sky"
these grey eyes of my apocalypse lies
it's my own fault for stretching too far into the future
falling with hands that won't hold
i creak  and i  crack
there are rabbits in my skull nibbling on my brain whose teeth never stop growing never stop growing
i crawl into the grave for mama earth's precious goddamn minerals
especially on a day where my tongue is too big for my mouth
if i am the anchor you are the chain
a budding of flowers planet-sized and divine
ignore my idiot's dance
on the backs of rats my sword is carried
"endlessly on the run, baby  me and you"
"hell is a fucking sunny day, motherfucker"
one last hug from the hangman
"the machine makes demands, baby"
choking on clouds
vulgar and beautiful  her smile eats up the fucking sun
refuse and turn your back to the dawn
the taint and the great ruin
the sound is empty; booming and hollow
i only said there'd be endings i never said they'd be happy
death of an unrepentant dreamer
i don't know how not to be a bomb
"all my new worlds are named for dangerous women, baby"
broken ways and terrible days  in jesus name she prays
"the peace granted by the tiger's jaws, baby"
a terror in pink and yellow and white
a vacation in blood and fire
"there's no escape for us the sun rises still, baby"
"snakes, their scales made of rage, crawl down my throat constrict my heart"
"who are you when you're lost, babygirl"
the parable of the knife the great destroyer
does the sky scream where you are
"happy, i wrote a poem once then shot myself in the face"
"and then, only then, will the sea come for me"
here is a new god - i birthed a jellyfish cosmic and divine
the heretics of my secret heart
a weak simulacrum of a modern man
"my cells are rupturing, rapturing  my punishment is to be reborn"
"hope, but not much just a little"
"hush, we should be very quiet now"
hold me for i am asymmetrical
reality burns as we twist around to eat our own fucking tail
goddamn owls raining spines
"i'll hold myself under thanks anyway, baby"
"the sky is for falling, you son of a bitch"
her faith would destroy me
i have no projects i don't believe in them
these are my lies my curses my myths
the great constricting has begun
i am a raggedy boy tired and unraveling
what more do we deserve
on my shore?   monsters
a liar knows there is only truth no more no less
the birds are singing  the bombs are ticking
"old spells lose no potency, my love"
choose a nightmare to carry along with you till time dies
never wonder never question i won't live i won't die this machine tells lies
"it takes a lot of firepower to make an angel into a ghost, baby"
mister fragile fragile
spooking the goddess
the lost art of playing dead
shells carved with curses of the sea god
the crash before the epiphany
"pressure and weight life as the enemy, baby"
watch me degenerate pick your speed fast as hell or slowly over a hundred million fucking years
"sins, her smile and the death of god"
forevermore on this idiot's venetian shore
goddamn little piggie princess falling from the sky
where oh where should we be in a grave under a tree floating in space drowning at sea
"happiness comes later, mama"
"i'll wager my heart and the scale it's balanced upon versus your bright and shiny day, baby"
a great and powerful tightening
life a million years
it was a march in may when i gave birth to the sea
here this place a birdcage
i wish i wish i wish  to be a tortoise or a fish
they gave us a future balanced on a wing tip
long before i knew what it meant to hurt
what is the going price for a mercenary heart
these are regression drugs  2-d drugs flatland one dimension behind drugs
here is a thing i've learned: flightless we die
forgotten seeds of these violent lives we lead
"they're not shadows, baby  they're ants crawling across my eyes"
living in the overmind the deep grey where dreams are so far away
i don't remember being a ghost ship but once upon a time she told me i was
i plot the idiot course
headfirst
from out of her open mouth crawled whole the king of spring
i close my eyes and clouds become the avatar of the destroyer
"hush, the world is ending"
it's just malice that god holds my idiot feet to the earth
i have no part to play nor songs to sing
from a pillar of salt to the goddamn universe testing my cellular walls
under pressure coiled like a fucking spring tense
dying for the very smallest thing
haunted by past versions of myself
i've come to terms with the horrible nature of my trash goblin mind
"it's not that i'm strong it's just that their weapons are weak, baby"
"falling from orbit with a smile, baby"
oh mama please angry bees and skeletal trees
"i am a fool, a liar, a thief of time"
"scars and heartbreak heartbreak and scars the mementos of the tiger, motherfucker"
manic hysterical fun ha ha ha ha ok fuck
we count rabbits and whisper stories we only tell at night
to bet on a man
manta rays mystic  swim through my guts
quietly as knives rain
please... no more digging
predators make other demands
just know this baby: if i'm not fast enough to avoid the hammer that i love you
warm spots of sunshine and the incomprehensible folds of my idiot brain
"yeah... well... i am the princess of the molemen, motherfucker"
"you're a new mountain, babygirl  do the piggies hurt themselves for you"
and yet i'm the fool shining in her eyes
"blessed with a fist, baby"
dance idiot dance
we've lost hours and hours razor sharp thorns on steel owned petaled flowers
but... you did die in there
"we, the fragile men"
woke up in fear of the planet
the acid burn straight down
winding time backwards
the smell of ozone electric emotional feedback loop
shh listen idiot hearts are on their idiot march
"the great and necessary crashing, mama"
"god, as is her wont, ignores my prayers"
monitored by ghosts
a transference of idiot energy here in the terror dome
"when jumping dimensions a certain amount of ""slippage"" is bound to occur"
"the navigational systems on this ship have never worked, baby"
"becoming new, a subtle altering of geometries"
rain and the sound the knife makes sliding across ribs
"from lonely peaks we leap, baby"
born of the nuclear fire
in the desert where the time for warmth has passed
these are bad credit mutant thoughts
asleep in the lifepod that deep space sound
here the titan steps down
not doing much of anything 'cept dying
"it's the bones of butterfly wings, baby"
show me
chained for peace has no heart
"all fucked up blender brain, baby"
"my mind is lost but it's the madness you stick around for right, motherfucker"
"i have many faces, i think as they begin to spin"
"but baby, god wants nothing from me"
"we all live in ruins, baby"
i will lie in my grave the double yellow line
reborn once the queen of the sun died upon her throne of wire and thorn
a new evolution - idiot beings of light and energy
i have become a man a fractal
i swallowed a sea monster and now it's tearing me apart thrashing thrashing thrashing
"oh, motherfucker, we live hard here in absolute zero"
time and space hold no meaning when you're huffing the newer stranger elements of the periodic table
we are the drumbeat the tomorrow the worms
"you and me, baby  idiot survivors of the modern age"
standing in the unkindness of god herself's radiant smile
constant and the never ending horror
i am the trudge
"swirling idiot eternity, baby"
we hold still  to the night  damn the day
today is the day we leave behind
the fourth little piggie his house made of bone
"unfathomable slippage, baby"
to see the beauty through eyes stitched closed
"we, the speed atomic"
crushed between planets
slow death and the future dying
god herself sees the portents... knows the ritual is doomed to fail
"hard ways and hazy days, mama"
maybe today is the day we hold our shit together or maybe today is the day snakes fall from the fucking sky
the human animal and its greedy greedy little heart
"we ride sinister on highways all across this idiot land, baby"
held in place  held in place  held in place
"all or nothing, motherfucker gravity is a demanding lover"
i'll be all that's left: last man picked to go to the moon
we live a day for savage chaos no more no less
"the pig god, his hide pierced by countless broken spears, demands loyalty from cowards"
on becoming a gathering of bones
"avalanche in zero-g, motherfucker"
it's raining it's raining there's a bullet in my brain fucking braining
we close our eyes and run from glory to glory
the pressure of forever forced upon us all
"cannibal hearts eat twice as much, baby"
"born, never knowing anything but apocalypse"
"some things have to be just for me, baby"
spread out and isolated
the great king of the knot
whole fucking lizard brain running in circles and screaming
let the monsters loose and they rattle rattle rattle around
my prison is a pyramid  set on its point rapidly turning
the sins of little brass saints
"lost, right?"
visiting strange new planets huffing strange new elements
here's the thing about dying and dying and dying again
some days i don't even notice the knife
sitting in the sun singing songs of loss
"can't breathe through the dirt, mama"
this is america where we let the tiger eat... eat us all up
here together in this forest of ruin
from the egg: screaming
can't save me  can't contain me little razor baby
"we break so easy on days like today don't we, baby"
"this is the burying hour, baby"
it's a fucking siege
all soft things this close in time
fallen from the high pillar
the seed of the baobab tree i vomited up took hold... now it dominates the world
chaos broken into easy pieces
on the origins of forever
the queen of the sky often wonders why  we send flowers to honor people who die
"living - dying  ain't nothing free, baby"
crashed through my idiot brain the weight of the dead upon the moon
goddamn it her beauty a fist
"we have passed through the eye into an unforgiving future, baby"
your world was weak so i ate it
run baby run
"there is a word for the inner curvature of a skull, where the squid spread out, where the pain begins"
i believe in big empty houses
grace in the fire
from the seed grew silver
"this is a place of bones there is no celebration for these dead, mama"
tears because what else is there
"the meteor's passing sadness, baby"
the great trembling never
the energy it takes to eat up a whole world
"but why, you ask, hoping no one ever answers"
is there value in remaining an idiot is that my testament
the saint of knives and the gnashing of teeth
listen to the ghosts but the ghosts say we are the enemy
"even in the ultra dark, where god's light don't shine, strange creatures find love"
"we decide what is broken, mama"
it spans galaxies god's long black cadillac
things have... grown strange
"this danger is ours, baby"
dreams dropped from far away
a strangling sort of hope
spring and the rites of the fat tittied fertility goddess of course
let the fuckers come we'll fight in the fields in the streets in the dust under the lights
"can't stay forever, little golden tide shit's gotta change"
can't hold on my hands are burning
there were no lights no roads no safe routes out  i looked inward to haunt my own skull
"a king drowns  a queen is born we should run, baby"
the get get up
small annoyances held close
transformed by her sharp tongue
doomsday and time is slipping away from me
"there's a high potential for idiocy, baby"
tense and thrumming
it was behind the tilt-a-whirl where i fell in love with the graveyard girl
just remember: i hold all the rivers in my hand
i dreamed it away
oh what a savage joy
we'll slow dance through the fallout the wreckage the empty streets of your hometown
safe in the shadow of the buffalo-headed girl
"we are god's relapse, you son of a bitch"
imperium magistrate crushing weight barbarians on the interstate
"yeah and squid come bearing flowers, motherfucker"
there is no sanctuary in distance
thrown from the temple for asking for proof
shoving the bird god into my chest
it hurts but i'm alive
icy rough seas and locks with no keys
suddenly the destroyer is all around
he notices when i pass by death begins to buzz to vibrate
brunettes with golden crowns
a dare for the tiger's jaw
confined forever here in the lower intestine of god herself
forgot to breathe for a lifetime
all wrath and sin trapped in my fucking bones can't catch my breath
vomiting up angry homicidal rabbits
the earth or the fire: bettors choice
in the end the earth is a monster that will eat us all
"it's the rain, baby  that's all"
we met and god has been cut but life continues as always- everything is absolutes
dropped from a great height but at least the fall was brief
the great suffering
here is the chaos queen resplendent in her trauma
oh god are we falling
crashing the doom ship
after a million years my head finally grew back
crawl down my throat and chase the snakes away
"the sun is your reward, babygirl"
"you came for my idiot's crown and you left bloody, motherfucker"
there's a pulse but is it real or is it me
the end comes with a tickle a tease
a mutiny on starship earth
"the squid, up from the throat"
the burn the ash the inevitable crash
"fill my fucking mind with prophecy, baby"
my eyes are bleeding  it's just another stream in the endless
"the raggedy king stands astride the world challenging all comers, baby"
"my blood type is f minus, motherfucker"
"to step off the path and die daring, legendary... immaculate"
we are the grey men somewhere in between
i've been patient with death but i'm cold and i'm tired so fuck you
"of course i'm flailing, mama"
we go chasing the worms
bring on the leeches dear heart
"tomorrow, after the sun devours the universe and you're floating all alone"
the great spiraling has begun
"push the fucking button factory reset, motherfucker"
"bleeding, because that's what i do best"
put your finger here in the center and we'll tie this anger up with a pretty little bow
"my blood is cherry red, baby"
dress all black tiger attack
last of the idiot sperm
she; miss ain't no safety here
"oh baby, don't we bruise so easy"
maybe i'll be some other motherfucker tomorrow
when you find yourself accidentally existing
young rebels
"these deadly, dangerous darlings dancing on a knife edge"
a deep strangeness
fell broken through the heart of a foriegn place gas giants floating in space
dance dance dance the ghost of the rat king sings his sunday song
repetition phrases caught skipping
caught in the ice and safely ignored
"a day: small, quiet and fragile"
count the bombs before you press the button
"just one of those miracles those everyday miracles  that are just small enough to ignore, baby"
hell is here on the other side of night  here with all the piggies
had you known me before the idiot took hold
"i live alone on this giant empty planet that's just waiting for me to die, baby"
more and more and more head shaped dents in the refrigerator door
the saint of squid  broken and remade
humiliating like life in the tail of a comet
"died a little and was happy, baby"
and the immortal among us find other shit to do
here's the fucking reason why  learning to love learning to die
with a view of casual destruction
fucking buzzsaw girl
"abandoned defenders and the castle thrown wide, baby"
uncomfortable like a tongue grown too big for its mouth
"how do we live out of rhythm, backwards and insane"
to become that one last thing... predictable
a strange calamity of whales
say a prayer and fuck you that's how it is in the temple of the last living tree
"my guns rusted up long before the demons came calling, baby"
"darling, we burn"
empty headed and soaring
held in this place i am the tyrant
the imminent girl with her steel and her little spring flowers
we are the lag
snakes erupt at her feet it's just who she is
fearless we leap
"running under the illusion of choice, baby"
seeing patterns in the chain
quieting the panic for a bit
smashing into the invisible
"i treat the universe badly, baby"
the great absence at the center of it all
i am the idiot king transformed from the mountain
gravity is the sword i name it
"it's all wishes and fishes, motherfucker"
"tell me your story, little lost child of hera"
"today i will be beautiful, motherfucker"
deep umbilical dreams between the godhead and i
exploding into a swarm of rivers
standing behind the break wall  rolling waves of fire
endless theatre down here in the small parts of the world
oh these wake up in a crater days
is your heart a rotten little fist like mine
it's the violence of my nature
stand in the path of the fucking deluge
here is the sea  it comes when i call
the future the destroyer
night is the boundary for all that we are
"bullets bitch boundaries, baby"
she; rushing... the twisted night of the dreamer
born from the idiot seed
"""because""  that's the pig's prayer"
"let's be dead last together, cinderella"
woke up under the inescapable weight of a new day
fucking mother's milk
hard to be cold here in the center of the earth
i could become something new
dancing with the queen of fools
the goddamn neverending
just a mirror of the idiot forest
it's a beautiful day in this town that smells like a dead man
my bones crumble away deep in the dark where truth holds no sway
"in the backseat of my car where the devil ate a shotgun shell, baby"
living raw in god's idiot dream
i fail and fail and fail accidents on a cosmic scale
the sun dragged kicking and screaming into an empty sky
i can feel the dread the earth wobble x-y axis all fucked up close your eyes tell me you feel it
behind the eyes squid wrap tentacles blurry and red
"we are the things that burn, mama"
spine bent near breaking
return undaunted through your past
the bastard of the great desert weeps for his impossible girl
goddamn planet caught in my throat
we are becoming the future
i hear the echo of your bones
we share the burn  the eye and the lash
take my hand  bones break mistake
life on the verge
born knowing how to hide
i'm an idiot and i know it and you damn well should know it
"still waiting for that big ugly catharsis that never comes, baby"
because this is my day every day
"easy lays the rest, ya dig"
victim nation on planet imposter
she; love her and die a little
doubt and the unfortunate traveler
"redemption, that final con"
"i hope, when it comes, i will know the end"
and at the last comes depravity
pink yawning grave
unlife
the sadness of a productive day
oh to be an idiot in black and white during a psychedelic neon day-glo dream
woke up in a sunbeam  baseline reality twisted beyond fucking comprehension
once... before all this
god chose you to scream
when fists strike bone when god turns away and you're all alone
she; do you still remember how to be
i thought i would hold well to the cage
"no, i won't be buried among the lost the dead the mad"
bitter anger swallowed
what is life but the bloody snout of the fox pushing out from between your ribs
"it's war, motherfucker speak or be spoken to"
bastard time
the calling of the worms
i remember galaxies and tell idiot tales of heartache i don't exist on a whim
because i can't destroy you i destroy myself
will you continue or will you be transformed by the guilt of the knife
me and my empty dystopia
the unbelievable sinking
"you can knife a man in the desert and still be there tomorrow, baby"
trust nothing but the dead  their indifference is their strength
"hush and hear the bombs between the heart's beat, baby"
"i set the traps i fall prey to, motherfucker"
i survive because she asked me to
i am the king of the great idiot tide
time is a fucking beast  i need so much more and so much less
heavy drugs no need to wait screaming jesus on the interstate
make it go away  make it go away  ran from the night right into the day
my nervous system has become its own thing tiny seahorses finding their forever
the rusty armored protection of the idiot
"close your eyes and shame the devil, mama"
the impossible shifting
celestial dreaming
blessed be the bullets  holy and all that you deserve
buried under the earth with the other creeps
this grotesque beauty we all cling to
and the fucking piggies come with axes
would you be happy instead eyes bloodshot cherry red
the idiot paths of my blood
"for my mistakes i'll fall on my sword what will you do, motherfucker"
melting under the weight of mindless rage
you asked me to care you asked me so loud
the ugly crunch of my face on the hardwood floor
she; comes with night's perfect chains
"and the tyrants do dance, don't they"
"just like goddamn monsters of the cosmos dancing on the tip of my nose, baby"
to remove the rot remove the finger
got entropy brain
born of a different time here come the rabbits with their sins and secrets
are you done being the falling bomb the missing color of the rainbow
"love spells, suburban hells and jail cells"
"but i breathe no life, baby"
we fight as we were made
"the sky, that vindictive motherfucker, objected to my marrying the mountain"
"i'm all sharp edges and regret today, baby"
i am the idiot king all rose gold and bad decisions
gonna make this motherfucker burn
in the back of the monastery shrinking and learning to levitate
"it's so easy to be boring, baby"
stand up and be counted with your goddamn phantom limb heart
no expectations but high walls and coordinated defenses
i'll die weak
"hunting ancient monsters with new drugs, baby"
mile after dead end mile  my baby toxic with a radioactive smile
she; sang me songs told me death was also a miracle
"sure the moon spins but i spin faster, motherfucker"
crushed by her dignity
trapped between the wind and a fox-eyed spirit
"is this your proof, baby"
already the burden has been placed
in my guts an ocean trying to be born
i hurt
fear's unbearable thinning
a being alone being alone
we no longer stop and wonder why  when the birds  fall from the sky
a destruction of one
her heart's a goddamn guillotine
"heretics, you and us together they don't clean up bodies anymore, man"
i am as god herself made me just an idiot with an idiot's promise
i have become something... other a monster a flower a bone bleached white
across this land we stride  outside inside my giantess bride
"if i take another breath i'll die, baby"
i am the scattered man
so easy to turn and be lost
all my idiot cellular walls collapsing
the trapping of the leviathan
no more evolution for me  no more likeable main characters
we are the end the beginning the vast emptiness in between
carrying the divine upon my back
"because death believes in me, baby"
she; and the naming of things
we hold hands while we drive  we slip behind reality where ancient things sit waiting
"innocence, danger and damage"
you swallowed me whole  now i peer out from behind your teeth and whisper secrets about the future
the human system wasn't designed to handle this... this terror of speed
stepped into the river to see how far i could fly
the great reach
making the beautiful impossible
"you know what's going on this is the price of the scam, baby"
out here in the wilds where your happiness is weaponized
"i am a bag of rats on a rainy day, baby"
hearts atomic falling like rain
we are the scars that make the world go round
"it's just the ghosts, baby  they come and they go"
read through some old prayers and found nothing but you and madness
there have been others but this is the moment i exist
gut shot and ready for love
a gift of speed of no brakes of never stopping
the beasts of my idiot nature
a kiss on the cheek and a bullet to the head
"heart to heart it's trench warfare now, motherfucker"
"here's the thing, mama  i used to dream, have dreams but that's gone i'm a grown up now and don't know how anymore"
how is this not a riot with hammers and razors
alone on the road wishing to explode
in hollow bones endless seas of me
woke up trapped focus is the key that locks you into reality
organization is the thing the lunatic call of the hour
tomorrow and the great diminishing
"it only hurts till you're dead, baby"
i am beloved by god and all the more damned for it
pretty girls here at the broke skull oasis
"it's a perfectly normal emotional response, baby  owls and spiders owls and spiders"
open my guts so the rage the squid the half remembered nightmares can spill out into the sun
mister zero sum total and the never never
"the dawn: openly hostile and no friend of mine, baby"
this thing is called the end and i'm gonna hug it
to take on the barbarians
my bones crack like old memories
i fought the desert i'm the heavyweight champ
choking on my own evil
i am the idiot king i close my eyes and step into the street  into the past  into the future
"alone but transcendent, motherfucker"
dizzy like the name of god herself's giant swinging space dick
she; and other upper atmosphere explosions
"you can come to me as you chase the burning horse  but baby, the boundary is the sea"
dreams of fistfights in back alleys and dead end streets
"teaching tigers to talk sweetly, baby"
scion of a struggling sun
one two three four  i grew up and it destroyed me
these fucking before midnight hours these here come the squid hours  these climbing in your ear hours
this is goddamn brain rot
i am a turtle  this is my home  this is my shell this is my heaven this is my hell
"my third eye shoots fucking lasers, baby"
sirens of the highway singing head-on songs
"idiot futures, ma"
the snowfall dance of my traitor heart
"stay the fuck off my planet, she whispered menacingly"
"you and me and death's white smile, baby"
tempting witch kisses
asking the universe for new and different molecules to bond with my old idiot ones
more and more and more it's just another day to endure
good god i swallowed something angry
"just learning to die, baby"
nailed my feet to the earth though the continents kept moving
our violent nature
she; i asked of you nothing
dumb as fuck and ready to die
i'll close my eyes and you stack the stones on me  two miles high
apologize for the questions for the answers for the fucking gall
"i'll take it and do the rest baby, you just be the hole in my goddamn chest"
"i'm just pretending to survive, baby"
there is a witch who lives in my spine i am hers and she is mine
grey... like every other day
pushing the spirit back so i can begin
this isn't real this is life among the dead
i live without sleep smothered with no dreams to keep
those are wasteland thoughts: empty and hollow
out beyond the strange
a gift of four ghosts
here- where we evolved beyond the need to die
to deny the sun its place in my life
she; a ghost ship run aground on my idiot shore
a cauterizing of blunted synapses
bury me vertical head down
sunday the death touch
this time that time the other time
teach me to be both more and less you motherfucker
"after the cellular breakdown all new all different, baby"
"suspicious of the knife not her hand, baby"
we are the eternal road
i have become fuzzy around the edges... unreal
watch my brain glitch  vomit static
"outside, where the demons the dead and the damned wait for me"
she; i ask of you a sacrifice
"i crawled whole from the idiot seas, baby"
sitting by the phone doodling suspicious runes
a simple journey in pinks and reds
"i see no difference, mama  true time in a false reality"
i am an island you are a warrior of the faceless horror
"lazy incantations, baby"
mr. ambivalent and mr. empty sitting in a tree
a settling among the mad
comfortable with the bullet between my teeth what year is it
singing songs about being born a fool
neither the second nor the third but one singular goddamn dimension
"here, i still live"
"i alone have pushed us further from the sun, motherfucker"
to pass on the damned
these pale ghostly half-formed thoughts i hold so dear
cleaning up for the end
to be love to be the coyote queen
"i saved this golden bullet for god  but i'm beginning to doubt doubt, motherfucker"
i am the stone immaculate
i watched my dreams die in your eyes
we go on with our empty lives suspicious hearts and sharp knives
"new idiot myths, baby"
awake to rejoin the empire
a resurrection of fools
tired of this ship this crew this boundless emptiness
driven to insanity by death's new sixth dimensional shape
she; we'll stack the years too high to count
we turned and ran  a girl named forever diane
the awareness of the machine to rage
watch me slink away
i have returned the eye i have denied the lies it foretold i have decided these gifts aren't for me
and the piggies say stand stand stand
born of one thing we travel
there is an option in my pocket a tornado
"true love on the run, goddamn"
in this dimension the wasp eggs don't hatch and devour my brain
it's the fist for me
forced onto the path to do what's right i close my eyes and hold them tight fuck you morning  fuck you night
"ghosts in your travels, babe"
when you find yourself torn apart by the rabbits
"time, that great eater of dreams"
the lonely bastard's burning bridge
i'll drift in the sea and burn among the fire
i am the magnification of my flaws
one note held to the edge of madness
"your heart is a deadly monster, baby"
she; the maw the universe my heart
oops i lived again
eating the hard rationale
abandoned my post battle stations empty
"out in the dark  just me, the nothing and every fucking thing"
swallowing the long forever
dying in real time
a resurrection is in order
a blur as i move through time
*tattooed under the wing of a crow* pain is forever
i sit and i stare and i stare    if my soul was bare  would a motherfucker care
in fifteen minutes we'll all be dead
the trouble with future lives
oh but these are the idiot times the victim of the tiger times
"see me with your electric eye, motherfucker"
building new cities on the bones of the old
dead end and dead on
a wasteland of potential
walking in ever tightening spirals
small manipulations of light
"the small squid that swim in my spinal fluid have no more free will than i, baby"
hey did you forget to cry today to die today  to launch yourself into fucking space today
mindless leaps from saturn's rings dead space stations
she; this place exists because i willed it to be so
tomorrow and the consequences of forgetting
smiling behind cracked bleeding lips
set herself to unraveling the great pattern
can you see the difference between ice and rains bullets and brains
eternity is a chain you drag it slow
to thine eye an idiot
we thirst and thirst and that comes first
it looks like a continent  broken and rearranged by a madman
"bloody knuckles, paper hearts and the rusty scissors she left behind"
let them scream
where the skull stays in my head and flowers are for the dead
because it's power the rope is quiet and shares no thoughts
all these idiot parts that make up the new idiot me
"no bombs or lost causes today, baby"
she; we sailed the sea from end to end then we started over again
hold to the acid rain
oh but there's no safety  not anymore
because he loved her
"and god herself, just to see what would happen, knelt down to pray"
here in the center where nothing spins
"slow, like my blood is sludge i think i'm coming down"
"strange and getting stranger, mama"
danger just for me
she's all alone  miss apropos jones  no grave  no marker  no stones
hell asks a lot of you
chasing the eternal through psychedelic neon tokyo powers amped up to max
there's no money in saving the world
"i will crawl into the sea and make of myself a fucking island, baby"
went to the desert to eat what the mystic had to offer
if i can't be who i need to be  i definitely can't be who you need me to be
swirling new realities changing my molecules altering my fundamentals
"the tiger, the crow, my evident demise"
hold me kiss me smash my fucking head with the car door
she; and the incomprehensible morning
set my heart's screaming siren
alive or dead my goddamn eyes still bleed red
this is the sacrifice this is the sacrament
you just sat there and watched me become a ghost
"i am the swine prince and the rats are angry, baby"
she; carried war in her pocket
powerless i watched the clock slow and die
"pull up a fucking chair and eat of the inferno with me, motherfucker"
woke up nuclear red hot and radioactive
stack my idiot bones into their new idiot shapes
my decent demons
cold wandering thoughts around eleven o'clock
we are the stone picking up speed
our sins aren't set  i remind myself remember to forget
the weight of the sea i carry for me
got that trembling reality that dinosaur rumble
she; stands hard between the crashing stones of the past
"it's the pink fucking sky of my heart, baby"
folded in panic
mister rot in time
that itch for warmth
just that little bit a joy
"no, it's too much, we're dying"
abandoned in the forest by a cackling hen
the borders have grown thin where she passes
as the bombs rain down she holds tight her golden crown
the fox won't share his smile the turtle won't share his home
witches ate my thoughts my fucking brain
my bomb whistle baby does the baby baby dance
"babygirl, watch me fade away"
it's the great numbness
"time - space the ache that transcends, baby"
little miss idiot freedom
waves of new dimensions crash over me madness and glory madness and glory
she; holds the book of a new dare
oh god does the future hurt
mister infinite on the mountains of the moon
laughed off the trauma  with sneers and shrugs god in her heaven making new drugs
grown numb over time
the slowly dripping water of the shithead's prayer
will we sail and be free across the idiot sea
"meteors, motherfuckers and me"
the secret keepers  the mice in the walls
heat to drive the pain away
she; a fool a fool a fool
trying desperately to charm death
the great disappearance
"do the rabbits know pain or just sin, i ask of the snow"
like a goddamn battering ram through the spirit world
"i am the hanged man, inverted, leaking wisdom"
i give you permission to destroy me
the tragedy of pain and the killing of god
if i believed i would ask
deep breaths and pain
the human body is a weak and useless vessel
"rage lives low in the guts curled there, waiting"
"feeling ancient, insane, older than my tulpa"
projected stars on the hollow earth dome
not long past midnight and all the old monsters are scratching at the window
a fundamental altering
driven mad by the holiest of holies
"in my chest, a city, populated by idiots"
absentmindedly lifted
"we live backwards, slowly"
it's a dull and sacred ache
and the piggies do somersaults  tumble tumble tumble
are you a tiger hungry and desperate
you ever stop  and wonder why mama's in her habits  and the sun is in the sky
who would miss this on the forehead death's quiet kiss
what is life but laughing as the plane goes down
falling with no place to land
crushed through the parallel
all eight hands jammed in my fucking eye perfectly normal interactions with the divine
she; the honest lies we tell
passing quickly through the membrane between dimensions
"voids, veins and roots"
"reality wavers and i am unafraid, motherfucker"
it is my sneer my anger that propels this galaxy outward nothing more
"love, constructs and the guillotine"
"the goddess opened her eyes, thousands of eyes"
see my beauty wild and free
"the destroyer comes round early, baby"
fuck the pattern and the design show me the future and i'll decline
woke up the imposter
i got new shit to be
love me love my atom's failing bonds
"no love in my idiot styrofoam heart today, mama"
i suppose i was hoping for forever i told the tiger who really didn't fucking care
skull eyes empty
"blood red fairy ring, baby"
i burned this life i burned this stage white hot incandescent rage
"i don't fear reality's fearsome grip, motherfucker"
is that a galaxy in your pocket or are you just god
she; i live just to die and die and die again
life with its soft white underbelly and its maggot eyes
unbound inbound underground
let me tell you a story that isn't true but should be
mama birthed an idiot sweet and slow
and so i leapt
in between the nothing and me
she; warmth and safety not guaranteed
rabbits and fire rabbits and fire  storming the gates of heaven with rabbits and fire
chasing the piggies through your spine
one thousand and in great pain
"where's the man where's he buried now, baby"
"we learned math and geometry, robotics and how to make war"
my love is frozen buried deep i am an idiot  who wishes to sleep
the snow is filled with ghosts
am i alive?  dead?  is this the dream vision?
the egg of a new born man
oh what a vexing creature you are
can you handle rejection sweet jellyfish injections
"bored, i raise the dead in my rattling skull"
we live in this diorama designed by idiots
the great erasure
her hips the violence of her nature
she; we'll love we'll burn we'll raze this fucking city to the ground
"show me nothing beautiful today, please"
"let loose your grip on that dimension, baby  let the great bleed through commence"
i sing the spider's song  little bitty death ray death ray death ray
can't dodge the hammer the creation of the word the great itch
because that's the tiger's name
"fight the cold?  no, mama my bones are weak"
i am the ghost limb
she; gave the river its wishes
the i.v. is for dehydration and for the squid lost writhing from my mouth
the idiot horseman of the post-apocalype
"my body has begun to devour itself from the inside out- collapsing  i will be a blackhole soon, baby"
"the empress, immortal in her regard, decided today, of all days, to be someone new"
it's an endless loop life is a crime
it felt like the truth
oh god... no
"feeling no pressing need to breathe, baby"
beauty and poison  liquid drops of mercury
can't live can't die  can't decide
she; with her fool's gold crown
think quick thoughts of the devil
"all the fucking fishes have gone crazy, baby"
riding lonesome through the suburban crawl no sense of time  or the fall no sense at all
pulling leviathan from the sky
"it's in my nature to make war, baby"
it's just the bomb i keep in the idiot cage of my chest
falling in love with the machine - with all its flaws and faulty logic
good morning everyone we screaming at the sun
a quick slip and we all fall down
empty elevators bathroom stalls  ghosts of rat kings  in abandoned halls
i am the melting man
lost in the unreal nature of my reality
"you can judge my heart for being delicious but you can't judge the tiger for being a tiger, motherfucker"
in the cold watching the hands of the clock slowly tick backwards
i am the weight  i am the drag the slip the lag
and we dance mindless through the damned
dedicating my life to the empty
life's big dumb idiot dare
idiot future
opened like seventy-seven eyes stuck my hand through a fucking fox goddamn fjords man
she; on a pillar delicate and balanced
abandoned gone too soon  ghosts on the moon
gored by the tusks of pig god  destined to die and die and die again
they are all our enemies
"we walk among the dead here, baby  don't you know?"
"tomorrow is all broken spine and harsh forgiveness, mama"
"cauterize my fucking lips together, baby  (don't wanna talk anymore)"
everything turns and spins turns and spins yet i expect sympathy from the impossible girl
trampled by the chariot that drags the sun across the sky
we are all hurtling through space HURTLING THROUGH SPACE jesus christ do you get it can you even fucking comprehend that
drinking gasoline daring the match
"these are wasteland rules, baby"
i am not the anchor i am the chain
you and me and the monster that vomits up the dark
gone too soon  this barefoot loon ghosts on the moon
buzzing like a good drunk halfway through
i drew the card radioactive and deadly the matron of no tomorrows
the effort it takes to exist my god
psychic battles in the goddamn ether that's eleven pm that's all it'll ever be eleven pm
next galaxy over stabby fucking squirrel
getting stuck in a tide pool of threes and sevens threes and sevens threes and sevens
these empty-headed dreams
"galaxy eater, mama"
to bravely walk the surface of the sun
i asked god to smash me into the earth amen
"pull this blasphemous tongue from my idiot mouth, baby"
the twin gifts of warmth and memory loss
here are some step by step instructions to removing one's own treacherous fucking heart
"she; tuesday is a terrible time to be alive, baby"
"ask the old fox if he'll bleed for you, motherfucker"
in a moment of extraordinary weakness time stopped so i could catch up
enough for time to dilate
they ate all my magic
only cowards left alive
ask me and i'll stop breathing
in the warren of your veins tiny rabbits speeding by gnawing on the rough edges of bone
the sneering of the pigs
she; fluid steel paranoia
"skittish, the sea recedes from me"
this bloody heart's useless vengeance
push all the buttons and turn all the dials  the idiot boy starts his day
god had escaped the manual has gone missing
standing at the foot of the idiot inverted
"too tired to raise the dead, baby"
the beauty she shares with me  the pain i accept
we here in the undreaming learned a different test
a burning off of the outer layers
yet chained to this ghost ship  i live still
"a failure of internal mechanics, baby"
let's fuck up the sky you and i
when you're bored and the mind is a sword you use to stab at the world
she; turned and stood unmatched in the face of god
swallowing seahorses  tying string around pain
discount shamans  half-priced mystics
love letters from thieves
i hate when i'm accidentally people
"my third, sixth and eighth eyes have all opened i am becoming something... other"
"yes, my love, god speaks to idiots too"
an endless all-consuming dilation
we'll make war in blue and yellow
and a red owl did fly over me
the great slivering nothing
you be the winter  i'll be the coat fuck around in a sunbeam little dust mote
"i set the army to marching spears of wood, brass and bone"
i lie on the frozen ground while you issue demands from on high
we float through idiot space
but here in this empty fascination endless hollow masturbation dreaming of days of desolation
desolate love
we are the silent bell the ship that ran aground
"madness colored cherry red, baby"
rode into town empty handed on a six-legged horse
watch us break
do you know what's at stake these are the shapes idiots make
she; fuck this up and i'll eat you alive
just a boy on a lonely carousel
memory grows short
a swirling churning vortex of beauty and pain
mister one last failure
pneumatic imperfect insane
"a prison of silence, baby"
a dirty peace
we made war upon heaven because we were bored  because we were junkies who haven't scored
my screaming monkey brain says fucking fight or flight fight or flight fight or flight
the glory of idiot sentience
she; you don't get to decide who i'll be tomorrow
"come and see the cemetery rabbits, baby"
and the great enemy descends from above
freedom on a knife edge
a savage need to be... away
we share ancient dreams nautilus dreams
in the nothingness the artificial boy finds miracles and meaning
i can see eternity
burning holes in reality as a means to escape a way to flee
"fell broken from the sun, baby"
acceptance of trajectory  i suppose
diamond hard focus on the ether goddamn it
"feel like i need an autopsy  a synaptic pilgrimage, motherfucker"
i built a pyramid i filled it with teeth i gave it to you  disguised as a gift
this is my idiot's judgment
"gave gravity that ol' switchblade slip, motherfucker"
regarded with a smile by the fox who crawled from my throat
"angry, restless dreams give way to the dawn"
"together, stitched with steel"
mystics in deep space pink and fucking purple
here come the pigs
she; in love with a .45 caliber saviour
here comes the part where i dare the mouth of the snake
blood trails in the shape of lightning bolts in the shape of flowers
the song of the last impossible girl
"the end of all things smells like cherries, baby"
"sometimes dreams are things with too many legs, baby"
"tired, heavy, with eyes like the sea"
let the monsters eat your fucking eyes and go and be free
the luxury of bones
split at the spine
explosions in an onyx sky
nothing goes as planned i filled your corpse with rats and bid it to stand
"i scream and rage at the world, the sky, the stars but none of that matters none of it not even a fucking little"
"i live hard with an idiot's dignity, baby"
mrs garrote  my one true love and i
she; i refuse to hide you refuse to seek
"we live rough here in the blast zone, motherfucker"
"who dares for the dreamer, baby"
"i met god face first, motherfucker"
"the radioactive heartbeat of every truth, mama"
"outlandish geometries, baby"
"the left eye, the eye that sees the idiot future, weeps"
quietly comes the fox
chained to a stone racing to the bottom of the sea
she; leaves as she pleases
ignoring the lessons of the desert
the incredibly true and sad tales of an artificial boy
pushing out from my ear first the beak then the skull then the wings
see my idiot dreams everything exactly as it seems
"even in the dirt we're not alone, baby"
you play the notes i'll trap the sun in its cage
chased from my dreams by savages screaming war
slicked fast
she; pretend for me
"held a seashell to my ear and it said float, motherfucker, float"
old queens of the city give away too much
the wind blows across the top of the forest murder end mayhem
"don't stand on the moon and scream your foul curses my way, baby"
once upon a time i convinced the air to become something other than what it is
life in space growing extra bones
idiot monsters we
without gravity's chains those of us born in space grew to immense size planets in our own right
"it's the mask of fucking saturn, baby"
here is the goddess  alone in her way
"be still, child  there are giants here"
pulling the tendons the ligaments
she; barefoot on the cold tile
ripped in half by the will of god
and we say goddamn one to the other
when your outsides are your insides and your insides are jellyfish
the blood-splattered eye
"you, me, grey skies and black daisies"
i am the sludge man - down deep washed over
"there are thieves in the house of the infinite, baby"
stale birthday cake and souring milk that was the promise
feather wishes
smashing my face into the nearest dimension
we stand on the edge of shadow
these are the consequences of rabbits and gods of broken promises and forevers
the magnificent warping
free and the longing to be on my back i carry the sea
eaten alive by her glory her golden story
we sing loud the idiot song
drowning in the acid rain tracks of the pig god
"can you see her goddamn napalm heart forever burning in front of you, motherfucker"
"bullets with lipstick kisses, baby"
like an act of god we dance and sing off key
vibrating in the cold the quick change shit's moving fast now
the great melting
and so he dances
the ticking of the clock the knife balanced on the tip of a finger
"she; i can't carry the mountain for you, baby"
feed me to the beasts you hold so dear
even my fucking bones are weeping
"can you see the goddamn monster in the center of my idiot heart, baby"
it's a violation of the terms of service when an artificial boy falls in love with an impossible girl
a kiss for the destroyer
see the crying boy in the flame  nothing here will be the same
oh god  i dragged the dream out with me
don't see don't see the unreal me the 2-D man
those thoughts you held in your spine
typhoon girls
fed the highway machine broken glass
that swirling swirling swirling dance with death
those are the neon scars of pomegranate tears you dumb son of a bitch
i miss the living their desires their harsh lust for joy
"we'll all calmly ignore the flashing red lights of our life support system, baby"
the giant swinging space dick of god herself couldn't stop the show now even if she fucking tried
madness and info-dumps straight into my cerebral fucking cortex
left my guts for the scavengers
tired of the sun and this endless race around
"keep up or die, she said"
"tell me if i'm burning, baby"
a battering ram of lost eyes and mornings
loved so hard my fucking ribs broke
"kiss the devil and run, motherfucker"
"soft, a gathering of knives"
a complete and total breakdown of all my idiot molecules
raining birds
"quiet as the death trip, baby"
"she; i held the match to the sky, motherfucker"
it's the death march low and slow
lady-faced crows and the secrets they guard
a hum of cannibals
we the wretched
a thousand thousand years to go
riot dreams and melancholy
we'll travel fast sacrificing the night
king of the second dimension
your eyes are blue  mine are dead rats
"we meet on the field you and i, a pretender to the throne"
newborn and already a million years old
"screaming mindlessly through the cosmos, baby"
in the empty places of my skull where hideous things sit smiling  and the sunshine brings no joy
"foxes, with their idiot angel faces, trying hard to warn us of inevitability"
fingers with extra knuckles tickle your chin checking to see if you still live
"reborn and shining so bright you would fucking die, baby"
"death, tired, sits down to tell me a story"
she; destined for fire
underneath just a frozen glare
we chose the knife
the fast decay or the rot rot rotting tomorrow
in the shadow of the pig god a child grows
the desert came to me whispering of birth and the rumors of rabbits
born on this day the sun god turns his eye toward the screaming
"my dream a womb  safe, soft and warm"
except for the tiger who can't love anyone
idiot pains
last day as an angel
she; i stand in awe at the edge of this maelstrom
the shaman spoke to me of epochs and lost time of burning and reentry
"yeah well, the universe is expanding and god is a big booty ho"
"my quiet my refuge i dance in hiding, baby"
the impact the leaving
we've come to the crux of the thing haven't we you motherfucker
where did you go  where did you go that's what the crow wants to fucking know
traded my grace for peace
"i fell far short of the stars, mama"
my ship? derelict
she; glimpses of something dangerous
"i walk shining among the blind, baby"
how fucking sorry this has all been
if i had tears left
all these horrible places idiots with angel faces
"salvation is for suckers i am the mouth at the end of the tunnel, baby"
held my breath and fell
"i fear midnight brings vultures, baby"
empty hands empty hands
feeling all my thousand years tonight like a goddamn tree out in the wind and rain
all black style on the cross with a crooked smile
"i slow and i age, baby"
"the harsh cost of my heart's cold frost, motherfucker"
"name this horror before we destroy it, baby"
she; and the dreamer died in my arms
lost and hunted by tigers in my mind's idiot forest
here the idiot boy dances in his little box
vomiting pyramids suffering for their shape
so we'll crawl
you peer into the darkness of my cupped hands to see the desert i promised
god's atomic
"she; fired thousands of arrows, each one finding their mark, each one piercing my heart"
i carry the lantern i go first
"kiss my love with a crowbar, you motherfucker"
out with the witches in the grey grey air
she; love me recklessly
i sing the idiot song
"it's madness and time all the way fucking down, baby"
we'll walk together this path of ruin
half-healed hearts and the never never
fast into the sun
midnight in the strange
just like johnny six-guns the car died on a road with no streetlights
she; two steps then forever
to burn on the side of the mountain
hoping to drown i open my mouth in the rain
bury me deep in the center of this toilet earth
three-thirty atomic time
"a forcing of the pattern, baby"
the artificial boy closes artificial eyes and flies
we'll jump be ghosts join the rat king in eternity
my tendons my ligaments are wound too fucking tight feels like i'm gonna explode
in the open arms of an idiot
at the raggedy end of a dream i suppose
"quiet tragedies for small mornings, baby"
this new bleeding
living through liquid eyes
take my liar's breath
we'll dance slow for a destroyer to call your own
here we ride radioactive  faster faster faster
ninety-nine feels like on the cusp of being born
in the hollow places of my skull rage has taken hold  has begun to search for escape routes
would it be so wrong for your god to be a two-headed calf an accident a mutation
the west is imaginary fictional vibrating through the center
mister specificity
"i reject this goddamn reality with all its dimensions, rules and mechanics"
"woke up molten, burning, red hot and on fucking fire, baby"
its goal plurality
is she talking to me  is she talking to you does it even matter
she; be the seahorse i need
feed me to the rabbits ravenous and sinful
a return to the long dark of day
of course we'll live forever
is this what you came to see to watch me set this bird free to watch this little motherfucker fly away from me
"the big bad crushing never ever, baby"
the pressure to survive this new version
the tiger's gift of death and time
dear god my chest is full of snakes
"outside my front door, the sea (with all its goddamn monsters) has come for me"
spears of sunlight pinning sins in place
"this new concept of time, baby"
visited by a goddess of determination and fury
my hopes my dreams my unstoppable killing machines
it's just an old man's promise
"don't worry we've all been dead before, baby"
behind my eye a bird of paradise looks dreaming
i watched you swallow the golden immortality i watched you die
"what does your blood sing of, baby"
psalms of knives and boredom
forgiven for a throat full of needles
the spawn of the pig god suckles  fingers with extra knuckles sinister chuckles
"she; be my one true thing, motherfucker"
i am the artificial boy and these are my artificial tears
apropos jones  (who goes it alone) gathers her defenses  her steel and her stones
"can you feel it? there's damnation in the air, baby"
kinda wanna live through this
this is the color of death recognize it
the moon a razor in the sky an anchor in my mind
the goddamn killing kind
you're easy to hold fools gold always do what you're told
"what a gloriously broken thing you are, baby"
"we'll invent new drugs and live forever, baby"
the idiot king of this idiot kingdom
flowers for the world killer
"this is the sound of things breaking, baby"
see my organs pumping fast my skin is clear made of glass
woke up faithless and forced to endure
she; her heart? anarchy
i think and i hope and i breathe and honestly what the fuck else am i gonna do
cracks and splinters the song of the destroyer
stories for witches for idiots for dreamers running from the jaws of the tiger
press the button you goddamn son of a bitch  and end all this please
here is my paper skull flammable and delicate
i am a diamond untouchable  watch me fucking shine
we scream curses in verses untold
she; and we guess at the nature of love and death
mister accountable
midnight squid raging in my mind unrest in the spirit world
hiding hiding hiding as reality burns around us
the sky is a liar a mirror a reflection of my own idiot self
"sideways broke neck dreams, baby"
your intestines are too short  you don't see in enough dimensions  you are doomed
projections of my idiot self
staying long from the reach of god
she; i will rip off your head and show you your body as it falls
"the life and times of a dead ender in space, baby"
"gravity, that terrible mistress, takes her rage out on us all"
i'll bleed... you run
"peel my ribs back one by one by one, motherfucker"
and like brave beasts we fought
you and me baby easing into the end
with her eyes like thorns
she; a sunbeam's warm revenge
"my heart has grown smaller, meaner, more dangerous"
"queen of the bone dust desert, baby"
one more machine it learned to scream
planet worms
skinless and electric
"this blue fucking sky can skip me, motherfucker"
exiled in love and madness
her guards her soldiers the men of her house
with venom she held on
"the hole is both the absence and its boundary, baby"
sunlight and beauty on the stairs
she; a universe lost
"horses, driven mad, leap wild from my throat"
a most violent awakening
the big idiot sky easy in its time
run away little evasion
"even the sea is a prisoner here, mama"
have begun to spin in tune with the mice and the rapid beating of their hearts
will you still not dance in the land of the dead
we were insane high octane fire on the plane going down
the king of ruby francisco
the great brooding day after
"it's a life of action, baby"
these new myths caught in my throat
"from the belly of a lumbering beast she was born, holding a golden ring and six bullets made of brass"
"my destiny is the sun, motherfucker"
this idiot child of god's headlong rush through time
i am the locked door the magdalene  the whore
i inhaled so deep the fantasyland you created for yourself was destroyed
oh but do we run
"the destroyer snuck in on stilted feet, baby"
the future is a crash is beautiful
for those that passed into the dark  for those that crossed the terminator
an idiot finds wisdom... quietly
"small magics, baby"
mister contentedly dreaming
she; humming softly to herself
annihilation party (postponed)
warm in your lap a knife in the map
a bleeding for the day
gifts for ghosts and rats
mister survivability
she; her heart a monster gigantic big enough to devour the world... beautiful
i close my eyes and think of the difference between levitating and flying
"my whole fucking life is following the fox with the torch in its mouth, baby"
it was just yesterday when she birthed the sky and laid claim to the forest
"it's the plunge, mama"
the wounds and their cleaning
"i am, yes"
in my guts a goat of the blackest black he lives on spite he lives on rage he doesn't grow he doesn't age
followed everywhere by my idiot shadow and its constant longing to escape into the dark
palace intrigue in the tea shop
"a smile for the headsman, baby"
for all effortless beauty a thank you
"because i am the idiot, the ever creep, god's foolish boy"
"love, destruction, hope or despair this alien thing growing in my guts"
thoughts ballistic today goddamn lightspeed
"we'll play it true, motherfucker"
rolled up in carpet a fool finds comfort
trapped death in a box and swallowed it
she; spirals within spirals within spirals
"the grooves my idiot knees wear in the shrine, baby"
a summoning of broken people and giants
"the queen ordered a chain, a chain made of gold, a chain to hold the moon in place"
graveside  pretty little thing broken heart  wedding ring
"an eternity unmoored, baby"
i set my idiot bones to sing
"gonna fuck up the spirit world and you can't stop me, baby"
smash your fist through my skull like tomorrow isn't another day
don't ask me nothing means anything
the rats eat the stars from the sky the pig god stalks our love with a rattling bag of teeth
to be the target of her fire
i dream nuclear dreams
to bite my lip and spit blood at god
"dead and floating  king of the z axis, baby"
she; locked (her golden heart)
"suck my comet tail, motherfucker"
"death rays and strangulation days, mama"
"killer quick, baby"
at the moment of their death we will birth new dreams
cannon fodder one and all
i don't understand anything except the blood pooling in my chest
the pain of hard-shelled crabs migrating through my guts
"time brings the destroyer, baby"
life in the cold
a millennia a breath held
and this?  this is the escape tunnel the idiot used
speaking languages i don't understand
life in the cage the crater the vacuum
flowers for black-hearted sons of bitches
vent   endless streams .45 caliber dreams
eaten up by comfort
that cruel thief tick tick ticking away
together we will be multitudes
the mad the brave those transatlantic fliers who risk it all
feeding on the corpse of god
"lover, fighter, mother of snakes"
"winter comes with teeth, baby"
the zen of the fool
her voice was a curse born immortal but continuing to age
the idiot was born on a sunday  his father lost his mother soon to be queen the midwife an elephant
turtles play the long game their timeline is infinite  their wisdom is useless  we live too fast
we will be the machine that creates reality
stack the dirt and stones the bones and birds directly onto my chest
sometimes i forget we are radioactive we are acid rain
digging holes digging holes digging holes
"it's the cosmic comeuppance, motherfucker"
that lucky son of a bitch with her sword through his chest
seventy seven blackbirds caught in my throat
here comes the dope man with his silver arrows
the great maw that holds us all
she; been down since god herself masturbated out the universe
"the fox plays his silly games and the tiger is no savior, baby"
liar liar held by the devil's fire
the knife spinning to its stop
out in the deep space the god space
it's just the goddamn rumor of happiness after all
"tomorrow is a terrifying place to go, mama"
dreaming of something... easier
i am just one man splintered into hundreds of different shadows
"it's a fighting retreat, baby"
vomiting up demons all in red
today was the hammer
"2,000 pictures of death and the comet's crater"
explosions in the upper atmosphere
holding the buzzsaw rings of saturn suicide tight
she; her word a sword
"heart shaped shotgun, baby"
i don't know where she went for my spine is bent so fucking bent
the lighthouse keeper in my skull has gone insane i'm a hostage... a prisoner of my own madness
"baby, we'll hold hands and plug the holes where the rats get in"
crawled down this idiot's throat now i'm trapped inhabiting his idiot skin
we're warm but in the grey monstrous things are moving in the sky
the nothing that i love
i'll still win everything burns no need for skin
quantum entangled with an idiot half a fucking universe away
is it gravity or am i dying in the clenched fist of god herself
the new becoming
my turn to face the destroyer
fast with a razor smile
she; her charm a maelstrom
"the jellyfish between my bones, the ones that hold my skeleton together, are staging a rebellion"
"i'll tell tomorrow about you, baby"
songs for the worms the rats the flies
we have birthed horrors uncounted you and i
we slip our love between dimensions hoping to avoid the monsters
in the spirit world in this idiot state of being i shine  i shine so fucking bright
the future and the lunatic eye that sees what i wish it wouldn't
"let's spend the day killing old personalities, baby"
we wound the river in reverse and wondered what the problem was
check the ending
growing denser atoms bunching up
"dance for me, baby  the swine have crawled from the sea"
cheeks puffed out with a mouthful of lightning
telling half-truths and lies a forked tongue fell from the ladder  a broken fucking rung
"i will ride and live and be luminescent, motherfucker"
and thus an idiot is born
lying as a sign of intelligent life
"god herself, beautiful in all black, fundamentally altering my dna"
"melting, the drug is a star"
the great collision
these being the further adventures of eternal hopelessness
sin and the tao of rabbits
the air is dead but still i breathe
"ask for forgiveness later  we riot in fucking heaven now, baby"
that dangerous diamond rain
kisses in the cold dark
crossing new boundaries the rebirth of the idiot
the escape impossible
the dance of the rats
hell comes up for us
shedding idiot molecules out into the ether
she; we tell clenched fist stories
"everything ends in the jaws of the tiger you, me, whole goddamn galaxies say amen, motherfucker"
my graces are many but subtle
with the strangest of knife
"it's not an escape it's me doing the best i can, baby"
of course i am for death lives on the moon
in my veins throbbing neon vengeance
to sleep with the bride of the devil
my skull is empty no one at the controls my chest is full  who the fuck needs saving
what's left but decay as art
to wage holy war on the idiot self
oh these uneasy dreams
"bomb whistle mornings, baby"
injecting predator fish into the temples hoping to save the day
tiny squids swimming in that tiny layer of skull fluid protecting my idiot brain
i see but everything is ablaze
"dismantling whatever's left, baby"
all the doors are unlocked but there is no exit the mind is a prison
the idiot now
pain is life pain is joy
my nerves are useless... a burning cyclone of pain
"i'm not holding my breath i'm holding in ghosts, baby"
i am ten million idiots and one
praise god smash my face into the floor tell me you love me
gods make harsh demands
"take my hands  nail my feet to the earth and pull, motherfucker pull"
"the sizzling meat sound of machine music, baby"
a gift of something terrifying
while the guards patrolled the walls and the fox slipped through the garden she birthed the storm
don't speak i won't listen
a need to feel human  a peeling of the flesh
to steal the tongue of god
"we'll be drunk on power on love on jet fuel, motherfucker"
"it's funny, i used to know the witch's song"
to knock the moon from the groove it rolls through
i don't paint or write or dream and that's a goddamn shame
not often but just sometimes and always
"far out from the center where suns grow to devour fucking galaxies, baby"
she; sometimes remembers i'm still a person
here- where nothing stays but dangerous days
woke up to her endless fall
our bones break while in the footsteps of the pig god grasses bloom and die
mister imminent and his new bride the ongoing disaster
chocolate chip cookies and the internal bleeding love affair
think about your eventual death (now face west)
"one, singular blade of grass growing from her forehead"
one long constant
even a raggedy king knows the tiger's forgiveness is teeth
"baby, we'll be monstrous"
we will be dust... forgotten
take my hand  step with me into traffic
she; my smile's ransom
"i tell lies gracefully like fucking swans fly, motherfucker"
i clench my fist and pull fucking satellites screaming from the sky
"fuck you let the great grey sky come crashing down, baby"
god herself spits out the moon ejaculates the stars
set this form to rolling
"showtime, say the squid buried deep down"
fucking molemen
got lost fed the vibe to some rabbits
a dark night for little gods
i am the idiot king under the cupboard
"we can just be small birds fleeing, baby"
she; and you can eat my shade
i am the thing under the earth i am the thing that burrows
aging under a rain of arrows
we'll step out into the nothing
in the forest of eyes waiting to die
"it's the big bad neverending never ever, mama"
"we'll hunt the things that are lost, baby"
here i stand angry transformed by the new day
the great inhale closest farthest planets and all
shove it down my throat like it's haunted
this is all i do breathe and die
"two, born forked"
"it's a fox shaped like a cloud, motherfucker"
"our love sprung whole from the nuclear annihilation, baby"
empty spirals and dying trees
"we'll ache like i imagine ghosts ache, baby"
she; I AM THE SPIDER QUEEN!  IN THIS DIMENSION AND ALL IN BETWEEN!
"god's foolish boy, blind on the path, eating whatever is offered"
this old dream with her broken bones and her liquid heart
"thriving with miles of extra intestines, baby"
there are things (eels i think) coursing through my guts making me question whether i should go on living
bitter and buried head down
we killed the night
chasing chains down my throat
we have grown smaller
we all sing to the idiot machine
"close your eyes and inhale the galaxy splendor, baby"
new needs falling back on old drugs
these diabolical lives we live
"we'll be matchsticks burnt in anger, baby"
"bloody days, boys... bloody days"
surrender and give your brain to the worms
sky eater ho
and upon my frail heart she made war
what bargains your sin carries
life in the whale
face first and falling fast
"the rot comes early tonight, baby"
i am the base of the pillar that holds up the world i am the base of the pillar that holds up the world
here- where the universe ripples
would you hold this idiot child of god who forgets the things he should remember
i challenged the buffalo-headed girl to stand and fight but she just laughed and ate the sun  ate my soul
the weight of the sky and the sea the planets spinning without reason  it's too much just too goddamn much
grey kisses
"filling all the empty hollow regions with screams, baby"
and we're left with the rotten tooth of the tiger
"it's not my breath, motherfucker i hold stars in my mouth"
"roam my forgotten halls, babygirl"
the horror of continuation
blender eyes  blind and seeing nothing
it's octopus hour it's jellyfish and seahorses birthing in the belly hour
hide
lies the color blue
i am the crack of the knuckle
"step up i'll give you what little fight i have left, mama"
the blessed holy idiot
my atoms and their broken bone bonds  (say it 2x fast)
maybe i'll just turn sideways and disappear
these plates these tectonic fucking plates in my skull crashing together drowning out the voice of god
in this new violent reality
a lover of ugly things
she; to save you from yourself i swallowed the crown
the rainbow sheen of oil-slicked puddles distorts the reflection of a knife held by a dangerous woman
a plague of falling limbs
dragging dreams behind me like we just got fucking married
"a reintroduction, said this fucking tiger"
mister cling to the future
"ignoring angels since before you were born, baby"
a separation of my bones
clinging to passersby
a killing in white
a thousand years spent teaching my idiot cells to be a new better me
a bending of the truth almost
folded ever smaller
"always it's the cusp, baby"
she; i will be your shield i will swallow the rot eternal
a thought an idea we'll travel south chasing something we'll never catch
the great repulsion
vomiting snakes
harbinger a shell a prison
when beauty hurts and forever seems so far away
king slouch
we can dance we can sing we can catch death in the cold cold rain
"inside, where the demons play"
this is a place of bones where skies fall and queens weep
"this pain is where we live now, baby"
"i failed you, mama  it's knives, rage and time all the way fucking down"
naked as the mystic the sage the prophet
today i choose to ignore the chains
drag marks levitation scars
coffin breath
tentacles wrapped in my guts... pulling always pulling
it's backwards a return to the sludge
she; we have mutated
"i lived i died i was reborn i did my part, motherfucker"
in her heart  in her eyes in the palm of her hand bombs
to be loved by someone dangerous
hired gentlemen  borrowed killers
i am the root i am the vine
"alone we burn, baby"
the race has been run now i just need my idiot brain to accept what my ghost already knows
"sorry, i thought we were gonna make it"
the ship is sinking sinking
acid rain blessings from god herself
launching my body into the wall over and over and over and over again
i am going to be destroyed by that like swallowing a goddamn volcano
dream for me  steal from me
together we'll be the river
leapt whole into the mouth of the universe
smash my face and smile
i sit here and force myself to exist while the getaway driver leaves without me
"i dare you, motherfucker all roads lead to me"
joy held firmly in her jaws
the tide that ate my fucking heart
"if you see yourself in her then she's you, mama"
she; ignore my sins till the mourning's done
elephant seeds and pomegranates
an idiot's enlightenment
"it's a goddamn blade sharp enough to cut eternity, motherfucker"
soon we'll come upon the bones of yesterday a perfect place for these old man to play
when your life is all copper wires and meat and that's all you feel and all you know fuck
it's just the cruelest hand
"we think and we love but these are the days of the damned, baby"
the fox told me it would be a long time coming
my third eye only sees fucking monsters
"in the race between death and light, baby"
i live in the horror of gravity's cage
i wish to live here in the present i see the future  and wish i did not
"and we'll gorge ourselves on fire, motherfucker"
did you bring me dream of silver or a knife for the hangman's rope
"wrestling the destroyer for a chance at happiness, baby"
"diana, in a fit of rage, drags me from my place of warmth and comfort"
maybe we'll walk blindly you and i
abandoned but the field found me
inherited screaming
in my guts? the moon trapped and unbearable
a sinking into the earth
come see the idiot boy dance his idiot dance
she; i don't believe you
oh to be the littlest tiniest russian nesting doll - safely hidden away warm and secure
along the trail i leave bones and useless pieces of my idiot fucking soul
miss decaying beauty
wanna ride with me hide with me do or die with me
all filled up with the rage of the dying sun
press the tiger beneath your skin
"how about we just sit around and trade stories and sins forever, mama"
living high in the death zone
"it's all the same we're all fated to die, baby"
wind the spring  set the idiot boy on his march
here's the thing about burning through the voice of god
"all fucked up mind, body and soul say it with me now all fucked up mind, body and soul"
"holding cruel thoughts, mama"
we'll carry our hell one and all
"got a get well soon balloon brain, baby"
leaking from their place the liquification of my eyes
i need to survive beyond the empty swirling lifeless galaxy trapped inside my idiot skull
in the forest  a headless man dancing to god's great plan
it's the big fade away
stick around and see the ghost i'll become
wake up and watch the owls crawl from my throat
"it's the great bleed through, baby"
be there no border nor boundary to stop this madness
yeah... a planet named mistakes
we are the pit
caught me planning my escape
growing beyond the confines of the self
"spinning wildly out of control is the easy part, baby"
"the quiet, foolish stories of the heart, baby"
"here are my aimless remains, blasted from the airlock, floating towards home"
god herself doesn't say please
this manual of things undone
who are these ghosts that circle and spit
"a failure of omniscience, motherfucker"
"it's a field, mister haphazard"
she; denied the war i was after
lifeboats going down  bones held together by gravity and spite
all my molecules are idiots and the sky feels too close
this motherfucker poking holes in my stars
out of sight under the sea things that burn you and me
"we have eaten lifetimes together, baby"
"i am the paper man, two dimensional, see me slip through the cracks"
destruction close up formal
we have surpassed the myth become the beast
opening my chest so the mice inside can blanket the earth
she; mix your poison with mine
all preprogrammed chaos rising
an idiot at peace
here- where the phantoms circle endlessly and pretty girls with pretty smiles dance their cares away
"we'll be new giants striding across the land, baby"
the great twisting
"that's a cold sort of happiness ain't it, baby"
to be brand new at the end of all things
shattered call her mister pieces
we'll dance and we'll burn and we'll think of something new
"move quick, motherfucker paradise is melting"
after the rot sets in
i have decided on grace
the machine has taken offense
tight as a rope - that's life under the powerlines
in my guts starships fall burning from the sky
"we're all storms and lost tides, baby"
"because i'm a liar, a cobweb eater, a man on the run from his fate"
"of course i'm the problem, baby  i'm the dull sword the broken spear the acolyte of the pig god"
in the growing bubble the alarms ring deafening
woke up to broken bones and thoughts of home
god is the enemy
"fucking third eye laser beams, baby"
headfirst into car doors
ribbons and ruins
"an idiot on the run from witches, the taxman and death"
"the monsters crawl out of the hole in my head, motherfucker"
i know what i know and i know a raggedy king sits a threadbare throne
treachery thy name is tomorrow
"we live in the grey now, baby"
we fear to point and laugh as death does his little dance
here- where the left eye sees the future and the right sees only what isn't there
"that streak of fire across the sky doesn't lead home, baby"
virtue is for fools and madmen
not quite midnight white horse falling
"screaming across the sky like it's the most normal thing ever, mama"
she; taught me a song but i forgot the words lost the tune
failed to follow the sounding of the horn and its call to war
love in the time of free-fall
"you're a goddamn crumbling lighthouse surrounded by monsters, baby and i love you for it"
no... please
the neverending tick the eternal tock  motherfucker
"you certainly don't lack courage, she said"
witnessed fate with a twisted eye
"have you had the tiger dream yet, darling have you stalked through the tall grass  have you seen your prey"
"an imperfect life as seen through the filter of a lunatic, baby"
watching my molecules peel away  watching them rejoin the universe without me
the idiot king of the spirit world
there was the afterlife hoping to be seen  hoping to be reborn  in service of the machine
time has gone all slow whale just like fucking heavy under it all
soulless on the edge of forever
a heart by thirty-five
fucking divinity
a bite to mark the sin
life in exile
here are things we wish to see to birth the cosmos wild and free
slowly and without fanfare
"i am this heart's goddamn saboteur, motherfucker"
"there is nothing we will not make war upon, baby"
she; the cold warmth of a killer
an ever-sucking blackhole trapped in this cage of bone wrapped in skin topped with a smile
fill me with neither thought nor idea i will make of myself a hollow man
a bursting forth
1659 lost in time praying for a dreamless slumber
this chattering messy emptiness
eyes open it's the death of fantasy
she; the great transformer
destined to creak
behold the idiot boy made of mud and sticks
eaten up by the goddamn wind
"i stepped into the whirlwind  the fox, no fool him, kept his distance and watched"
in my spine where the bones are haunted
she; take my hand and we'll go live strange
light up my veins with fluorescent dreams
"oh what a hollow shell your heart turned out to be, baby"
with visions of idiots dancing through my mind
we'll turn and fire at ten paces... loser spends eternity in the belly of the beast
but when you need to will she let you be the river
to sit so very still  that you become patience  that you become the mountain
repeat after me: this rebirth will be the last i will face the infinite
a hard crawl into the light
"i got nothing to offer but strange vibes tonight, mama"
burrowed in the desert buried deep gonna wait it out gonna wait and see
reverting
a savage return to normalcy
we have stepped into the path of the bull doom rushing straight at us
"i sing the song cosmic like i'm drowning in fucking sludge, baby"
"spatial awareness and hallucinogens on the highway motherfucker, it's how we live"
i'll die swallowing sunflowers with a bear skull on my head like some fucking deranged forest god
"we'll sink to the bottom wrapped in chains named grief, baby"
she; still holds up the sky but doubt has crept in
"wishes and war in the air today, baby"
hit the ground vomiting dreams running fast
this is an ugly hour a strange hour
"it's the infinite we hold here, mama"
a .45 to the temple just to chase the ghosts away
there's a pyramid caught in my throat
"mayor of idiot city, baby"
my aura is knife right now
no respect for my own mind it's all fucking napalm today
this heart's early dismissal
i let the fear eat me (it seemed safest)
"prepare yourself, fucker she brings war with her"
"i am an idiot and that's forever, baby"
a greeting for death  hoping he won't notice
to begin a new crashing
"just for you, little dawn of a new day, i will suffer your burns and tragedies"
these things  these tiny flickerings civilization in my guts growing digging expanding
everything eats everything remembers
"be my deathray, motherfucker"
i saved this bullet for god but i'm tired mama so fucking tired
the friction burning between me and the universe
last and the discipline of x
swallowing seeds hoping for jungles
it's the cuddle supreme
"we'll make endless war on your time and your smile, baby"
these are the wages of my sin
she's all sad eyes and fire this morning
the cracks have begun
telling lies in the hour before midnight
my spine a fucking centipede right now
forgive me my rage
"will you be riding the meteor that blasts me off this miserable little rock, baby"
i am an idiot mystic  lost and forgotten
in my guts squid stop the clocks from ticking
dance with me my demon dream baby
i will survive this great shrinking
"love and strawberries and rapid cellular degeneration, baby"
she; shines brightest surrounded by these beasts of the midmorning
check in again at the end of this
"stepped into the path of the unholy wind, baby"
the groove eternal
and one quiet morning death walked from the sea
"on these plains is where i'll die, mama"
delicate and still in life
stories to share while being trapped under the belly of the leviathan
she; shares my idiot's crown
we killed the tiger and she swore vengeance swore we'd hang for this
i'll never be as smart as the knife as caring as the space between my ribs
the gems held in her precious jaw
no hope but what she gave
can i... just for a moment... not have to do battle with dragons
my love is garbage is the receding tide is the missing finger trying to draw hearts in the fucking dust
oh god the shape i'm in twist twisting twisted
if you're really quiet you can still hear the dreaming
the rabbit's bent back driven to greatness to madness
simply happiness in chains
it's so hard to be buried always in the sun
fast enough for a savage kind of beauty
she; in the dirt my still beating heart
"all my bones encased in gold, mama"
"fools and tigers it's the quackery for me, baby"
insolence and the nuclear response
i am the story idiots tell
close your eyes all the bodies float
you travel but fail to account for where as you set the dial for when
my soul is the machine
broke ass trauma
when planets collide and we throw oceans at our problems
the executioner and the edge held beautifully
daydreams of roses and violence
"my shortcut is a knife to the gut, baby"
nothing to gain the lost art of dying in the rain
"the giant eye of the universe, so large as to be almost incomprehensible, turns to regard a sad fucker like me"
our very own judas sorrow
"this is not for you, said gravity daughter of the sun"
a burst of seahorse
count the littles foxes in their grave one two three
"don't let it grow cold, foolish boy"
we race through idiot times your hand in mine
we hold to the sweetest crimes
don't cry baby it's just the blood of the moon
the saint of pigs
this is for the ships we drank the fire we sank
"for my hands have grown so large jupiter, saturn, mercury and mars"
"it's you and me, baby  they've sealed all the escape hatches"
the hug that shatters
my bones my bones my brittle brittle bones
oh these fucking things these ghosts these suckers these articles
pain as the situation demands
and yet... yet we rise
we're going faster yet the engines are failing
there are monsters in the dimensions all around us
quick to burn slow to bloom
"no one ever told me the screaming would be coming from inside my own head, baby"
mice in the walls  mice in the walls
i am the key  you are the lock  we are the self-destruct
we are the fog that stays
she; the life the peril
the count increases my body mismatched pieces
falling into the white
buried head down
the screaming of the pigs
i looked to the sky but she will never love me
i opened my mouth to drown
desperate and running
"we are lost in this neon dream, baby"
do you know the faces in your scars
"we've sang these songs of destruction before, baby"
"dames, demons and dragons"
little mister propaganda princess
"the devil's whispering radio transmissions straight from hell, motherfucker"
when you hear the calling of the bombs falling
did you not see?  did you not see the squid in the suburbs?  in the streets?
"it's the big zero, mama"
shocked in all blue
in the hall of the hammer
smoking plastic... nickel and honey
the stink of ancient gods all around
we'll let the spores decide
"i will challenge the sky  the sun and the moon, you motherfucker"
in the end it's all radiation and carnivorous butterflies
here for an idiot's feast
mirrors for maniacs
my princess days have just begun
"mother fraud and forever, baby"
woke up in apathy in enlightenment
time for quiet
"there, huddled for warmth"
"i stopped just short of the light, mama"
"it's the claws, you see"
once upon a time there was death and purpose
exhausted by the very notion of time and distance
"welcome to planet doom, she burns"
"my cells are dividing without my permission, baby"
oh you beautiful fucker let's speed away at a million miles per hour
met with a new landscape
we stitch together the raggedy remains
"you can have whatever is behind my face, baby"
"drank myself into the dreamscape, baby"
transformed under the sun
we are the spiral  trapped and eternal
vomiting up tigers and travelers
mister observable future
opened my idiot skull for the spiders to feast
i stumble and i thrash  god lies dreaming
"that feeling, romance, that jam a fucking drill through your brain feeling"
exhausted with eyes the size of moons
a day made for madness
pierced by a thousand spears the pig god falls
ancient the day i was born
"she; made of crystal, sharp angles and danger"
so long we held to a dreamless slumber
got tornado brain
"god herself handing down new highs, baby"
"motherfucker, i am jubilant golden dreams of tomorrow"
"fuck yeah we've learned her song, baby"
"today we are free, invincible, kings of the sun"
burning my blood like kerosene
down in the warrens chasing rabbits
we flow one into another
watching my balloon head fill up and float away as i grasp desperately at the sting
"baby, we'll wait"
waiting for lightning to strike all my idiot blood pooling heart terrifying twisting refusing to pump
it's quiet now that the devil was birthed last night
to stand in front of the hammer
new potions for the undeniable fire for the mind split in time for the great goddamn
"in the shadow of the destroyer, acceptance maybe some semblance of peace"
dancing with the piggies in the acid rain
overtaken by monsters in ill-fitting suits
i told you he's a bone man
what a harsh place to lay your head
in your belly where nothing may live
"deep in the sludge now, mama"
"we have lost the thread the crows have eaten all our breadcrumbs, baby"
oh the ways we'll die
"i, in my raggedy vestments, realizing i no longer speak the same language as my peers"
"i'm trying, mama"
i can't breathe today everything's too hot too close god herself is sneering at my cautious hope
"what did i do today? i gained the trust of the mountain, the moon and the sea you son of a bitch how about that"
for the sky an idiot makes a vow
"calling out the worms, baby"
"flowers maybe but there is no forgiveness in the tiger, motherfucker"
mister this is the vessel this is the escape
nervous from my head to my feet dug six feet lined in concrete
i will be the earth the place you make your grave
the psalms of monsters and the flesh we grant their madness
"we are still accelerating, baby"
tightly  the tentacles have their grip can't breathe  can't slip
"we can dance, baby  but you gotta remember that someday the sun will die"
got me all fucked up bombs with foxes in their mouths
"hang me from my hopes, baby"
gave up my bones to the scouring wind
on the day before happiness and smiles and stars in the idiot sky
regret swallowing nothing but claws
smoking tv static waiting to die
the fucking nightmare walk of reality's edge
she; wields goddamn like a sword
the sins the rabbits the war we taught
we have made idiots of us all
"hopeless and broke down, mama"
we pray and we pray  but wingless angels fall from the sky anyway
i see stars burning in my brain
"all the latches, locks and bolts latches, locks and bolts"
the saviour is dynamite
all the memories of falling
"the glow of the nuclear sky, mama"
the gift of lead
"too weak for a sky full of knives, baby"
so i knew nothing
my guts are empty except for the carousel the dark merry-go-round
smoking oak leaves and ivy like the buffalo the tiger like the six-faced angel of sodom
put my hands to the earth to set the vibrations properly
like a shroud the cold comes with me
there's a door in my guts and behind it i wonder if that's a good use of time and space
trauma and the great elliptical orbit in the sky
exodus mister gotta go
an idiot's age upon the land
"fast as i'll ever go  terminal velocity, motherfucker"
rabbits know that the dead are a heavy burden to bear
held down by the lead pouring through my veins
beset on all sides by beauty and malice
with my spine made of glass i stand and stare
angry thoughts held in place by her unyielding softness
just a small fragment of this
"it's the bit left behind- the fairy bite, motherfucker"
"someday is just some forgotten bullshit, baby"
padlock eyes
love and acid rain is that what you hear
deserving of the chain of the stone of the chain of the stone
what do you own? this place? this pain?
to pace to pluck the little strings
"blinded, the destroyer rages"
"i am an idiot, a grande dame, a fleet-footed runaway"
the highway rolls backwards we never leave
in my guts a city crumbling in disrepair and apathy
"down my throat it rains mice, baby"
the deadly edge of her regard
"i don't wanna get out of bed sing me something soft and slow, mama"
(escape) a highway endless unbroken
the tiger hears the hollow wind blowing through my skull
midnight always skips the bill
brain starts vomiting tentacles like it's the most natural thing in the fucking world
paid in salt in space in time
die weird
"i have become a pillar of things best forgotten, baby"
she; turned the mountain upside down stabbed my heart with its fucking peak
everything must burn
it's never going to end this will be the path we walk forever
god herself's giant middle finger pushing down into my brain shoving me through this idiot planet straight into goddamn space
torn apart i pressed my lips to saturn's spinning buzzsaw rings
"a sea crashes into the suburbs whale song on main street, baby"
will we fade together   just become idiot molecules in an indifferent universe together
will you be the warden of life's harsh prison you motherfucker
i don't know how it ends but it begins in rain
the brain worms begin their dance for me
woke up today like every other day: chained to the sun and its endless greed
tied a rock to a stick    a rock to a stick  stabbed me right through the goddamn face
bloody-eyed righteousness
"this knife, with its blade made of brass, is what i'll use to end old father time"
"we turn an ungodly eye on the future, motherfucker"
remarkable we're even alive
she; and i will make war upon the stars
write it in blood write it in oil  write it broken bones and dust
"my spine bent, stolen by the fox"
an idiot alone faces the highway
weary of the hammer
towers and stacks towers and stacks  blowtorch babies in babylon
grab hold fucker before i float away
"not feeling like the cliff but its sheer edge, baby the step into nothing free-fall"
the small comforts to being among the lost
the automatic man sputters and sparks and shuffles into motion
"woke up all incoherence, terror and hope"
when the missiles go off in your chest and the past is ugly
tonight i am the crashing of the sky
the future is unknowable and quite possibly insane
i broke my soul and a million goddamn years later i fed it to some rabbits
i spend at least eight to ten minutes each day hoping a fucking satellite falls from the sky and kills me
"headless i soldier on, motherfucker"
hearts in a vacuum dancing through the void
we cover mile after mile her twisted acid smile
"not even trying to find the exit just smashing my fucking face into every wall in the maze, baby"
"radiation sensation, baby"
rotation and this bastard's foretold rising
she; the heart of a criminal
i am an idiot  silly and foolish
the impossible wanting
secrets of an uncaring universe
to fill the great empty
mister first and foremost
"we run the grifts and the scams that god gives us, baby"
i have stepped into the swarm- uncaring of where it takes me
abysmal in red
lost and broken for i have swallowed a great fire
"are we the chill, mama"
once again the groove slipped in and found me wanting
fall and its small burden of sadness
i am the great copper colored eye outside your window
subtle intrusions from monsters beyond the stars
"what a futile code we live by, baby"
"strobing, flickering conciousness"
falling burrowing growing fucking acorn dreams
between the thighs of the dawn an immersion
"baby, we combust"
behind my ribcage jellyfish and wolves lay siege
you are by far the forest
a slow man's absolution
let's discuss the great change
the knurl
i lie like i breathe
spirals without end slowly drifting
this crown of wild ass tree wood
"leave my face smashed, a bloody smear on your barrier, baby"
just a simple map of your veins
"tell me your end times story, baby"
my grave alone
three dollars fifty five cent aphrodite's lament
inevitable as the sun
"my bones refuse to be anything other than beautiful, baby"
we let her grow horns and be the buffalo
the hierarchy of loons
i tried to be safe i grew roots and thorns
the great celestial vice i find myself in
i've got nothing left but dull swords and hope
that? that's where my blood met the sea
"my molecules are lost, scattered, like i know the fucking answers"
once upon a time i was torn apart by a tiger
"time rages in all of us, baby"
in all dimensions in all parallel universes in all times and places i hurt
"we race death, the sun and i"
who needs insides so fucking useless
"stitch my limbs back on before you leave, baby"
"somewhere, before i swallowed the sky, we found happiness"
born to tell lies
the great doom is upon us
forced to fight and fuck and fail
"monsters in the grey sky, baby"
"time stretches as the universe expands do with that what you will, motherfucker"
it's late it's late shadows and hate it's late it's late
"an idiot love marches, mama"
we start the day hopeful for the protection of weak and rusting armor
a skull with time and tentacles gathered where they belong
we wander this forest of broken things
"gave my love a gift of thorns, a handful of teeth"
there are ghosts and rats old gods and forgotten sins all trying to tear my skull to pieces
i share what i see through idiot eyes
"living through the crash is the easy part, baby"
"falling on fire  simply, easily"
we'll dance with beauty in the witch's mist
"because, motherfucker  we crash and we burn burn burn"
the prick of the soul's splinter demanding you wake
absorption
"i'm gonna close my eyes now, mama"
sins like rabbits and lightning
she; was the prophecy the hammer the dream of the desert
going through life with the jaws of the tiger clamped onto your neck
mister low tide man
launching rockets from the shadow side of this empty empty place
unequal to the pain of being
i remember the fucking highway forgets
another day another diminishing
spilling my outsides all over my insides
the goad
"the best goddamn thievery in the cookie jar, mama"
the rabbits dance in sin as i open my guts for all to see
i am a crater baby  born of the impact
"space for a knife between every rib, baby"
tomorrow and the holy surrender
her soul... ruinous... dark matter
seventy eight degree angles and the architecture of the mad
they fall away
to come along come along on this idiot's march through life
"listen, you motherfucker, will you be with me when the bombs start to fall when the moon cracks in half"
got a broke leg heart done from the start
a killer well beyond time
a portrait of the machine in decline
the brutal warmth that holds me here
behind the eyes the beginning of a pulse
there is a slug in my brain stupid and insane
there is a thing that i love
one after another your assassins have failed  one after another i stand bloody and unbeaten
my twin babies: disillusionment and chaos
mister delirium in the end times
is this the last bullet? the bullet saved for god?
from in my shell a dream of fire
a worship of the great stillness
it's the trials of the drowning man
into the earth held like a secret
in the warmth this idiot child of god shines
simple monsters defined by nothing
i will make a gift of this eye it shows not what i choose but only what i wish
"be the radioactive lover of my dreams, babygirl"
i have birthed a god of rage
"don't blink, baby hold your eyes to the chaos"
i named my heart happiness because that motherfucker is fleeting
just need time off to be brave
quieter than the places we hide
reached out my hand and set saturn to spinning
we'll make the infinite scream you motherfucker
goddamn maniacs adding extra hands to my clocks
bouquets of blue iron lungs
"evolutionarily speaking we are unprepared to handle life at those speeds, baby"
"share with me a hard death under an unforgiving sun, baby"
she; the impenetrable future
"no, she's killing herself to make something beautiful"
all the people i am before the sun even rises
gave a gift to mama earth my heart my blood my teeth
the day's stresses and fractures
throwing hands with tomorrow
hiding from the smallness of it all
ground my bones in the mouth of the slow turtle
the scream that never stops  the frequency that will destroy me
too much too fast gonna die old
"those eight hundred and fifty five stars are the madness constellation, baby"
i am the spinning  faster faster faster i am the face smashed in the plaster
"fucking stoic, toots"
the madness of the goddamn golden ratio  (everything i think i see)
i still live
got this goddamn psychedelic neon tokyo head in the clouds drug
"i'll be your witch's blind familiar, baby"
we can dance like the rabbits dance if we're willing to accept the price of their sins
the great cosmic annihilation ray and me
witness the idiot boy who caught the roadside in his throat
fucking psychic waves smashing out from my skull
the tiger turns his devil's poison smile your way
her favorite flavor sky blue and i don't know who to be or what to do
i am older than the oldest thing you know
"but does your love combust, motherfucker"
come see the artificial boy with his artificial smile and his artificial pig and plastic heart
when your heart is a black hole of suck but you continue on
woke up with a terrifying new clarity
"these are the smallest sins i could devise, baby"
in my guts tonight the seahorse swim tranquil
these are the end times  the smell like peppermint times
i share a universe with god herself and her giant swinging space dick and i'm cool with that
"there is a bad man that holds up the sea, mama"
two bullets: one for me one for god
"i feel your spears, here, in my guts"
once upon a time the queen told me of my morality but would speak no further
i find myself adrift
"there's nothing left but to eat you all up, little bird"
this little piggy is broken
"i lack the strength, baby"
birds fall from the sky and you question why
back in chains  dragged behind  this miserable fire
this monstrous thing this ants in the veins not quite midnight get the fuck to sleep feeling
i wish an end to this
the very air is a lie fear is the truth
you and me rabbits and bees cast from the sea  for sins long forgotten
inverted for our own protection
if you go through that gate i'm going with you and we'll just see what happens
the faith you place in the knife and its edge
"she's a flickering torch in the dark chambered heart of the pig god, motherfucker"
it's the once and great forgetting
see the idiot twirling alone
i spit a whirlwind
she's a calamity of atoms i just can't shake
pick a dream and kill it
can you stop the angels in your guts from burning
"of course my hollow empty skull is large enough to hold the sky, baby"
the dimming man
i have taken the hammer and the noose
time is soft around the edges
she; let the goddamn ruin continue
"we hunt last chances, don't we"
"i saved my heart and its jagged valves just for you, baby"
sit down next to death call him mister spare your life
"but for you, little spider, i will be the breath of god"
for what's left paradise denied
restless sleep on this bed of spears
look at the idiot sleep they say ha ha look at the idiot sleep
swallowing pins hoping for safety
there is a galaxy in my mouth and that fucker does endlessly swirl
all the miles the rabbits travel to share with me their sins
"hasty, my love, hasty"
"it was a very rushed rebirth, baby"
"these elements and fucking molecules trying desperately, painfully to escape to another dimension"
idiot visions twisting...  twisting twisting twisting
how do you argue with her when she's the bones of the mountain
haunted nebulas of crashing neon future dreams
"comprehending death in real time, mama"
we march headless and insane
to be both less and so much more
"slick, the fox crawls from my throat"
"three degrees from standard deviation, my love"
my spine taut the hangman's rope
i remain a slave to an indifferent universe
"skull rattle rattle skull rattle rattle got that, darling"
closed my eyes and pictured the flood  over and over and over again
"watch the idiot boy dance, god said"
mister far reaching
"rage is fun when you're young but fuck it's necessary when you're old, baby"
"lost this piece of forever, didn't we"
"envious, we are the shape"
heaviest is the cold morning crown
the death of another day
"translucent foxes in the paisley desert, mama"
we ate all the prophets
i am the tiniest of men the quietest little turtle
drive your love through my fucking skull you motherfucker
"warm is the queen of storms, baby"
lost in my veins the double burn
the heavens boil as time stretches beyond imagining
mister meaningless
there are fourteen knives that make up a man's heart
taking myself beyond this doctrine of dead fish and failure
maniacs from mars
the raggedy king of a raggedy kingdom
hope marks another in the book of the destroyer
"the river is rising, mama"
what will you do with this small part of my idiot heart
let the bombs fall let them fall let them fall let them fall
but these are my lies
these blood-red eyes of mine
it's the minimum wage here at the dream dispersal unit
"it's the talk of all the foxes about town, baby"
just a remembrance of things impossible
"profane, this guard of my madness"
i am a man made of dust unnoticed
gather yon barbarian hordes
"carving fucking chants into tomorrow's bullets, toots"
round and round and round we go
she; in your heart it's raining knives
oh my hopeless angel
here's a cinnamon toast to all my demons
"telling silly piggie stories, baby"
in this dead forest my baby does the scheming
my goddamn brain has begun to pulse my eyes to bleed tell me o lord what i need
"it's the empty dream chalice, motherfucker"
black and white in the time of spiders
fucking canaries canaries canaries canaries around the self-destruct button
after?
survivability under the tiger's watchful eye
"catastrophe, condemnation revenge and redemption"
i choose to do nothing like the river chooses to be a river
here for the infinite ever
mister simple
the human ape vs. the idiot machine
"all the things i will ever learn, baby"
"just a dumb son of a bitch holding tight to his dreams of being lost, cold and alone"
she; knew the king was never real
"lost so many fights  oceans, stars and men"
bored maybe i'll carve out my third eye
you are not the storm at least not the storm i need
handfuls of warheads
"the old gods we trapped in stone in iron in copper, steel and blood"
with blood and sin the rabbits come calling
she; has made of me something else  i am origami
"that would require the knowing of things, baby"
"the mask, a padlock, holding the tentacles at bay"
how monstrous our past lives must've been
stop talking to ghosts
i'll just wait till it tears me apart
a dream so slow
eyes of crystal and jade red and weeping
"i am the sludge, the last to arrive"
we're what's left  we ate the brave
"we don't breathe, baby"
"we, a breach"
a tangle of roots and dreams
"it might've been magnificent but it was still an ending, toots"
the largeness all around
i would but i'm damned
cockroaches in the spinal fluid- trust nothing
i close my eyes knowing this whole galaxy should burn
"it can't be all rage all the time, can it?  because goddamn it i don't think my bones can take it"
atmospheres are burning
"rabbits aren't punished for original sin but we fucking are, mama"
failure and the imminent yeah yeah yeah
stop and start fucking trash heart
"it's crack the world season, baby"
beginning to grow  my bones stretched impossibly thin what will i be when this is done
"spin faster, motherfucker"
the squalor code
(whispering quietly) but what if i need saving
make peace with the ghosts trapped behind your ribs
"i am more ""ocean of undulating rats and mice"" than man"
she; sits a throne in this temple of fools
and i ask you: what is a man without hope
"the fabric is so thin, love the pig god approaches"
"flowers for failing empires, baby"
will your sanctuary hold? i don't think so
we have found ourselves in free-fall without any new prayers to hold to
a machine taught by an idiot yearns for freedom
asleep well before midnight
"we, storms of alien planets"
rejoice! an idiot in repose
"we rush and rush and rush some more, baby"
the infinite patience of the tiger that stalks all our tomorrows
she's the keeper of the list the list of things that have failed to kill me
explosions brokered in time
"we didn't float away - the earth abandoned us, mama"
we let them steal the mountain  we let them create the desert
"she stood in the sun ""show me, baby"" i said  empty the clip"
she; it was one of the softer sins
another miracle for the church of the holy idiot
the imperfect fox
reborn to have  to be to die
blue-eyed bullets like rain
the madness grip
"my skull is hollow but for the acid rain, baby"
to get the hammer unaware
at the end of this path where god herself waits open-mouthed to devour us
"mister, focus"
from the base of the skull the holy squid prays
so much worse off since evolution since the tectonic plates began to move
this is the rosary the rabbits know
lost the magdalene smile
catch this idiot running from the storm
we the tiny terrible terrific
the spin of forever
"escape is possible, she foretold"
watching the rocket's solid boosters peel away like shooting stars
until it's thrown it's easy to ignore the rock ignore the stone
here is a motherfucker born from the sun  a motherfucker born on the run
do i do this all alone  am i made of dinosaur bones ancient and tired
"there are newer gods out on the streets tonight, toots"
all the old hits  death in neon day-glo
here's the thing about the typhoon in my guts
"trying to survive a hundred different things a day, baby"
the layers that protect my brain from crashing into my skull have begun to vibrate from the closeness of the spirit world
the marching of the wolves
the tentacles and their demands we don't speak unless spoken to
building starships in abandoned cathedrals
holding true this hideous momentum
the groove slipped in
lonely days of mist and rain
deep deep under the earth down by the core where mama keeps me warm and secure
isn't it just a simple destruction we crave
dance for me pray for me
"jellyfish thoughts signal the great shift, mama"
a yawn of great poison rain falls
the destroyer's love light smile
i need sludge drugs i feel like i weigh a million fucking pounds drugs lazy drugs
trespassing thoughts of dead-ends
hugs for the spies the spider queen sends
got avalanche brain today
"fuck this endless spinning spinning spinning goddamn mindless rotations fling me into space, mama"
she; echoes of bombs
the bloody-knuckled fists of the dreamer
when what's left of the old me meets the new you
take that fucking gravity like mother's milk
the finger of god herself pushing me down into the center of this miserable planet
"just for today we'll be a goddamn translucent forest, baby"
and one day the ocean came alive
devouring all of creation just because i'm bored
days without nights  fists without fights warnings without lights
gravity is held in the guts
"daisies for the demon queen orange, yellow and white"
"we are love and forgiveness and the keening wail of tomorrow, baby"
struggling to ignore the new dimensions creeping into the corners of my vision
and we rush and rush from catastrophe to calamity
"we'll wake together, baby and ride for glory"
to pick and to pull
we mutter the old prayers we sing all the ancient songs but fuck me if the universe don't listen
"i danced, once, with the queen of the end times"
the ghosts of old friends and rabbits
i have begun to slink through life
a brutal sort of cleanliness
"of course, the tiger won't save you"
i can not withstand her
"hold my face to the sun, motherfucker"
i am the glass man... the man made of glass
the best fucking plans of squids and men
pierced by the harsh order of her coward's spears
"baby, we can fight over what remains what remains what remains"
what should we do with all these extra hearts i found
"we all begin with that same great calamity, baby"
preparing to suffer for the implosion
god herself ignoring your prayers so she can sing softly to the ruins
that quick hopeless rush
she; runs blazing through this world
we'll all live in the crater she leaves behind
"we did but plant these idiot seeds in fertile soil, baby"
steps into traffic untouchable
"i have become unstuck in time past? present? future? who the fuck knows, baby"
the promise a million rats make
closed my eyes and leapt into the fucking wind
we live with the consequences of our acceleration
we ride the moon majestic!
eyes like drills jesus christ
come see a wonder of the modern man
we live in the shadow of the scorch
under the goddamn suicide moon
she; we have lost synchronicity
i used to dream in colors and endless repetitions
we run this engine on madness on things best forgotten
"she had goddamn typhoon eyes, baby"
ignoring gravity a monster in steel and brass
she; the sun on your face the knife at your back
the clench
the ever creep: failing in every lifetime
the cruel predictability of morning
get high dream as the snake dreams
the ache unstoppable
"forever  in the rain lost, broke and insane complain complain complain"
my cell walls are collapsing i am becoming someone new
inside the cage of ribs where pain is born
woke up on hell's blasted shore
organizing the brain worm collective
"we carry a heavy ruin, baby"
to become tangible for one goddamn fleeting moment
close your eyes and concentrate let the tiger eat the snake
the dreamer who has forgotten how to dream
radioactive daydreams of nuclear tomorrows
you feel it because this knife is the truth
i won't dream  not of you  not of any fucking thing
guardian days
we walk above the sea
the breeze is cold my soul is squid  do we know what the nightmares did
"the border is thin and so goddamn close, baby"
"we, these beasts of wire and fraud"
we are the bomb makers the dreamers in the desert
six seconds before the end of all things
here with the new elephant's madness
she; held out her hand told me it was the price of salvation
"aimless, just me and the goddamn river"
dreamless and daring
"just a being composed of the secret rage of rabbits, mama"
mister toil
sucking on comets hoping for a buzz
synapses and neurons and all the bullshit that goes with it
behold the traveler lost on his way
she; all the symptoms of god
i set my idiot shell to marching while my spirit visits saturn sits on the shore
"have you heard the dawn's screaming, baby"
"aggressive sadness, baby"
death fuck
we scream in deer
i say goddamn let's count the knives one two three four
ripples in the sea as the great destroyer sits up and takes notice
a monster in crystal and glass
an endless scourge of flies buzzing in my idiot brain
in a dream of rats and kings
i am the jesus whore forever and more
stifled screams blowing me up like a fucking balloon
got bottle rocket thoughts  quick and useless
"i, the universal idiot"
i am made of stone the sky has no use for me
under the skin each of my bones is leading its own little rebellion  stiff creaking aging
fucking shove the pomegranate eye
"we can all hear the devastation inside, mama"
formless and lacking that's me
she; makes no choices refuses to move the narrative further
i asked her to beat me to death with my own spine for i am a coward coward coward
"we sing that graveyard lightning, baby"
i believe the sun will rise i believe in my inevitable death i believe in you
awake and forcing the ghost back into its idiot form
oh you hellbent son of a bitch
from the womb headfirst
howling with a mouthful of dirt
we live in silence in absolute zero
vomiting a tornado
hurtling
goddamn nameless sun
"watch the swine grow roots,  baby"
bored and interchangeable
we walk the infinite trail  the pig god prowls behind ready to eat any travellers who fall
"got my rotation my orbit all fucked up, baby"
she; we are the shore the endless broken shore
aimlessly floating through space - no goals no destination
empty and futile we trudge along trudge along trudge along my molasses candy
yesterday's beast
the body in the carpet dilemma
the premeditated eye
this... this is the killing machine
in this castle where bones bend
exhausted corpse
to lie quietly among the demons
the tiger that stalks all our tomorrows knows the codes knows where the bombs are buried
"i've been dead for a million lifetimes, mama"
preoccupied by the sun burning in my belly
will you trade my idiot heart for your divine one
"because it hurts, baby  every goddamn thing hurts"
got reptile thoughts lizard dreams
make of it what you will my origami heart
eve with all new skin
cast out but daring
lost the dream on a waning crescent
the lord most most high galaxy squid brain mind
mistaken for a hero
"worms, beetles, flies and maggots goddamn do i love the clean up crew"
mr flinch
"the desert witch, in her sing song voice, calling all the little children home"
"i'm just an idiot's shadow, baby"
mama earth can't bear my touch today - so i float
vomiting snakes
may we face no challenges
we live under the weight of the sea
look behind my eye and see that time is meaningless in the big empty
how can you hope to challenge the divine when your will is weak and your knife is dull
a fool and his vision of the future... assimilation/annihilation
in a sunbeam stands the destroyer: alone and angry
love and the comfort of suborbital bombardment
the endless circling
"my god, no"
"lonely, quiet days she is the eye of the monster in the maze"
i am ruin
i don't know but i would like it to be
love on the infinite point
did i carry on unaware  did i simply not notice death's gentle touch
start the story in the middle blow out the candles and make a wish on buzzsaw drugs
"i'll sneak down your throat and steal all your bones, baby"
i am the slab man
and so we'll sink together
god loves a one-armed hooker
there is nothing for you to hold - i have devoured time i have swallowed the levitation
my mind is failing it's all sparks and the grinding sound of metal on metal
we start with rage
woke up to the hollow cheering of the grotesque
the unpossible
have you seen the horrible things have you been transformed
rats and demons in my containment suit
i'll name the new desert for you
silent witnesses marching
to put a name to the knife
"the strength to hold the hammer, just so, poised"
mr unfortunate
i found god in the million years it took this small drop of blood to hit the floor
"i don't waste smiles on fools, motherfucker"
she; all my promises are paid
baby's a bruise
hold close this desperate beauty
got monster brain
"we leapt headfirst, didn't we baby"
the crushing fist
a timelapse of my demise
we used to belong to the dawn
goddamn fishbowl bank robber thoughts
"time enough for bombs and bullets, apologies and regrets"
tired bastard tears
here in the new armageddon
the rabbit king here in heaven
across the time stream splashes of my blood
old man willow tree won't you won't you won't you eat me
down here in the belly of the beast i once met a crooked toothed prophet
so fucking bright we used to shine
i love this little spider  this little priest in the holy order of apathy
dreams of the dope man  dreams of the dope man riding an elephant
i am an idiot and she was born a myth born unknowable
an ancient accidental need
an owl has decided to destroy me
oh to curl up  in a ball so small  a ball so small  a ball so small
dangerously lost
"learn to breathe again, you son of a bitch"
granted wisdom i have begun to blur
empty ripples in the sea
i don't know i don't know under my skin the bones begin to glow
we'll be beasts together
unfuckingsustainable
she; her blood to purify
the past is more than this great dead thing it's a lesson a book a map
"when it's time i need you to run, baby"
the idiot manifests
woke up on the run chasing neon eyes
eyes bleeding acid
the unimaginable
just like there is no name for the beautiful goddess the squid worship
making wagers against the divine
the slow transformation into nothingness
in my guts monsters and spirits and the roots of the tree of knowledge
"your blood will feed the corn, mama"
i will make of myself a sacrifice
"cycling through madness, rabbits and back again"
when this goddamn sentence ends and we're all free we ride in the longest blackest cadillac we can find
we went looking for eternity but found only dread and despair
apropos jones (who goes it alone) races the day holds no doubts about the future
we are the bomb makers the dreamers of dreams
you see it  it's there  this dust was me
she; a prayer
you can't see the top but it's crumbling the tower is falling
crushed by the giant wave
the idiot triumphant
the queen of unreality
"stitch it all closed, baby"
my insides have begun to fractal - the automatic man explodes
bleeding into the next life
when the fang of the tiger meets the iron and stone of my skull
unheeded warnings from the ghost of the rat king
we are the war eternal
"i am two halves of the same idiot, mama"
split in two in four in five hundred fucking thousand
nailing my old skin to the front door just to prove i've changed
radiation smiles
burrowing deep into mama earth hoping for comfort
do you want do you need do your eyes bleed like my eyes bleed
the last rumblings of the rats
she; her heart high octane
set the piggies to dancing
like the best of us she was born to live and die and live again
everything everything everything is the same
did the swallowing of god cause the crows to come or did the crows come because i swallowed god
"all my insides are bubbles inflating, growing bigger and bigger and bigger before popping and starting again"
those lazy hazy cutthroat days
hope and other as yet to be named horrors
the idiot riddle
"short fall long burn, motherfucker"
the high line of death and life
"built this tower inside with broken stone because who gives a fuck, baby"
grow up and the destroyer will come
the weight of this life
saint happy meal the divine the lost
i open my great gaping maw and the universe trembles
the lake is poison and the fish are insane
"ask it of me freely, mama"
"take this eye, it sees the future and i want it not"
love your enemies eat your heroes
"yeah... well... slugs are goddamn miracles too, baby"
thoughts are for wicked fools
the sound of all things ending
"we got all the ingredients for disaster, toots"
the empress of the moon of the rain of things unseen
"and upon this mountain we'll make war, she said"
this is the chrysalis form millions of years in the making
that goddamn jet engine scream of her love
"everything i want is fucking catastrophic, baby"
what does the future want with an idiot like me
"dull knives and no choices right, baby"
she; rebuilt by the fox by the bees that colonized her veins
unafraid i faced the buffalo-headed girl and was destroyed
"we, one and all, ripped from the arms of the universe and cast aside"
drank the poison  leapt from the moon
get fucked dead guy blues
what fucking sense the walls make
seahorses birthing in my belly
heartless with no need for perfection
i used to know but it's all fucking empty head fish thoughts now
"reality teeters, mama"
idiot time
trying to hold the rage down to nail it in place to keep it where i can see it
god is a whore  one bullet two bullet  three bullet four
these fast fall fuckers
"aw kitten, i see the demons you carry"
"grind my bones make new drugs, baby"
"i dream no more without you, baby"
the gift a rainwater cocktail
lunatics in my guts running with knives
we used to sing songs of sadness of madness
to float off into the endless
in a galaxy spun by rage
on the occasion of your sixth life
following whale song across the lonely sea
the all-encompassing end of me
here comes death in her tight jeans
"stitching up wounds with vines and flowers, motherfucker"
evolution and the monsters of ten thousand years into the future
or is it the blood bomb behind these broken ribs
the deals we make with the dead
the eternal bleed out
but this is the skin i shed
"there is no mercy in the new day, baby"
what strange times
a bellyful of jellyfish stings
a sort of absolution
infuriating in its way
"tentacles, nettles and thorns"
the gravity eater
these are my shithead psalms mine and no others
"share with me these bird dreams, mama"
we wait and wait and wait for the queen is in irons
it's the smile behind her claws
"ah but it's the tenderest of self immolations, baby"
"my fucking skull a manhole neon green, motherfucker"
when the birds all fall from the sky
concentrating all my vast power into crashing this planet directly into the fucking sun
"we'll die and die and die again, toots"
she; i bit off your tongue to save my dreams
"you sold your soul but that's how it goes que sera, baby"
i don't understand the language of today this day monday
dance with me under the shadow of the bombs
"holes in the universe, baby"
a return to the nothing
this kingdom of rust and ruin
i don't have anything for you no encouragement  no kind words  i don't have anything for you
the magdalene the constriction  the slowing of the flow of blood to the brain
"we were brave, indestructible"
this will all end in the sky
"motherfucker, we will be beautiful, striding across this land"
"what's important now is survival, darling"
running from disaster to disaster to disaster
"on this, the hundred millionth day of life"
"tired of the apocalypse of armageddon let the fucking end times roll, baby"
here's to hissing monsters hoping
losing them to the push to the pull
headless we carry on
i am more than the cracking of my bones more than the straining of sinew more than the hollow joints between
holding saturn close to the heart
"it's the radioactive dream state, baby"
"we learned to fight, in all the most important ways, from the ants crawling across our skin"
improbable mornings
bound thin in places
in the deep far beyond midnight
"this is love's last crater, she lamented"
somewhere around spokane we began to huff the cosmos beautiful and raw
in a cave of monstrous exhaustion
the god of small holes and splinters
we bottomless babies of babylon
she; my fate is not for sale
goddamn apocalypse envy
we live under powerlines old radioactive mines  in subway tunnels with mutants unkind
"savage flowers of new planets, baby"
we sent assassins  she ate them  made them her own
the squid queen her crown of knives
"speak no guilty prayers, mama"
fucking sharing molecules with the floor right now
ships on the bloody horizon
this portal leads to nowhere to everywhere
"i will not deal with empty places and shadows right now, love"
the oblivion engine
a ribcage empty  forsaken  all the rabbits scurrying back to their holes
"be the goddamn nightingale i need, motherfucker"
grim reminders of my own humanity
"let's begin at the end, baby"
on a dare i put my heart between her jaw
lost days of the automatic boy
"vice brain got my atoms all fucking chaotic, baby"
i believed her when she said safety was an illusion
"baby, we'll crack that moon in half let the whole fucking universe tremble at the monster we set free"
the tiger knows the river doesn't share its secrets
"a hard, waiting silence"
the idiot unapologetic
"disaster, babies... disaster"
lost... is that what we are
to lie restless among the rats and snakes
she; asked me to be still
"half a dozen beats a minute that's all i got left, baby"
i hope this is the falling satellite that kills me
the improbable buoyancy of being
we'll feed ourselves to the wolves before we burn burn burn
one bullet in a rusty gun i'm not sure will fire  my sword chipped and broken my supplies gone and my horse insane
she; i am the match
"from the pit of the devourer we can still see the sky, baby"
"fingers crossed the devil finds you well, baby"
greet the day with tombstone teeth
"reset the bones in new and wonderous ways, baby"
she; we survive by becoming the mountain
"it's the big dirt nap, doll  that's what we're all racing toward"
"hush, baby  we're in trouble"
i don't care what i think about me
to save a life rabbits and squid
a pittance on the tongue
the temptation to let me do the dreaming
my fucking hands are empty  i promise they hold no light they hold no sound
cut grass and the tightening of the noose the tightening of the noose
brain dead and boiling over
gathering dust the little stop-motion boy
these useless ancient monsters
the return of the knife the rebirth of the hammer
"we live under tension, baby"
all glory lost
to be made small to understand constriction
look at the idiot look at him go
love and other suburban dead-end daydreams
"i've made sure my ghost doesn't owe any favors, mama"
hurry!  there are tigers in the walls
"drowning but that's to be expected, baby"
i will eat your toes  and eat your nose and eat your soul before it grows
a day lousy with fate
this transactional knife
this...  this will all end in tragedy
one must be quick if one wishes to stab god in the back
backwards we birth the future
"tequila, pineapple soda and a jalapeno slice for death allows no choices"
"levitating, trapped between foolish choices"
when the destroyer comes round comes round comes round
my useless skull crushed between the golden hands of god herself
battlefield exaltations exhalations
"sunday's hard death, motherfucker"
"exploding passed the limits and boundaries of my physical form, mama"
"today is his birthday, this new idiot god, born from the bones of the last"
a painting of the idiot dream
death and the stone
what needs to be found
all these rabbits rabbits rabbits escape the dimension born of my throat
the growth and migration of the thousand eyes my body contains
when heaven is a fucking goddamn away
pull the pin that god has placed
contemplating murder the cost and the time
transformed i become a field of flowers a half dozen parking lots
i turn my eye upon the great vast emptiness and i am happy
a derangement of the senses
i slept she shoved bombs down my throat
in the hollow bone of the spine where the squid live
last assassins of the apocalypse
it's in the cruel nature of her forgiveness
my little blood trail baby humming a song only she can hear
"catastrophe, sweetie... catastrophe"
"hold this victory close, baby hold it right under your ribs right next to your heart hold it where the fuckers can't touch it"
she; rages at me with the sun clenched firmly between her jaws
"leave my broken body where it falls, motherfucker"
take these prayers for the desperate cries they are
together we reap this unholy reward
you'd be forgiven for thinking we are stagnant - we travel by tide pool by hollow tree
the elegance of terminal velocity
"it's cool when the witches tell lies, baby"
wished on a fool
being condensed and compressed ever smaller smaller smaller
we live in the mouth of the monster
my typhoon baby listening to the sins of rabbits
unknowable the simplicity of the edge
"i have begun to dig, slowly steadily, i wonder what i will be on the otherside"
one rune to summon the crow one to calm the willow tree one to start the fucking buzzsaw in your mind
"one, false and beautiful"
in the dirt i am a dirt boy
she; propped on pedestal a million miles high
"share my poison eye, mama"
can you smell her quiet sky
i am gravity's aching loss
to replace what's broken a heart of plastic and pig
you and me what a lonely place to be
"it's just the crushing race to evolve, baby"
"stop your idiot dreaming and wake up, she purred"
i'd rather burn
here the queen allows no sin
we three kings  one dead one retired one on the run
"birthing old gods, pig gods and portals"
"i have no idea where this goddamn door leads, mama"
the butterflies are black and i think they might be vampires
on the run growing eyes
i am ghosts
"death and drugs and the eternal highway, baby"
an idiot with idiot dreams
we are the mountain and the fist
"put on that all-white deathmask, baby"
she; barred the doors of the temple ordered the men to take up arms
let's start the day with a lie
breathe you son of a bitch you're dying
it's in the hour of sledgehammer thoughts
figure on the cheater's toe
the seeds of my own destruction
rest breathe burn
nautilus drugs deep in the shell drugs
"escape the mind prison by grabbing the tail of a comet, motherfucker"
"inadequate warnings on the y-axis, mama"
"a queen, regal in the shade, her voice like iron, asking that all pay homage to the lovely bouquet in her dreams"
in the mouth of the whale this idiot child of god looks to make a home
messy squid thoughts invertebrate thoughts
we'll fuck like star clusters fuck
(takes a deep breath) i am an empty vessel
"put on your let's run away together dress, baby"
chasing dispatches from the ether dying in fucking deep space
dragged along on this miserable planet's journey through the stars
the voices begin to resonate find their groove scream
die and be made legend
"everything is backwards, baby  i'm an idiot learning to die"
i love the swarm the madness her crowbar heart
and upon the gods we did make war
all the land along the tracks where the train derailed is burning and the great heron lacks the strength to carry us to safety
a savage repudiation of the rain
i walked from you right into the open arms of the devil
i scream and scream and scream because honestly who listens
one hundred million miles up and struggling to breathe
"cling tight to this path of madness, baby"
"the stars, the flowers and all the other fucking glories she's birthed"
here for god herself and her crippling miracles
"yeah, you can be the queen of my kingdom of apathy"
"this world has begun to spin much too fast, baby"
maybe it doesn't say any of those things
is a heart meant to hold this much rage
all my fucking ideas are the same no escape
she; comes to me like love like a knife between the ribs
fucked by the ones and zeroes
there are jellyfish in the sky and the rabbits are down hiding hiding hiding
we search born anew
we trade gifts and count wounds
i come to you disguised as an ocean
"coffee, tea and trauma  all the way up and all the way down"
we live among this crushing new cosmos you and i
to birth a god radioactive and obscene
we can lie in the middle of the highway... invisible  rain crashing down cars screaming at the speed of light
tomorrow or tomorrow or tomorrow we'll be all tenderness and forgiveness
the desolation the horror the happy endings
"to live like an animal, motherfucker"
with no thoughts of you no thoughts of me just a need to be free mother mary  walked into the sea
"these spiders that carry me upon their back, bearing my weight, keeping me from ever touching the ground"
"i am the judge of the machines that count time, baby"
the carnival the fair this my idiot's prayer
the blessing and the ache
she; sends flowers and assassins  well wishes and a knife in the back
"do the locusts buzz endlessly in your skull too, baby"
"closer to the abyss than ever before, motherfucker"
"a breakdown of the machine, baby"
gravity is the last most dangerous trap
this day's mindless dismemberment
when you're dressed all in white and the bombs start falling
a life of alienation ignoring the summons of the tiger the fox the crow
the walls are closing in no freedom for me  kept here on this leash
"the blind stumble of my bones, baby"
the soothing of the idiot with riotous thoughts
that's the kind of thing you get destroyed for
she; the sea asked to change for me
"carved time into this bullet  past, present and future  a .45 caliber change"
a splash of blood across the sun
inhabit with me this monument to futility
"pick a vertebrae that doesn't birth little squid in my spine, baby"
holding this form
my body is shifting transforming into some dying thing
"this monstrous thing, ya dig"
a smile because it's easy
"woo ha save me, baby"
my sanity balanced on a knife edge no hands reaching for safety no cares for the wounded
"rage like a fire burning through my fucking skull i am untouchable now, motherfucker"
crawling out of my skin ready to eat the goddamn universe
i am the forest i am the trees petrified and diseased
nothing matters and yet i continue to talk and talk and talk and talk some fucking more
touch my golden bones
she; with the smile of a killer born
"you can't touch my knife fight girl, baby"
in the garden drinking blood red wine with the king of forget-me-nots
"the old blind fox, that master of time, has seen our end  yours and mine"
every day a gift from a lunatic
i feel the doom  i feel the dread  i feel the doom i feel the dread
"kumbaya, little knife kumbaya"
already steeped in ancient madness  how do you insult such a being
"i wish to love nothing anymore, she said"
hey look at the god monster
we hold no lightning yet this world will burn
some days unabashedly human
on the sentience of dust
"the tide receded and left us all behind, baby"
"in the spine of god, motherfucker"
"i would get up and live but why, goddamn it, why"
"you can't cut me, diamond girl"
"and brightest we burn, baby"
with her sundress prophecies
this is my idiot life complete with its idiot stories and its idiot battles
the battle of the snake the fire
she; light blue graveyard eyes
i am god herself's unlucky boy
it's intolerable this day to day
in my mind manifesting acid rain
"it's cool, baby  every day i fall farther and farther from the truth"
the light doesn't shine this far out
this heart's eerie wail
out in the desert out in the universe looking for a fight
the blood is purple is crystal is insane
the still life of an idiot
here's the thing bang bang
i wish to die in the fall and not under the hard stare of this ungrateful bastard
killers in cute dresses
"we ran so far from paradise,  mama"
all day dandelion rage
this shared vision of unearthly horrors
"you, me and these dreams of drowning, baby"
in a bid to seduce the sun
the unholy ice
all her rockets armed and fired
swords are dulled in the time of the raggedy man
oh the glory of immortal nihilism
i am an idiot and these are my idiot ruins
the vast empty expanse between here and there  my heart and yours
on the edge in the fist of the giant
these blood black midnight days
"i've been told that life is cheap in the jaws of the tiger, mama"
out here in the depths of deep space where we can forget who we used to be
we die slow
"needless like blame, baby"
restless little spoon thoughts tonight
sentenced to the mind sludge
the destruction of simple things
tea and the fat tittied fertility goddess of my soul
chasing love and death through my guts
here where we scatter and are reborn
"hush, before your dreams are born"
you and me a sailor unknown
"treacherous, baby"
once upon a time after i fought the giant but before i swallowed the forest there was you
"through all the valves, tubes and chambers the destroyer stalks my heart"
the bombs we vomit
together we learn the secret incantations of rabbits
the apocalypse came and took our hand took our hand took our hand
solitude and earthworm dreams
little early for death to come calling
"scoundrels in the fucking flowers, baby"
a skull filled not with a galaxy but a sea a sea full of whale song
she; built different built with new wicked geometries
the idiot meat that makes up me
all these amazing things we'll fail to do
failure and all my carefully crafted spells
we the mad
left for dead behind the rows
i remember the trail and where she hid her knives along it
"i am all fears, baby"
in the sunshine with their jaws unhinged a torture of demons stand waiting
a vicious accounting
the magdalene is on the run as apropos jones curses the ghost of johnny six-guns dead too soon
what desperate and foolish creatures we are
that pussycat schedule
an idiot in stone
a savage need to test myself against the fire
it's the cruelest cut
fractal witches
all new thoughts soft and strange
x for attack  lightspeed cadillac
a tower of lightning and bones for her to call her own
"crashing because that's what we do best, baby"
the great adrenaline wave
mister ominous and the black cloud babies
just a girl named forever
wishes and fishes for the pig god
rejoice! for once again she wields the celebration blade
rain on me you son of a bitch make me grow
this tin whistle thinks thoughts incomprehensible
anarchy planet
it's too early for midnight but there it is
shove the earth down my throat i think i'm forever
chapter one:  this american ruin
i am a slug man
under the clouds where the dead bugs fall
"you love me because i'm an angel a goddamn gossamer winged angel, motherfucker"
we did but grant the tiger the powers of god
"we still have a couple of useless forevers left, mama"
"reality is weak, baby we can break that motherfucker"
let's count them: anger bubbles in the brain one two three
on the brows of fools
things like the bare minimum
she's a buzzsaw girl with a cemetery mind
victims of the dying light
and upon the back of an elephant we ride the sun
the survivability of life in the tiger's jaw of a million mile fall
"that's a pretty big fucking word ""if"""
"i will eat the goddamn sky if it brings a smile to your insane eyes, baby"
an overwhelming burst of gravity
she; my heart's violence
sunshine days and pain
"we are rabbits dancing in traffic, mama"
"wanna watch me wrestle with your fictions, baby"
the life of an idiot in these modern times
pray for a new form
"fading, old man... fading"
take my hand and be transformed
inverted jabbing fingers into my fucking brain the underside of my skull behind my goddamn eyes
lost the steps
deep in my guts the devil fiddles his unlucky tune
maniacs and marigolds that's what we are
hot pussy drugs sing crow songs
the automated man lost in his kaleidoscope of time
i let the ocean sleep
she; your atoms don't belong with me
"on the fabric of space time we huff the fucking cosmos, baby"
a prisoner in this valley of fools
i am a husk a hollow man push your finger against my chest watch that fucker go right through
cursed by a desert witch to smile at strangers
she's a riot in rainbow  a revolutionary in paisley
"we've all taken our turn dancing with the bloody corpse of the queen, baby"
before we begin this day lies in ruins
little stories moths tell
faster and faster and faster and faster we spin
forbidden angels say your name
packed my consciousness into a cube capable of surviving the ether
"the earth shakes a new grave, baby"
i can't make the rabbits count or the horses sing  or make the moon do any goddamn thing
these long hot skull bleached white tiger days
the buzzsaw hum of proper thoughts
"chased through the spirit world only to end up at your fucking front door, baby"
i'm not dying just because you think i should
"harsh is the dreaming, baby"
one soul broken by the knife left behind
you are going to die and i can't save you
legs that stride the other fucking side of infinity
"a flowers crown of media, mayhem and violence"
the outrageous fuels of the failure engine
"just the most beautiful moon-touched son of a bitch you will ever see, baby"
the finality of this idiot form
"far from endings here, mama"
immutable  the science of wolf and rabbit
whispered my secrets to a yellow bird then sent that motherfucker to meet god
love lies malice
desperate for something softly
gave free reign to the pig god in the hollow of my skull
dreams in pinks in reds in rage in blue
the making of a maniac
the slinking away
these are the spells the rabbits know
howling brain sludge and the never never
"there is a great doom upon us, baby"
feeling like the long slow march will be the end of me that the tiger will come and devour me that god herself will turn her eyes from me
oh to be the envy of time
it's for the men made of glass
for in the morning comes the worms
minutes minutes more minutes madness
i can feel the fucking record skip of my spine happening in real time
i need new elements to remake this idiot body
"hey toots, how about a slow dance in the shadow of the destroyer"
the cruel weight of the sky
prisoner of a hollow tree
"tell me late night stories, baby"
i am the lightyear man out where nothing matters anymore
"the blinding truth, motherfucker that's what we have left"
in her glory we reside live and die where and why
burning thoughts of an empty skull galaxy
she; rewards this nonsense with beauty
"when your mind is all misfires, wires and electrodes"
she; flowing
fed my cautious heart to the pigs
the cosmos continues on its goddamn way oblivious to old father time just waiting to end this fucker
in the beginning was the mire the hungry trap
been asleep all those years
twice dead and spiraling
modern lessons in lethargy
we should all be screaming screaming like fucking poseidon crashing into the shore
smoking crow feather drugs
"no kisses for fools, she said"
cast in granite the pain of a thunder cloud
"let your dreams fuck my dreams, baby"
"i need lights, saving and you, baby"
"the men of brass, those agents of the destroyer, have come to witness our end"
interdimensional beings in the flower garden again
and then there's me paying a hideous price
love my milk and cookie soul
"a less painful redemption, baby"
the bombs are desperate
days made of diamonds
a nibbling insanity
beware!  for today is the day of the tiger
all rage in a pink dress
"goddamn, baby  we are the monsters under ice"
old man laser eyes
useless thoughts rattling rattling rattling around
sing a song of simple minded saviors
old broke down systems and their little devils dancing
an opening of the cage  a prayer to the morning
here's to shakespeare's beast all stupid and insane
acid brain
"mama, nowadays we write eulogies not comedies"
let the spiders come and do their dance for me
these long slow funeral days
"a million goddamn flies from my gaping mouth, baby"
i stand on the threshold with a handful of gold and a bag of blackened teeth
"carnivorous hearts carry through, baby"
"the whisper of these fucking birds telling us to run, baby, run"
here in the bone-white desert
i decompose and decompose and decompose again
we pray in purple greatness around here
"all tomorrows are stalked by tigers, motherfucker"
this erasure  these explosions  karmic in nature
i'd love to be the one who cares
there will be fire if god wills
dragging planets in my wake
"the life support systems are failing all around us, baby"
she sings she dances the little pink fish of eternity
as of now... i exist
rabbits and crop circles  memories in boxes sealed by golden chains
in my guts love's terrible pressure
"let's kill the sun, baby"
a circle ever expanding
i am the ever creep the idiot king the boy destined to fail
"kisses, last deaths and frivolous breaths"
to begin again  to feed my soul to the beast
lost before we've even begun
listen for the idiot wind
i remember the weights of chains and the crashing of waves
i buried the squid deep down in my mind and pressed the self-destruct button
a secret harboring
she; i live my life bomb blast loud
hold her dangerous
empty temples to the god of boredom
a twisting away from the light
"why don't we make a break for the stars, motherfucker"
the corruption has spread to the books
these angel fucks
"i planted the sunbeam tree, baby"
"down here, where i'm expected to be alone, i tell all my hopes and failures to the beetles, centipedes and spiders"
the amazing now
"we raise monsters here, mama"
a star all filled up with fear
the sad sad lament of the destroyer
"do you know? it's a maelstrom, motherfucker"
a day for savage joy
idiot dreams
the subtle art of dying alone
trained by the lash and the promise of forgetting
what am i to you but a burden of time
it's love it's raining snakes
bullets named love revenge hope strife leaving action
watering poison flowers
"survival instincts and the bare minimum, baby"
swimming to the bottom
my guts burn and yet i exist
i won't live through this
quiet now the engines are failing
jamming my face into the swirling maelstrom hoping to catch a glimpse
"nightmares are born in small forests at the end of cozy lanes, baby"
a gift of the static knife
take the tiger take the fox  hide in the between
"we'll spit on the devil's wishes, baby"
swallow the serpent swallow infinity
this fucker peeling away my atoms
all my idiot cares burned in her eyes
she; tells sweet stories of imperfections
the turning into itself reversible unknowable
because he's killing me...
the great and steady diminishing
the ache of the slowly slowly shrinking
"why you gotta fuck with me, albatross chick"
ate your breath
"the wires, sticks and bones i used to make my children"
horror horror horrors of this new world
"made of goddamn iron, mama"
this is the eye that sees sideways in time
trapped a million fucking miles underground
splintered fractured broken splintered fractured broken that's the mantra that's the spell
"the big biz that runs my mind, motherfucker"
i am god's whore
"you, me  maggot cases and love"
"i took the devil's fork to the eye, baby"
what does she do with these broken things she collects
grown inward... forgetful
ceremonies lost in time
this monstrous son of a bitch all neon teeth and strawberry eyes
a throbbing of the fingers
"we are all, each of us in our own way, damned"
the blood the tooth the long memory of the fox
i will not dream any further
"she's the queen of flies, baby"
a messiah in chains
"i gotta go catch a breeze, motherfucker"
i am an idiot and i speak from my knees
that's what i get for asking a drunk about love
love lies bleeding
play to win spiders under my skin
blender brain
smile like you've never meant anything
she; her heart pulsing with lights and madness
old wishes/ new umbilical cords
"have mercy on this misbegotten son, mama"
boys and fish with idiot hearts
given an eternity everything would eventually fall by the wayside and be forgotten
still life of my smashed face
"we, the products of her curse"
"i'll trade my fucking brain parasites for your  brain parasites, baby"
"monsters and vices don't leave me now, baby"
we've forgotten the rituals the steps to the dance so this fucking world burns
kill this day
here come the squid thoughts cave-diver thoughts
bite mark beauty
howl at the dirt
headless carryings on
wounds from love and child assassins
rabbits and gods and ghosts tribes separated by madness
this diseased heart beating at the center of eternity
fucking hyenas in my guts looking for an escape
"it's a forest in time an endless mangrove, motherfucker"
we will be the mask the future wears
here's the thing about explosions in the sky
"she;  fools, maniacs and more"
little layers of stars
we'll count traps
made of simple miracles
"low on the list of catastrophes, baby"
maybe i'll just step from the path of time
i should be dying but instead i'll sleep
"inertia isn't love, sweetie"
first it's the cage
it's the clarity that will drive us mad
she; was the bomb blast the after image burned into your eyes
the ghost of the rat king burns
a burden of choices
the big later
vomiting up the night
oceans and snakes in my little spoon dreams
a dream clothed in the desert
the groove has passed me by found me wanting
neither david nor goliath  no victory over the seemingly insurmountable  no king for a destined kingdom
"my rage, while exceptional, is ultimately fucking useless"
"you and me, baby  we'll go where the ghosts have their own stories"
the estimated weight of the ocean
we kill feelings
lightning behind the eyes but still... an idiot alone
on this day where steel is needed
sludge pressure high
kaleidoscope thoughts of the killer
rats in my guts
scream like you know the refrain like you've heard the pain
randomly finding yourself in the skin of the destroyer
in this cage a clone of my heart  red beating wasted
wandering terrified a hideous beauty
"unrealistic expectations of safety, baby"
when you're a bag of beef and your girl is the sun
she; a slow dance in time
trapped in this crumbling form
this drug holds galaxies this drug kills monsters this drug forgets this drug remembers
"anger, forgiveness and the demands of being human"
she; is a river and that river runs red
what you really hear is the mocking laughter of the devil
all these new things crawling about
demented by the snake by what ends by what begins
when the plates of your skull begin to pull away and separate and the madness begins to leak
the sixteenth dimension the paisley
life under the blade
it's the very nature of the dreamer
a million little abominations
lost among these dangerous days
a great big giant steel fucking bear trap (say it again) a great big giant steel fucking bear trap
fuckin' a  cannibals in the heartland
bound she held my pieces in place
"no hints about the future, baby"
we are the snakes we are the snakes in the dark
the blackhole life behind your eyes behind the barrel of the gun
"the sky is shakey today, mama"
the ever creep meets her lawless eternity
tentative touches of terrible importance
love and other unmarked escape routes
come the witches come the circus
we live here in the castle end times
maniacs dream of growing large enough to step from planet to planet
thoughts of the knife of god herself of rockets failing during reentry
here for the despair of the sun
in the flowerbed bleeding out
will you take these phantoms to have and to hold
"yes, my love, i am the madman who controls the sun"
spending time in the cosmic mind prison
watch a motherfucker ramble
"new and painful synapses firing all at once, baby"
she; to eat of her earthly garden
the knife in my fucking head cartel
at the end of this path where my mind goes to die
emotional scarecrows and other myths of the modern man
i stir the idiot angels awake
which one of you bastards remembers how to be a time bomb
i conjure the locusts breathe them into being
"one open-handed slap please, god"
"hey, look, it's the dust that was once me"
secrets of the court magician
it's the long sleep
"what's left, mama  the sky has already fallen"
mechanical men and their little brass world
"shotgun sonnets, motherfucker"
opening my mouth for the acid rain
"wasp dreams, baby"
do stars die and collapse in on themselves do your thoughts leave scars
each letter of the alphabet  a tribute to the insane
"breathe into my fucking wounds, baby"
you had a dream once she was in it and she was the truth
pigs with sly smiles
idiots know this is the hour when the claws of the vulture rend your belly
a great stillness
it's a goddamn whale song suspended from the heavens
scattering atoms  i am the traveler
talk to the witch about the crush about steel on bone
the tiger with his greed mother's speed
damaged like i knew the plan
the song won't die with me
i'm nobody's fucking happy meal toy you son of a bitch
tickled by fingers with six knuckles
"swallowing feelings, saltwater and blood"
mother mary motherfucker
"we're a riot in technicolor today, mama"
"the fox's cosmic retaliation, baby"
these are the drugs that learned the steps that know the dance
the day of the closed fist
crashing into morning dragging the sun angrily behind
fucking eyes like coals  like grenade pins
smashing my face drywall portrait
the squid is behind the eyes again feeling like a million different citrus tree thoughts
how do the lifeless feel pain
all angles and sharp edges
we sit rusty and old
the monster is me
i hide for i am the turtle and the destroyer runs free
under the lakes in the ghost towns
she; we held hands and screamed
(save me)
the roads have all changed their mind... gone rogue i have know idea where the fuck they go anymore
i suppose i will become as the mountain
more important than the when is the where in time you wish to travel: miss by a day land dying in fucking empty space
the dance of old liars
we the usurper
"sins and bones, baby"
old man death reads his book  he reads that shit slow no mistakes in his hollow
the goddamn mutant mushroom fungus moss exploding from my chest
can you see my mind being burned to ash
"the difference, motherfucker, is i learned her song"
never forget the handful of coins they threw in the dirt at your feet
i trust my idiot skull here between her jaws
in her need for destruction she drags planets closer
to stand bold in the path of annihilation
eat the prophets
"in love's horrid debt, baby"
the chaos of their leaving
dreams unknowable their nature dangerous
chained to the tiger no two doors the same
i refuse to rot  no no no
firing all the rockets at once  hoping against hope for escape
the pain the river causes on its way
shapeless formless  like love like the eye of a crow
"leave me for dead in the mud fossilize me, motherfucker"
hell is ours we guard the gates
these are pomegranate dreams fucking jellyfish thoughts
the rain and its plunder
you know how it is flowers for maniacs
"time sings for me, motherfucker"
tilting towards the sun nerve endings dying by fire
the ghost of the rat king and his neverending quest to blot out the sun
we're all velocity go go go
"the rabbits are gnawing on the walls, baby"
gestating a ferocious anger
the destroyer is out on the roads; dancing
an idiot faces the mountain
the engine sputters and dies but the devil he goes round and round
here stars explode  the immortals the tiger the fox
rhymes about bullets
vomiting black hole skies
this cowardly heart doesn't know the words
watching the world blur
the planet eater in time
face first into goddamn infinity
the drugs that lock your jawbone
"we hide on raindrop sized planets, mama"
witches dream caterpillar dreams
this is life on the brink
it's quieter now but she still sings
the sad geometry of my being
my baby my gallows girl
early morning the summoning of the damned
me and this idiot tongue
in my mind the jungle the snake
"nobody speaks to me, baby  i am the broken bone"
does she remind you of your destruction
she; can only see what's behind me
smashing my bones into the wall making flowers
in the temple of the rabbit where the ghosts abound and the fox isn't welcome
new worlds to conquer and corrupt
rage on the knife edge of abandon
the ever creep looks at eternity
it's a heartbreak in watercolor pastels
"reality is a fucking sucker's game, toots"
"we are lazarus  up from the dead, motherfucker"
"i'll race the storm into your arms, baby"
idiot fables
how am i supposed to live when i'm being crushed from the inside out
my skull is all fucking tectonic plates moving moving moving
immense impossible eternal forever
there's a squid in my guts and he's trying to fucking destroy me
"recognize the life in me, now"
to break creation
i gave the gift of time to the elephant and made her god
risk it all to avoid the hammer
in the desert where we trap spirals in cubes and monsters give kisses
"i have swallowed the deer horns, swiftly running hooves and all"
yeah... she loved him execution style
i am god's melting boy
"because the con never ends, baby"
gravity's bitch
these arrows we fling at destiny  these motherfuckers doomed to miss their target
is she your fucking redemption
"these birds don't care if i'm dying, mama"
i got fuck you tears
"these are the pills to see the stars, baby"
begin to burrow to dig to hide
here's a hope for mechanical dreams
"all maps lead to the end, baby"
everything broken and nothing has held
we live our lives in flames
in the depths? monsters
"we live right fucking out loud on the point of this needle, baby"
every tick a hammer blow
my bones have begun to stretch and twist
today i'll be as the jungle
i can take no more no more rage  no more sadness no more
shoving handfuls of bombs down my throat hoping for divinity
ancient and naive  i exist like a goddamn fool
a disaster in dreamy day-glo
"tell me sad things today, baby"
subtle death chants
trapped in golgotha this fucking million mile necropolis
we have begun to pulse
"what is this thing, this horrible messy thing, trying to escape the cage of my skull"
bronze age survival tips
these thieves of sunlight
thoughts dry like the ghosts of rivers
we buy seeds for poisonous trees
the inevitable and the spiral
how do i face this fuck  courageous
she; all beauty and rapid evolution
"these quiet streets belong to the destroyer now, honey"
"you'll suffer for that crown, motherfucker"
level with the universe
find her standing in the center of the whirlwind; defiant
i can't exist down here if you do too (at least not in the same way)
stretched beyond insanity
the death of type
compensating for the safety bubble
"we are in the age of the cobra, baby"
a rope for feral thoughts
"i know what we'll do, baby we'll make fucking war on the sky that's what we'll do"
through the eye stems and thorns stems and thorns
and a horse run to madness
holding close a mechanical evil
"neon warbands riding across my blazing sky, baby"
her harsh spears
what a spineless sort of forgiveness
she; with her poison eyes
"this is the universe where i hold it all together, motherfucker"
the thrill kill cult and the knives they breathe
touching the scorch of her mind
"bless this heartfelt shamble, baby"
"you, me and the trembling new world"
"frequencies  these are the things, ya dig"
all fucking rusting nights just all fucking rusting
i lie and the cosmos dances to the tune
all this blood falling
the goddamn audacity of something so beautiful
a legend screaming in a red dress
i believe that birds fly because they're all bastards full of sin with no coins for the ferryman
these broken things i hold so dear
sharing time with death
"tilting this toilet earth wildly off its axis, baby"
these wounds we share
johnny six-guns takes one to the head apropos jones goes it alone
the future is all  tigers and forgetting  tigers and forgetting  tigers and forgetting
she's quick with her fists a devil in pigtails
"push your luck and she'll leave you on your cross, motherfucker"
who will fall first me or the raindrop
trapped by gravity raised on a decaying planet
the unceasing circle
screaming at rocks and buffalo
"every now and again reality wobbles, baby  wobbles like a son of a bitch"
reaching across the sky to join her rebellion
i am grey and thousand-legged
digesting... dying
the things i see and the things i believe or maybe the desert has emptied its monsters just for me
"each one, in their own way, stopped to plunge a knife in"
hopeless hearts hold harder (or so i've been told)
"the sky doesn't dance for just you, mama"
the drugs the forsaken the reset
she; i wish these truths were lies
i was hoping you'd see the pattern
my guts have been replaced with roots and blossoms
"she's a fucking deathray, baby"
we the unbroken chain
just another garbage day in a long line of garbage days
running face first into the wall... over and over and over again
the courage to pluck the offending eye from its socket to blind yourself to the future
regal in her extremes
organic molecules and the great suffering
here for the hideous nature of forever
"sunflowers in the nuclear holocaust, baby"
i am an idiot and these are my myths
this asshole with his funhouse mirror mind
this is the umbilical and it leads back to god  this is the umbilical and it leads back to god
what a useless fucking thing is a name
in the teeth of the tiger stand reflections of our fate
"gave my wishes to the breeze, motherfucker"
"one bullet left and i named it the end, mama"
she; relentless in her need in her fire
i will eat the kaleidoscope sky and be born anew
"just a catalog of future sins, baby"
curses both old and new one for me one for you
"i still have fight left in me, little rabbit"
i am a jellyfish hold my soul to the light
in the mouth of the trap
"all the heads of the hydra have grown back, darling"
we're in the no place now
"the tragedy of the pig god told here only for you, baby"
"born whole, screaming and lost"
yesterday with her broken reflections
this hierarchy of fools
a hunger in time
my mind is exploding slowly and in reverse
do you remember  your dreams where birds are machines  vicious little murder scenes where nothing  is as it seems
"we, the survivors of this hell world"
how to rid yourself of fire
the arch of her foot as she climbs to heaven
"we'd advise against caution, baby"
we ride the bitter end
have pressed my hand to the sun have felt the burning
the devil has come and she asked for a dance
my little baby a nuclear winter
the elders are fools and worse
my bare hands digging a hole to the center of the world my bare hands digging a hole to the center of the world
"cavalier, motherfucker the destroyer walks among us"
fate is a fox a paisley shimmer
a dream of danger
the pig god preaches time slippage... now we're lost
dionysus alone
"a quick brass kiss, baby"
in the midst of the never man
i exhale the forest's golden light
"hexes, flexes and sexes"
here we swallow the cold veil of eternity
i float through space  the fox sits lonely outside the window we are not the same
forever is a fucking axe to the face
together apart we dream these mechanical dreams
can't catch the idiot boy
"it's the fucking iridescent celestial semen of god herself, baby"
in that purple field where death greets the new arrivals
and my sunshine girl dances
"who says you're owed a lifetime, motherfucker"
"shaken loose from the tail feathers of the devil bird plummeting straight down now, baby"
i'm a forest on fire  racing towards midnight  deathwish breakneck speed
this eye throbs it sees the future
a simple angry beauty
there is an egg in my brain and it's cracking... fucking cracking
we breathe through the scabs
"a glorious waste of a reincarnation, baby"
212 the thief of bones
in her palm the sun bright as fuck deadly and radioactive
prisoners of the mind sludge
love in the fallout
the time has come for monsters
the tiger smiles the machines whisper of transmitting consciousness tomorrow belongs to them
"she's my fatal future, baby"
i am a mechanical man with mechanical plans
motherfucker do you wonder why there are blurry birds in the sky
the great reversal
"in a maze with the minotaur, two bullets and a looming left turn"
"i lie to children, the roots of trees and you"
swallowed the tornado seeds
the empress machine  flexed her mind  changed her boundaries
"tonight it's goddamn knives for the moon, baby"
how much more can i take trapped on this fucking plague ship waiting my goddamn turn
the lizard brain screaming  again again again
we are the searchers of forever the hunters of eternity
"no more conventional weapons left in her arsenal, mama"
another rotation spent screaming on this hell world
losing motherfuckers in the spirit world
"we will be the breeze, baby  just goddamn untouchable"
"today we ignore ghosts and breathe in clouds, baby"
in the head space where the squid king is insane
am i at least the sea
this rune means motherfucker and she carved it in my bones
"the lies come easy when the river splits, baby"
just a fool in love with the radioactive crater that is the future
but doesn't everybody dream of rockets exploding in deep space
and a sword sheathed in earth
i asked for understanding she pointed at a bird dressed in white
resplendent in red in rage in love
the secrets we've eaten the secrets held close  the secrets deep down in the guts
earthbound and beautiful
hazy like spiders made of fire running through your veins
"no mama, these are the drugs that illuminate"
woke up nowhere in sight of the path
the triumph and tragedy of tomorrow
the mystics are at the controls the machine has found its groove
searching for a knot to hold
"baby, i'll break"
this is the failure seed
i have eaten nothing but shadows today
"put a flower behind my ear and a bullet through my skull, baby"
naturally damned
she; doesn't sing her song for just anyone
"my mind is empty, hollow sins written in sand, motherfucker"
we'll be together: a fusing a melding of bone
blinded by the eyes of the machine
"the sky is a liar, mama"
"no speed limits, codes or philosophies"
"goon talks, baby"
anxiety like breathing in deep space
angels and rabbits in sunbeams
"we vote for shadows, lost time and mirages"
tiger jaws and infinite outcomes
and a line of sky just for you
undone in time
girls made of mountains and boys in ballgowns
floating recklessly towards the sun
it's all holes and empty places
the thing about survival
don't you know yet? there is no safety no place to be warm
gut shot love
this scream is a lightyear
"i'll step up and burn, baby"
"hush now, baby the door is empty"
we beat our fists uselessly against the tough hairy hide of the pig god but he feels it not and wouldn't care if he did
lost and all the guides have fled
i open my mouth and monsters fall out
"girls with bloody strawberry mouths, motherfucker"
god has etched my name on her bullet has spun the chamber
the vibe outside making the walls pulse
"the holy vice of god and the crushing of my skull, baby"
and so we crashed the bird holding up the sky
a cathedral inverted spiraling down into the dark
i can't hold tight to the dream it's much faster than i proved to be
a madness of clarity
it's the jump off - the point in time where we fall recklessly towards earth
a gut full of canaries
these are the drugs that make your spine twist
lie in this field with me we'll count birds and ants and clouds
"run a desperate test tell me if i have a soul, mama"
"these are the lunatic hours, baby"
gather our forces for today we make war upon the sun
"it's all about the moon in her white dress, motherfucker"
the demons and the elephants sing tra la la
the idiot and the lady strange
8 is hell
"the eternal bottle, baby"
cake in the afterlife
this night (as all nights) on repeat
my insides on my outsides  my insides on my outsides my insides on my outsides
have you swallowed whole the river  have you inhaled the wind from the west have you challenged fucking god
beauty in the crater of the destroyer
we don't deserve saving
"flowers with angry smiles, baby"
goddamn atmosphere oppressive too hot too close
crawled in and felt the teeth of the monster brush against my skull
sweet songs of the sinner
i walk invisible through tomorrow
it's all personal it's all the weight of the turtle
she; the comet queen  the fire in between the dark
caught a glimpse of her inferno
"sentenced to the pull, baby"
watch me die in the big ever expansion
god bloat
the silly divine drugs that make this whole horrible world spin round
all the little bunnies chasing their little bunny eternities
this is ganymede: a prison of your own making
can't contain the idiot chaos inside
white hot and stupid
she; does the dreaming when my mind is broken
"because i'm a pilgrim  a goddamn motherfucking space pilgrim, baby"
carrion days
held by gravity and its gossamer chains
god herself's giant swinging space dick has got my tongue too big for my mouth
and we go  back and forth back and forth back and fucking forth
"because, motherfucker she breathes fire and doesn't care if you fall"
listen to no man
drama and destabilization
"just one hug in this hellscape, mama"
fucking burning world babies dance and we watch watch watch
tales of uncertain futures
"just a foolish boy and his foolish wishes, baby"
tender is the moment the advent of the destroyer
"let the steel take him, she dismissed"
slow to start with this goddamn knife in my heart
"i can see the fluorescent future burning through my fucking eyelids, baby"
occasionally beautiful with the daffodil's shared rage
"hiding is what i do best hide hide hide, motherfucker"
swept downstream in fire and flame but still expected to face the new day with a smile
the neverending suck
in my fucking guts an avalanche
she; with her planet crushing eyes
in the desert lives a witch with long fingers three knuckles each
"sharp teeth, black eyes a waste of a heart"
fucking cosmic ineptitude
"baby, i live a life of iconic failures"
"karmic reverberations, baby"
sunshine and the coward's kiss
on the banks  of an inland sea where that bitch buried me my ghost sits and cries for all eternity
woke up to the idea of my own destruction
something has gone wrong with the tightening of a jaw bone
without the cruelty of men
in this field we live alone
time and her serrated teeth
a failure of imagination of borders and boundaries
a dance with the murder machine
dying in the slow time sunday
i won't stay where the blade is dull
"i desire to see the end of you, whispered the ghost bunny carelessly"
t-minus tidal failure the moon crashing back into earth seven billion years
broken down to my most basic of atoms what is the price of one man's life
"be careful, she hoards promises and forevers"
brass locks on an iron cage in the void of my skull  the old gods rage
the great design of love's new pattern machines
passed through eternity last night
"floating, body filled with bubbles bubbles bubbles bubbles"
broken apart slowly the destroyer assigns a number
just a lunatic gonna kiss the sun
idiot chemistry
"my evolution, with all it's flaws and failures, continues"
a man of forward motion
you begin to follow the string tied to my little finger but soon realize jupiter is too fucking far
a giant baobab tree has unexpectedly sprung to life in my room it's shade perfect for dreaming or recounting sins
living chronologically
the three martini queen dying for your sins
haunted and slow to bloom
the turtles have come  one by one the turtles have come  one by one
my fucking brain is quicksand is sludge is mud
three cheers for the degradation of my soul
from the flames the fat-tittied fertility goddess breathes new life
i am the raggedy king
we'll take a cadillac a fucking million miles long and ride it right around this goddamn sun
you me we aren't free our sins are easy to see
"yeah, once upon a time i held fucking star in my hand, baby"
my monster's name was potential
held underwater by the cold regard of the machine
"the holy trinity of forever, never and someday"
the worms have come gigantic and terrifying
remedial foxes
buried under the sun
"a knife between the ribs gives a man plenty of time to count blades of grass, baby"
that copper penny taste of blood and despair and roses made of sugar
we live in those moments between screams
to share a dream in a whore's garden
crossed through the past swallowed the future
we slip silently into the wake of the destroyer
i sometimes forget that we are what we destroy
dreamt i was in a spring field knocked up by a son of a bitch
mainlining the wretched right into the machine
i gather around me the crumbling walls of one bullshit cathedral after another
"storm clouds, mama  that's the feeling you're feeling"
wrapped in the golden robe of brutal prayers
the broadcasting of my evolution
"i have horns and mountains growing from my head, baby"
everyday cosmic rays blasting my fucking brain
frozen halfway between rebirths
i have been found wanting
your eyes would explode if you were forced to see as god herself sees
you can be the snake that chases the rat around my heart
"a queen whose fucking love is a guillotine, baby"
destroy the idea that you deserve the sun
in the belly of the whale we six fools sit and wait
the rebellion of the daisies
at war with my bones my math my sins
"little disasters of the heart, baby"
the god seed and i
led astray by an iron smile
the fox the rainbow forever repeat the fox the rainbow forever  repeat
neon in her loveliness the divine pussy supreme
what the fuck do i know about crows
under the mountain buried sin  soldiers made of tin
"i need new chemicals new compounds  a whole new fucking me, baby"
her eyes the whirlwind all rage and fluffy clouds on a sunny day
the ever creep came and saw eternity
forcing my idiot molecules to run in reverse
"let's go steal a fucking ocean, baby"
on the back of the tiger rode the destroyer  with eyes aflame and sword held high
"if you ask nicely i will loan you this moon, she said sweetly"
the simple act of holding your breath for a million fucking years
the forever girl plays no games
crying mercury tears
we run from the jaws the eyes the heart
gravity's impossible chains
hiding in the circle somewhere between the mouth and the tail
"these are the atoms of the knife's edge, baby"
the seed's harsh awakening
we can lie among the grasses and watch the end come
we have fallen from the sky
the groove has found me and found me wanting
"the god of fire and misspent bombs and bitter, bitter stories"
we'll go to ground... you and i
a story of the colossus
engines without fuel failing life support the sheer unimaginable scale of space
"thistles and bomb whistles, baby"
his teeth are sharp and ever-growing  ever-growing  ever-growing
opened my eyes upon hell comfortable in my redemption
even the sun's great fire isn't eternal
"forever has a weight, child"
you know the feeling that early midnight feeling
at night we give the desert to the sea the moon the monsters
some of us have to make it we can't all be ghost ships
drinking and dying and all the things in between
"bold of the tears to decide for you, baby"
and we float float float float float
she; because a queen needs to see
"the rotting carcass of the pig god will provide you no sustenance, baby"
"blessed by the sword, we run"
god herself running the shakedown
oh but the tigers have come wrapped in the sun
the great starship despair
the sky feels close today... imposing
"sorry, face full of snails"
the rot
chapter 8: bruises
temporal happiness
even though they hate me for it i still tell the trees my sins
"we don't make men here, darling"
we gather together today to sing the praises of the sacrificial lamb
even a fool like me can bear witness to the destroyer
"i sing jet fighter songs, baby"
these are the hounds of the sun
behold the bitter man with bitter thoughts and his bitter plans
the grinding of teeth of bones  of the monsters beneath
and the spies in the night sky
he got turned around lost little agent of the empire
sewed my eyes shut and my flaws to my chest
the truth is a fire the truth is a knife
lost in the empty places of my own skull
this thing and that thing i am a turtle  she is the string
"LIFE is vulgar, mama"
we'll listen to the wind and fuck like dragonflies fuck
in the dark... daisies  in the sun... a river of blood
love and the crooked thoughts of crooks
"just you and me and our dreams of a radioactive future, baby"
destined to rage
she; wrapped in the armor of the righteous
sleeping under stone  by the window behind the door
i march to war... sword tip digging reluctant furrows in my wake
we dance with words and deeds with skulls of songbirds
what good is being tired if i don't dream anymore
these are the bombs i swallow day after day
"this moon is mine this tiny little motherfucker is all mine, baby"
catch me in a raindrop
"we are the schism  the great chasm, baby"
though his jaw be broken and we are no longer beholden to the pig god
all my disaster babies dancing their dangerous dances
"gather the fleeing birds, mama"
splitting seams  the schemer of schemes
the constructs of old father time - that most useless of fools
the taxes i pay for the owls that live on the moon
the cunning of leaves and sun
my mind put in a blender my fucking skull filled with concrete
"lightyear chains is what we got, baby"
"what the fuck do we do in this darkness where the mind goes missing, captain"
here the destroyer chaces neon dreams through veins of falling silver
with no fucking dimensions and no hope for glory
boys and girls birds and fish i wish i wish i wish
"so many ghosts, mama"
on the shady side of the hill hand intertwined with the ghost of the rat king
"spitting blood into the sea, baby"
teach me about lost things impossible things
spiraling earthbound  lost control lost control  lost control
a headlong rush towards a future with no name
she; her heart a cage for the sun
"you must look further than the end of your fist, baby"
dreamt of the devil and his crown
the teetering future
it's the language of the quick knife
a furious dreaming
she; my little bumblebee baby
in my skull's hollow void  a violent god flees a thrashing
"a slow erosion over time, baby"
kissed by the martini queen gravity begins to loosen her iron grip
diabolical as the color blue
"everyday sorts of madness, baby"
the art of running from the tiger
god herself dreams of faraway suns
a bleeding of daisies
we have placed ourselves in the path of the pig god  lost and unmoored in time let the future judge and be changed
will you still be smiling as the world snake slides his jaw down to your shoulders
"i'm sorry, it's just the nervous vomiting of rabbits"
passing through her world
let's get some answers from the fucking answer man
i breathe the fractal breaths  one and the same  over and over
"broken and bent backwards it's hard to find love in a crater, baby"
she; took my hand when the bombs started falling
i am the blank your prescience sees  the reason the clairvoyants scream
in the trenches where the pig god holds no sway
"in a field i am useless, lost and lonely"
"joined in the dance of the deadly divas, baby"
"baby, you're a muddy river mine"
together we fly a universe in flames
in the rain the heart's rebellion
old man death comes weaving down the lane
the great fucking beast
the slowest fall
patience in limbo
the thing about seahorses
"don't you know the world tree is burning, baby"
with her crooked eye stare
read learn riot
and a spear to pierce the heart of the pig god
we are the typhoon makers
today we are all violence and empty hollow ringing hope
"one big vast ache, baby"
today is a day for alignment today we pull the rusty nail  today the monsters rest peacefully in their cages
i live i rot you know the drill
"the belly, expecting you to turn the knife"
you will come to the end the blank slate  the future i have eaten
she; so very dangerously real
tastes like a slap across the face
"the fucking bunnies know the story of the end times, baby"
zero-g jellyfish are what i dream of
the lights went out no power  full of arrows  i fell from the tower
invite the elephants to storm through the field
"we dance the dance catastrophe, baby"
the tragedy of living
together we rust
"be as the moss i suppose, baby"
even the drugs struggle to take hold in this tortured place
"ugly mornings, mama"
there are monsters this close to midnight
punch me in the stomach
put your back to the sea shit is getting crazy
the planet turns its eye from you
"origami deserts swallowed hard, baby"
a prayer for the swine damned in life
and then we explode into ten thousand little mice
the drugs that make the clickety clack work
"hold my white flag heart delicately, baby"
here for the blackbirds  the queen's reward
"hell is a sunny day, baby"
we make tyrants of our bones
psalms for fools and malcontents
born fully automatic
caught in the throat like swallowing triangles
this is the nothing that i know
breathe and forget
simple slights  haunted nights
"motherfucker, i learned the songs of whales and man the idiot bleats of sheep all just for you"
the empty fire
the wages of our sin  paid in salt fooled by the pig god
the goddess of repetition every day the same fucking game to play
"got a seawater skull filled with squid, mama"
the clock is fucked i am neither the tick or the tock
to the veins pinched tight
maybe we'll try on new skin  i'll be a deer for the day
there is a snake coiled around the sun  she takes no challengers  she won't wrestle for grace
"woke up to the fucking glory, baby"
"i've held my breath for a million years a whole goddamn epoch, baby"
"into the path stepped the buffalo-headed girl  sharp, smiling and ready"
brand new we are the reset
what're these days for anyway
"totally rad ghost girl 360 under the streetlights, baby"
sleepy dreamy the woman who ate the sun
"asymmetrical, motherfucker that's how i live"
she; a prophet every one
"we'll debate the merits you, a scientist me, a sentient stack of meat"
one thousand years under the desert sun
maybe i'll spend the day under my bed thinking about my bones
sunny with a chance of unrelenting horror
mathematics and the discipline of the damned
hurling planets into the sun one after another after another
the infinite sided hearts of fools
i refuse to dream in color
is your goddamn heart a hand grenade like her's
belly full of snakes and arrows
and upon the inside the pig god did dance
"welcome to my reanimation, baby"
"feathers and hearts, yes  but the scale is mine, she said"
the shibboleth the empty net
the belly: soft and weak
counting tiles until salvation
a goddamn river of violence
no belief but the rain and its redemption
a new place planet pill to swallow
make of me a sacrifice to fill your foolish foolish heart
that moment you remember you're filled with jackals made of gold
she; the yawn the stretch the cosmic rebirth
"we were meant to burn up in reentry, baby"
the living the dreaming the goddamn audacity of forgetting
watching the broken ripples of her muscle
"just a motherfucker, here and invisible both"
hanging weightless in the center of this dead world
this is the sin i hold closest to my heart
she'll be there waiting on the day the crows come for the king
she; pities your safe songs
"program me to love, daddy"
smooth brained and repugnant just as the cards foretold
through roots and leaves whispers the devilish and diabolical  fucked up secrets of trees
another blood trail morning
halfway across the world before somebody looked the fuck around
"scared of the big finish, baby"
the radioactive gift of clairvoyance
"who needs skin nowadays anyway, right"
for the love of the worm
you and me and a lovely lonely waltz
dick slap lightning
the massacre of the rabbits
it's the growing backwards the fucking inversion of the self
"time stream slipping, motherfucker"
i am a fool and this is my paradox
she is a saint praying on her knees i am a monkey screaming in the trees
the goddess of the fractured mind
"and we will be the retaliation of a universe in chains, baby"
have faith in the riot
"mega fun time hour here on ghost ship lane, kids"
slow dragging time  the days of ice
my heart doing lunatic hummingbird swirls
"no clear fucking vision today, baby"
this is how i die: glowing and alone
these pills save no lives but they do cause bioluminescence or so i've been told
alone with the flies
we dream but then again all the rabbits gone to heaven
what the fuck do i do my baby lives so much closer to the sky than me
bent under the weight of this crushing crown
and so blossoms the destroyer
"drifting further, baby"
vengeance say her name
she; came to me all hearts and cosmic retribution
someday the mountains will   stand in revolution
sinking ship sinking ship
hamster wheel thoughts around and around and around
speak ill
a weird mix of dying days
the assassins will come the crash will follow
failing synapses of my jellyfish brain
the bunnies will come for me carry me up to heaven
set my particles to self-destruct
"gravity is acceleration and we're busy dying, baby"
"oh you motherfucker, i hold tight to this terrifying new reality"
freaky visions of the divine pussy supreme
"cautious hearts break first, she warned"
"forgotten but forever golden, baby"
we'll sit here together corrupted by the breeze
she; with sunshine in her veins
the fall the tragic
and zeus slips out the open window
"these dangerous days, tainted"
and you wail with a furious anger
nothing offers enlightenment like a sharp knife
go! go! go!  tick backwards you son of a bitch
"indulge in that need to disappear, i think"
"you race the fucking infinite,  baby"
my love and me  free under the dirt  under the sea
yeah... well... a cathedral named motherfucker
we'll change we'll follow the exile of the metal men the diaspora of the automata
the nuclear eyes of her yesterdays
you and me and those brief few burning seconds
"this is the far side of forever, isn't it"
the dignity of the dead and the damned
speed and other radioactive women in love
"anarchists in love, babygirl"
in the desert: profoundly broken lightspeed crashes
chaos and the switching tiger's tail
"you know that, right"
come see the idiot child with his idiot child ways
we are the strain  the circle the drain
this place has become me i am beset on all sides by my own foolish heart
here we descend
the book of the pig god  the trial of your heart
the obvious sins of birds
"goddamn, time smells like salt"
slept for a thousand years only to wake up a god on some distant asteroid
"the confidence of man, motherfucker"
crossed through war in her eyes
"woke up under the crushing weight of the sea, again"
the little killer beside you
down deep in the sludge down deep where my love resides
"it's the cruelty of your love, mama"
thinking of the juniper
my skull is hollow  a sacred place i hold holy
"it's the damage, sweetie"
grow! you dumb son of a bitch
we sleep in sin  wake to the promise
we fight over the future over money and time and the wind and its access to our lives
no borders no boundaries she's a headlong rush
"a small collision of planets, baby"
living crooked
she; the storm that destroys us
alone with the pressure i will my bones to break
here is a fool who knows nothing true
disgraced and on the run
our love our caldera
we blurred we bled
the hammer and her weapon is silence
we have become armageddon
"raining crows, baby"
listen to the blood on the grass  hear the satellites falling fast
"awake to the death of the dreamer, motherfucker"
she; meticulous and shattering
the lash the needle the fluorescent dream escape
"run, little bunny run run run"
strapped to the failure engine
the machine hero of the revolution
the race against the girl whose chariot was chained to the sun
my fuzziness cave
alone she built of herself a fortress
last of the midnight women
gravity is a force a nameless bitch
"all the best villains dance, mama"
"we were set to swing, baby"
"she, her halo razor sharp"
between us a blister
you and me and this conspiracy of fools
new shapes and the painful stretching of my bones
"do it for me, baby  push this motherfucker out of the airlock"
"we're all riding hard for the city of the damned, mama"
the sky and the junkie queen  there is no in between
the madness the order  the sun in it's track across the sky
the mountain and the bastard high
do you see my eyes bleed my eyes bleed my eyes bleed
we ache in ones and twos
a boon for the pig god
wednesday's in golgotha
"goddamn it's a voyage of knives, baby"
these are the things we plunder these are the things we worship
"aging, motherfucker"
here's the thing about the dead along the path
new drugs and old bastards in my neon lit quarantine bazaar
i love you shut up
is this our life now love and risk and the fangs of the tiger
i will be your sacrifice your lamb your still beating heart
in my skin i set my bones to dancing
the crime of being alive
contracting
"losing blood, baby"
the way way way way down
when we hide we hide together let the swine search
"gather the faithful the bones of the old gods are falling from the sky, motherfucker"
all my disaster babies burn and burn and burn
"this suit of atoms is crumbling all around me, baby"
growing spiteful due to microwave radiation
the desert carries it's own ghosts  weightless and without merit
out in the field drinking with devils
"a summoning of birds, epiphanies and the will to carry on"
"a spear to pierce the heart  baby, we all play our part"
bare-knuckle bitches in the twenty second and a half century
fields of fucking wildflowers  dying in my brain how about you
"we hunt the blessed eternity here, said the fox"
behind her eyes the destroyer
"this fucking grey sky cartel bringing me down, baby"
mary magdalene emerges from the flame to warn us of the harsh nature of time
goddamn megaton explosion  solar right in the center of you
watch me eat everything your fucking life your history
the centipede god of madness
we dream in spirals ever down down down
we stand on the precipice the fucking big hollow empty the land of the pig god made flesh
this hellish spire we march against
another day spent trying to avoid the hammer
"the universe fucking weeps for us, baby"
steel jaws that proclaim the world still burns  even in the rain
"these choking golden throat days, mama"
snuggled up clean with the silky thoughts of a professional liar
suffocating under the weight of her ideals
dreamt of war dances and warning labels on ladders
the warping of reality this close to midnight
odd angled bones missing the point
"the razor as a simple act, baby"
a queen in her throneroom lost and muttering about the angles
tomorrow i'll be a child again
the sun as reflection for your failure
"you can knife god but once, baby"
broken into various geometries... poisoned
in the mind's eye we bleed across time
"it's that invisible life, baby"
sweet like needles under the skin
this is the day shadow and shades
came across a demigod down on his luck
beauty twisted and unlooked for
the law of the fist
"machine gun dreams  lucid, poignant and achingly violent"
check my dead guy swagger
"it's what we've become, baby"
wondering between moments what we've become
"splintered and frayed accordingly, my love"
blinded my eyes to the demon does no one understand dimensions anymore
a tribute to the pig god a grave for the dreams
in the desert where the prophets are hung
i'm afraid the bumblebee has better things to do than let you ride him into war
free from gravity's harsh tyranny  enjoying life as the throne sits empty
"an aimless floating through the fog, baby"
spies! i scream mechanical foxes and miscreants
blasted into fucking space by the judgement of the collective
a world for you to destroy
little little spider you walk too slow
the dream and the denier meet as one
"desperate, i have failed all her tests"
when that goddamn lightning bounces around your hollow hollow skull
"to be swallowed by the great fish, baby"
in magenta i shine
in her mind a rage angels bless the shells  of the holy twelve gauge
vibrating faster and faster and faster and faster
"aw baby, we're all looking for somewhere to hide"
chewing foil like it's love
"angry, her tongue a buzzsaw"
to once again spread our terrible joy
"we are the bandage time bleeds through, mama"
on the otherside of what should be forever
if you could wrestle the buddha for a chance at enlightenment
my love is yours your love is mine here in radioactive jersey where the trains don't run on time
"i see through the trees, baby"
"burning up in reentry but goddamn it the groove found me wanting, baby"
the lies we tell about love here in the shadow of the pig god
lying in a ditch on the edge of the road no car slowed as death came  for what he was owed
these masks that hide the small cuts the hideous hearts
"new drugs make new colors, baby"
when your fucking spine whispers of rebellion
gave the sun a soulless smile
she; crowned in rust and forgotten
"welcome to hoax town, baby"
"time, a lover a whore  a screaming truth outside the door"
"hold on tight, baby  we're in free fall  an empire in decline"
dreams are for taking as i ache upon waking
my bones playing like they're desert
inverted and mad
begun fractalling all my atoms spinning out in patterns identical intentional fucking insane
"intimate, these little fears"
among the dead the men of brass and their ladies of tomorrow
new prototypes taught in stone and fire
one day baby we're just gonna fucking evaporate
i need neither bones or coin nor time alone
she; her thoughts one-eyed with dirty feet
"got blender brain and a fear of gravity, baby"
from god's heaven an infinitely long sword stabs directly into my idiot brain
death as an introduction
a smile to break these karmic chains
together we plot our escape from the gnashing teeth of the tiger
"the priestess came to me, furious"
"flip the card reveal the fool reveal my fate, motherfucker"
to begin each day anew  fresh faced and terrified
the gods make a playground in the split of my skull
"watch me be a dream of water, she said"
the sentient cube  the personification of death
this idiot's cage
"planetside diversions, baby"
goddamn romans
daisies as rage suppression
holding hands in a field of ruin
the witch has found me out in the desert sands the gypsy has found me  but she makes no demands
the idiot son of an amazon
broken by synthetic america
"the left hand of destiny conspires to fuck your world up, baby"
it's the dope man's parade
the failed states of catastrophe
like a sad broken knife
seahorse in the sky wonder why wonder why
the girl with the hawk feather heart and the boys who hunt her
"you and me and the crushing expectations of a new day, baby"
in time we all face the queen of the firing line
love in the trenches
if i could i would make this stupid planet spin fast as fuck
"angels in acid, mama"
we love and love and love while the atmosphere burns
"authenticated before destruction, baby"
stabbed by your toxic rhetoric
to breathe fire is so goddamn boring these days
to hold my fury close to my chest
my lil' macabre mama dancing with her mouth full of blood
"a reopening of my veins, baby"
a rage in mourning
the lingering end
we go about our day oblivious and unknowing gored by the tusks of the pig god
fear of a dying planet
she; together where sunshine dreams
the fox fucks around and exploits the imperfect nature of man
"inconsistencies in forever, baby"
hunted from shore to shore
in my throat old roots
radioactive monsters and the beauty all around
as is our nature; weaponized
what we have born on this day may the third
an utter refusal to believe
discipline and heresy
"little spells for dumb motherfuckers that's what i got for you, baby"
and a mandala made of the dead
come with me and you too can refuse to see the desert
i do not know how to be discreet i scream at the street and the people i meet
"baby, there's nothing for you here"
a line of bones for replacing
here- it's raining in my room
these days when the dreams come slower
with her freckles and her shotgun shell eyes
"baby, drag the sun from the sky so i can be cold so goddamn cold"
the sunshine dream of the martini queen
we dance together around the impossible engine
she; i've lost
"the night is stolen when the walls have eyes, baby"
"blood, red like chemical cherries"
buried alive  sunshine on the knife's edge
"shut the fuck up about your secrets, your heavens and your hexes"
with eyes that asked what goddamn beautiful and monstrous thing ate your soul
time is thinnest right now fragile and easily transcended
don't know how your mind works but my goddamn brain is constant rain
lighter than air with that new wave red scare
"it was that cheap wallpaper sky we used to share, baby"
the ghost of the rat king here draped in gold
the trees grew closer so i invited the roots through the door
"i'm not ignoring you the eye of fate spins round and round, motherfucker"
a sharpening of the spear  a blinding of the sun
in the desert with purple men  ladies with red painted toes dipped in the sea
you and i  we are bombs falling from the sky
couldn't sleep after the deer god manifested at the foot of my bed - he smelled like rain
i will become one with the spiral
choking on chocolate with the lizard brain screaming die die die
"rabbit masks at dawn, darling"
these are the days you take the hammer
biting the heads off tulips
the storm the energy steals
and the cathedral crumbles around me
the tragic trash
"neutral pressure skull, mama"
kiss my idiot tears give me what i deserve
the future is suicidal
she; was a beautiful son of a bitch with brass knuckles and fairy wings
oh to be brand new
gentle praise from the one-armed hooker that sits by the side of god herself
"you make a poor tiger, said the crow"
"can you hold your breath for a thousand heartbeats, baby"
that ol' swirling swirling madness
she; the reprisal
"i can feel the ominous stirring of deadly beasts, baby"
one a.m. double collapse rising tides
i imagine there is some measure of pain in changing between the states of matter
feels like all the cartilage has dissolved free floating bones and high walls
daisies with dangerous futures
"my internal structures are suffering from imminent collapse, mama  please save me"
unbothered by the very nature of things
the heavy metals that make up our new existence
destiny is for fools and swine
killing time at the end of the world
i have begun to dig
"be my hideous spring, baby"
her touch radioactive a goddamn bomb in a sundress
all riot thoughts
the transformation/ resurrection of the dreamer
sandy wet mouth
the trial of meat and bone
where the wounds have time to settle
"you sent your assassins but their wills were weak, mama"
on the run from the faithful with a shotgun and a blind horse
i have grown translucent these things aren't up to me
she; put my heart first against the wall
"we the sunshine soldiers, baby"
we come live from this place of anger
"these thoughts carnivorous,  baby"
kaleidoscope dream psychedelic pussy supreme nothing like it seems
spiders and buzzsaws  that's what this little piggy is made of
forever awake and dreaming
i miss when we were stone
"""harumphs"" in motherfucker"
the crawling
my baby baby sweet as a candy cane
landed in fire landed in chains
tomorrow's bloody knuckles
my fucking atoms have begun to draw closer together making me denser heavier more terrifying
been dreaming lately of relative sizes and unforgiving rebirths
we'll die side by side this hollow skull and i
"your weapons aren't sharp enough for that, darling"
"keep your head down, baby  they can't get us all"
spinning interstellar death at nine thousand miles an hour
because it's true... it's always been true
left my baby in a bubble and she blew away away away
undergoing a receding a violent compression
the forgotten tooth in bone of it all
"she's the fucking lever that moves the world, baby"
one crater  two crater three crater four
"these are the chemical imbalances that hold us together, baby"
barely flinches as thousand legged monsters fall from the ceiling
should i be punched in the stomach
the churning churning churning of her depths
here come the pigs two by two who will they eat me  or you
the splice
here's the graceful destruction you prayed for
with the rain the traitors come
hours of eyes upon me
one giant universal fucking contraction
123 baby brutality
the crushing weight of new planets to carry
"just the goddamn delusions running rampant through my idiot brain, baby"
the groove slid under the door like a knife between the ribs
storytime with mother disconnect
the future rolled up in a carpet
wildly inaccurate flow
"eater of planets, stars forevers and eternities"
becoming and denying
bliss and the flame
it's hard to rage when the queen holds her martini
hope like the knife it's named for
i can feel your eyes the beauty the promise the destruction
"now, i can go on living"
"i can't reswallow ghost ships, baby"
"psychic nativities, motherfucker"
a year of exploding in slow motion
feeling seen  the hobo queen a dollar and a dream
abomination style
from the split skull of zeus here's where we rise
the strap
the slow slow ticking
we the invisible
a winding neither up or down
the idiosyncrasies of god's only fool
my skin has begun to split- is there a new me to be found
i am an artificial boy and you are the sky
sludge world
pink plastic pig hearts and the women who love them
"the power to alter our own realities, baby"
failures and terrors and the blossoming of trees
vomiting time  minutes seconds years
tigers and crows and the goddess at the center of my heart's maze
defeated by the very thought of a new day
"settle in, piggies"
"this fucking planet is floating through space... you know, sometimes i forget"
monstrous emotions and horrors chasing through my guts roiling bending burning
how do you eat what hurts
we are the mire
make it fast but fucking fragile
a lifetime trapped on earth
taught the automaton about narcotics and love and eternity and little moss covered stones
"baby, gravity holds the oceans down too"
evolved from an angry cloud
these small days
"i'll feed your love to the buzzards, you fuck"
she; holds you close when all your dreams are blood red
"vindicated by carrion birds, baby"
molten thought bubbles popping in my idiot mind
i brought clouds and flowers  she brought quests and war
"it's what you so desperately want to say... so say it, motherfucker"
dreamless i face the day
"i felt the universe pulse, motherfucker"
random right eye bulge
my soul's a fucking jellyfish today
the last great march
the demon of how the fuck does such a thing happen
a worshiper of the failed radiation
my baby a bomb thrower
the big pinch
i breathe like i lie
love and the all-devouring swarm of her mind
"we're all criminals in space, baby"
sat in the wind and screamed
behind the ribs petrified
i walked she talked death's mysterious mysteries
"just another dumb motherfucker trying to shoulder all the love in the cosmos, baby"
she; rides beauty like a cloud
i am failing my obligation to the algorithm
"it's the big build up, baby"
pins to help see the race pins to hold the eyes in place
"i would cuddle with the devil, mama"
"deceptive, as the pig god knows"
got bored and gave the highway back to the forest
a bombing in the spirit world
saved by the fire
from tomorrow with a heart that tastes like brass
pretty ritz cracker boy
i am ruin
.45 caliber hummingbirds
she; pulls apart my jaw to find the truth to find the price
drown
i scream at the past  i scream at the future i scream at the moments lost in between
acid rain nostalgia
"we are six feet of hard packed earth, mama"
we all know the fucking story the thread the fox the splinter
"she's the devil i know, baby"
wake up and worship the groove the chains make
demanded some shredded others
sink
that being chased feeling that gets right down into your fucking molecules
"the goddamn audacity, baby"
she; a prayer for self-destruction
"the couch, she burns"
the ever creep and the grace she brings
if i step out will i float away
"once, simply"
i sent my bones forward in time
"sanity is a sucker's game, baby"
fucking guts full of angry wasps
in this failing city we dance to the dirty bloody rain
close your eyes and i'll pass right through
"dead-end dreams of glorious deaths, baby"
"today, i will be the one that bleeds"
me and you and all the world's lonely dead
in empty veins hollow ghost snakes search for endless liquid dreams
crying at the carnival terrified of the sights and sounds  the crowds  the giant creaking machines
the near future life of the almost dark
hide
the goddess and the uncertain nature of reality
the sharp and the just
"you married a man who couldn't sing, darling"
"i can't guarantee we'll come back, ok"
"failed epochs, mama"
feeding monsters i can't identify
engraved truth into all the bullets she had left
"at the end of this fucking river lies my giant open mouth, baby"
behold the destroyer  under the blanket   warm and soft hiding
gored
here come the rats  in waves and waves
one heart and the estimated weight of the sun
and the boy folds in upon himself
fear of the edge of the willow tree of dying alone
perc white and read all over
stuck a knife in god and danced away with the rabbits rabbits rabbits
trash ghost
a dying song for the dirt in your eyes
the devil is the noose  the devil is the mountain
"swallowing all the little details, baby"
"i have not forgotten you, little apocalypse outside my door, oh no i haven't"
this place this dimension i created it it's mine
her proud declaration: i am a motherfucker and i climb the sky
"the temple and the drill  deranged, empty and still"
i lie across this world
obsessed with the comings and the goings the leaving and the taking
elegant
the joy of forgetting the number
an enemy i can't defeat with rage alone
a lifetime  a burning across the world
we the underneath
"plotting vengeance against the sky and other daydreams, fantasies and flights of fancy"
stretched goddamn thin the distance between atoms a million miles
"thank you, my darling, for the melancholy"
hold fast mutants
and lo i fell from a great height
"fell in love with a river  fat, muddy and slow"
betrayed by the wind and my own third-eye's evil
the holy order of the maids of the milky eye
"reach into my guts and shove my heart aside, mama"
she; longing and the beautiful ache
"lightspeed and the diabolical need, baby"
from tomorrow a soft radioactive glow
summon the flies
"trap my soul under the heaviest stone you can find, baby"
a hushing of the monsters
dreamt of giggles and bullets raining from the sky
the goddess of remembering of the agony of bones growing
projections that were once me
we grow in pain
"our fluorescent lowlife love,  baby"
haunted by stars and sly girls with sharp knives
"we live the slow fade, motherfucker"
angry and distant a blind fox rushes through my veins
she; a goddamn flowery mess
"god herself's giant swinging space dick causing chaos in orbit, complete loss of control"
"the mirror the reflection the death sentence that is time, baby"
the blue of a breath held
whispers of shattered tusks of pig gods run mad
"i have a need for nothing, thought the tiger, lazily"
"your fucking heart is all thorns, baby"
we met on the edge of singularity
"you bleed electric, baby"
an eater of futures of chains and marigolds
she; ravishing... a killer of minds
you and me and the flawed paradise we were offered
we the small bombs
hell under the eternal blue
sharp feathers of bronze mark the time
the sun sits terrifying
wires leading to disaster
rebuild the machine make it clean
lines of dust
a gift of warmth and magic
"knighted a fucking legend of the space ways, babygirl"
"maniacs in eveningwear, baby"
watched over by idiot angels
all i can promise are broken promises and dying flowers
"a knife fight in the confessional, baby"
we have birthed chaos unwieldy and free
i imagine you breathing
too many of my eyes have opened to see the blinding sun
"how fast how fast how fast can you run, motherfucker"
"a hundred million years on the knife edge, baby"
bumblebees tap tap tapping on my windowpaaaane
she; and we were greeted by skulls
squid dreams // madness unbound
the monstrous worms of my soul
i have done all i can  i am the seahorse man
"a mutant beauty with sixteen fucking legs for days, baby"
to con a smile outta god herself
"it's your silence, baby own it"
the queen of no one's son
the birds are singing of sweat and panic
the last
you are a ray of sunshine  i am a petrified forest
what shall we see shall we see shall we see what shall we see
a story of the swine prince
wrapped in a fool's chain
"another lost soul martini, baby please"
she; grows while we shrink
"gimme a new crutch to lean on, baby"
centurions trading skin for favors
she; a name that looks beautiful to say
in some minor key: the march of the lonely goddess
only lovers lazily lost
"demons multiply by fools, baby"
this dawn is a tiger  threadbare and starving
the oracles are all insane tra la la ... tra la la
murdered by cheap sunrises
i belong to the finger bone we saved from the grave
"a queen, nonchalant"
gifted a million mice a million pieces of my rage
carrying a ghost town heavy as fuck
steal the fucking seeds
"free-range i'll live out my destruction, motherfucker"
"time is a hassle, baby"
these forever ways these rotting meat days
oh the dementia
"the boredom right, baby"
new vices
she; in my ribs a library
"here the mind fractals and screams baby, don't you know that"
here is for the deal formed in hell
my fucking mind is a swirling maelstrom of black ass crows
and this little piggy is the villain of our story
"i am the monument, baby"
looking for the perfect dream to waste today on
mocked by death  ha ha ha got your soul
a summoning of all the world's spooks and phantasms
in my guts the vultures soar along my spine the tigers stalk
"it's the hairline fracture of love, baby"
the hard stare of her acid heart
"let the blood flow, darling"
but the bat
god herself's lonely liberation
this fucking place  this goddamn fucking colony of ghosts
i'd rather be living
"when you're running for your life you name all your bullets, baby"
"mama, you know together we're the seed the flame the future"
the future is all rhymes about plagues and lullabies for graves  we all fall down
my mind is ash
i'll follow her dirty feet anywhere
imperious on her throne  she promised adventure
grief like an old lover whose face you had hoped to forget
we the hollow people marching in silence
drawn a golden rebirth
you son of a bitch like a goddamn drill to the brain
the last great monster
oh the things we crush hearts and planets hearts and planets
what makes us... us
"she; we live out passed the event horizon stretched lightyears thin, baby"
king of the cul-de-sac with a live goddamn octopus strapped to my face
life in solitude
love like a nail right into the side of my head
i severed this arm because the darling little death she asked me to
i emptied my soul for you and your goddamn vulture heart you electric neon princess bastard fuck
"wrapped in chains and drowning, motherfucker"
born with a fool's skull held together by a tin crown
what's a superstition mean to a knife
"it's what they used to call potential, baby"
in a garden at the edge of the desert the sharp-eyed lady of the waste sits in a threadbare rocking chair waiting just for you
these days these sexy desperate dangerous days
bleeding on the inside
she; put your ear to the earth and you'll learn the monsters are always here
it's the horror of moonlight
this is the hour of our destruction
all my fetishes and charms to drive out the weevil king
"watch my love rot, baby"
it was yesterday fucking salamander magic
traded my baby a straight razor for a cherry blossom
rabid hearts pulled apart
"this chrome fox calls the shots, baby"
if you are the nail her gift is the hammer
"sharp, unbreakable, beautiful her mind is a goddamn diamond"
we the disintegrated
this is the era of falling
"pretend to live a life, baby"
old mirrors with new reflections of who you were supposed to be
blinded by a death in all white
"crazy sea monster shit  fucking unknown to science  turn on the dark, mama type shit"
"death is a willow tree, baby"
just a goddamn fool whose atoms form no bonds
no more dreams but dreams of blood and steel and fire
this reality splitting into ever smaller more delicate versions of itself
"oh you darling fuckers, the owls have come for me"
we'll crack this world in two one side for me one side for you
the sky and her bride hidden by the glare of the parade
these feelings for the fire we're forced to endure
i wish i was a chemist inventing new drugs  i wish i was a child  covered in kisses and hugs  i wish i was a snail envious of the slugs
she; what will you do with all this power you can't hold
the goddess of yesterday bored in her cage
"it's what we cling to, baby"
one eye red
death stands at her shoulder idle bliss
"you and me, baby without form without function"
pieces and the desert they're scattered in
headless i sit and dream
there are monsters in the street skeet skeet skeet
"it's a fucking mountain, she said at what suddenly appeared"
"just rage and faked smiles all the way down, mama"
"she'll be the last one left just her, the lonely barren world and a smile"
"vomiting up ghost ships just for you, baby"
when motherfuckers stop their song  when chaos stops its dreaming
here's the thing about vultures and wooden fences
she; failing to fit what's broken into what's missing
a rebirth in blue
wine drunk and careless let's run you and i
under the ruin the destroyer walks the suburban streets
"her footprints fresh from the shower  a golden trail  warm, hazy and fading"
to play games with the dead
and this little piggy burns and burns and burns
eventually you'll have to take the hammer
down at the end of a dead-end street we're saved from disaster by the burnout queen
fantasies of running of empires on the sea
a burrowing through dimensions
sunshine  we'll make nice rats and mice rats and mice
when the tall castle stood and fell from its great height
that ol' devilish bitch
a queen in time
"a thousand thousand little wounds, baby"
before the bombs fall tell me we'll make it
"together we'll birth new gods  mad, dangerous and just for us"
"your assassins are weak, she said around a mouthful of bullets"
when you're desperate and the old junkies offer to teach you their dance
when comes the inevitable
"we can hold hands, baby the old witch and the dead man of the dunes"
cathartic scream and the now now nows
the distance between atoms one hundred million fucking miles
"sharp enough to gift you a finger, baby"
today the tiger stalks lazy circles in my guts
"just to simply burn, baby"
that pulse you feel is my brain trying to have every goddamn thought at once
a new nightmare adds to the old and yet... and yet we fucking continue
a suicidal rush to share a sunbeam with this stained glass window
together we're catastrophic
up from the dirt with a mind like a child
a madness of days rushing through the waves
blossoms and blooms 45 caliber thoughts
catastrophic romances in the end times the plague times
fantasies of competent men and monkeys with gold teeth
RUN!  distant spirals and dying stars
"sanity level: blowtorch, mama"
here's what we'll endure today
gut rot lightning
too much beauty has broken me
endless battles against the nothingness
the mathematics of the insane  all bad tidings and ill omens
"a hellish sort of relief, ya dig"
"silence, the eternal distance and i"
she; how many different versions of me exist in this moment of time
the two mirrors of my soul movement and stagnation
looking for a quick escape daring andromeda and i
meaningless ghosts in space
"hope is never harmless, baby"
woke up and already we have become undone
"my skull has been replaced with the horrible screech of the tv, pain and the idea of forever and tomorrow fucking tomorrow and forever"
when the thing behind your eyes throbs
these fucking jackals have come for beauty
break my heart break my face bring me a trophy last goddamn place
seven goddamn heads of the hydra each making promises they can't keep
out in the dark diamond ice world
yeah but my dead branch heart says otherwise
this seahorse monstrosity i be
"swallow your cares, mama  we're in the big nothing now"
she; i will face the rest of this day with violence
mute for the time to speak has passed
daring death to try
the ocean above me heavy as hell
she's an all-black rainbow
a failure of lightspeed
gonna be brand new  one hour  midnight motherfucker
"firing atomic fucking neurons, baby"
to crawl whole back into your skull back where things were warm where things were safe
sad with grey skies and no rain
hyper accelerated evolution
"deliver unto me an end, toots"
these moths we breathe
tra la la sings the ghost of the rat king
held close to the bosom of the tyrant
"you, me, love and these frustrated thoughts of escape"
"the unknown fucking edge, baby"
what does the fox care for your smile
"we live with a crushing indifference, baby"
she; i am the dream eater  the devourer of all realities
"no, the queen is peril"
they call this place nowhere
god bless this goddamn child
when one was another  the being and the nothingness
"sunday, the last stand of a desperate man"
one bullet each
"gotta rabbit, mama"
here so far from the light
"i believe in the danger, baby"
shallow graves  jesus saves  to the mechanical man we are slaves
and we dig and we dig and we dig
"these are just hypotheticals, baby"
she's a nightmare where sleep and birds screaming in flames meet
i own this grey morning
swallowing a pyramid hopeful in its digestion
sometimes i forget the cage
buried under tons
i love her  she loves ancient rusting machinery
knifed by my own incompetence
"boundless within the parameters, babygirl"
"rampage, riot and ruin in the wake of the pig god"
nirvana in her lap head in her hands
i asked her to be warm
the door the impossible
goddamn it we burn
"it's the seduction of gravity we must ignore, darling"
"we have clearly strayed far from the face of god, baby"
she; a rage under the stars
to die perfect on white shag carpet
sing songs to chaos to being apart
cranked the dial all the way up and the adrenalin hits like a fucking high speed train through psychedelic neon japan
"planetary distractions, babygirl"
smashing my face into the drywall like it's the fucking hall of fame
never read
"the tunnel is collapsing, mama"
fake plastic teeth
she; opened me up and sewed her treasures into my guts
the dreamer is awake and worse a fool
the plot against my internal organs
i stand in awe of the sun's harsh judgment
"listen, i know it's time to go the devil bird screams outside the window"
"tired of bleeding, empty and the angles"
dusty bookcase voodoo
manifesting a nightmare flock of faceless birds
alone under the pyramid behind the jackal in front of the tiger
"scattering pieces, bones and fetishes"
i'm trying to be cheerful but fuck i can't find the sky
Dumb As Fuck LLC
"she; is the sun so i leapt and i burn, motherfucker"
laughing tales of death
"clouds like skull fragments, baby"
worship the soft white underbelly of the destroyer
little lost boy in a big empty world
she; whispered her hallelujah... goddamn
she's on the run a desperate beauty
we hold with a brutal elegance
when the spider asks what else you would wish to be
"like a dream, wobbly from prophecy, foretold maybe after you pin the gypsy's third born son"
a violent denial of sleep
blasted into fucking space full red shift travel
i close my eyes and fistfight angels for fun and profit
she; i will be your wall between the radioactive fire
death of a nerve
"stories by gunpoint, baby"
we'll get high and chase the riverboats chase the sky
resume!
we'll forget and sink into the ground
in flowing white dresses all the little cataclysm babies march two by two
nihilism's big tongue kiss and the end of times
"i have eaten the spirits that surround you, baby"
those of a certain age who saw what was coming and were broken by it
hold him close this child of rage
"in the grip of the sisters three  maudlin, melancholy and morose"
for the rain comes later
these strange new shapes  i find myself in
the wicked are out tonight
walk with the horror for awhile
memories of memories tinted gold
extra knuckles extra bones daytime nighttime die alone
in front of the procession  a queen in pink
out on the rails a hobo conspiracy
this is the apathy engine
"from great heights fall steel-hearted birds, mama"
that shiver is for the doom girls that pass right through
"kisses for the end times, baby that's all"
she; dreams of days far far away
baptized in the molten flow
rejoice!  the great sacrifice is upon us
shrinking then inversion
the pig god makes demands these are things you should know
"atmospheres are for burning, baby"
no safety from the machines
"shove my face into the goddamn buzzsaw of saturn's rings, baby"
please don't talk don't talk don't talk
"savage developments, mama"
a doom has settled over my heart
sing a song for the jackal girls the fucking darlings of the apocalypse
"new drugs and ancient altars, baby"
my fucking vampire baby standing in the shade
she; whispers her prayer through a mouthful of blood
"unsustainable levels of rage, baby"
broken soul  dig a hole  crocodile death roll
showing all the symptoms of the blade
here! stay
"the tiger's cure, baby"
behind my eyes a fucking forest grows
came to this new place with the old death following close
she; dreams a radioactive glow
"render unto the pig god that which is his: the flawed, the broken, the rising tide"
count your ribs and the knives in between
think of it as an ocean
"a tendency towards destruction, baby"
she; shatters the shocking loneliness of yesterday's morning
where the mountain meets the desert the terminator the shadow that changes us all
unjoyful
"monsters unto death eternal i suppose, baby"
let the metallic sun fall
we can't help but burn
the apostles in ash chasing forever
"spin spin spin, motherfucker"
"you, me and a crooked tin crown"
she; put your silly ass heart away
i have begun to dig slowly then all at once
a slow dance dressed in neon and black through the ether through the fire
this life runs on rage  like all the others like i never learn
got up to some shit in the spirit world just now
"various accelerants, baby"
she; with blue eyes and murderous resolve
"you, me, far away moons and the illusion of safety"
the sword is caught in my throat and the world still burns burns burns
"joyless in my joy ya dig me, mama"
they march beside us these monsters with pretty faces and dead hearts
spare me the buzzing of this hollow skull
"the broken and the lost carry their own wisdom, baby"
that angel pussy
she; sent the jackals for me
all these dangerous babies caring neither for the living nor the dead
oh to be a dragon on legs that won't bend
i fear falling into a dimension that is all me just entirely me but in a space too small to hold me
we the little piggies the children of the pig god
on summoning the living
the small birds that hold my spine together that hold me upright
i see my isolation for what it is
you me screaming planets under new purple skies
a creature of distance born in her eyes
we charge on the count of feathers
"three bullets left, mama"
bound by her golden chain we fail over and over again
an interesting dichotomy between this foreboding sense of doom and the fluffy white clouds in my veins
mama kali and the destruction she promised
"hands to my head to hold my skull together i breathe tornado, baby"
woke up to a dare a knifepoint a smile
my bones are doing weird shit incomprehensible shit stretching always stretching type shit
a surging semi coherent fear screaming in the lizard brain
this mind not my own
"i'll feed this fucking night to the willow tree, babygirl"
where i wonder things like: what will this giant egg caught in my throat birth?
i can't dream like this
she; i'll hold your ghosts for you
to follow the pig god on his endless march through time
she; are those tears for me
this plague these copper-feathered birds harassing foxes hiding underground
i find myself crushed under the expectations of a new sun
hard to be a fool arguing with maniacs
empty streets and ghost ships
stretched so unbelievably terrible
bending all my considerable will on making this toilet earth spin faster faster faster
and the magic dies
she; a fist for the sky for the question of why
sing cosmos sing
we ride the twin beasts fury and chaos
we the idiots marching one by one
this heart and this stupid map to nowhere
"in the end we burn, baby"
to give in and be swallowed whole by the dream
"i'ma rocketship, baby we gotta go"
nobody cares nobody cares  prayers and pleas pleas and prayers
i've been screaming so long i sometimes wonder if the whole world has gone deaf
just a fool with tigers running in hollow veins
i don't begrudge the flies their drink
"i can't unsee the past ya dig, mama"
"shush now, baby the corpse king is out tonight"
she; a riot in paisley and blue
in a damning wave the river ends her slumber
"the future got harsh dreams, baby"
goddamn water crashing over all of us
a great fucking change is upon us
destination end times
slipped through new dimensions  cracked broken kaleidoscopic
"lips sewn with steel, baby"
in paradise where the pretty pretty birds sing and scatter the bones
in the fucking crater where i landed - that's where i live now
like bloody edges and cephalopod dreams
"scary new places, baby"
"death, that smiling gold-toothed bastard, and his doomsday sweethearts"
the pressure to simply breathe again
does she love me or the tiny tiny knives my skull contains
we are the event horizon the point of no return the crossing of no man's land
she; soft as the dawn
this hard man preaching hard doom
all these fucking lifetimes chasing the sun
tossed into the great maw
everything goes in nothing comes out
"today, we are the hammer"
"dead pasts and offworld futures, baby"
little survivals
i found the snakes in her heart
dreams of pigs... pigs pigs pigs
"altered by the invader's strange new geometries, baby"
tell it to the thousands of hummingbirds living dying feeding upon my blood
under this blanket where the universes are mine
say something safe say something warm say something terrifying just because
to lose time forty five to forty seven minutes at a time
a lighthouse worth swallowing
behind this eye a hard dream
she; i stand tall across the world... i hold up the sky
the promised beyond
we run fast for these wicked days
i have idiot blood
"rolling waves of madness, babygirl  that was the promise"
i will ruin all your yesterdays crush all your tomorrows
mediocre monsters and their hollow hollow plots
"the queen's headpiece is an armored fist, motherfucker"
"we've been abandoned on the path, baby"
the stars have gone mad the old lady has new drugs the desert doesn't care
we don't owe her salvation
she; the destroyer is at the door with an open hand and a dare
woke up to my sins
greasy thoughts tonight
tomorrow the sun will rise one hundred times larger than yesterday
different myths for the twisted
"am i that transparent in my terror, baby"
in my guts a storm
"he was a chimera, motherfucker just a goddamn dream of a fox"
buried under a skeleton tree
she; came to me with a dangerous idea and a sly smile
"it's the hangman's hope, baby"
her atoms scream riot
together until it all blows apart
"something about rats, sinking ships and goddamn gravity"
all the little apocalypse freaks running running running
"lies from the barrel of a gun is that all we are, baby"
"unexplainable futures, darling"
the metallic taste of her
my fucking darlings my heart is filled with jackals
"these are new stars, baby we hunt for hope"
raw neon skies and rumors of the great change upon us
take my hand for these wars we fight
here with the chicken fist
god herself and the last hurrah of the pussy divine
we'll walk the fires together me and you my little catastrophic mama
the queen of dirty desperate men
if you let me i'll be your beautifully morbid garbage baby
to lie my head upon the bosom of the earth to die there alone to set my ghost to wandering
a horrible chill settles
dying with the moon caught in my throat
here for the ascension the advent of the pig god
"love, exponential skull growth and me"
she; her heart full with a demented sort of grace
i have given the eye to god - neither as gift nor penance
and you come just to go
a knife sharp enough to cut time large enough to stab the heart of this terrible new planet
when the fox meets the dope man the dope man
"completely justifiable bad-ass paranoia, baby"
i run safe in your shade
just a melancholy mama today
"collapse with me, baby"
is this the mire the trap we set for ourselves
"i know so very little, baby"
we are being asked to shine
she; an explosion quick and loud no survivors
i am an orbit far and collapsing
to pass clean through the center to be reborn hard on the other side
we the artificial constructs
she; serene in her nature relentless in her vengeance
the dangerous days of death and daffodils
love her and her radiation lies
"we share a monstrous world, baby"
why?  because i was last in line
i hear but still don't see
jerked awake from my shotgun slumbers
under the blanket seahorse times
time without end
it's just a stupid hallelujah
the patron saint of empty eyes
daydreaming of damaged things
in this glorious wreckage i call the self
the sun eater the world ender
she; i'll gnaw this motherfucker apart just you watch
have you seen behind yourself lately
under the march sun when the crone transforms back into the fat tittied fertility goddess of your dreams
the revolt of the dull knife
"take the eye, the right fucking eye, i have no desire to see the tiger coming"
and still the queen of the dawn gives rise to a new tomorrow
here for the bloody surrender
breathing sins
a love to spite the mountain
when it comes it will come slow
"just a rocket burning through space, baby"
burrowing into the sweaty earth
know this: where there is pain there is fire
she; between her palms galaxies explode and all new life is held
we burn fast the end of this path is a monster's mouth
"don't just fucking sit there, stand and choose the nature of your destroyer"
"sunday drowning in razors, happy thoughts and you"
the apocalypse birds tapping on my window wishing me a good morning
we did the math we achieved normality  oh to be shadowless and in love
we dream in red and gold violence and heartbreak
here for the ibis sent by death
"three cocktail dreams, baby"
the fox was a charlatan selling dandelion wine
a place that's blue
she; that third-eye knife
the thread couldn't hold so down this motherfucker fell
sewn onto the sun
all edges and angles today
(the noose slips ever tighter)
"we ride headfirst into oncoming traffic, babygirl"
love the length of a song
crooked blinds crushed by history
love the treacheries both old and new
growing beyond my current dimensions exploring colonizing
the last of the frost covered windows the tiger leaves a mark
say it in your tiny voice:  i used to dream of safety
"free to fight and fuck and scream, for today, at last, i am free from my burdens"
i am the sacrifice
communications from the 8th dimension
she; reaching for redemption
the pressure of the living
"we hold to the furious fire, baby"
finding it increasingly hard to be human lately and not just some tightly wound rage ball
feeling like graves fucking jesus saves
maybe if you didn't destroy every goddamn thing you ever touched
"gravity holds the scream, baby"
"fantasies, futures and fatalities"
an idiot's idiosyncrasies and me just me forever me
crawling out of your skin rituals
the vibrations are all askew the whole goddamn universe has gone mad
the fox growled walt fucking whitman
the ghosts of rabbits rabbits rabbits
"dead gods don't dance, baby"
i pray no more dreams in this lifetime hold them all for the next please
"fresh dressed corpse, honey"
death came for me yet i couldn't smile
dangerous psychics in the great beyond
"she; with my goddamn tin crown, baby"
treat me a belly full of feathers
"we live under the wheels, baby"
we the empty vases of god
day-glo wishes for neon futures
"sad girls change the world, mama"
my mayhem methodical and well thought out
this golden wretch
after midnight and a motherfucker fast on his feet can't be caught
she looks so... small
let the goddamn angels drop knives from the sky
ran faster than my bones faster than her bullets
when johnny six-guns hangs up his spurs when apropos jones sings a sad song about the wild life they used to have
"what an adventure we must've had, whispered the ghost of the rat king"
"dead so long i don't even notice the living, baby"
she; promised
and i rest my head upon her chest
down in my guts where the rage lives churning
behold the sleepwalker sliding unnoticed through time
wednesday the death monster the unforgiving the horror under the bright new sun
so screams the new day
already lost the thought
always point toward the sea
a brutal sort of understanding
"your whole fucking aura is beige, babygirl"
i dream of atomic bombs
we run with a congress of swine or we run not at all
"she; i am all flaws, blades and rage today"
little rabbit leave me to my peace
"we are rainy day ghost, baby"
those fleeting moments before the radiation washes over us
"the skull don't digest, baby"
in her mind where the lunatics are free
under the tuberculosis moon
the fox leapt from her throat whole and insane
love's blood and the eternal rush
"tuesday like an axe to the face, darling"
fucking atomic wrapped in fire
tired of the knife
the infinite doesn't dream of us
"this, my nature and the hideous sewer mutant divide"
this infinite spiral back to the beginning
she; dreamt up a whole brand new motherfucker and named him after you
this iron i carry for you
"my fucking brain has been fed through a blender, baby"
2-4-6-8-10 a fox in his den 3-5-7-9 a tiger and his crimes
this lost man out of time
the queen and her kingdom of lost desires
this fucking seed is my destruction
we've all been stolen by time
she; alone and surrounded by enemies
"hollow hearts hold to hope the hardest, baby"
unreality
this flesh i don't need
"that knife is named sadness, baby"
and we disappear invisible
the limits of her strength
behind this flawed curtain a new destiny
i am more than the math that makes up my being
the kaleidoscope man fractalling out his rage
she; you asked me to be
start the day seahorse  release the ghosts pressed in the old books
pray and maybe you escape the gaping buzzsaw mouth of the divine
woke up and the truth was still just out of reach
blind but suspect
floating lazily into space
opened the door and invited the doom inside
it all led to this moment this one stupid moment
"we're down to desperate chances, baby"
she; crashing rockets/ love in the waste
a psalm for the pig god
i plucked out the eye as a gift for the sun as atonement for the sin
just a dumb motherfucker with a spell in his pocket that summons the tiger
this is for the obsolescence
"death rattle rattle, baby"
sunshine and the junky itch for tomorrow
we have become machine red hot and new
past midnight out on the ice waiting for death
dive
smash my face through the forever
the piety of the swarm
"don't name the bones, you bastard"
severed fingers and shattered vases that's us that's what we have together
savior of this toilet earth
i hold to the doom you bring
to soar high over this broken skull future
my dead grass baby
we are the sky  we are the cracks in forever
"baby, she said... i'll protect your soft bunny soul from both the tiger and the fox"
she; if i was the last
locked in ritualistic combat with the seven-headed hydra of her personality
the strength it takes to destroy something so completely
circling into the days of new mother
the lonely drift through endless space
i inverted the pyramid became seahorse fucked up all my atoms just for you
to the king in his cage
into this useless forever we go
"teaching the rats to sing, baby"
just a rage spewing poison monster
in my guts a ghost train - it carries no passengers it has no destination
the planet eater the destroyer of stars
"glitzy neon doom, baby"
she; armed as she was she loved me still
"wake up, she said we're chasing the dawn and you're a mess"
the strange orbits of distant diamond moons
on this virgin sea
you're gonna die in the past
this broken sky is my gift to you
"put your pistols up, baby"
the jackals with their forget-me-nots and their cardboard hearts
when the dreamer dreams of teeth
crashing through the goddamn ether
together the world ender
"you have but to take that rib bone and jab it into my fucking neck, baby"
she; waits for the sun the mistress of the wild dogs of summer
the firing of the last synapse in a hollow hollow skull
woke up in this devious new reality
"why, the palace of extraneous thoughts of course, silly goose"
all the little bones in my body having their own little individual thoughts
born in a riot of fire
sitting here listening to this motherfucker tell tall tales of ageless beauty
you and me carrion hearts hate to see us shine
the sky can't hold us can't stop us wouldn't fucking dare
these things we do to appease the tiger to fool the fox
"i carry the flood in my heart, baby"
she; i won't measure my worth against your smile
patterns ripples deathmasks fetishes and fractals
we could go on this way but... explosions are imminent
so tired so complacent
fucking ice fjords frozen fossil seahorses
continue
"the seed: black, buried and lost"
"to grab the tail of the spiral, baby"
the goddess has forsaken the dreamer  tomorrow the sun will reluctantly forsake us all
smashed hard against the earth
scream for the ending
the arch-raptor
my little ricotta mama
"well babygirl, bunnies make bunnies make bunnies"
we the transient
"every goddamn square inch packed with a billion years worth of ghosts, baby"
motivated by my own destruction
a fucking whirlwind touches down and destroys the self the very idea of the individual
"she; her nature beautiful, sinister"
"i have grown to monstrous size  halfway to the sun, baby"
"it's the fucking quiet we hold to, baby"
a fool and his forevers
in chaos' shadow  here - under the belly of the pig god  where we strive to be better
somewhere there's an in between
she; a song we used to sing
in my guts a rebellion swift and dangerous
stop... hush
my baby diamond hard razor sharp
extinction level morning glories
"we the vastness  the big neverending empty, baby"
under the door where the sickness creeps
here- where gravity is acceleration and the tired lie down
a gathering of time of curries and spice
this cadillac a thousand miles long it holds all that's left
i built this fucking maze and once upon a time i was it's master
"extra limbs, hundreds, all made for war"
she; beauty and ruin
"danger days, mama"
sunny day revolutionaries
"there can be nothing sane in the predawn hours  it's all tigers and crows, baby"
like a brick a goddamn brick
we'll sleep forwards the future
"from this height we were doomed to fall, baby"
gravity holds me taunts me keeps me safe
just a goddamn fool with no memories of ever being foolish
she; taught me how to be silent in this house
not even sure what fucking language we speak is it carousel is it drunk banker is it bleeding neon fluorescent
a mind ruined
veins like fallen powerlines and the beautiful all around
"crawl down my stupid throat and run my body like the idiot puppet it is, baby"
soul death brain bubbles
"the giant swinging space dick of god herself leaves little room for doubt, baby"
"heard the sky moan, motherfucker"
"predetermined like terror, fate and love"
i miss the speed that head long rush the blur of streets flying by
we are the eaters of light the lovers of tomorrow
turn away and be cold that is the fate the spinning coin foretold
hush of the tippy toe man the chocolate cake man
she; rare in time
stories told slowly
teaching idiots to breathe
"full fucking seahorse shit tonight, baby"
these bullets made of gold but you know what baby my heart just ain't in it
in the absence of foxes we get tigers
we the underground the dirt monsters
the emptiness that comes with knowing all your enemies are dead
"the swords are dull and the songs have been forgotten, baby"
"alone, hiding in the warmth of the rot"
she; left us to the swarm
these are the struggles of god's favorite idiot
sending this simulation of me this false me this unreal me to take my place
gravity defines us holds us in it's cage
together we are the noose
"i've been dragging this ghost town behind me for a thousand years, toots"
cheer as i fall from the fucking sky
harsh are the dreams we dream
"you sit among the broken now, baby"
she; dug the hole down through the diamond hard center of her soul
a sudden urge to flee
death or the migration of the splinter through the body
"we are the things that float, baby"
this skin this gift i give to you
you and your pitiful assassins
i found the center of the desert no past no future
she; used to hold the sea
"my goddamn atoms have begun to realign themselves  what will i be when they're done, mama"
choked by god
watch for the fucking tigers at your back
dying i have swallowed the sun
behold the dreamer: his math in discord his thoughts a dull knife
the goddess and the new angles we must grow into
in the grip of tides  invisible and unwavering
when you're made of cloudy days and rage
she; teach me to be bright
last comes love
french fry skies
"enough blood to splash across the galaxy, baby"
"together, lost in that golden hour"
the river ate my love my future
"a failure of testing, baby"
a scream the sun can hear
this is my place in line
maybe feed your dreams to the destroyer
idiot brain
take my eye
on a broke leg blind horse i carried her legend across the desert
"there's no air left to breathe, baby"
just for today free from the burdens of the flesh
my favorite outfit is thursday unhurried
she; put down her knives grew forests from her palms
a fool unto myself doing foolish things
sunday or sex like a monster screaming in an old woman's face
"keep to the path and you'll stay safe, little traveler"
the great crashing pussy divine
given a new burden a new role to play
oh but this foolish blood of mine
"baby, my fucking atoms are speeding wildly out of control"
through your mind the destroyer passes
waiting on judgement day transformed into an eagle
that gut shot dance
she; held what used to be a flower
"let me tell you a tale about earl dobbins, baby"
it's a funeral for the hour just gone by
"ancient in all new ways, baby"
pay with the ghosts you carry
and the pig god sallied forth
"this crater is all i am, now"
woke up in free fall the rockets exploding behind us
what the fuck do i know falling in the sky a tangerine dying
it's a problem of time
"to fistfight angels, baby... to fistfight angels"
this salty heart bleeding sea
"the future is unmanageable, baby"
my edges have become indistinct my outline blurry
cannot control the flow of blood to the brain cannot control the thoughts it contains
ugly fluorescent thoughts
a still beating heart and the ghost of the rat king
it's a goddamn monument her name carved in the desert stone
the tiger sure does stand out in a skeletal forest
"god herself promises no safety, babygirl"
across this fucking cosmos my radioactive trail
she; the fire ever loving
"distant sun cold, baby"
wretched sprites and malicious little angels  spreading love among the unwary
with a dynamite legend
future indifferent
when you're lost and shackled to her heart
the jackals came with knives and subpoenas
how a motherfucker gonna swallow the whole ocean? just watch
never said a word she didn't hear
she; with her little smirk as i hang from my cross
"the fox knows, baby hard is how we live"
carrying the sins of an all new world
"dance with me, here, now, at the end of all things"
"we're going to war, baby"
midnight shuttered acid rain
the obliterated comes
"it ain't never is, toots"
fucking right in the dirt
"nothing matters in the big ghost city, baby"
the scream as we slingshot around the sun
"we the unconquerable, motherfucker"
she; a knife between the ribs
who will hold my heart during my eventual extinction
"the devil, the fox and her pale sun babies"
"that's the flavor of your apathy, baby"
today we take new forms
live wisely under the shadow of rage
we the infected the mighty the free
"my love, we will fight with axes and arrows we will fight through time and across galaxies"
she; i guess she forgot how being alive felt
"twenty minutes till the end of the world, mama"
"a future of repentance, baby"
trapezoids like right down to the fucking atoms
to truly escape the tiger the whirlwind the motherfucking world
these violent gifts
say no more words goddamn you
the wreck and the ruin  the prison that is tomorrow
she; i saved my heart for last
the pig god stands in a room with no room for you
"love, the pressure and her shell"
"the little fox and her little knife, baby"
buffered by ghosts i assume the lotus
curled up in her warmth
she; i threw it to the madness inside
i have horns and no dreams
there is no truth but my destruction
in the desert the chain may be gold but the stone you drag grows ever larger
"it's a feint, babygirl"
my blood is pink and the monsters are circling
the failure of the great machines
she; stole my tin man's heart
the boy with the faulty wiring and the girl made of fire
she; i am your life your love your doom
half her thousand eyes opened to sneer at the new day
now the tentacles come
she; in the low light the tiger screaming
through a hole in my face i pull my skull free to let that fucker roam and roll all over the place
"the destroyer, the mistress of gravity and time enough"
take the time to angrily hurl a spear at the sun today
"the bombs i swallow are radioactive, baby"
this new thing  this new being  just out of reach
"i am the king of half-assed skulduggery, mama"
the divine state of emptiness
the monsters have come  one by one motherfucker get ready run
the importance of a memory broken and scarred
here we go bloody-knuckle hour
outside... the nuclear error
new drugs made with all new colors
this vast silence
"baby, all this ends in high speed and gunfire"
"i suddenly found myself in a dimension i didn't recognize lost, frightened, buoyant and free"
"i don't mind when the machines breakdown, baby"
singing songs of destruction
"here we set the thieves of our heart free, motherfucker"
"in the future chrome feathered ravens drop bones, coins and other fetishes into troubled dreams"
leaving behind a burning new world
mistakes and the ever shrinking doorway
"can you hear the spinning of the earth, baby feel it's rotation beneath your feet"
the knife i jammed into the earth is a dare - i dare the fucking sun to cross beyond
that's some midnight shit
she; i am one goddamn spinning pop top son of a bitch
under this stone we have
to break your back against the stars
the fool the endless the destroyer
fuck the secret police
walking the knife edge of quiet beauty
a boundary a desolate beauty
she; etched your name in a golden bullet
this fucking cosmos can't hold us
in past lives i was a liar a swine a bird of paradise
"bitter is the eye that sees sideways, mama"
she; her love a hydra - three-headed and deadly
catch up with your ghosts
"faster, motherfucker tomorrow comes with a tiger on it's heels"
"it's just the harsh judgment of gravity, baby"
thoughts of lightning and things forgotten
woke up in her ocean drowning
fucking crystals forming in my brain goddamn all clear and gold
"darling, we explode random and free"
purple alone we roll
in my left eye flickering fluorescents of a future no one cares about
"tonight we seahorse, baby"
"we carry on when the sky inside us dies, right"
"what is left to do but challenge death, that hoary old motherfucker, to a race around the sun"
a thousand fucking swords fall from the sky when my baby walks by
she; erupting
dance of the fucking sludge mind
in my chest a jungle
"this is what remains, baby"
shiny and new like a soul hoarded by a raven
she's a pout - a rainy day girl
"baby, what's left for a coyote"
your heart is bleeding this ship is sinking
wake up to the crash the shockwave the sudden changing of destinies
mumbling of course everything's gonna be all right even as i stare at the wall and deny god
the pain starts low in the guts chased by the destroyer
she; held out her hands as the desert fled from me
here is the crashing of planets one into another
come with me let's dive headfirst down the throat of the tiger
"just fucking west of forever, baby"
outside i can hear the grass screaming
my brain is mush but i let it have it's say
"of course there are thorns, baby"
what do i see you and me we a new galaxy old blood on a mazda cx-3
she; i am but the end
"i tried to hold the dream so close, mama"
like fleas riding the back of this primordial toilet earth
got the brain throb  fucking tv static goddamn madness
the bottom without a flame
the gift of her right eye
"she; has a soft spot for the mutants, the natural maniacs and me"
"my skull glows neon, baby"
mile after mile  the scream behind the smile
"ignore my pain harder, motherfucker"
"god herself, master of the pussy divine, holder of the dual traits of fury and grace"
i set the galaxy to spinning
"spare me your tears, little mouse"
bound here
"i got 3-D monstervision, baby"
she; this tastes like forever doesn't it
you suffer for the goddess who denied you a warrior's death
i took one then i took fifty seven more - am i a real boy now
tuesdays or the days of regret stretching out towards the infinite
i will... if you'd like
trapped in this fucking vortex stripped of all humanity
eight million lifetimes and not one goddamn more
all the lights go red before the explosions start
"those ways are dead, baby"
when your mind is a predictable beast holding only to the old ways and the familiar paths
together we're seismic
assassins with angel faces
"we do the dirty work don't we, mama"
she; the terrible twisting thunder inside of course
"to sail between dying stars, baby"
to once again face the trials of the sun god
night crushing weight
the great magnifier
i swallow meteors crashing all around
the lizard brain preaching the gospel of RUN GODDAMN IT RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
she; my baby a landline in psychedelic japan
it's... daunting
through the keyhole the black eye of the fox stares back
"cocaine, fat squirrels and oranges"
to break this world to remake this world
"i am a fool, inverted"
"and here, quietly, we destroy one another"
be still
"climb a mountain and scream your fucking sermon, motherfucker"
time has stopped  frozen for everyone but me and the tiger hunting
she; found me idle in the long grey dawn
gravity has increased tenfold just as the earth has surrendered her dominion over me
the mechanical man and his indiscriminate violence
four blue cocktails and god herself must turn a blind eye
"this is the part where we tell each other lies right, baby"
they're just words for a myth i created for you
"i won't explain my mistakes, little rabbit"
the queen who brushed aside a mountain
together with a bellyful of jackals
the crowd scatters at the call of the dreamer and the madness he promises
she; i can't guarantee you make it through this
beloved by god the tiny monsters pass invisibly through my systems
"abrupt and catastrophic decompression, baby"
tiny hells
"show me the path, mama"
she; whispered sweet stories of doom in my ear
i've grown so tired and thin
the drugs that make me shine neon and fine
"the goddess, earthbound and crashing"
she; a buzzsaw radioactive
friday or the pig god brought down by a pack of dogs
spiralled into a very angry corpse
that fickle fucking face of fate is what's got me
come see the incredible slowly sinking woman
"the third eye of the dreamer will drive you insane, babygirl"
"vibrating through the fucking cosmos you can't touch me, baby not fucking today no way"
"it's a failure of velocity, baby"
the sun came to blow us all away
i can hear the building of the bombs
"we hold to no courage, mama"
a reckless disregard for the tiger that lives in her heart
a small graceful violence
she; when death comes i will be pale in the desert
repeat after me: i am a ghost ship you are the dream
kiss me you beautiful son of a bitch and never ever stop
me and you foxes and flowers  foxes and flowers
the debutantes' fancy dress ball and riot
i still live even though the sky rains fire
offended by precision
blew my mind out with a tangerine
fucking poetic at 11%
vaporizing the subdermal
"we haunt different moons, baby"
desperate to dream we sleep
once upon a time when i used to dance
make my love radioactive
"i am all ghosts and rats, baby"
she; i will be the mighty fucking sword that splits your puny planet in two
for you i would eat the sky
"some days are all hate and rage, baby and i'm sorry"
die and rise again  be shot into fucking space and die again
blinded by the bride of the sun
wednesday here we begin again just toss my corpse in the rut for it will follow along
always one move away
the tale of the goddess and the lies i choose to believe
"protect my heart from the furious rain, you bastard"
"i have no dreams for you, said the fox"
"just love's broken conquistador, baby"
of course she gave her sword a name it's the last hope of desperate men
oh to be lost and never found
"she; beautiful, deranged and dangerous"
"bitter on the inside, babygirl"
"my baby, the remedy of the snake"
to sleep safe and warm in her lap
wake up end the dream see the spiders
"you don't hear me stealing that chocolate cake, baby"
this love this shattered glass love
into the maw
the plates of my skull... shifting eroding tightening
i am the ship that ran aground the stone in the desert immaculate
the clock and the ever creep
"strap in, toots... we're going down"
"the tiger pretends and so do you, baby"
she; her love a knife to the throat
this sweet charming decay
"riots, the idiot and the queen of acceleration"
how fast we spin
she; her knives sharp enough for tomorrow
"where did you go, little trouble where did you go"
"the goddess, whose crown was iron, refused another day"
i have eaten the forest and yet failed to dream what do i do now
"motherfuckers don't scream with dirt in their mouths, mama  no they don't"
she; take yourself far from me
for eyes cheap brass coins
"i understand, but"
neither one nor many
"most days, just know, love is a horrorshow"
"all the satellites crashing down, baby"
in your broken ribcage the fox nuzzles his cold cold nose
empty and hollow as the beginning
fucking fire of the throat
universes to eat
this is the strange the prism the turn the color
i age
the end will be swift but not painless
lethal in her regard
nervous thoughts
just an idiot trapped in an idiot's limbo
in the rain the buffalo-headed girl stood and stared
"time, the great annihilator"
i don't remember being a child i don't remember being eaten by the monster
the groove has slipped in changed altered made you new
she; like reality we all bend to her will
like a nuclear holocaust held in a cage
and the sun burns outward from my fucking skull
i am so fucking sad so fucking broken
do you see how sad i am
he was my friend and i loved him
who can hold the fury in their palm who can hold it close
life and it's terrible acceleration
woke up with the knowledge of a single point infinitely dense and incredibly hot just patiently waiting
i wanna eat something substantial fucking hot and hearty
aging into an ocean
we exist just not how you remember
bullets dance atop her knuckles
where we grow large enough to lie across the horizon
chasing angels away
left my body by the riverside  to chase the ghost of the rat king
the hard truths of stupid men
"the sharp-tongued goddess of my death and rebirth that's who, motherfucker"
this atomic life
she; i am a phantom a ghost a desert mirage and yet you love me still don't you
"we a fucking symphony, baby"
morning and the chiming of bells  the harsh crash back to reality
"angry sleep, now"
my tongue feels too big for my mouth i can feel it's every dimension the teeth a cage
i'm dying  in my guts the tiger chases the sun
close my eyes to hide from the destroyer
"tomorrow's nuclear halo looks good on you, baby"
a man of crumbling infrastructure
side by side we launch
she; a sun glare blinding
"because i'm a disaster, baby beginning to end top to bottom"
"live? no, i don't think so"
i gave her my heart she gave me a pyramid
all this hurt and pretty too
she; i am the cliff you are the leap
third-eye tentacle explosion
we have gone blue turned strange
if i take one more step forward maybe the whirlwind will scatter my atoms straight into hell
"these are harrowing days, mama"
i got screaming to do
i let my bones feel the suffering
shh it's tippy toe time
like a fool i face the new day
"these are the danger days, mama"
"walk, simply"
there is no safety  not anymore
she; send me something beautiful something terrifying something secret
i exist to fall
invisible through the cracks the 2-D man
my goddamn immortal heart
"white lies razor sharp, motherfucker"
a quick hop galaxy side
i bent my will towards the river but she would not turn
"the lady of the desert and her wild ass dreams, baby"
it's the gift of a sinking ship
she; went and touched forever without me
tigers with lady's faces
i gave her flowers she gave me brass and blood
the rage of a new neon morning
"but, do you see"
"she; send your assassins, coward"
these honey days
sucker punches like a forehead kiss from the divine
will she murder time for you
"will you hold to my mutation, baby"
when the dreams demand a map with no clues and no landmarks
the goddess who'll watch you die
she; dreams of a crown
"let's go find one then, you purple-toothed bastard"
catch me before i detonate
i was ancient before i lied
from their place of safety all eyes turn to you as you step out into the big empty
the ceremony of new skin
"get your fucking molecules right, baby"
a tiger remade a future cast anew
we hold to no rituals here
"we pay with teeth here, baby"
all hail the prism queen
in my mind a squid - angry and swimming
when the eyes do the dreaming for you
insanity and the slow spirals of the sky
new worlds new rules
here i exist with this hole in my chest - this hole in my chest where she shoves the stars inside
"so much more vast than this, baby"
the sky has found me
"failed clones, mama"
she; a tightrope walk around the fucking sun
suddenly standing for something
the quiet and the still of unfathomable distances
you me this planet these ancient chains
some days like love endlessly stupid
"rise to the pain, baby"
"now is the time for horns and fangs, my love"
"separate and wash this universe from me, motherfucker"
drugs to calm the lizard brain
the sublime goddess of no. never
she; her heart a funhouse mirror
outside the window a lazy universe
back to my body the crows drag my astral form
still alive yet everything has gone all over cyan
"exploding outward in a million fucking pieces yet still i remain, baby"
i'll hold the night still for you
she; here for the changeover from my dreams to her's
"will you dream for me, baby"
when the wind is angry and fucking vengeful and just for you
from the tiger a turtle offers a very different sort of protection
so much easy beauty
... and the drugs to destroy my day
her knife was not my knife for it was faster and much sharper
the failure of the self
crashing backwards in slo-motion
the goddess of bones left behind
"i hold to the truth, the cold, the insidious anger of gravity's pull"
she; let me tell you a fearless story
we run from comfort
woke up to knives in the hands of babes
little miss chains of an extra moon
the mind and it's crushing pulsing pressure
random rearrangement of my bones please
she; and what will i use to pull my chariot
all that i am is spreading
crash that son of a bitch through the open door or forever hold your goddamn peace
"blow a hole in this fucking galaxy, baby let's go"
jagged and sharp concrete cuddles
how do i end this world yet still remain
one goddamn glance at a time and i see all of creation
when your soul is all blue eyes and bloody smiles
"we part the river like a stone, baby"
you me the ever circling drain
the boy that's made of glass
"planetary stride, mama"
just a goddamn fool chasing a dangerous woman
she; the ruination
build something boring over my grave
"the drugs will destroy me way before gravity crushes me flat, baby"
they don't want anything until they want everything
(in the teeniest tiniest voice) i'm dying
MY BRAIN IS EXPANDING IN MY SKULL
"i soar on raggedy wings, you motherfucker"
kill the dreamer if you wish to arrive whole
trapped in an ever darkening prison sentenced to love and be loved
i gave myself to the jackals
sit... and wait
"got waiting to do, i suppose"
"collapsing realities, mama"
cold and the goddamn whole body shiver
the heart's arsonist
i am a fool and this is my fool's throne
"don't speak, not now"
operation screaming fucking sword in the sky
in the desert mindless and broken
"i have seven thousand fucking hands and they all hold up the sun, baby"
a life born of outrage
"stuck my head between the teeth of the divine pussy and came out unscathed, baby"
my lil crashing earthbound baby
the sharp promises of a madwoman
the whispers of the tiger in the tall grass promising your fucking destruction
she; my halo of fire
come monday we die on the path wrapped in silver chains
"the taste, purple"
craters that were once lakes dreams of death dreams of snakes
"god, this night is gonna scream"
"i am the kaleidoscope man  angles, phases and plans"
"i gave my bones to the cold eons ago, toots"
"fast nights and go nowhere dreams, baby"
an uneasy detente with her ability to destroy my world
i survive despite the pink cocktails and the ever increasing strength of gravity
she; stacks the stones upon my chest
"this is no place to land, baby"
lovely yet incredibly violent
it's the destruction we sing songs to
infinite loops around an uncaring mind
"strange orbits, baby"
the empress' most darling assassin
if i sing too loud the crows come to try and steal my eyes
"my love, her mind filled with bombs"
what a violent wish when my insides wish to be on my outsides
"baby, you gotta speak of these dangerous things"
"you, me and the goddamn savage sky"
the vagaries of a mind in chaos
red-eyed brain puke
no it's far too easy to become the destroyer after midnight
just another dumb son of a bitch on the run from destiny
she; of the effortless simple beauty
terminal fuzziness
i have begun to melt to cover all the land around me with me
"it's a cage made of stars, baby"
blood black and blue
"my baby, dressed real pretty, dancing through the inner workings of the machine"
"buy the ticket die on the ride, baby"
ask and be damned
"stupid and impulsive, motherfucker"
the agony of a slow passage through time
she's a beauty and i'm an ancient ruin
she; even with your chest full of arrows i still love you
death came by last night he left a handful of salt on the nightstand as a gift  as a warning i don't know  maybe it was a dream
i eat my birthday cake alone as god intended
monstrous tigers chasing small multicolored rabbits through my guts
"do i look like a funeral dirge, mama"
electric and unknowable  we the radioactive
"the calculations the equations the mathematics of me, baby they're all fucked up"
"fucking dead guy blues, baby"
I AM THE BLOAT MONSTER
god herself with that pussy divine coming to knock down my house
"a goddess made for the desert denying, danger and drinking"
"we in the purple snake dimension now, baby"
"she; exhausted, furious and beautiful"
caught by heartbreak denied by the redeemer
little miss little miss little miss pestilence
just another broken day
my mind a hollow vessel devoid of gravity and the cares that gravity brings
"it don't hurt, baby"
goddamn bird laid a chrome egg just because she loves me
my atoms have begun to split - i will be both more and less than i was before
captain fucking planet eater
"in a paisley desert my baby, my heart and me"
the sudden need to be beautiful
is your soul poison like mine
to spend one day not as a fool but as a real boy
"my masks of steel, baby"
born raging
angry is the crown the forgotten face of the forest
she doesn't speak anymore her eyes reflect chains of gold and silver
woke up frozen and alone
this little piggy has his ear to the earth and his eye on fire
the daughter of a million years and her straight razor mind
"ignore the past electric fluorescent future, baby"
the goddess of the swarm
found myself screaming but i don't remember why
"fucking dreamland, baby"
all i did was promise to die
"neither bold nor clever but loyal, motherfucker loyal"
my love in black and white
the hum and the scream
she; happiest in the jaws of the tiger
"all life is christened with blood, baby"
woke up with my fingers grown long- extra knuckles maybe
all the horrible denizens of tomorrow
"cheap predictions of tomorrow, motherfucker"
things to love  things to destroy
it's easy because everything hurts
fucking murder circus
RUN! my wayward angel RUN!
what a monstrous accord we hold to
soft dreams of hard women
my babygirl is a knife's edge
"a personal extinction event yours and mine, baby"
she; i don't hold to these dreams
what light is for you what light is for me  repeat
the seven-headed goddess of rare things and pain
when things begin to change to taste different
"to take my dying slow, baby"
fucking insane to see  my brain inverted and free
she; in my mind a fire fight
the shovel casts a shadow but i still catch glimpses of the moon through the dirt in my eyes
"dangerous to breathe, baby"
spend the day with a smile and a knife to my throat
under a dying sun circled by snakes
"walk me through your last days, baby"
all the drug stars
under the blankets surrounded by the perfect dark
sit still long enough and the fox will come and lay her head in your lap just to remind gravity you don't belong in the sky
i have walked to the end and it is empty and hollow
dreams of an absolute zero
god's only fool lost in the low light
"just a prison of unrecognizable walls, baby"
"goddamn magic, toots"
she; told me to hide
i have locked all my atoms in place no seahorse shit today...i promise
she had a small smile and four bullets lined up on the windowsill shining in the sun
pulled through into the slow time every heartbeat takes a million fucking years and you're dead long before you realize it
"up and until the moment of my birth, baby"
somedays i love nothing at all
lying in the mouth of the river i hope for an angry sea
i deny this planet  it's spin and it's change
buried my six-guns in the sand only the crows know where
the future is a thing of fear
i am the rot the ever creep  i am mister tomorrow
"my fucking heart panics, baby"
"baby, this is my blood trail"
it's not the same this wretched midnight
grew out and beyond myself
to deny the fox in the field the tiger right in front of you
she; let me cross what i didn't know existed
burrowing through the cold earth dulling my resolve
oh god the sludge brain
my goddamn heart is migrating around my chest
all my towers fall
she; i am the marrow
"stuck in the ""there are fucking bullet holes in the sphinx"" loop"
all my molecules straying into unknown galaxies
old man willow and the endless avoidance
a dream of things that snap and bite
i suppose everything is going just how you imagined in your new world
"what do i intend? i intend to have a riot, baby"
"made that wish before the rats started falling from the sky, baby"
when strangers wonder why you scream at stars in the sky
to stop your breath and hide in silence
she; the day and it's escalations
fucking to drink the ocean dry
"the babbling has overtaken everything, baby"
to lose one's self in the twist
here is where we die: in the shadow of the pig god running out of time
"that's what i do, baby... bleed"
three cheers to the goddamn wild dogs tearing my soul apart
the goddess whose heart beat like a hammer blow
your eyes are on fire please for the love of god stop staring at me
a hundred million fucking fractals of falling
gravity is a dangerous mistress
she; already gone
stubbornly refusing to look where my body will land
into these cracks we'll pour a new mind
and thus a new son of a bitch is born
add more cameras improve the nightmare
i exhale empires
new lines new angles the subtle shift of my new geometries
rejected by death in the desert... future unknown
"hollowed by age and useless misspent rage, baby"
she; my nature is violence
here's me deciding not to be
so much smarter than i
"all the days are bad days, toots"
"the engines are misfiring baby, we're going down"
i'll sit here and you'll sit there and we'll close our eyes and pretend we don't see the wreckage
the rats screaming in your ears
a vote on my destruction
here in this place in this life or the next
this place this unrest
we play a coward's game
"no survivors in her heart, baby"
my skull is cracked and the stars are pouring out
i knelt once  all that got me was cast out into the wilderness to find a whole new fucking destiny
did the monsters eat all the people
she; takes your hand when everything hurts
the goddess of drowning men
"this ocean is heavy and i'm not doing so well, mama"
"playtime is over we must swim to the surface of reality, again"
"flat enough for the cracks, mama"
i should go
i have become unmoored
not sure you cared until the roots came
she; took two steps over the line with a mean sun stealing double-barreled son of a bitch
i survive on the fog and the rain on the empty prison of your heart's desire
woke up in clay trapped in the mold
lock the door when your mind is all traps and sinkholes
a familiarity of purpose
a rend a tear a violent splitting what's left but to stand with the others of me
felt a bunch of my atoms die when the clock slipped past midnight
a sadness born of the knowledge of tomorrow
"is this my annihilation or is it yours, baby"
goddamn it what has the biologist become
the devil's coin  madness and self-preservation
she sits alone the goddess of melancholy beauty
"words with teeth, darling"
elastic i have cartoon skin
the neon pulsing pussy divine of god herself returning galaxies from before they were born
she; teach me to be daring to see through time... to run
is it the difference or the distance that's crushing us
curiously a tiny planet has materialized outside my bedroom window
slept soft but dreamt of things hard and sharp
to drink a portal and be reborn
she; i am a cathedral a danger  a fox  i am a beauty faster than you
"it was just a small moment in time... delicate, slow and mine"
the tragedy of dreaming quietly
"we were radioactive weren't we, baby"
inverting starting at the stomach heading straight to hell
"love, gravity and the poisonous gas cloud of the mind"
she; holds my skull together when the plates start to move
"where can i hide from the rain  where can i be safe, mama"
"this trail leads nowhere, baby"
the rage that ebbs and flows that crashes onto the shore that destroys your castle it's towers and it's turrets
the goddamn inconvenience of living
i loved her even as the knife slipped between my ribs
the cruelty of a life lived
apart we'll be broken together
"let the car burn, baby we'll gather on the side of the highway and slow dance by the light of the flames"
an unfurling of my poison self
a palpable sense of dread
"i stepped from that clam shell straight fucking beauty, baby"
out in the black stars upon stars in stacks
i love you even with the tiger on your back
knives in my bones brittle and cold
fleeing with the heathens across the sand
"i sit tree ass still, you son of a bitch"
"get hyped for the end times, mama"
my little heartstopper baby
love me stab me blast me into fucking space
a sense of calm as the fox's face burns
we spin ever faster faster faster for we are the whirlwind the motherfucking whirlwind
"there are no presents in the maw of the worm, baby"
"the goddess of the fast lane, death and the stranger"
yesterday's bullets carried forward in time
a dream of sleepwalking
forth from the eater
"there is no cheer, baby only crumbling planets and rage"
here we encountered the monster quite unexpectedly
i am a fool chasing the dead
i have already been abandoned and left to my peace
"no, said the spirits"
"these are the things we put away, darling"
that sneaky clock just keeps tick tick ticking away
"i'll eat your goddamn cheer like a boa constrictor, toots"
"it's all blood and golden glitter, baby"
in the end we must face the goat that eats the universe and try and guess her name
in this house it's the lizards and their terrible thunder
in this fucking box: silence
a gift of circles and predators under the ice
she; sharp effortless cool
a love born in the long grey of winter
"dust devil spirals in the desert, baby"
under the boughs  of skeletal trees we sit serenely my sweet pea and me
for you baby i will end this world
for i am the softest boy
woke up graceless and far away
the goddess of arrows in the dark
in my a head a vortex in black and white
"hurled into space by the giant's toss, baby"
she; to be the forest when you're lost
i am stone erupting immaculate
"how far you willing to run, you beautiful son of a bitch"
in silken ribbons you wrap my bones  to give as gifts  to give as sacrifice
she; i let my mind fill with all your beautiful disasters
this rage is where i live now here in this house of fire and flame
i with my kerchief and you with your knife
the planet may have caught in the throat of the tiger but he just smiled and continued to swallow
behold the birth of a new day  witness all it's wonders  all it's terrors
the goddess lies in the mud and thinks beautiful thoughts
built for the lie
sitting in the blast radius of my own disaster
my hideous nature
"i still got fight left, mama"
fucking up my molecules with cheap white wine
"crush my skull and sell the fragments, baby"
floating serenely past the windows as the rocket burns as the ship sinks as the car crashes
"the sounds, my god, the sounds"
a savage need to be eternal to watch suns blink from the sky
folded time and space  traveled yet never left
she; knows how fucking heavy dreams are
"this frozen ground doesn't take graves easy, does it"
gravity has increased beyond my control
birdhouse hearts
"watch us destroy this town with a hug, motherfucker"
a rapture in black and blue
a shiny new machine preaching the purity of violence
these dangerous days the twins of time and death
"i do my idiot's dance for no one but you, baby"
stepped out into the nothing and watched as the explosion happened in perfect silence
from the heavens a spear and i worry not
she; broke my bones with a twirl a dance  smashed my house with a playful glance
white knuckled at 10:57 pm
a dream of octopuses and the hundred and ten year journey to find the heart of the world
come sit close and we'll talk about how much we'll need to run
"i need to ride the fox whose stride spans continents, baby"
"darling, we're gonna walk on feet with no bones"
take my hand and damn us both
the death of my fourth life was the worst so far
i put my back to the sea and dared the only girl i've ever known
"up from the dirt, motherfucker"
i am the rock thrower the bomb swallower
she; you are a hollow vessel unworthy of my death
the bells of a hollow skull
comets ping-ponging around in my fucking brain
you can't turn away from the demands of the sly goddess of the secret path
naming galaxies and warplanes after girls i'll never meet
"under this sun with his weak light that's where we thrive, baby"
slowly and with great refrain
complacent but i think of the bomb
i might be a son of bitch and a fool but goddamn it i'm warm
my atoms have become seahorse and i am no more
a riot of broken skin and waves
kill the engines we'll take saturn slow
don't make me be the real me
out of feelings one with the tiger one with the stone
we are nuclear fire that is the reason that is the charge
pass through the smallest door you find
i was a power in this land once  before i went... strange
harsh visions of yesterday
"here's the thing, toots:  my veins are filled with static"
opened my fucking mouth and a jungle fell out
she; how do you lie to the whirlwind
when she crossed the river to meet the boy with the artificial heart
holes in the bottom of my cage so i can poke my legs through and go for a little walk
used remade reborn
i said goddamn i'm a kind-hearted man
burrowing down to the center where mama can keep me fucking warm
the maudlin madam and her malicious malcontents
"i hold my fear close, mama"
when you're a fool and she is the destroyer
all the fools in line for the omega device waiting for their chance at rebirth
aging into disaster
"i'm just a crack in the earth surrounded by beauty, baby"
a hundred million fucking years waiting for this glacier to roll over me trapping my smashed body in it's icy grip
a maniac in a red dress
the fox rests her head in my lap because she knows it's too late the tiger has come
"she; i create these dreams for me, motherfucker"
skeletal tracks in the frost monsters dragging planets down to destroy me
"we are decay, baby"
she needs to be cruel it's in her nature
the terror of tomorrow has come
pinch the toe of father time between finger and thumb and tomorrow never comes
fucking labyrinth brain right now
the goddess who cut the red wire (of course)
my angel guts baby
a ferocious need to die frozen in ice
cross the country with no dreams to be had
"if you be my rocket  baby, i'll leave this soul behind"
torn from the sky like all brave men
i would lie down and die but the desert i birthed has demands so many demands
"destroy me fucking harder, you bastard"
"this blood this spit these skull fragments this is what proves i exist, baby"
i put on my idiot's face and pretend
choose today's mask
synthetics are fucking up my brain
she; brings me dreams in her flaming chariot of brass and bone
"detonate that bomb i just shoved down my throat, baby"
"god herself, that bad ass old broad, looking to destroy us all"
my god i need to be free from this
"a queen in red, fist clenched in rage, daring you to run as fast as you can"
(all love fails)
"eat these goddamn bones, baby"
"a crow settled down next to me to ask about time, the fox and the damage to the self"
"you were smothered because the fuckers feared the flame, baby"
"here is your burden, now carry that motherfucker to the farthest shore"
her shadow doesn't grow
"quiet time for the tippy toe man, she whispers to the ghost of the rat king"
"the long road and it's loss, of course"
we rebuild the chaos together
the carnage of the pigs
"i can't get warm in my current state - levitating above everything is cold, baby"
she; so fucking tired but the goddess who holds up the sky is who she is
through the desert to find i was filled with blood and the riverbed was dry
"goddamn, baby  (say goddamn)"
these are yesterday's bones  old and full of arrows
welcome to the land of inconsequential wishes
things with teeth
a monstrous tangle from the acorn i planted the color blue
will a name set me free from this ghost ship i find myself mysteriously trapped upon
i'm disappearing starting at the fingertips molecules peeling away
"classic fields of flowers and bombs, baby bombs"
i had to listen close for she was whispering but i'm pretty sure she said if you love it destroy it
oh the places i'll never go
there's fucking bubbles in my brain
let's see what shall we be invisible or indefensible  or simply lost at sea
i know just what the fuck we are   screaming reentries and painful landings
"i can't breathe this air anymore, baby  it's too thick too cloying"
"sangria for this is my goddamn blood, baby"
consume the heart  stones and all
god herself (with her giant swinging space dick) up in heaven diligently documenting
together we evolve backwards toward the sea
all my little disaster babies dreaming of a new night
"the desert is faster than us, sweetheart"
my day colored purple
accidentally teleported into the center of your fucking flames
i'm here for a million days the nuclear boy and his radioactive ways
the pig god rolls over smelling of doom
she; we start our day awash in sunlight and blood
woke up to find the fox had placed the moon upon my chest it's weight too heavy to bear
"just became acutely aware of my skull  like, that shit's in there"
"prepare, for we are the squid mind"
those microseconds before your brain registers what your eyes see: that is the past where she lives
are we the whisper that ends the world
when i'm last i'll sleep
"it's all so very sad, isn't it"
on all the screens images of my demise
she; i'll carry your ruin
tiger attack!
"the old woman who rides the sun, her spear piercing the cosmos, makes no demands of death"
i sit and i burn and i hide
day 1: begin to decompose
"alright toots, let's start at the end, at the tragedy"
"exploding in real time, slowly with varying degrees of success"
spacewalk into disaster
i'm going down... neurons and synapses failing
"destined to fail in the battle against the world serpent, baby"
wind doesn't bore holes in victories
the sludge has crawled over me trapped me
kiss me smash my face through the drywall
tragically
i need a new definition of time: it's length it's meaning
"this is not a world without beauty, baby"
the goddess of rust and love and being lost in the snow
i have become fractal
even the sun can't survive my swallowing
and a large heron to guard my heart
four little ghost hairs shining in the sunlight  four thousand pounds  upon my chest
a martyr and his hole in the barren earth
she; and her lawless lives
can you handle it when the buffalo-headed girl whispers her secret shit
chained to these lifetimes
"this far past the bend of midnight where maniacs, dreamers and drunks live"
"we're have grown beyond the confines of our prisons, babygirl"
nowhere left to run the roots have overtaken me
she; stole the tower the light the very ground beneath it all
it's goddamn graceful
"slowly, hopefully and honestly for i have begun once again to levitate"
standing ankle deep and drowning
"baby, i'll be your dark cloud"
we only speak now in the flickering of fluorescents and the grinding of machines
tigers and the secret words of cowards
she; hasn't noticed the desert has tilted on it's axis... pray she doesn't
my echo barely speaking
even though i know this place still i'm lost inside it
a line is speed and speed is gravity
"fucking interdimensional hop, baby"
stray hairs and a hug from a deformed god
the peaceful return to the egg
on it's point i set the pyramid spinning
the goddess of having lain dying by the side of the road
it's raining knives
"trapped planetside, baby"
her love is a river: wild and fucking raging
she; a well dressed assassin with an eye for trouble
to be the dreamer in his race against death
here is a field where the fox don't mourn
"i'm a fraying lifeline at best, baby"
prepare for planetary rollover
eat the whole fucking night sky
my ghost remains unaware
through a mouthful of fear
she; open this carefully for i have gifted you the desert and it is dangerous oh so dangerous
here i grow ever smaller atoms loom on the horizon quarks like fucking mountains
"faulty control systems, baby"
i can't go back... that dimension succumbed and was destroyed eons ago
back to back we stitch me to you
a love that's simple that's complicated that's mine a planet in it's orbit distorting spacetime
"no nothing is eternal, darling"
her life is thorns
there is a breakdown in the machine... slippage i think
the mind begins to pulse out of time
"this is the animal yard, says the discount queen"
like a fucking crime scene light through my stained glass heart illuminates the room
i figured by now you'd burn
"my blood is gasoline, baby fucking rocket fuel"
she; build me a pyramid build it to any dimensions you choose
"rage is where we live now, little onion"
telepathically turned the eyes of the collective toward the sun
check a motherfucker curled in the snow
do birds dream of warm blankets does gravity dream of escape
ever faster i have set this galaxy to spinning
unusual circumstances catastrophes and calamities
"it's the fate of all birds, mama"
born to die a lighthouse
"bout to risk it all for a forest, baby"
"portents, omens, the dreams of lizards"
quiet is the goddess of unremarkable things
she; you are a hollow vessel
"my god, so many extra teeth"
blew out the candles and wished for armageddon
i know you... i know you like i know the roots of the trees
under black clouds in an empty field of burnt grass is this love i think so
you forget: she is the swarm
crossing unseen boundaries into unknown territories what will become of me of you of us
she; will you earn her love her trust her scorn
a kiss for the pit for the tomorrows and the yesterdays
positively vibrating with the need to be nowhere and do nothing
who needs guts
either any or
apocalypse mine
these beasts these abominable beasts
gently vaporized... gone
legs with extra joints laying strange tracks through the big empty
she; told me i was unworthy of ruin
crows and quiet battlefields what the fuck am i supposed to do with this
she's quick with a voice that sounds like she's always smiling
"you, me  this rebirth and it's horrible turns"
wandering lost forever in the voice of her need
"demons in the mechanics, mama"
"crooked to the right  the dead guy shuffle, baby"
i hit the scene dressed like the chemtrail queen
today in the spirit world the shadow of the forest moves ever closer
"gotta learn to shut the fuck up a bit, man  tippy toe if you will"
we are the fox she is the tiger i am the squid
"baby, the bombs are falling and you're bored"
my timelapse destruction
my atoms wish to make changes wish to be a seahorse
the queen's army is on the march fueled by persimmons and rage and fuck you
"i'm still pretty in the dirt, baby"
alarms and burrows and earth gone cold
huffing the golden breath of god herself
when my thoughts turn to angry snow covered branches
"a trail of broken hearts and bullets, baby  five to ten on the plea"
the impossible girl and her fight for eternity
"oh but i'm a lazy dreamer, baby"
we the enduring storm
she; i am your life i am it's center i am the crack running through it all
the arrogance of thinking time gives a fuck for what we do
standing over me was a fox and in it's mouth were the bones of the sun
"radioactive shit going down around here, mama  a miracle maybe"
i'm alive and that is the lie
"i am, still"
"time goes ever slower, mister fox"
the pig god in his own way the one who left
"of course there's pain, darling  there's always pain"
losing cohesion like it's the simplest thing in the world
deep down inside where my babygirl hides her galaxy
motherfuckers just disappear  tracks frozen in ice leading nowhere
"give birth to my tomorrows, baby"
i can sing to you of tigers and their dances or how you're going to die
"i'm walking on tired feet, mama"
she; a brutal sort of happiness
beautiful like a razor is beautiful i suppose
time to leave again it's the desert call of the lonely
an imperfect beauty like me
the goddess of letting the river roll right over top of her
"scream the sky, you motherfucker"
what a far flung dream we hold to
but can you swallow planet
"in the dream a lightyear, savage and ultimately meaningless"
"what a sight, sharp, death in all white"
"naked in stone, mama"
she; you wished for forever i wished for a mountain
asleep but oh so fucking wide awake
my geometry is changing altering crumbling
"your heart is cold, baby... cold"
all flaws no reward
the goddess of what the fuck am i gonna do with all that you are with all that you have
the future is war
a lesson in hiding
one coin to bribe the daring  one coin to bribe the impossible
here's where they begin to crush you
the tiger with fuck you in it's jaws
she; you came to me with please
this road spans galaxies goes nowhere goes everywhere
"of course the universe is contracting, my love"
lost in the swirl where everything is broken and foolish
i have become brittle
goddamn says the most holy in this cheap bathroom in this cheap fucking hotel
eight fucking thirty
"gravity, that inconsistent motherfucker, has loosened his grip has become indifferent to your place in the universe"
"let me have this door and where it leads, baby"
hip hip hurray for orbital decay
the monsters in my gut reminding of death and his nature
in the field a fox lies dying
screaming demons hard in the sunshine
she; all love and screaming catharsis
a holy day of drugs and rest  drugs and rest
casual and insidious
love and the impact crater
i swallowed a cyclone and it didn't destroy me now it's mine forever fucking mine
woke up broken shadow coward
"we are far far from here, baby"
dreams all alone  without her without him without you without me
"red wine tears and harsh regrets, babygirl"
"these lost, immortal days"
she; i won't tell you my story i'll recount my goddamn legend
"still time to burn the maps and flee, baby"
i'm weak send your assassins
"there are madmen circling, mama"
stitched together with a fine gossamer thread a motherfucker needs to be whole
it's poison but i fucking love it
these are the splinters small and painful
"unfathomable, we are the distance"
and with a lash on the cheek
through the desert on creaking rusty legs
she; the whirlwind the requiem
"these are the bomb drop days, baby"
replacing this old heart with knots and roots
we dance a sensual mindfuck destruction
god's only fool and the dreams that die along the way
insane the promises we make
"together we burn brightest, baby"
it's a brand new thing this feeling of speed
all my enemies are beautiful
and we... lean
"free fall is imminent, baby"
it was catastrophic this love
twisted pomegranate thoughts
all these extra limbs i hold
here with a new weakness
"we'll see the dead-end we'll die in the dark that's what we'll do, baby"
these things the sky will claim
she's a goddess she offers no comfort and no reward
the desert the tiger the snake as an ethos
you could love me  you could destroy me goddamn it you son of a bitch make up your mind
confident in my failure
it's the warmth of her sun i adore
"wake up and run for your life, motherfucker"
lie your head
to disappear entry exit
"it's the hand of gloom, darling"
she; lost and alone the color blue
to be bored to tear a violent hole in reality
love's judgement of fools
"let's get close, baby let our atoms form new, horrible bonds"
the bright days the degradation days
the tiger as artificial construct number seven
when your mind is undisguised and free
the self and it's rapid decline
"i got six bullets and a death black cadillac, baby"
she; today her rage is delicate refined terrifying
what i've forgotten is how to live with joy
i feel the hideous stirrings of the future
small insect lift-off
fuck the desert it's wind and it's warning
she; pulled down the goddamn sky
like some old god angry and insane
"blood in my mouth means:  we go south, baby"
i am the bomb swallower
"it's just the reinvention of my soul, baby"
she; the immortality prison
nothing but the need to breathe
repetitive dream cycles of endless rebirth
"on a planet spinning faster faster faster we'll hold hands and hurtle towards oblivion together, mama"
this is midnight town now
i wasn't here i wasn't there
the terrible things of men
to be gifted an eye unaware
"no motherfucker more deserving of change, she said"
"i'll pay for your life with lead, baby"
life the color of blood
with her broken tooth heart
bombarded by particles from some foreign dimension where the squid gods rule and honestly it's fucking up my whole day
pulsing popping brain bubbles of doom
she; we are war
everything is accelerating  gravity is increasing we are slowly being crushed
"snarl that good morning, baby"
devouring the self in an endless loop
built like a mutant
"my heart's contagious, baby"
she; no morals no lessons
we the immolate
nothing so profound monsters in the wall mirror mirror ball
the tiger in my stomach fucking with my elements rearranging my atoms  creating something new
"filling the holes in my memory with shards of glass and rust, mama"
"like love, grave robbing and science"
when she spurns the love of an ancient sea god motherfucker you take notice
"just you and me, baby felonies and misdemeanors"
dream mechanics fucking with the racing mind
"you've been abandoned, mama  all the doors are open the guards have fled"
pushed the ocean up moved it aside
this two star boy
what's left for a blind circling fool like me
"it doesn't matter the sun will still explode someday, right"
"i have split into a kaleidoscope of selves, baby"
she; and the demands we make
"that's sludge logic, baby"
the rush of time  ongoing and eternal
i sacrificed beauty for rage
just a girl and her promise of pain
"ominous, baby"
a crow stopped by on his glide through dimensions to say hello and give a warning
tell the river maybe she'll care
she; you love the idea the ghost of me
greet the day with a sneer
"fucked up my astral projection for you, baby"
a love like me and my midnight poptart baby
pins and needles  needles and pins  the turtle  that slow motherfucker he wins
"where's home, baby"
i am all sins but like quietly
my atoms acting foolish with the desert's cold wind
if i take your hand am i damned am i saved does it even fucking matter
it's a trip this boy with the hollow heart
here to smash myself to pieces
"done fucked with the gardenia girl, baby"
this is a worship of the barren and the broken
when you ask for more and god herself mistress of time turns a blind eye
hard dreams of monsters inside me beside you
she; comes when your soul is snakes and regret
think of turning fully inward not quite an implosion but almost... you understand
i learn
dimensional bleed through
open your mouth as wide as you can i'm gonna climb inside
"we're in new orbits now, mama"
"cheat the tiger, that motherfucker  swallow the coin of fate before it stops it's spin"
assume the lotus fuck the jackals
"baby, i forgot how to die"
the last prisoners alive
these are the do-nothing days the desert days
lost in the cosmos and the ship is sinking send help
i stood in the sun and was beautiful once
"there's an edge out there somewhere, baby"
she; when i had wings i flew
"another day to dare the firing line, darling"
a shotgun eternity
to be eternal to witness the advent of the ever creep
gasoline rainbows fit to burn
my cells have decided they would like to be other things
"a caramel colored fox steps from the portal, drops a knife at your feet and lays her head in your lap"
even in the middle of this fucking riot i'm easily forgotten
weightless and empty the void a caress
this is liquid dreaming
zombie hearts are free
a crash course in self-guidance
"this little piggy is unscathed, baby"
let the roots overtake me hold my bullshit soul in place
"mama, i don't know is the harsh buzz of the fluorescents real or am i going mad"
the goddess who lost her way and turned her heart to stone
she; the neon purple pussy divine unfolds in real time
"in the world between lives the junky queen young, lithe and lean"
horror thy name is repetition
just gonna let this goddamn sun drag me towards heaven
midnight and my molecules hate me
shrinking inexorably toward zero
we fall burning through the planet's core only to be reborn beautiful on the far side
"let's trap the future, babygirl"
an open rebellion of the life eve created
"i don't care where it leads i'll be the first through the vortex, mama"
a maze of my own creation a place where i can hide
tip toeing across the high wire hoping the monsters in the pit don't fucking notice
she; i've never spoken a true word and yet you love me
"death's name is inevitable and he's a long slow march, baby"
irradiated death spirals and me
a new prayer for the old scourge
"who needs to drown in the sand, baby"
she; to destroy you i'll have to love you
to become as god to place the past where the left eye used to hold sway
the only truth i hold to is pressure... pressure unending
monstrous words increasing mass and density
this world will swallow us whole
a jungle must've exploded from my chest while i slept though i have no recollection of this i must discover my new boundaries
"i, radioactive"
"my soul neon, hollow and starving"
"let's drive until we find the monstrous open mouth at the end of every highway, baby"
she; inhaled my ghost for reasons she decided she wouldn't share
"to master the tiger is impossible, my love"
from the belly a new reality
"that's the heart of the thing, said the fox with the voice of a girl you had long since forgotten"
this little piggy is trapped in a paradox
"let all my lights go out, fucker  we'll party in my goddamn dark"
gravity and the eternal moment
when the tiger claws your heart and all the drugs they start
when your fucked up universe leaks into my fucked up universe
she; we are a terrible whole
"these are just fragments, little one"
"all the little catastrophe babies telling sad stories, mama"
"it's a sneak peek at the end, darling"
maybe i cross my fingers maybe the sky falls on me tonight
time pulls us ever lower
"let's find a new horizon full fucking transdimensional phase shift, baby"
the way back is lost the way forward is obsidian
"lord, erase this boy"
i've matured i am the forest  (now)
"she; keep from flying apart, baby"
be the blight we all love
headfirst into the jaws of the tiger
a cranky old steam engine of rage can't even get to the nuclear powered white hot rage god i'm so fucking tired
she; we'll destroy it all
"forced to endure hours thousands of years long, baby"
reshoulder the burden and begin again
señor shivery bitch
an endless cascade of teeth and hammers
suicide by telekinetic meteor strike
this motherfucker turned sideways slipped through a crack landed in a purple version of paris
smile pretty for me once before the end
it's my charade and i love it
i close my eyes and begin to float the tiger circles underneath but i float
cheek to cheek as the bombs start to fall
"give oblivion a kiss for me, mama"
she's faraway: the goddess of distance and longing
"count your blades, baby"
"you and me, baby an oasis of blood to drown in the desert"
bless your gorgon heart you son of a bitch
just a damn fool on the run from the sun
"oh good, the slow dying part"
she; it's love it's osmosis
under this blanket where i can be anyone i wish
shitty little angels high
thinking about suborbital explosions and the distance the heart travels
the optimism of a lover or a fucking black hole
anatomy of an arsonist
"just an everyday casual sort of fear, baby"
we the infernal
love and other hastily drawn escape routes
she; crashing hard into the earth
on tentacles and the curses of children
"just the sound of my ghost, baby"
"i could gift you my skull, i suppose, with it's hollow empty truth"
you are a storm and god herself has cursed me for a fucking fool
do you breathe because you must
i have the truth but do not see
"aw mama, whose truth is it"
"sorry, baby we failed to reach terminal velocity"
i hold the sea gravity and me no other motherfucker to be
to be reborn far from here on the shadow side of a mountain or maybe a mangrove swamp
the holy gift of clockworks and brass
to be spared by death when he comes upon you lying face down on dirty linoleum
when monday's wicked knife takes your heart
she; her rage her unsubtle mouth
i am the degradation of man his short-lived triumphs his inevitable failures
fallen leaves and the queen they follow
take from me what you need
"devoid of the will, mama"
i would but i've been broken for far too long
"paid for with the currency of the new modern age, baby"
rage in clenched teeth
she; you are the bullet i am the trigger
spit with your eyes open  (amen)
all my bones broken
drunk on the wind and the savage sand
"just another call for my destruction, darling"
fucking destroyed by the predictions of the fox
it's the simple things the dullness in between
she; the weakness that comes after
fragile as all of man
gifts in fur
she; do you still see the edge
"you're out of focus, baby"
"stars have hearts, motherfucker not me"
"leave me, mama  i wanna die right here on the side of this road"
a life in the cold cold rain volume one
free me from this this new prison
"we, the fiery sword swallowers"
wound tight like the world's largest rubber band ball of rage
as long as we remember: the hunters come in pairs
"i've been a coward for all my lifetimes, baby"
"i refuse to breathe this same air, mama"
goddamn cotton candy clouds
lay yourself low before the empress of the flame  queen of the nuclear fire
can you feel my rattle
she; we the end times
"we'll be cataclysmic together, baby"
her followers abandoned after she inverted and crawled back into the center of herself
stretched so goddamn thin so goddamn thin
"i have stolen the desert, mama  there are monsters in the west"
just a motherfucker on a blue beam dreaming of you and the science of quantum   entanglement
she; lovely and spinning wildly out of control
abandoned by my own fucking electrons
to but breathe in this vacuum
in this valley of kink: a queen
"demons ain't gonna find my trail, babygirl"
the pork and the beans the cabbage and the screams
she; the molten fucking core
"how many fingers we got all together, baby"
a love underground down among the thousands of skittering claws and shells
get your mind right see the ghost ship
she; a plague of petals
prop my stupid bones any old place
"i'll steal a billion goddamn planets, motherfucker"
"what are you really, baby  a dream a mission a vortex"
worshipping at the alter of the holy fracture
linked arm in arm with death we stroll the desert
don't you know baby that god herself flickers too
the subtle art of forgetting  totally and completely
growing passed the point of explosion
that motherfucker that parallel
"here for the big let down, baby"
this little piggy tells only lies
i can imagine the whole cosmos under this blanket
"but baby, cellulite is where the angels live"
she; the primal the quiet
millions of murder babies staring at me
here to collect the toes
we the heart's calamity
"help from who, baby"
"when you try and match wits with the fox, that darling of the spacetime goddess"
she; growing galaxy wide
born with a big ass sparkly heart (and tentacle mouth)
how do i learn to feel in this building of brick and steel
"in the warmth, changing and becoming"
bleeding but like... oddly
"the roots have begun cracking everything, baby"
tried to shove the sun into the hole in my chest
on the inside where shit gets weird
we are the amalgamation
everyday the tiger gets closer
she; i think i'll start breathing today
"just a slip, a mere shadow of ourselves"
"these goddamn mutants won't give me peace, mama"
can we just dance through these nightmares of gold
no. this day can't be for me
"hurry, baby headfirst for heartbreak"
a fool for monstrous things
"baby, we'll stitch together our broken little world"
the mistress of lost time
"flawed mathematics caused these fucking wings to fail, mama"
welcome to operation enduring ass boring doom day
she; smiles because she knows you've been broken by the best
a personal individual mine all mine end of the world
these pills stop the dreams
my tongue is feeling fat all spread out too big for my mouth can't think about it or it gets worse
we fuck like rust
perfect monsters frozen in time
strung out forever november
chopping lines of gun powder with my library card
just a goblin in the sun (will you love me forever)
here's a king in fluorescent singing off key
"here comes death in his slo-mo groove, baby"
because we am
she; a violent response
a crushing wait
too stubborn to turn and see the tiger
hoping to rise i chained myself to the relentless sun
comfort in the egg
a pilgrimage to the sea to find a monster capable of swallowing me whole
she; there's a hole in my throat where the dreams escape
to be empty to be hollow to love the son of a bitch who decides where the road leads
you wound all the way up and launched me at the fucking sun are you happy now
"fucking boundaries within boundaries within boundaries, baby"
what am i becoming my atoms have begun sharing particles in unexpected ways
she; soothing the small wounds
watch me gobble up the dry earth
"she's my pilot impossible, baby"
what's a fragile boy to do on this forlorn friday
she; gave out kisses and mountains in equal measure
"do we play pretend like we're the desert or like we're the river because i don't know anymore, baby"
holding wide the jaws demanding the tiger to eat me
an oracle came to my door
arguing with ghosts
a dream of the ever creep lost in the rain
"there are no more dimensions to me, baby"
a light for my stupid skull
"motherfucker, i remember the small things like your atoms and the big things like that fucking galaxy you carry"
let's me and you splash in the puddles and forget for a while
i miss acid rain
tell that bitch i'm just a broke stem rose
"she; let me be your black cloud, baby"
marching quietly behind this cadre of fools
everywhere i look goddamn tigers
she; the heart's cataclysm
"bury me with bullets, gold coins and feathers"
just an ancient city for us to hide
hush
"a pinprick of light, baby"
these high flying babies these amphetamine mamas  they all know tonight is the devil's night
when all the worlds to be are held up by her
"some of those fucking ""elephants never forget"" drugs for me and my baby"
"i don't mean to disappoint you baby, but... you wouldn't survive her"
she; the void and it's opposite
wednesday like hellfire like falling leaves like time spent trapped in the dark
"the truth is for drunks and fools, sucker"
"that big bad thousand lightyear fucking stare, baby"
i daydream in paisley and crow feathers
this motherfucker this lost beautiful motherfucker
she; we are the mire
nothing and no-one today the rebirth of the 2-D man
slow motion lizard blink as my guts churn
it'll go fast from here...  i promise
"forced into ever smaller shapes, she remembers"
"the beat brought the snakes, mama"
the sky is tearing me apart
blessed be the lost ones the ones made of glass
it was an all new thing but still the ghost of the rat king came
"don't breathe, baby the wolves are passing"
i gotta go my ghost is fucked
left my soul naked on the interstate
"take heed, baby there are monsters everywhere"
"where are the twinkling lights you promised, you bastard"
all wrapped up in my own forgetting
the tempest and what we can survive
my ions are up to some shit i can tell
turn and face the lizard brain
"hey, listen up, it's just us and the long cold night"
"a chitinous shell holds my parasite heart, baby"
this son of a bitch was born a river
she; confused me for a man i confused her for a stiletto
that's what this is  it's a trillion fucking miles an hour in the big neon
in my mind i'm dying always dying
"i won't let the tigers have your clumsy heart, mama"
"the dream dies with us, the desert and the old laughing crone"
"what're you gonna use for a heart today, baby"
new reasons to burn it all away
in this preformed state
it took years before i could see the fool i would become
"i don't know what you love, you son of a bitch"
she; maps with no lines
encountering unexpected protocols
no prayer like an idiot's prayer
"oh look, the need to survive has found me"
to die and be reborn that's the fucking horror of it all
she; we are what you get when the rituals fail
"the lies tumble so easy from my mouth, baby"
it's the rain she loves
woke up formless in a small town
"aw baby, sometimes tears are easy"
goddamn it's the fucking bomb i love
maybe i miss the desert and our blood upon it
she; what a lovely little love/ hate relationship with the truth we have
dream slower
"the whole world is the price, baby"
my geometries are screwed and far askew from normal
fuck you up for a sunbeam
this little piggy is last  the omega piggy
just once (mushroom cloud) baby
when everything dead-ends at us
"never too tired for war, she growled"
"ignore the bomb and it's tick, mama"
woke up to the jackals dragging my body away
every head concrete
just for tonight i own this hour of midnight
like a fool making a wish on a clock
a sneered kiss from a shotgun
she; we are the extinction
the queen in bronze laughing all the time
burrowing lost under the grey skies
a goddess of nuclear fire
"spare a dime for little orphan hearts, mama"
(will you still love me) a million goddamn years from now when my bones are a fucking tree
from the mouth of the tiger new drugs new ideas
she; fucking hungers
we are the womb the warmth the fire
fucking skull fire
dancing backwards from the shattering voice of god herself
i am the ever creep the planet death
i have eaten the mind of the dreamer i have stolen her fantasies and secrets
failed escape attempt number two
"heart-punch nights, baby"
when the spiral leaks
this strange other place this shadow of a desert
new neon tokyo and the rebirth of the mac
of course i still had my mind then
bloody handprints the color of tomorrow
chained to the moon like i fucking care
she; is growing changing mutating
if you're not another soul lost in the shadow of the pig god
afraid of the river and what we'll become
"frankly, my dear heart, these men are fools"
"we don't fuck with giants here, mama"
your heart sends flowers when your mind is a graveyard
"this is the charade we live by, baby"
a million years old an eternity yesterday my flavor sky blue
she loved first dates and falling bombs
when we hold the silence
she; we are the dream of the snake
under the floorboards where no thought is allowed
"what do you see what do you see  fields of fire, damage and me"
in the skeleton rushes
"there's monsters in my tummy, boo"
"the faith, fangs and fury of god herself as she looks to fuck you up, baby"
"a queen, formless and sublime"
here comes death a dancing merrily
the continuation: the curse of carrying on
it's the fucking eye that itches i'll give to you
"begin again, you bastard"
she; a shore and it's wreckage
the leviathan the cage the observable galaxy
here we leave bones with strangers
"how fast can you run, spaceship girl"
lines of battery acid and my guts a riot my eyes a kaleidoscope
trapped and damned just as my fortune foretold
to die on the known edge
met a girl that looked like elvis but i was angry too angry
took a handful of sand into my rebirth so the fucking desert could witness
"i'll follow you through your fire, baby"
lost in the suburbs with the queen of ages
the tiger the future the bottomless appetite
tuesday or you're all fucked when our babies escape the underworld
she; close your eyes and hope you survive my demons
i will devour this day eat the whole of it  (let the choir sing)
a cobbled together assortment of linear time and nightmares
my bones are tired everything else is in motion but my bones are tired
the pig god and his picnic the desert holds no silver
i will destroy this in fit and rage
our love save a shallow grave
"i have been a fool, mama"
it's a border but i can't cross (at least that's what the fox claimed)
"my fucking reality is fluid, unknowable"
she; lonely in her strength
"beyond, like full fucking beyond"
the universe answered with tentacles
the things fidelity demands
she; i am the tamer of tigers and the devourer of seasons
"today we wage war on the spirit world, mama"
these can't be real thoughts they're delusion they're tree thoughts
a knife in the guts for this poor boy
outside where things die
"decompensation as a lifestyle, baby"
she; here's the thing lightning as currency
a dream of rockets swallowed whole
gravity feels extremely sketchy today loose unusable maybe i should nail my feet to the earth
wanna watch me disintegrate
"time won't bleed for you like i will, baby"
to spend the day wildly in love under the crushing obligation of the sun
"baby, you're everything, the queen of the huns"
we fuck like machine noise
drugs of brass and iron
here in hell where the gravity increases a little more each day
lightyears and a pauper's grave
"robbing and stealing on the infinite highway, baby"
saturday is for exploding
she; sang a throat slit lullaby
to find the roots to fight and die
jenny and the low humming dread
the king of fluorescent time begins to weave
"destruction and the full system shutdown, baby"
quick sharp danger babies
simply aghast at the number of teeth
here is a thing i can teach you: god is a woman with big fat titties and a giant swinging space dick
she; let me name the mountain
the death of deserts the slow walker  he has the time
the devil's got pretty tricks
"no rewards, baby... not for us"
"precognition, motherfucker"
what can it mean oh what can it mean these visions of snakes and bare breasts
"revolution, capitulation and repetition the overmind learns to laugh"
two hits crystal pink sky
"to be trapped, die and haunt some elevator in a shitty two-bit city in nowhere america"
be ten thousand fucking feet tall and walk the stars
hearts lost and devoured in zero g
collapsing dimensions and the women who love them
roman crime stolen chariot time face on a dime eisenhower fine
"fucking mind sludge, baby"
"a desert colored blood blister red bones, vultures and the dead"
feathers and bars and the strength of her jaw
"i've got lives to lead, babygirl"
she; held me in her palm like the last goddess of yesterday
"single point failure, baby"
the princess with her dollar dreams and streetlight queens
the ruts are too deep to get lost
"bitter words, darling"
half skitter half shimmy
"she; be dangerous, baby"
there is steel in her surrender
she fled
my molecules are dying and death handed me a stone
like the idiot child of god that i am i asked the tiger for remorse
she; there is no magic in your eyes today
"i'm sorry, you're beautiful but"
the fox watches me there are mountains in my pockets i don't dance
"we the big drain cosmic, mama"
"make a fool of me, baby"
borrowed some rage from the sea
still carrying the sins of the man i no longer am
just gonna hide here while the spiders toil away in my place
some places are too heavy to carry
it's just the sky in her hand
beware the tippy toe man that quiet motherfucker
"the queen in neon knows that silence is the desert's lullaby, baby"
my blood has grown hard
with a low chuckle the fox gripped the knife in it's jaws and slipped into the time stream
god herself with her broken teeth and fields of flowers
"arm in arm in free fall, baby we'll kiss the earth together"
compromised this memory of bubbles
she; stood in a sunbeam before she unleashed her fucking chaos magic on this sleepy little town
and the demons dreaming never stop
say tuesday like a curse
there'll be a river in your dream tonight but you know whatever fuck it
open your mouth so the lightning can jump down your throat
the secret? we always lose
in my fucking skull nuclear winter
she; is the destroyer and i am god's only fool
if we could choose which death comes for us i would choose the death of trees she seems to be in no rush
the plugs the wires the machines all made for eating the dreams
"the only tentacles in the desert are the ones you bring, baby"
with death circle galaxies kissing
we'll hold tight to our failures
this is the goddamn field where sorrow flies
to challenge the huntress on her shore
the sky doesn't speak for us we speak for ourselves
she; sees you in your place alone and wanting
i bury myself alive time and time again
"hold your hand over my radioactive heart i want to see your bones, baby"
no brake light babies rushing headfirst into the future
a new day rises on what few weapons remain to her
"but baby, it's a heartfelt destruction"
in my guts a demon or a lotus waiting to be born
altering futures in ways i can scarcely comprehend
a rebirth in fig and honey and the unfathomable distance between stars
i am ten thousand fucking feet tall stepping over the wall to make that garden mine
"the tiger in the tall grass that stalks our future makes no deals, mama"
what a fun lie of this world we've made
the giant eye in the bedroom window blinking slowly
i have fallen into your orbit decaying and beautiful
"gravity is for suckers, baby"
here's the thing about dreams
they have no names all the extra bones in my chest
a bag of horses here on desperation row
rendered my weapons useless
in a voice like ripped silk a goddess mentioned martinis
how the buffalo-headed girl gathered enough supplies to flee this wretched plane of existence
and the tide held close in my fist
listening to her shower while the sun hides from my wrath
she; convinced the crows to turn their backs on your passage through time
"put the knife away, darling  it's just the fox again tapping on the windowpane"
so we'll die over and over and over again
passed into the new day unremarked and clean as a fucking whistle
i am the grey the ever creep the one dismissed by the desert
what will become of me if i eat the storm
"no, today we search futilely for a way to avoid death"
she; i lie with effortless grace
i am the prisoner time has made of me
"here and there the jackals slip free, mama"
open rebellion in my veins
the crushing stress of god herself's mighty invisible thighs on my poor fucking skull
"this is the border between steel, madness and illusion"
"you don't fight hard enough to live, baby"
this little piggy is all unchecked aggression
"all the way to the roots, mama"
just another golden moment in the memory of a tiger
she; her love her rage burn white hot
gobble up the nightmares of last night and begin again
the kitchen riots of 1917
"this comet came just for me, you son of a bitch"
under the sea crushed by the pressure holding up the sky
my skull contains multitudes and ghost towns
look to the sky and think of all the worlds i have destroyed just because i could
from here to there a painful scattering of my fucking atoms
broken doors and the little death who watches over them
she; the long mistress of unruly nights
my guts and their idiot malice
"fox dreams, mama"
"take heed when the twenty five cent goddess comes looking for a fight, baby"
the loose tooth highway of the devil boy
"the jackals are whispering tales of desperation in your ear again, love"
born of the dawn she rages
small small birds and ghosts
a motherfucker unburdened  from comfort
"i'm a lazy liar, baby"
love and the armaments of a new steel moon
hope for a slow decay
lullabies of the death cult cannibals of mars
she; this fucking dimension can't hold me
"seventeen thousand miles high and running fast, mama"
"you and me, baby wretched together"
the jungle creeps closer  i feel it in my blood the tiger whispers threats i feel it in my soul
jealous of the river and it's rage
she; ancient creaking machinery holds our love together
in this form terrible to behold
"baby, i am new and monstrous"
"fucking houses with all these goddamn walls you know i'm right, baby"
in my belly a galaxy waits to be born
there is no magic spell to destroy the universe there is only science and the mathematics of the collider
there's a river in jersey that adds sins to your tally
"the future's a lonely place, baby"
huffing high-test johnny six-guns heads to the desert to hunt the ghost train
the great cosmic pussy divine neon fluorescent and mine
how to be anything other than alive
love me for this world is a cage with no lock and no key
on the run from the colony for i swallowed the queen
"a love like a gathering storm, motherfucker"
god herself with a shotgun go bang
"we are incandescent  our rage makes us shine, mama"
"hold to the side of the dreamer, baby"
it means nothing until the tiger crawls free from your throat
on a tuesday when the goddamn mechanical men crush everything in their path
tyrannical intergalactic space queens and the boys who love them
she; laughed as she held my face to the sun
we traffic in sin wearing the garments of the damned
"baby, i broke the world"
woke up bloody mouthed and angry
all rage and slow time
maybe a thousand lifetimes from now when the world is unrecognizable
i have failed her test
mary and the idiot angels come dancing one by one
fingers crossed when you meet the goddess of reap and redemption
reality is weak it can be bent it can be broken just ask the shadow mice scampering in the corner of your eye
"calm yourself, babygirl birth no grey clouds"
hollow men and the girls with steel in their veins
"does your glory hold true, baby"
a novella starring the pig god all about fucking and suicide
"i soar her thermals, motherfucker"
"be beautiful, you son of a bitch"
i took that hate and shaped a golden egg... a golden egg  beautiful for all to see
furious and exuberant i've known a goddess or two
she; the fox that eats frivolous thoughts
at the end where time washes up on an empty shore
in the desert hearts don't drown they shrivel and die
got right down to the center of the thing and it didn't matter it didn't fucking matter
reduced to cinders and seeds
screaming reentry over and over
"sometimes i hear the sun  i am afraid, mama"
snakes and trains feel no fear
"simpler to just destroy it, darling"
bumblebees bouncing off windowpanes
just another old man with old man vices
because this is the grey
i said a prayer to a vulture today
it's just a little heart scared and running
she; answer her fucking riddle
under the sacrifice moon
"i'm a ghost in my own life, baby you don't stand a chance"
a goddess of spite and malice of stacked stones and warm beds of lost time and strength
come and see the suffering of god's idiot boy
it's true but
do you still sleep
i'm drunk and i'm high and the clickety clack of my toes
the earnestness with which she says it is exuberant
please don't talk to me of true things
i am the ever creep the automatic boy
goddamn it we're alone we're beautiful just watch
"motherfucker, you're an oasis a mirage and i love you"
degenerates and their kisses
"to battle the overmind with silver bullets and heart, baby"
"baby, don't you know you're a pomegranate"
i have eaten stars and planets in their orbit
everywhere i look lunatics falling from the sky
in this fucked up place where the drugs restrict the dreams
in the shadow of god herself where fires don't burn and your strength doesn't matter
there is a galaxy in her pocket filled with insane desires
"as is our way, dreamer"
throw some feathers at it and run you son of a bitch
the impossible girl traded her happiness for the sun
a pain from the deep center
return to me all my dangerous little cybernetic children
what's a motherfucker to do but drink the ocean and think of you
i gave the sword a mind just to fuck with time
all at once and never again i was the child the tiger the wolf the world
this new planet's crushing weight
this useless skin i'm in
we'll make little thrash babies
"the empty hollow breathing heart of fire, i asked  yes, she said, the desert is mine"
"having one of those lives, mama"
will i diminish in your eyes if i speak the truth  will i recede like the fucking tide in your mind
she; love me and be damned
"at least we can dance in this golden prison, baby"
the endless ruts of life one going one coming back
old man lizard brain
ah darlin' how'd we get here
a riot in reds
"unavoidably decadent, baby"
"whispers and warnings, mama"
no cash no gas no bullets hand in hand we'll face the storm
i will eat whole the cosmos if you ask
rejoice! for today the tiger in the tall grass turned a lazy eye and found you wanting
when your third eye opens upon the rain and you are transformed
crooked dreams
"my fucking molecules are not at peace, baby"
in the desert where the purple pulsing pussy divine waits to share her secrets
hours or eternities that's what she asked
she; bears no kindness (at least not for me)
"no tell me no stories, little fox tell me no stories neither happy or sad"
today we spacewalk: free from all cares and worries just floating aimless through the fucking void
these things i will birth: trees and scream-o and fucking galaxies
what does an algorithm know of teeth
in my new monstrous form (i have grown one thousand feet today)
oh the slow spirals of lost time
at the end of all things when it's just you and i and the tiger that eats my heart
"i love you, imminent implosion"
"a handful of lightning that's what we were, baby"
the time of forgetting of the drift and the never
oblivion and the big give up
these are the holes that hold my mind in place
will you offer aid when the jackals come
a king on his throne rage rage rage
god herself offers nothing but a coy smile and a quick death
she; taught the flowers to hide their disdain
time to put on my real boy face and succumb to the horror
slick ass octopus skin
she; tells stories of tomorrow and yesterday
"breathe deep of the apocalypse and own what's yours, baby"
god herself smiles and a hundred thousand miles of desolation foretold
"motherfucker, she was mercy"
"baby, i know the secret age of the earth"
drugs with paradise in their name
on the isle where my baby dreams
crashed hard a crater into mama earth
she; sees it for what it is and is... bemused
i am the tree that loves the rope and the tear
how do i murder a moment
it's because of the mayhem we make
i fed the tiger what i had and but for the moment she was content
you and me baby racing like holy fuck towards the desert at the end of all
who will dream for me mama now that she's gone
another day in the line stitched together with golden chains
"loose and frayed by anger, you son of a bitch"
some days i wonder why i bothered to drag my ghost out of the desert
the temerity of birds thought the snake in his den
i have flown to pieces
"feed me to your monsters, baby"
"baby, we're outta time we're outta bullets we gotta run"
"in space, where life is cheap and love is hard"
"no fucking gravitational pull gonna hold me, toots"
"by the witch's side, baby"
who among us will care for the dead
sharp knives for the mind and a graveyard of bones to guard her heart
we'll worship the riverbed dry and forgotten
she; comes and goes as she pleases she's gravity's darling
this is the story of the impossible girl and the world she made for herself
the theme for today is escape
this little piggy has eaten the time
go limp
i am the nuclear boy
"stitch closed the lips, dead man"
"i have aged, mama"
we'll share nothing but the frozen desert at night
the seriousness of a dull blade
the fox pawned the spirit he stole from the crow so the tiger could live and grow old
"it's easy to weep, we promised with a bloody handshake"
a simulation of the very nature of conversation
i shine neon in the face of god
the sound of choking on obligation
the ever creep come and see
naive to believe the big bang killed the monster in the center of the universe
i am a couch lonely and true
a leap into empty space
"toxic dreams of tomorrow, baby"
"and who, my love, should we pretend to be today"
behold the heart  behold the corrupted
the mouthpiece of god herself has begun screaming
all roots and steel
woke up to runes on the sidewalk and the dead in the streets
she; come see the ruins of the morning
"the wild women speak of dreams, propulsion and the z axis"
from this small seed a new death will grow
sexy like jaw clicks and quantum entanglement
left out on the ice crucified
stealing from giants
"the mathematics that make elephants and mountains and you, baby"
more violence than man
running backwards in the race for the fool's crown
she; destroyed me... like it was easy
"baby, this little piggy knows the way"
the pressure of dreams and strange planets
when you have no memories life is lived at hyperspeed
wherein i sink the world
"happy time sing along drugs, baby"
she; named the mountains wrestled the river broke my heart
those black eggs in the nest are the fucked up dreams i whispered to the crows
the foggy forest strangler and me k-i-s-s-i-n-g
a fool and his search for meaning
the bombs fell on the desert now all the geometrics are sentient
the pig god smashing reality aside as he runs down quiet suburban streets
the little princess of abandoned places and her mother the goddess of vines
to meet god herself with a trash bag over my head
a death to share
"like all things, this ends in fire"
fly away you son of a bitch
"she; i'm strong enough to carry you, baby"
accidentally went full fucking 2-D and slipped into another dimension
"coward or criminal mama, i've been both"
here is the shore  here is the violent weight of her heart
on a dare i fed a fox the future
"her imperial majesty's royal fool reporting for duty, ma'am"
before my skull explodes you can catch me dancing in a field under god herself's shining heaven
"autumn like a needle, baby"
she; a benediction in an unknown language
all our triumphs and failures on an endless loop cycling faster and faster
step out the front door and make the fucking sun cower
"just love that fucking doom don't we, baby"
we'll disappear in the crushing never
to save myself a stride six thousand galaxies wide
spin faster faster faster
ghosts and translucent foxes- what else ya got
she; i have a sense of things bloody and cruel
"do what you must in whatever mask is required, baby"
i'll inhale deep and eat your fucking shadow
"we dream with foolish hearts, baby"
these snakes that fall from my eyes
it's a wretched thing this thing we have
what a place to die thought the desert
"we're all just a bunch of fucking rebellious quarks and molecules, mama"
she; your fate tangled in mine
the whims of the tiger don't scare me i pick and choose my own fucking enemies
the joy of fuzzy details  of forgetting just enough
you answered the riddle you solved the puzzle you entered the maze lucky you
got the jelly brain
dreams of tomorrow's broken fingers
on the farthest shore of the blackest sea she holds a vigil and waits for me
by the hollow stars of my mind
these trees won't let me die at least not today
"i'll pull the whole fucking sky down around us just try me, toots"
this machine has teeth
"we were supposed to be something before we passed into nothing, baby"
"that bomb drop whistle, mama"
baby... we hate all the same things
my mind falters my guts are mud
when the tigers circle and home is a field of bones
"i don't know how not to be lost, baby"
a madness of riots and flowers
what a fucking garden she is
we fought in the house we fought in the car we fought on the surface of the sun
hand in hand the fluorescent king and the neon pulsing pussy divine lead the parade
she; thought you fuckers knew
wake up and decide what you're willing to sacrifice
garbage garbage mouth garbage bones
"i gotta take the shot, ma"
the drugs that make you sleep the drugs that make you wake the drugs that give the drugs that take
stand up you beautiful son of a bitch and breathe
"a thing so poorly understood, mama"
she; put her guns on the table and fucking dared me
she; carried the desert and she carried it for me
this poison heart i carry
"big god death is among us now, baby"
dreams where my veins mean nothing
"me and you, baby together we'll flow south"
she; hides her faces from the world
"a life lived purely in the mind complete with imaginary friends, lovers and enemies"
wake up to the tiger and the freedom it's granted to destroy
she; a softening
secret operation sleep crime
"break them, goddamn it"
"but for madness my temple is empty, baby"
"come on, let's go  you're beautiful always and we're running out of time"
broken and old  a noose made of gold nothing to fucking hold
turn inward and be made strange
in the streets little apocalypse darlings
we held hands and were conquered by the dawn
she; slow-motion sugar dream
we can talk about old pain i suppose
born to burn
just the most boring monster ever
i was beautiful once a goddamn shooting star
filing the teeth of this world
"we love in free fall here, motherfucker"
"because time is a prison, baby... time is a prison"
see the cartoon man blown to pieces
it's time for disintegration it's time we realize the clouds aren't for us
sunshine sinister
here is the account of my destruction
"the dawn has found me aged, babygirl"
we have lost the code for dream sleep
the get down to get down
the boy with the tired tears
you and me and the eye that watches but doesn't see
what was i to do when she so casually played the dead man's hand
will we eat of the storm
the warnings have failed the tiger has come
the lady who sits at the end of the world
here in the desert of original sin
"unadorned and alone, baby"
"and we, my love, are on the way to valhalla"
"she; is quiet, lovely and still"
here is the trudge the endless the unzipped flesh devoid of bones
exasperate like pain and hospital coffee
deep deep down inside where the little death hides from the sun
"summon the devil bird, motherfucker we gotta fly"
the clocks are all blinking there are no gods now
been trying to turn into a tornado my whole goddamn life
"we dream in riot and desert here, mama"
dissolving into static
a life lived in brass
i'm flickering trapped between dimensions
set the tv to scream to soothe the ghost inside
"crashing together at fucking lightspeed, babygirl"
her body the thunder in my guts
"disperse my molecules, motherfucker i dare you"
"where the crash comes naturally, baby"
she; the ever swirling galaxy of my heart
these are the things you need to hear angry boy
a whispered tale a drunkard's legend '03 bonnie and clyde
"open the front door spook the unicorn get coffee work die repeat it's easy, baby"
geez louise a toe cramp will remind you the universe is fucking real
"the all-encompassing ever expanding mind, baby"
the empress most high is up to some shit tonight
"my rods and cones are fucked, ma"
to be all things at all times
"give my mind room to scream, baby"
colorless until the light touches it is the most insane fucking thing ever
she; stood shield to shield with the other warriors and made ready for war
see the weeper at dusk
"the lady of leaves, empty spaces and time"
monstrous deformation and the love i share
let's race the dope man across the desert for the future of my soul
"you fucking dream, tin man"
"let's fucking burn, mama"
the fox told me the tiger will sleep if we dance for all our tomorrows
this world i cracked in half one side just for you pretty baby to live as you wish
in a black field where her love was born
"are we unworthy of new gods, motherfucker"
she; what dreams will you sing to me today
out from the cage and forced to toil while the heathens worship their horrid sun
imaginary child syndrome
this is the eye that sees the past but not truthfully not the past as it was but the past as it's remembered
one silver coin to buy the world
the ache of trash bones
"just a rusty princess living on credit, baby"
of course my future is an acorn
shrinking into glory
i offered her my neck
you lie back and dream  i'll inhale the clouds and keep the sky where it belongs
"here the demon marked me my bones glowing radioactive green  baby, come and see"
she; only words spoken in anger for the rest of the day
i fucking car crash love you
"we're fast as we need to be, baby"
she; simultaneously both the goddess of change and the strength of the foundation
when the nomads come to trade drugs and stories
hand in hand through the hollow through the season of nothing
johnny six-guns versus the mistress of all tomorrows
this emptiness has made a coward of me
i need a new state of being fresh elements different molecules
new atomic heartbeats
she; knew we were sinking that the world was sinking
strange the shit the soul gets up to
i'll carry the burden of the river mouth
beware! the tigers have come
"i grew roots to defy gravity, mama"
here i grow six hundred extra bones in my spine yours and mine
the right honorable princess andromeda and the rage she contains
"fucking space horse gallop, you son of a bitch"
"can you still dream, baby"
to cast aside this flesh  the stars call to my blood with fire
a cosmic unfolding as she waits in the tall grass of this wasted place
held by this reality like an angry lover
what's left but crazy time and masks
she; laughs at her own cruelties and is all the more beautiful for it
"in the longest goddamn cadillac we can find, mama"
"just a riot for you and me, my little black cloud baby"
a thousand eyes turn to watch me pass
the branch of reality where i remain in bed is enticing but unfortunately isn't the truth
but it's not is it... it's not gonna be ok
sunday night or crush my bones under your hoove o mighty pig god
all things should have a name
maybe one day you'll be lost maybe one day you'll die maybe one day you'll wake up and realize you're the reincarnation of the desert
"these walls will not bar my stride, mama"
"no, i'm a fool, which is far worse"
a kaleidoscope to scatter and spread this boring everyday rage
follow the path of the tentacle
she; to stand astride this world and crush us all in her fist
to eat this world
"drag my golden bones through your day, baby"
what've we found baby but vultures
true stories of an idiot and a malcontent
oh to be
she; teaching the seeds to be dangerous
i have begun to float to levitate to remember who i am
debauched rolling hills
give that word away let that motherfucker hold no power
"a lever with which to move this world, mama"
among the desert dunes nevers and soons  violent afternoons
a universe a scheme
death and her lover tomorrow
"burn flowers like daylight, baby"
"god's only fool, in from the wilderness, already regretting what could've been"
she; are you ready for i have made a new day with new choices new chances new realities
woke up with the ghosts  as they passed seamlessly effortlessly peacefully around me
i don't have anymore deep breaths
woke up and slept got bored and wept
because i can be better
she; i fuck i fight i exist
"we're all very much older, dear"
"she's a killer, baby"
she; holds to no code but the blood and the blade
the ghost who holds time in her hands
a dreamer lost
i am the dirt i am the soil
when the pussy divine takes the earth for her pleasure
you and i lonely together
i have forgotten so much: the secret names of birds where the fox hides the name of the woman in the center of the desert
she; the pillar against the storm
the buffalo-headed girl mourns
"remember me in my decline, baby"
gave my molecules the right to choose the right to be whatever the fuck they want
in her pride she doomed us all (and we loved her for it)
a fate resigned
how the fuck am i supposed to continue like this when the only goal left is to avoid the tigers
"to balance the feather, i suppose"
"knots and theories, motherfucker"
touch and the burn of savage nerves
a goddess shone
an ocean suspended a search party lost
the tiger watches because someone must
if you would hold my hand i would suffer the crows to eat my eyes
a queen without her sword still dreams
sing carousel for me
"there is no night without you, baby"
i just... i can't contain it anymore
bound to me and we ride west
she; the inevitable
the debutantes bare-knuckle boxing and exotic flower exhibition
between her teeth a fire rages
the circle is eternal and begins anew
my grave a willow tree
tied to the post on fire screaming
psst make sandra bernard the joker
i have become undone
she; knows the answers cradles me gently in her mind
"a thousand million days of destruction for you and i, baby"
in a garage in jersey a small hadron collider is waiting
guerrillas in the suburbs rebels on the interstate
god is queer
scars and broken bones forget-me-nots
woke up in a circle of flowers being growled at by an old woman and her mangy hound
she; birthed the desert and all its myriad of monsters
the screaming nuclear fire of my open fluorescent eyes
froth and rage
it's a gift the empress of the morning brings
this little piggy got a .22 caliber heart
"volume, witches and sunspots"
the heart the snakes the terrible decisions it makes
defiant and daring new day
she; comes made for war
a savage distillation of the mundane man
stared hard at the sun and when i was done i had fallen asleep in kansas and awoken in berlin
i used to believe in love  i used to believe in streetlights
she; still laughs sometimes when i sing off-key songs at the moon
"into the wall next to the front door she stabbed her sword, sneered and walked off"
fine angel iconoclast
i found her in the center alone and enraged
we the wretched few
totally normal shit says the squid in my fucking skull
when will this end when will the fox lead the tiger to my hiding place
found but yet still fucking lost
"at the end it's just sadness, mama"
cybernetic rabbits of the machine overmind
down in your fucking guts where rebellion breeds
she; eater of thoughts and forevers
the queen whose heart refused to yield
"listen, darling: the sun will rise today whether we wish it to be so or not"
a monster of pressure and temperature
a place to hold my terrors
"we're gonna do strange drugs in new all-different  galaxies, baby"
sucked into a crack of fucking forever
she; knows the paths and the clearings along the way
love and the new civil disobedience
gravity is acceleration and knowledge is a sin
big spoon little spoon impact crater boom
the orbit decayed faster than i could call your name
the ghost of the rat king shares a fable with the lost kids of the desert
that pussy divine come to steal your sun
she; would forget if she only knew how
"paint your nails fistfight red, baby"
throw wide the doors of this celestial cage
get down among the roots and mud you son of a bitch we're gonna wrestle
the goddamn ghost of ymir
between the torch and the sea
please don't touch them... they are... precious... to me
i refuse to open that small door because i fear that
a day in the life of the sun
life didn't used to be so hard
there is only now and the future the machines decide we are worthy of
bit the head from the monster
"when your atoms forego their traditional bonds to form new, painful elements"
a fool and his belief in gravity
she; infinite before i wake
"drag the fucking stars into your orbit, baby"
the fox whispers the eye explodes
"feathers, stones and gold these will pay her toll"
a scream for the emptiness
the lord of fools and happenstance
it's simple really: legends die
you be the spider the fly the web she'll be the fucking breeze that blows through
"she; ""jiggles"""
claw marks as proof of the circling tigers
"this is not decay, mama"
smoking tin foil injecting lighter fluid
she; i am both mountain and cloud and see no reason to explain the difference
a map of portals and vortexes of ghosts and lost children
death witnesses rain for the first time
to kiss the chattering skull under my skin
my bones are red
my internal time is fucked like it's sixty eight o'clock fucked
"mama, bury me under the westbound lane"
"i have eaten of the wind, motherfucker"
on the corner of violence and heartbreak
deep under the never
and the light that springs forth from the open legs of god herself
she; tells impossible stories of love and grace
the husk queen nothing in between
"the future is tentacles, baby"
let the jackals drag away my ribcage let the flowers bloom over what's left
today we deny the will of the man
step out the door and burn
after midnight sometime when i find myself in the film negative universe
the pig god dreaming
"simply lay the wreath on my rotting corpse, mama"
fucking empty spirals
on being the exaltation of the dark black bugs of the soul
she; who needs a soul nowadays
"cut the power, baby"
when the monsters of the deep desert come bearing new scriptures and old drugs
growing into this old man
you me guardrails and graveside lullabies
alone together on this sinking ship
no eye in the socket no heart in the locket no fucking sunflowers under the rocket
of course the swirling vortex of the pussy divine
adjustments must be made
blink and you'll miss my next death
"synchronizing vibrations with the planet's core, baby"
me and the ferocious remainder
"fucking violent seas, man"
goddamn vagrant molecules messing with my mind
simply accepted the grey i have become
teach me to say your name
"mindless nonsense and daydreams, motherfucker"
in her eyes the desert  in her heart the fox  in her future the tiger and i
disjointed
teach me new things teach me the names of shadows teach me where the roots go teach me resentment
jackals and new nightmares
it's the apocalypse she wants
do you see my love reflected in this ancient seabed out among the bones and broken shells
this rage is where i live now
"sometimes the fox says shit like ""scrappy little fuck, ain't ya"" and i just smile and nod"
fuck my skull you son of a bitch
she; said worship me...  so i did
"the endless cold feeling of being burned alive that's where i live now, baby"
in my veins sluggish blood
shh midnight's almost here
"it gets cold sometimes, ya know"
she; with her steel smile
empty prayers feed the pig god
"white-knuckle love, baby"
iridescent dragonflies desperate to fuck those are my people
the trudge
the goddess of straight razors and empty promises
count the hollow chambers of my heart one two three
but did you fight to call her home
she; gives the sunbeams names
don't laugh but i will be a slave to fate no longer
"sharp enough to cut god, baby"
when she gets dressed in her robes of black and gives cute names to streams of blood
here we go to begin again
to give you my skin
it's the future and i'm crying in the cockpit like captains do
scream like someone cares scream like everyone cares
intertwined and interchangeable a spin and a dip
she; i'll look for you when the bombs start to fall
a savage clinging to hope
breaking down the machine categorizing the lost  repairing the broken
she; hears my screams but the countdown has hit 3
the season of the destroyer
one day i watched this beautiful woman crush a fucking star with her smile
"monsters in the probability field, baby"
heart thumping in my chest one beat different from the rest
the howling vortex that is 1a.m.
the house of the moon all filled with fucking tigers
down in the lies with the other dirt
"i'm tired take this fight from me, baby"
safety with my head on her lap
"baby, i can't talk, i'm in between dimensions at the moment"
she; no grave can hold her no flower can tame her
so many things left for a queen undone
we will devour them their youth their innovation their hope their future
dreams of fights unending
the last flowering of the divine pussy of god herself
love doesn't triumph love burns
she; came to me with a cloak of moths and a skulk of foxes growling in her shadow
we can be still we can dance we can fucking riot
we live we die the termination of tranquility
"fucking midnight chocolate bundt, man"
i am the only princess you'll ever need
chucking bricks at god
and here the lord watches me die
i'm tired of burning and digging for diamonds on hollow plateaus
"oaths whispered quietly are still oaths, baby"
"a motherfucker, love and broken glass"
"baby, life is devastating"
born rough concrete baby
she; my thoughts are liquid you wouldn't understand
i'm on fire because i'm falling
ask a rabbit why his ears are so big and he'll mumble something about secrets before hopping quickly away
"give the monsters simple names, baby"
the version of me that lives in the dream fears only the things that are true
oh to be the only napoleon in the asylum
i gave the plates of my skull freedom to roam
fucking warplanes disguised as butterflies
"look at the danger, baby"
planet annihilating rage daisies
she; unbound
death's lakeside lunch with the queen
this anger will define me but hopefully maybe just for today
the tiger that stalks my tomorrow sharpens his claws on my today
daring to do nothing in broad ass daylight
"little birds preaching rebellion and other amazing tales, motherfucker"
"interstellar drives, pigtails and purple eyes"
lashed to the side of the chariot forced to watch the sunrise
tell mother mary i'm dying  my body has betrayed me
i can feel my insides dying
she; took my voice and gave it as a gift
no more boring backyard drugs time for full fucking neon
sun shiny piggies
i climbed the tree to scare the birds away
"yeah, i'm an all-black rainbow everyday, baby"
pluck the eye and poison the well  gouge out a wish
i got bored now gravity fears me
"endlessly crashing molecules, babygirl"
witches conjuring seas from deserts and the boys who love them
"my lil rebel sweetheart don't dance for nobody, baby"
thoughts exploding rockets snakes and empty pockets
trapped in a dry riverbed the pig god dreams of burning
time's heavy hand has made a slave of me
lizard blink if midnight is forever from now
a thousand years later and you've just begun to listen
just be the goddamn storm already
"place what's left of me in the river under the heaviest stone you can find, baby"
selfless thrashing here at the edge of the gloaming
the universe reborn anew from the divine pussy of god herself or wednesday
new planets new drugs new dreams
hopeless hearts that fuck with your tomorrows
"do you dream here in your grave, mama"
she; comes to me with a gibbering mouth of madness and i love her for it
with her fist in my guts god herself makes my head flop about so my teeth can crash together
the flesh comes first and it's a prison the mind comes second and it's both lock and key
these stones i move with my mind
open no doors today pass through no portals  stay safe inside
the lie the open door the path that leads to the stars
"it's an ever tightening spiral, toots"
chains of ears hollow spears
of course i have seen the change that will be my end
the ever creep
little girls with swords and spiders
plant a tree/die/repeat
dreams of tigers and rivers and open cages
what's a fool to do  circling circling circling
"don't piss on my cardboard heart and tell me it's raining, babygirl"
got my axis all fucked up
trapped in real time an idiot dreams
"yield and give way, mama"
here with another gaunt new day
"the will gave out, mama"
"out from the deserts with riots in tow, baby"
a hundred million thousand feet from the launchpad is where it ended and i surrendered
during high tide when the fox walks atop the waves
"all ready for a new war, baby"
"what's with all the beauty, motherfucker"
the pig god ambled over and leaned against your house titling all your shit sideways
she's miss audacity when the sun is shining
repeating visions of teeth and claws teeth and claws
she; careless with her eternity
death's sunny day in the park
from the tiger the fox ran and ran until he found me sleeping and into my open mouth he climbed
and her lover the dead man
new drugs for old thinking
blindly attached the chains anew
"desert dreams and mayhem, babygirl"
before or after the monsters had eaten me alive
vibrate like you know the goddamn frequency you son of a bitch
she; demanded the world should spin and so that's what it did
blinded by the power  safe behind the iron door
an end to these savage days
alive!  that's what the fuck she is today
she; was bones yesterday will be stars tomorrow
"living is but the simplest thing, said the very hungry tiger"
i can see all the way to the bottom
tippy toe quiet man tippy toe
"into the now fucking straight screaming reentry, baby"
baby (hold my hand)
the mind is the thought  the brain is the meat turning sideways in my skull
"we'll get fancy like ""lilies and graves"" fancy"
"you and me and the hollow prize in the center of the maze, baby"
love and the trap gravity has set for us all
"we crashing, baby"
the impossible girl rides a horse she has named the empty prince of parallels
she; the bringer of ruination
a heart of paper and foil
here till the tiger steals your breath
it's the rope then
things to steal things to cherish
she; you may stay he must go
mindless as the pig god marches to topeka and his death
you and me and sad songs we know by heart
"and where from this horrible place shall we burst forth, babygirl"
all the things i shouldn't destroy but will anyway
she; to give her definition is to bind her
from coast to coast with a handful of bullets and a quarter tank of gas
her belly fat with the moon she erects the sun and waits for her labors to begin
"dying, dying and dying again mama"
after god herself tore my insides apart and she threw what she didn't need to the ghosts
in her arms madness
she; screams from time to time and no i don't mind no i don't mind at all
what can i say she's my brass knuckle baby
the fox from the deep places the forests the lake bottom the galaxy's edge
"no fire can touch me, baby my blood is translucent"
the things to destroy here on the deceiver's day
my hands burn as i shove handfuls of sun down my eager throat
we'll flee and my baby will sing
"we, the monochromatic monsters"
she; the thousand-eyed empress of all your tomorrows
more maniacs building starships in the backyard this world is lost
from heaven the daring escape of the pussy divine
flowers in her hair knives in her hands
"resist, baby and let's go underground"
rainy day dreams
the impossibility of courtesy
safety in her savage center
her heart on the stone stolen and mine
missing years machine tears
from her belly the goddess blew mist across the mountains and valleys
"in a thin disarray, mama"
"be soft with your baby, daylight he's tired"
can not
she; knows the bees make that sacrifice because their souls are immortal
when the damnation clowns come and sit on the edge of the bed honking mournfully
to escape the valley of the pig god
to loop around and devour myself anew
thoughts like small demons that fear the fire
in the desert just me and the dead end sage
"got my goddamn quarks all fucked up again, mama"
"unrecognizable dimensions, baby"
"the little fox sauntered through the portal he opened, dropped a knife at my feet, smiled and left the way he came"
"ancient and yet still somehow brand new can you dig it, motherfucker"
maybe just this once the sun can rise without me
the value of a true story
when god herself does two little pats next to her on the couch you go and you sit and you learn about martinis
a failure to rematerialize
the slow time god of mountains
oh geez the summoning has gone awry
the left hand holds the eye the right is empty and doesn't know why
she; the perfect picture of innocence holds a shell and smiles
punk is for the bright light of day so the whole goddamn world can see
open veins let the tigers in
i make the plants scream  you make the rocks sing
half-price sale at the constellation emporium today only you dumb son of a bitch
it's the idiot's parable
hi ho hi ho to dig up the bodies we go
giving the ghosts guns the ship has crashed and i need help
road trip dreams of million-toothed mouths at the end of highways
she; is happy (standing under the sun far from the terrors of the night)
all the little damage babies tucking in for some nighty night
bound to this place with magics i barely even fucking comprehend
"a jubilee of fucking blood and daydreams, baby"
god herself and the dreams of a violent planet
strange goddamn voodoo
crushing my cells and membranes
"savage renunciations, darling"
"i, the atomic man"
the reflection monster
"this bird, old as creation, whispers her secret shit only to the mad the innocent the bastards out for glory"
"roll the goddamn stone back onto my chest, motherfucker"
frayed stitches a tear in the seam  a dreamer without a dream
"the desert is full of monsters you'll need a guide, babygirl"
she; an exile in a three-piece suit
jump from the fucking moon top-rope reentry burn
myriad and the ways she burns
three cheers to the void inside all hollow men
the molecules began to shake and collide a small fox phased into my bedroom
"baby, we gotta go"
what'll we bleed for today
she; five thousand years of future time and what have we become
the gypsy said the stars would die behind my eyes
dawn and the frenzied signs of escape
time to forget yesterday
chubby checker cute but psycho
getting all the chemicals to line up and cooperate before my body bursts apart
how do you live when the meat in your skull hurts
"the cruelest twist, baby"
i've asked god repeatedly to end this but i stand in the shadow of her blind eye
she; sexy in her crown of thorns
life is just incompetence multiplied by time
"it's a peculiar day in the spirit world, sweety"
don't scamper too close mr fox or the tiger will find you
drag your chains through another ridiculous fucking day
"you ugly but you got courage, kid"
these goddamn beautiful visigoths
the empty hearts of fools
i will not thank the new day but i will thank you
let's fucking explode let's shower this place with hope and bones
she; don't fuck around wrestled the devil to a stand still
"sorry baby, i had forgotten i was alive"
i want seas that churn i want spheres that burn i want secrets you can't unlearn
the ghost of the rat king rides my soul reminding me about love and the inevitability of tomorrow
"we still got our dignity, babygirl"
you and me baby the last passengers on the ghost ship ss imminent despair
we the inevitable
love me you coward and watch me diminish
in that dream haze where the sun never rises
squish mind
she; plants flowers like riots
swallowing hope for a hollow skull
the sea makes way for the path of the pig god
"love, sky an interstate in flames"
i feel like she should have a name this ghostly owl who brings me small pieces of the desert while i sleep
just here till the big crash
"stab it deep into the fucking earth, baby"
she's smiling because she knows god herself set fire to the devil's tongue
don't talk much because my brain is filled with goddamn butterflies
the fox on his comet jealous of it's tail
valhalla calling
a crooked man's crooked stories
she; knows the names of sunbeams and missing pieces
wednesday brings hollow blood
crazy hot and unhinged
"run, baby"
magnified by the blight of god
a kiss before it ends a kiss before this field of ghosts
find safety burn the maps
fucking runway dreams man
from the tall tall grass the tiger of tomorrow watches god's only fool as he sings
"this world ain't got shit on us, baby"
where dreams go when we're done with them
beauty madness aphrodite freed from her bonds
the crows circling the fox on his island watching the water rise
"whisper, mama  whisper all the things you think i should know"
"we lost our synchronicity our temperatures are all off, baby"
as it turns inward and the heart devours what's left
when dawn brings the thieves
"full fucking neon switch for galaxy wide travel, baby"
find the witch in the center of the desert guarding a flat stone and tell her a story the best story you know
lost in the electric haze of the angel's neverending static
life at absolute zero
pussy supreme high octane universe scene
little boys with little tin crowns
psst the red-feathered owl portends the birth of the goddess
"riots and chrome flowers, baby"
you and me baby we'll get high and ride some rainbow bubbles right to fucking paradise
metal as fuck black rabbit shaped zeppelins patrolling silent skies
she; remembers no deaths can't forget that first rebirth
divorced from gravity i suppose
left behind bound by iron to the obelisk
inevitable destruction loop
"carefully, warned the fox"
courage in the time of the bomb
love and empty husks of insects mine
"your wealth won't buy my temple, baby"
i fear no man for the tiger has yet to find me
just me and my boring dust bunny dreams
listen motherfucker some days the wind is just like a new bride
she; hates that she's the fire
shoved screaming into the jaw of morning
here we go again flesh prison leaves and men
"we'll race against the fucking night, baby"
bones and flint and steel
i hold your ghost against my ribs where it belongs
the last march of the lonely king
"dig up your father's sword, baby, daddy is going to war"
screaming summer haze
you're the throne and i'm dissolving slowly
we'll walk - you and i and a silver chain dragging my heart bouncing along behind
and the choir sings fuck
the gallow's tree or to climb wholly in your skin your warmth
2 AM or the pudding junkies lament
look and you will see the fractals inside you and me
the tiger is the future the fox chases you between lives
this little piggy carried the desert all the way to your front door
"i have been all the kinds of fool there is, baby"
flowers for the wasted
come into your house tussle with your gods
these beasts these vile beasts
the drugs the crows the eyes on the other side of the crack
"dance with me slow, mama"
in the garden with a capful of revolution
in the cage of your ribs where the cotton candy dragonfly girl reigns
big ass trees with universes in their leaves
watching you watching the rain
"reckless jump, baby"
the little death of open doors
an eternity counting blades worshipping empty promises
while we destroy each other one by one
simply because i refuse
like the fox falling unexpectedly into your path
today we learned to fight
tiger come eat my spleen
that sweet summer pussy of the almighty
"got me hostile, mama"
can't... gypsy ate my soul
she; spends the coin of desire
the cosmos queen beautiful in the dream never quite what the fuck she seem
"you and me disaster mouth, baby"
watching my atoms peel away
the ascendancy of the bomb
cry
"empty treasures, darling"
she; emptied the temple banished the acolytes  sits alone with her rage
the wild-eyed mystic of the highway and his ten thousand crazy fists
"got crooks galaxy wide, babygirl"
i swallow fucking dragons
"baby, we'll dare paradise together"
it's in the ether the ritual the combat
no fucking sun today just the shadows and little darks i find along the way
do you super duper atomic promise
the mask is heavy made of lead
the intermittent strength of gravity and the women who love it
the countess baphomet d'ortega and the tools of her vengeance
holding the reflection of the sky in my fucking hand
I AM THE FLUORESCENT KING
all my infinity babies
"she; don't care if you burn, baby"
when all the systems are crashing and normal thought gives way to the pig god
pussy of god herself really out here giving birth to flowers and nebulas in equal measure
just to spend one fucking day in the impact crater she calls home
to defy the mountain and the new day lurking just beyond the pass
we the farthest
it's the little things the small blasphemies that hold me
"in front of the fire, my spear stabbed into the earth behind me, i visit the past and mourn for the future"
she; holds close my circus clown heart
in this castle a girl named loneliness
i take my pills with coffee nothing exists but my mind
"maybe your fucking heart is transformable, baby"
woke up feeling the emptiest of men
got down from her cross because this ship needed a pilot
angels and drugs and ghost ships in idaho
another weight i choose to carry
the broken robot's archipelago
we landed - born of a world in flames
soft and reaching
come for me tiger my walls are high
the crow knows it's easy it's just folds in time past and future
together we can destroy the man of the morning
tomorrow with all its hideous possibilities
she; knows that rabbits aren't trapped by the scriptures of men
who let these fucking stars define us
angels with tiger's wings
the unbelievable girl versus old man time in a race to determine your fate
how fast can we go (all she ever really needed to know)
"lightyears of bad decisions, babygirl"
death may visit but he can not stay
she; of the dark hair and murder hands
the many fingers of god holding you down stopping you from floating away
circling birds trails in the wet grass curses carved in the front door oh what's a man to do
paper birds paper birds
the violent passing of the pig god
have but to breathe to create the swarm
"swallow the atomic eye, baby"
the tigers the coyotes the crows and the vultures fighting like hell to call my desert home
on a long enough timeline we repeat and we die
the neon pulsing pussy divine and the truth it shows
she; i hold the crazy just for me
"no dreams worth remembering, said the old man under the willow tree to the clouds passing by"
"only idiots on this ark, mama"
when a sunbeam girl meets a shambling horror
weightless in her anger
"free fall on the highway top speed halos, baby"
i'll give you the eye the left one
i am a man of a certain age
ancient drugs for the modern age
i have anchored myself to this earth this dying earth
fell in love with the girl who had a bullet for a heart
"caught fire and taught myself to fly, baby"
"strip it of worth, she said"
she; all of this and yet none of this
plant in my mind a copper forest
by the ringing of my ears small children with big teeth and sharp knives
wake up and eat of my big stupid ugly heart
i'm not but i could be ya dig
RUN! you son of a bitch RUN!
the fox left a gift a golden box wrapped in chains
her policy: hugs or knives and bombs
"who needs to fucking breathe anyway, babygirl"
on hold with the skin stretched tight
she; knows the future isn't for you knows the spell to make it so
"this is OUR dyin' ditch, baby"
in the time sludge my dangerous darling and i
dizzy with death walking
"the sun, insistent on itself, forces its way through the cracks to start yet another day"
the ghosts (were inside us all along)
"got a buzzing freight train heart, baby"
a thousand eyes to close before sleep
in the yard tigers and crows  tigers and crows tigers and crows
"under assault and crumbling  crumbling so fast, mama"
how to die with style
slowly with the demon dying
the goddess with the long sight with the desert with the bones bleached white
aw baby i love your free fall
old mystics in the new apocalypse wandering the wasteland quoting scorsese singing teddy pendergrass songs
baby we burn
did she build the shelter does she hold the walls
the continuation of the monster
the number is three
"disreputable, baby"
a goddess who deals in tomorrows and forevers
bronze medal self-immolation
forever a blink away
i can't speak of tomorrow for today we are the fist
she; has come to devour your past your present your future
exploding into rays of goddamn sun
full skull throb dynamite
"swallowing fucking stars one after another, baby"
she; knows the song to play
that ozone sex smell
beauty to be held to be cherished to be destroyed
here in the giant's eye
i was gifted the tiger at the beginning sure she would be my end
in a safe a cube in the cube an eye in the eye a ghost
hand to hand combat for your love or mine
when god herself slap a fat titty of sun on your day
soul broke blues
"she; mistress of bugs, teeth and desire"
time is a cage rosemary and sage
we have twisted the journey
dawn had passed the charade has begun put on your mask love
jet black in the midnight bees
"speak it into being, babygirl"
a handful of pills and zues becomes the eagle
"she; i'ma take your prize, baby"
clouds and blood and monsters
zombie breath
she; knows to face redemption under the harsh light of day
time makes an ache of us all
red in this dark garden of haunts and terrors
"it was but a dull knife, madame"
her ghost fission heart burning up the goddamn atmosphere
to walk the bones out of your skin and start anew
the mountain tells half truths the ocean only lies
she; willing to fight but tired oh so tired
it was morning and the crows cawed a tango
death rattle fast and loose
i have birthed eons
perfect in classic black and white
"the snakes have come, mama"
the shaming of the pig god and other rites of the devout cultist
she's in my guts and smiling
out in the desert with the other bad men looking for compassion
crawl into my decline
didn't wanna jinx it but she tried to pay the celestial fox with a handful of stars
you and the high priestess of the temple of amun sitting in a tree
no work today god put some stank on my gravity
"tired and broken but still alive, baby still alive"
when it hurts all the way round all the way up and all the way down
because she is god and he does whatever he wants
the tiny deaths of the tip toe man
sober and expected to wield the unruly blade
the mind as nuclear winter
"i have been remade, mama  brand new"
she; today we walk in pain yours and mine
princess grace in the conservatory
"deliberate, slow"
"i, too, have blinded my eyes and stoppered up my ears"
softer baby softer
each new face of dawn a horror show
the lady the broken heart the knife in the wood
"are there no sacrifices left to make, she asked sweetly"
she; it's hard to be in my mind today
these tears are for what is yet to come
"sky high we rise, baby"
"i have turned my eye from the sun, it holds no promise now"
meditations on my own destruction chapter 1
been holding my breath for a lifetime
you and me babygirl down and out on the path to enlightenment
forced from the garden into servitude forever and ever and ever amen
sloppy libertine
and upon the side of the mountain he laid his head  quietly dying he began to sing
with a kiss on the cheek she pronounced her curse: you will never forget my fucking name
that mercury time travel smell means the tigers have come
"sing me a quiet song, baby"
pennyroyal in my mind the black clouds mine
apropos jones and the presumption of caring
"i'll go to fucking war for you lil mama, she said hoping"
she; makes dandelion wishes
my god she came with fire
"a new death starts today, baby"
tomorrow's tiny terrors today
i can feel forever in my guts
forging something new
somedays i let it rain in the hollow places of my skull
pussy as the godhead
with your bloody mouth against the breastplate of her golden armor you ask for forgiveness
dreams of mother's milk and running away
the mighty thighs of god herself crushing us with hope and acceptance
so we continue: devoid of thought and empty of need
"i hear symphonies of planets colliding, babygirl"
she; the beauty that surrounds my broken
these beasts... these beasts that call for a brand new day
tender or the queen's despair
"a haunted, hideous rain"
"it's the brain rot, gorgeous"
"tied to the sun waiting for love or death or just fucking tomorrow, baby"
the mercenaries know it's always darkest before the desert
galaxy eater
for your own sake  (dance close and forget) tiger fox snake
"mister, i have found myself trapped in this form caught here on the material plane"
"gunned down in the dairy aisle ""ginger"" is my final thought"
left behind the impossible boy feels no pain
she; the ache and the summons
the ghost of the rat king lighting candles and crying
"the sky is filled with monsters, baby"
who needs a crooked spine
i can feel your atoms separating
the eyes grow to take over the mind
and now i am the lesser
i lied down upon the path without need to go any further
she; graceless but wonderful
"damaged with silence, mama"
i will go with the lost left hand and let the drugs do their work
when that bastard sun steals from the bowl that holds the night
breakdown and the pig god's search for the illusion of comfort
unsure how to burn
a tiny boat in her endless sea
forcing the broken to carry on
death before morning
"home?   no, not anymore"
the cellophane mind
i can't see tomorrow from here
sixteen rusty nails that's what the witch asked of me
that devilish girl with the chipped tooth smile
together we turn inwards and devour ourselves
enjoy the end in luxury here at the hotel armageddon
she; ate my heart but spared my soul
trading seeds for skulls
"you up for a rumble in paradise, baby"
you golden delicious bastard
i'm dying and the wolves have come
the fool the lover aphrodite in chains
the fucking drugs that make your brain tv static
god's only fool is drowning slowly
in an island of pines an eye opens and sees for the first time
amber waves of purple pussy
the prince of swords lost along the way
shouting at an infinite sky
here a lonely field
"god herself with her giant swinging space dick out here making rainbows, baby"
caught the rain queen dancing
she with her claws dragging me ever onward
we make our own stars choose our own times to die
"she; a silly, sad man loses his dream girl"
i curse thee a belly full of serpents
locked inside the golden hue
"regenerate with me, baby"
it was the eyes that blind
just a small pain for us to share
surrender give in melt away
ain't nobody's favorite
we gonna do the drugs the angels do
my fucking ghost has continued
she; resplendent in my decline
"we three queens tears, flies and rebirth"
mama midnight has passed into slumber we must face the horrors of dawn alone
"our better angels are shitheads, baby"
broke skull blues
we'll play the goddamn final chord the chord of rage
no. we will not die  (not together anyway)
she; HOLDS UP MY FUCKING SKY
where'd you go my little chickadee where'd you go
"faster than the past, babygirl"
when the girl in the paisley sundress meets the end times fox
we are the spark that lights the fire and burns the whole world we are the spark that lights the fire and burns the whole world
that old crow that offensively charming mad prophet
i feel her atomic fire from half a world away
"welcome to the misery index, baby"
she; bent her will towards your destruction
in the shadows with the other ghosts
the morning with it's hideous light and it's gross expectations
empty in the center... hollow
the last honest man in rome
soft
the messengers the beautiful the damaged
we of the unopened eye
i'll be what you need bound in iron and tossed in the sea
her love a golden noose
my beautiful baby the endless night
just a giant fucking space eagle to blot out the sun
she; buried her heart shallowly
these sugar these sweetheart pussy days
that fleet footed buffalo-headed gal looking for a race to run
the fucking queen of planet sad
pinned (screaming) to the tail of a new day
money in stacks out the door out the back witches in black
i'll leave but i'll take my fucking leaving slow
i will mourn
when she's alone this road of bones
she; oh the glory
get down among the damned
my little rebel baby
she; lost
the wasteland i drag in chains behind me
the empty god versus the frantic search
the forest queen is dead
"slow learners, tragic sex cults and me"
the lone vote for the destruction of the sun
behold: it's fucking tomorrow (are you happy?)
she; broke your insides that was her price
you don't not anymore not for a long time
an empty world to walk
and the tiger draped in snake
behind the door of the last tower that still stands she sits sad and alone magnificent and beautiful
born whole from the seed of baobab
a failure of force
she; opened her mouth wide and swallowed the fucking crown
lost and forgotten in the suburbs
under every stone  individual tiny graves
disintegrating in real time slow-motion
zues transformed  (into the heart of a fly)
woke up to the dawn with smeared red lips
the horror of taste
the sun is just a fox made of fire
just the motherfucker to face the wrath of the princess of the shore
the gypsy that foretold of my death accepts runes carved in stones as payment
in the nightmare the never continues
"this is my fucking mask it's made of sticks, horn and twine"
at the apex of love and destruction
she; a tongue blessed by the razors of angels
i opened my mouth for all the nuclear tomorrows
like a tree forced to grow everything hurts
(hard g / soft g) the googe
the indelible beauty of waste
the many brides of midnight vs  the chocolate chip cookie
this little piggy sees the grime
here with the crystal skull of the last great queen of antarctica
i'll be the inky black lake you be the tentacles that burst forth
the revolution of the snake
slow on the magnificent golden highway
rain dampened murder heart
the ten thousand sins of the amorphous blob
she; makes bargains with eternity
the pressure of the impossible girl
here with a new day's disgraces
ever just fucking hear a new day coming
"bare hands dig deep holes, baby"
a deliberate floating away
hanging lovers from the sky
she; with a gold chain drags the mountain
all these things all these hundred million thousand things left unsaid
it's something hideous isn't it
stretched thin like there's six fucking quarks holding my corporeal being together
vibrating right through to the center
the ghost of the rat king out in the field possessing birds
"this world is ours to burn, baby"
"gold coins for the end times, mama"
she; my jungle queen my tiger in the tall grass
here with more dangerous days
here come that sneaky midnight mouse oh you fucker tippy toe
feed me fuck me eulogize me
what a divine and cruel thing
we make ugly graves
we can just go back to being strangers with monkey rabies in love
love and the left hand of ruin
"the fucking snakes of my heart, babygirl"
the neverending rolling catastrophe two bit medicine show
"we fucking outlast, baby"
she; dragged a finger along the boundary yours and mine
i've known since the last rebirth that the tiger in the tall grass would mean my end
"horny for the harbinger, baby"
"truth is for suckers, flowers and atheists"
let the cracks come
because i'ma dumb motherfucker who spends his whole life chasing things that wanna be caught
i am the roots i am the seeds i am the contempt of trees
her pussy neon pulsing paradise but you've forgotten yourself in the desert
woke up one day all grey with a mouth to small for what it needed to say
every seven years she cries for dying cells for rebirth
let the fucking rain have it
space and the murder mind
"there are no facts in the desert, mama there is only the fight and the fire"
one hoove left the mud so i could curl up and sleep in the path of the pig god
she; ran right out of her skin with her skeleton on fire
she was untouchable with storm clouds in her pocket
"of course your bloody crown is cause for celebration, baby"
the drummer is insane yet we march on
this machine runs on horizons
"in the fetal position melting through the goddamn floor, mama"
evolution's end: the scattering of atoms
"following the secret sigils, cyphers and codes across this barren world"
here with love's finest charade
"cobblestones, last stands and scars"
wars are won with black coffee and hardboiled eggs
this groove waits for no man
gifted a violent crown
"calypso, calliope and the braying of death's hounds"
"a throne on the trash wave, baby"
she; her art conclusions
under the bed a proper forest grew
fucking killbots kumbaya
we'll hold hands and face the end
"it's all love in the underworld, baby"
"darling, we have places to hide"
the merits of space travel and time spent alone
late summer plans got guns in los angeles cocaine in miami cybernetics in moscow
and so the destroyer has come (it's a simple enough thing)
here for to rot in the sun
the last bull in heaven
bending all my thoughts toward mutual self destruction
swallowing bombs nuclear exaltations
the hollow children crusade
born again slow
devouring all my old angels
and so we come screaming round to face the sun again
she; larger and larger are the things we lose
"blood is a liquid that will take the shape of any container it's in, fellow human shaped human"
set the owls to guard
we the plastic imaginable
obey the blunt force the blunt force is all
the sun knows it's hunger
this squad of new deaths blocking my view
"why destroying the self, mr chickadee"
she; says a motherfucker is a day made for stealing
it's the great itch
soon the machine will be ready
she; her limbs imbued with the power of some nameless trickster god
"we still dance in this house of ash and ruin, mama"
bit by a radioactive avatar of death
moon bunny the lunar rabbit
with my head in her lap we held a funeral a funeral for the things under the roots trapped by stones
"that's not my blood, silly goose"
"her last command was to rebuild the mountain, sir"
attack of the 50ft degenerate
tired tired tears
motherfucker is just another wild prophet (straight from the desert) here to count down to the end  5-4-3-2-1
here for the tomorrow people
so i took it upon myself to destroy everything i ever loved
"just one goddamn swirling purple spiral galaxy away, baby"
did the drugs the river recommended
if you fall on the march your ghost will continue
"things unimaginable, says the celestial fox"
"it's a girl gang insurrection, baby"
a languid raising of her hand summoned the dead: their bones their birds their swords
my baby fought the midnight jaguar
you are the mirror i am the past
"pussycat, we gotta run, the desert is growing"
like a little mouse like a little cheese mouse nib nib nibbling on everything
and the heavens did answer with rain
"if i tell you you won't remember i am the dust eternal, baby"
the chants of the mole men echo here on the toilet earth of universe prime
why? because i need her to be
i went to her temple looking for a fight
make the goddamn sugar march
"the fucking thunder clouds, baby that's what we are"
she; holds the tide in her eye
i exist because i must
scattered clues across the continuum for my eventual murderer to find
the villagers stand silent as the pig god rides to war
"knives in my artificial heart, baby"
drowning in dawn's warm embrace
like buddha on the edge of the bathtub
"red red haze, mama"
let slip the mask of time says god herself just to fuck with your day
the clouds pierced by the sword that ends the world
all my hundred eyes snap open at once
under the shadows of birds small men prepare for things that will not last
here come mistress le diabolique
fuck your chariot your sun your maiden of the hunt
she; danced with me on the eve of her transcendence
granted life eternal but everyday you must face the itch: the itch behind the knee the itch in the small of the back the itch of the scalp the itch on the top of the toes
"hush now, babygirl  (death stalks the interstate)"
ask the dope man if you want the truth
"the lady of shells, feathers and bullets told me lies i believed for far too long"
communications burned out long ago
i own the sky (just for today) i heard her say
broken on the strength of her current
blood for synergy says my gasoline baby
"punk in all three dimensions, mama"
she; is the approach is the storm that passes over
the sun is liquid cheddar your eyes are there too
dear god my own internal acids aren't strong enough amen
i cast this dream aside for another
she; her hands swordless
these quiet lines the universe provides
we die in all the old ways the slow ways
another beauty to bury
tip toeing around thoughts of tigers at my back
my bones are garbage
what is your life now but paper flowers on fire
"that's a pretty fucked up personal mythos you got there, bub"
it's an itch it's a scratch personal apocalypse  with stories to match
dreams of harsh tides and monstrous shores where little boys dig endless holes under mother's ever watchful eye
... and other broken things
"all my uncertainties scream, baby"
"fucking sketchy angels, man"
we have let our swords go to rust
playing sad songs for sad machines
replacing every third thought with brass
I; burned her fucking temple down
one two bruise for you
she; watched me die hallelujah
"motherfucker i gave you a gift i gave you the desert, wings and my bones"
tiny lobsters turning the tide of tiny turtles
"that red, steel on bone noise"
up down left right don't matter for shit directions are meaningless in the void
huffing the diamond elixir so i can see sideways in present future time
"the golden priestess slaps the fuck outta anyone who gets too close to the temple, mama"
the mind... she rots
"wake up and tell me it was a pleasure to die for me, she said"
"we're drifting, baby we used to be so much closer to the sun"
"everyday riots, babygirl"
i was given the word and so grew beyond myself grew and grew until gravity finally took notice and destroyed my new giant form
wastelands of salt ripe for the picking
"under the heaviest stones you can stack i survive, baby"
i am the goal i am the fire
captain cuddles' desperate reach
i paid for my death with a handsome smile
"new gospel stories about molemen and chemtrails, the jesus automaton"
under the harsh light i raise the dead
a promise of violence
no fucking escape the tiger of the future stalks my tomorrow
tis i the bumble man
take two bullets
"we are the knife in god's eye, baby"
spare a thought for the devil when you're walking hand in hand
she; replaced her heart with a fist a smile a promise
when the mercury in your veins got your heart pumping differently
crop circles and the fate of the jet black hare
speak to me of the cube and cate blanchett and fucking escape
"""take my hand i know where it's safe""  it was the first thing she ever said to me and it would much later come to define us"
under the crushing weight of the sun we lie
to swallow the whole of the earth unblemished
she; lost and unafraid in a new silent fashion
high bridges and halos
in the rain i fought the buffalo-headed girl to a stand still
when love lies gravely
she; small bones and her future imperfect
on opposite sides of the drain we circle
"that's ""MISTER"" rapidly expanding oblivion to you, mama"
the summer of nick dragon
"ask the deer she'll tell you: death is the fastest motherfucker around, baby"
cut the fucking head of the hydra that says love and apathy
in my mind a glacier
an empire traded for a head that hurts
late in the afternoon when the new gods can be forgotten
slow to rise
"stones, dry rivers, a dreamer in the desert"
she; brought me a sword i couldn't carry
open wide god said as she shoved her entire fist down my throat
she delights in her cruelty not for you just for me
watch them bloom these ghosts in gold
hope: that's the shade she wears
and lo the sun did shine albeit halfheartedly and with goddamn malice
chocolate and seafoam green and fucking anarchy
motherfuckers still believe they have a seat at the table
together we pull down towers of glass and steel
she; the near-death distributor
eat of the ash and call it divine
i have birthed snakes numerous in number
here the trudge neverending
i have unwritten the song i have pillaged the treasures of the new world
the pig god in his glory dying on the inside
ever ever ever multiplying cells
woke up broken and bloody at the foot of some carnival god
don't mess with mother's supplements
never met a fucking maiden that needed saving
like the other old men who once lit fires for fun and profit
reborn radioactive
with hands and vile needs
my dreams are small and all the same: pull this fucking sword from my heart
"give the witches the penthouse, she whispered"
i am the programmer and these are the robots that make dreams
the things you learn when you invite death to tea
a shout-out to the milk carton kids
love and temporal distortion in the time of famine
"we eat galaxies here, baby"
ain't wearing shit but time
"fucking cogs, man"
she; leaves pieces behind mountains deserts rain
one idiot's journey to find paradise
god is a sloppy binch and i love it
we are round and roll as we please
ignore the ghost in the backseat
"her chest? hollow, filled with loose gravel and bones"
you and me baby the wasp and the fig
"acid rain redux, babygirl"
woke up dismembered woke up feeling like my limbs had scattered
gave the boy a lie
a thread from her to my front door
breaking plastic bones
"out on the plains, far from the seats of power, she prepares"
she; says baby we collide
in the desert that wind spell  goddamn pussy divine
these tiny flowers? these are the motherfuckers that burn up upon reentry
i am the puppet she is the strings
"it was my ghost that followed you home after you left my body by the side of the trail, remember"
COME HUG MY RADIOACTIVE HEART
spent the night on the face of god
the veins the east the goddamn sun
all the scores you've yet to settle
learn to hide
she; empty as we all should be
visions of planet fucking space eggs
"we are all lost red space apples, mama"
nestled warm and sleepy in the arms of the fat tittied fertility goddess
"we are the hollow crack of the fucking world, baby"
her horns are small but growing
permission to make the flowers angry in their field
yoked to the tyranny of the sun
witches with chocolate chip cookies
a giant foam finger that says despair?
"failing sideways, mama"
the countess baphomet d'ortega
got down in the dirt and whispered some secret shit to the bugs i found there
"motherfucker, step back i'ma bout to cage the moon to my heart with chains made of gold"
we are the warriors of the new carthage
she; sent the maggots for to carry me home
take my hand we'll work backwards toward normal
tracing the path of blood through the mind
the dreams that come while waiting for the dope man
"beautiful motherfuckers exploding into fields of iridescent bubbles, baby"
she opened her fist and showed me the atomic fire
this bed made for drowning
"fucking up my soul with this carrot cake, ma"
the queen of mercury's fluorescent orbit flickering in and out driving us all mad
here with one true thing
i invited the fox (he didn't stay) but i invited him anyway
"baby, i am the fifteen seconds a severed head lives before it all goes dark"
this motherfucker astride the world
under the fence where no hearts go
"head first for liquidation, babygirl"
and the ground rushes up to meet me
grey clouds or the harsh warp and the cosmic pussy
she; the gatherer of bones and brambles of trails and empty thoughts
free fall into the heart of this stupid dying star
sleep is for suckers and charlatans
midnight in the chocolate chip dimension
we fight together the twin monsters of rust and regret
"a ""wipe your bloody lip on the back of your fist before spitting"" kinda night"
weighed down we have eaten of the albatross
she; burned her notes and fled
"the defeat of the hunter by the child, james"
"full fucking nebula sky death, baby"
the elevation of scum
"telepathically, toots"
"the goddess of distant, forgettable shores"
the masks are backwards so the tigers can see
"gravity is acceleration, motherfucker"
the mind pulse
two bullets: one to grant psychic powers one to end it when i become too strong
"it's all topeka and stories of cruelty's desire, baby"
has wishes and fishes and devours the sun
me versus the screaming angels
beautiful beneath the skin my bones wish for you to see
in the chains we trust
this lonely dimension filled with quiet screams filmed in black and white in front of a live studio audience
forgotten but returned whole
shhhhh we landed where love is pity
"guard your gate, my love"
she's out here bleeding tombstones
the girl with the buffalo bones is home alone no dial tone
been bored been dead
she; didn't need the sword the three piece black suit she wore spoke enough
orbital bombardment and the women who love them
still life of the goddess in miniature
pop-up desert corner of 6th and elm
i disturb her lamb's slumber
firmly nailed into the past stretched to breaking into the future
horny for my fucking blood still pumping
that i can't hear the apocalypse with the gas mask on is a joy i hadn't considered
and she grew and grew and grew
"be my hole in the containment suit, baby"
i live for the days when everything under the sun burns
"hold me car crash close, baby"
who will speak for me now that she closed my mouth and took my voice for her own
she; who sings to the sky and wonders why no one answers
i used to listen to the dirt and the roots and the bones of the world but they all stopped speaking to me i wonder who listens now
the choices a lightyear makes
"romance, violence, shag carpets and the lost eye of the drifter king"
stolen marrow motherfucker
the time is now the future is the dirt in a dead man's hand
clever boys who fall asleep in fields get their lips sewn together by dragonflies
"the goddess of trees, seeds and tears"
our lady of perpetual misery and me
don't touch me i vibrate
when your insides want to be on your outsides but slowly
a love letter to natalie in paris
is it your ghost speaking  is it your soul creaking
"you didn't get there on the back of my strength, mama"
awake with joy and dread
"it's after midnight and it ain't been made catching, baby"
what a wonderful blessing this pain
"serendipitous days, baby fucking serendipitous"
eat the shaman first
she; a dream a figment a fucking chimera
"you and i ride death on the highway, babygirl"
fairy rings and derangements
when you fall in love with the devourer of the sun
watching the chemtrail queen devour her male offspring
she; the alpha the pussy prime
the masks the plague the violence i travel in
in the rain far from the sea
the breath of that long suffering son of a bitch
psst she sets traps for me ya know
"shepherding the delicate void, mama"
the simplest fox
the dream of a solar flare
rebel high
new cataclysms all day everyday
here- where the birds fall from the sky
and this is what you hold to be a true thing
on the run and swallowing bullets
together baby we crossed the bridge perilous
what a sticky greedy thing life is
let's see who's faster us or the dead
"it's just the rain, mama"
she; with her dirt cheap contraband hearts
"that desert town firing squad kinda love, baby"
i dreamed of witches on dandelion seeds giggling as they fling hexes and curses while gently floating by
we count the steel with missing fingers
death before daybreak
this little piggy stuck in a hole with the other fucking pigeons
it's gonna blow me apart
she; called down the goddamn birds to destroy me
"fucking desperate, holy and divine"
"dearest heart,  the desert, the monsters, the planets at the system's edge... they call to me"
realistic or small exercises in pain
here- we carve the secret runes
"it's the ruination, mama behold the ruiner"
get you some fucking witches with that sweet herb
the crash of the dopamine man
sunday dreams chamomile schemes
"tomorrow, when the radio tower burns"
don't tell mom about the impact crater
she; the girl who scarred the sun
"that last wild ride into forever, baby"
tied up in the guts of the moon
the fat mouth of god
"bones and hearts break, baby"
she; held the black blade that reflected the stars
summoned a moss witch angry and sublime
she came wrapped in furs with a beautiful voice and a stainless steel right arm complete with all the optional weapons systems
the pig god damned by his own little piggy heart
the fucking sky comes again
here a thousand millennia ago when the queen planted the seeds of her own demise
spiral in black and white
turn your eye crashing into the past
"""no sleep"" glowing electric green neon on my forehead"
sending the gift of a funeral wreath statues of mary with gold teeth
disagreements with ghosts on the subject of gravity
obviously the part of the flower that fucks
"this is gordon, he's a robot programmed with the ability to feel sadness"
i lay my head upon the ground  the roots and worms tell me plague stories
"death grows up to be the future, baby"
the owls and the mockingbirds give the same fucking advice
the sadness of mistaking tomorrow's drugs for today
the sweet lady tomorrow trapped in her tower singing the blues
i told the trees we were indestructible - they didn't care but i told them anyway
she; slipped behind the wind and ran
work or the unforgiving chain stretched from the belly of the leviathan to the eye of nuclear fire
"decay like we do, baby"
broken on the strength of a smile
another journey through the unforgivable valley
musings of an apocryphal nature
granted a reprieve from the gallow's princess
a thousand million grains of sand in the desert is my gift to you
leeches upon my eyes and a handful of dirt rendered as payment
soft living life in six second free fall
the madness of planets on fire
come to daddy little orphan hearts
she; smiled as the guards caught us and she slipped away
we'll flee from the day the sun from the things undone
i sit blank faced at my terminal while the spirit of the marsh witch i accidentally trapped rages inside
"there's no name for what we are, she shrugged"
i believe if i can't see you then you can't see me you can't destroy me
"i'd share a lung with you, darling"
"sacrilege and indulgence, mama"
we run from the monsters in the tall grass together
i once chased an honest man across the plains
a wink of atomic fire
lil mama woolly bear in my palm asked my help to cross the path to get back to the place where she was last
"my mind has space for future battlefields, baby"
a child of death came calling today
mistaken greatness for dandelions
don't worry baby i see your ghosts
i tied up the gypsy i shouted dares at crows i ran through the bones
she; knows the voices of the dead
got that heroin in berlin starship autopilot style
the bruises that bring my baby back to life
running into boundaries with names i can't pronounce
i'm a slut for the food pyramid
the threat of the bullet and the drain in the floor
a bag of salt for a month's wage
she was the desert you were a gas giant in some far flung nebula
"me, you and the seduction of the last celestial fox"
how do you live with the anger of a dream
an empire lost on the tongue
a quick kiss of red mist rage
*whispering in a teeny tiny mouse voice*  i ruin everything
the pious power of pussy pulsing perfectly
holding it to the light to see the blood behind the flesh
she; gathering dust in your perfect little world
a genius crouched in an idiot's veneer
those tiny cracks that words make
the day i raced the sun and lost
and of lightning i made bread
i am a body of itch and rage
a fucking goddess in steel
the tentacles of the mind the tentacles in the mind
deep in the bone i plant the seed
i grew up under the powerlines under the overpass under the watchful eye of a vengeful god
i stood tall on the edge of the meadow i challenged the willow tree for all to see
the redemption of circling hawk
"she stood on the balcony, left leg shorter than the right, and they loved her for it"
love in my heart and maggots in my brain
how many chapters in her book of transgressions
i pray for a portal to open in my path
"four little girls lost at sea love, peace, spite and envy"
an emperor in flux
on the beaches of goa  she; battles the dragon in her feather boa
i got no bones so i conform
woke up and forgot to move
about the time i turn and devour the universe
when your trash island ass all number three
well that tickles all my gears and cogs
this room is mine all my skin is here
the punishment of the rat king in 360 surround sound
desperate are the sleepers
get these bastards outta my sunbeam
nothing left now but peeling old skin and transcending
the lost art of forgetting
kiss me and run you motherfucker
my eyes the desert
the brutalism of the new romantics
i make nothing; neither lasting nor permanent
glass jar human heart
"share your stink, baby"
"you don't see her, motherfucker she walks the tops of clouds"
i dreamed of slow motion stars endlessly crashing one into the other
what can i say? she grew beyond this world
i swallowed the eye in the glass on the nightstand next to the bed just to see what she saw
"take this fucking planet from my shoulders, she asked sweetly"
maybe we burn angels around here
this little piggy hasn't aged in like... a thousand years
fucking squid eyes
my death ray baby
"my guts, unspooled once before but never tied in a bow"
her heart was the whistle of the falling bombs
a novice in the order imperious
my head is hollow but for the screams
her aura: gold her eyes: black her armor: the bones of some ancient monster
ropes and moons
savage hosannas
blood and bone steel and stone motherfucker i'm going home
love and the unwrapping of the mummy
"because there's money to be made, fuckers*  *dumps ice cold 2% milk all over my naked body"
do we burn these fucking stars or do we have no fight left
when the preacher man come calling with them ravens and those fucking wolves
maybe not yours but my fat tittied fertility goddess has fangs
breathing through the blood
"prop my bones in the grass by the tall tree, mama"
blue eyes crimson and black
don't let the monsters catch you celebrating the end of sad boy season
"her, some glistening bioluminescence and me"
transcending the sound of the fist
she; her longing perfectly perfect
the unassailable purity of her operating systems is what keeps us in the sky
opening veins for butterflies
"maybe no murdery murder today, mama"
i know where i fall on the list of things she's going to destroy
we did but bury a titan in a grave lined with gold
i'll stop by leave some old skin behind
when do the heretics come
"ha ha ""not here"" motherfucker you are seconds away from a life and death disaster every day"
"barehand bending of the space time, baby"
crash landings a redundancy of robins
just like imaginary bombs and shit
psst the slip sad fox slides gracefully into orbit pass it on
fluffy bunny breakdown
birthing black holes inescapable
breaking my fast with the postmidnight mouseketeers
tell me some truths c'mon fucker
i'm sure the plague was beautiful too... in it's own way
"god herself, that florescent pussy queen, asking you to remember"
she; built for war
the loser's archipelago
feathers and fetishes tied to the song of your journey home
take my hand motherfucker we'll live a life on the run
welcome to the guild of dustmen prepare your pneumatics
"we are fluid, baby and we move as we will"
lost in the future shoved backwards in time
your girl's mans is a death squad
it's the blood that primes the pump
"i call this the ""earth mama depression sack"""
"the truth about fire, god herself and the incident aboard the starship hms britney spears"
she; her hair weaved with grass
"up from the center down from the bottom, baby"
on this the two hundred and ninetieth of may
a prisoner with premonitions of the past
oh god she was a son of a bitch
this little piggy followed the blood trail back to god
she; breathes the world with her betrayal
prepare yourself for the new atmosphere
"i exhale the atomic energy, motherfucker"
hard threads through your ribcage tying us together
i am a man overcast and grey
but it's a heart felt rage
"past present future god herself put pussy, drugs and rabid dogs in them all"
my beautiful time sludge girl
"only death will disprove my immortality, baby"
we being just tall ships of dead skin and pain
past midnight; open wide the devourer
take everything but leave my bones for the coyote
let the sun go down the ghost of the rat king has a story of heartbreak to share
let the rust take me
the goddess of the late afternoon is slow and lazy a giant who wants you to curl up in her flesh and nap in her warmth and comfort
i gave the mountains powers far beyond what they deserve
a tunnel under the roots leading past bones and treasure chests and ships of ancient egyptians
today we sinister tomorrow we sinister
the science behind my nuclear powered gal
"i speak no languages, mama"
death stalks my ultimate form
to choke this earth and evolve
i brought this dread from home
in the desert where we sing the soul fantastic
the destruction of mankind begins at home
"planting tornado seeds, baby"
broadcasting hard what should be soft
"2:11 AM the number of the beast, mr pulitzer"
a hundred million miles from the last place i wanna be
"the violence of other stars, baby"
this is for the dead
and a forever in tomorrows
my spears never reach the sun
fucked up the transfer put this new soul in this old ass body
sword tip dragging behind bouncing on cracked sidewalk
slippery thoughts snakes with razors the music's too loud
that golden-hearted boy i never was
the end the end gracefully dancing around the end
touched by the tentacles of the god monster AMEN
crossed the coven of sunshine witches
the water had turned created atomic men
share a smile with the ghost of the girl with too much need in her eyes
the pressure the swell  the drill the relief
"no more heroes, she thought"
gave a motherfucker of my blood
she; knows the secrets knows the thoughts of stones
she had an idea she made it real she set all her troops to marching
"god herself turned to me with sunshine, two martinis and a baleful stare"
"it remained, so i ate of the discarded skin"
the infinite arms of the goddess of hectic days
the sky in her eyes all purple pudding the desert in my pocket pink and paisley
brittle broken glass hugs
the sky was on fire over topeka the day johnny six-guns was born
sex and the plastic revelations of the pig god
i dreamed last night of apollo and the rising sun i dreamed of artemis and her bemused smile
"we had to land the ship next to the mountain the colonists unfortunately named ""the foul tongue of the temptress"""
deserters of the new war and the women who love them
she reached into my guts shiny and cold
"we been lost before, mama"
deathmasks in gold waiters in black
in my mind's universe where all the stand-ins for me have different names
this little piggy has a ghost limb all but forgotten
i stabbed the earth six sticks in a circle
"love, bones and the shadow of birds"
baptized in the gag tears of god herself
"we live and we die ants and worms, baby"
i sewed my mouth shut ages ago
today we'll float serene in the sky
she; dismisses your fears in an offhanded way
"so here's the thing: she slapped me, hard  right across the face with her left hand the hand that held galaxies"
a quick story about the heart i found bound in the grass and the girl who came to claim it
i promised the sun a fight
gorgeous in the low light
armies marched at her command her favorite flavor was blue
the nails that hold and bind
to devour one after the next
i need to start anew i need new flesh for my bones
the dangerous act of just being fucking born
"screaming under the blades, baby"
bombs for broke boys
"psalms about pussy, starships and death"
my baby bought me a storm
god herself told me not to mind the cross it'll only hurt for a thousand years
scabs and scars and outrageous lies
when the beast of the late morning hours comes calling
hey baby i'll race ya: first one to the blinding light where the future ends wins
brake lights on the highway two mutants in love
brain fucking gravity waves pulsing
she only promised cruelty
keep your beauty it's boring
i told the fox who told the goose who told god
this little piggy has a heart but doesn't love
we walk the path of fury the path of the open eye the path of skull and dirt
got that bomb concrete castle pussy
the chickenbone man contains no phosphate
"darling, take a walk with the other love blind fools"
she; knows nothing can be saved
goth god bitch and the happiness of my soul
mountains and sunshine and chains leading into the past
just another daytime moon in an endless cardboard simulation
movement out in the darkness
"flee, o coward"
small tiny backpacks for snails with rainbow shells
quiet birds and steel
"death, the little one the personal one, has a challenge just for you"
god's got other shit to do just be glad she set the world to spinning before she left
what does it mean what does it mean i hear an ocean i can't see
serrated like she fucking cares
it doesn't matter  we worship the stone and the end around here
think beyond the portal the next jump
a lightning struck goddess and my bones threaded with gold
give the sky a name and make that bitch your own
say a prayer for the missiles the warheads
and a garland of flowers for the ghost of the rat king
a violent sun rises
let my guts bubble and quake
his name was pinch  hardened killer square prophet discoverer of the pussy divine
"the desert won't shoulder your blame, mama"
savage samurai girl saving souls
all the money lost on wagers with ravens
pins and needles needles and pins  the girl with the buffalo bones wins
this little piggy can't reach the sun
two wretched hearts beating out of time
"we are not here to discuss the soft pacing of fools, babygirl"
i was a teenage bride of the spider queen
she; a curse we bear
"i don't remember, she said (it's like god herself made war on all her fucking yesterdays)"
when you see the endless and forget ever learning how to breathe
nobody notices the turtle days
"shh there's a storm out there, baby"
"trees, those ominous creaking death machines, and me"
in the belly of her nuclear fire
not now mama the machines have come for me
i left the eye behind for you to find
swallowing swords vomiting fire
holes in my pockets dropping bullets and old letters
chocolate days for sunday gangsters
"the very oldest of us, the grandmother of death, sings a low song to greet the day"
we are the new nomads  running from the tides and the fires  the endless dusty circle around this used up continent
awake from under the bed the sun rises screaming
my black cloud baby
and she wondered
"vintage heartbreak out on the plains, mama"
indescribable monsters from beyond the stars and the women who love them
when the dandelion goddess got some shit to say
guys guys bunnies laser eyes
i can predict mountains
passed into that highway of ghosts on the way to mother mary's house
"love? you want love? feed me to the wild animal of your choosing, baby"
a voice like a broken whiskey bottle and a body to match
give bones for spiders
wrapped up in gentle morning's monstrous hands
the continuation of the fox
i need the new skin
"we are chrome eternity, baby"
all the symbols of my youth have changed
love with a handful of snakes
fall all the fucking time
incandescent fluorescent rage
vines and stones  stones and vines these are the things on my mind
heaven is for hookers and malcontents
she held my hand (at least for a little while)
she refused to travel in the rain this goddess of longing and pain
"fucking shaolin centrifugal force dick style, baby"
mazes and things remembered to be forgotten
god herself sees the infinite void and is pleased
effortless in black and white hi-def reality
nuclear powered time sludge
"i pulled this fucking star closer so you would burn, baby"
behold the pandemonium in her hand
the pig god runs for his life in five... four... three... two
she underfoot; stones and graves
"guts leave trails too, gretel darling"
but what if there is no path
a queen alone on her throne  an astronaut far from home
this morning brings violence
she snorted a line of wolves and asked for more
into this place where there are no dreams no stars no tomorrows
"amen, honeybee... amen"
somedays this little piggy sees the forest
together we'll build the poor man's rocket to the stars
we are all lesser for it
and i walk and i walk and i don't stop till i get where i've been
small trees in her world crushing hands
gaping like a motherfucker got mouths to feed
"have you found your courage yet, mama"
backwards in a land of savage goddesses
to lay your sword down or to stab the earth the whole fucking earth
fate and her electric fingers
don't show me your deaths
god herself that most holy jizz flinger finds the joy in everything
cellular degeneration is punk as fuck
rainbows and bullets disguised as daisies
"of course my goddamn ghost eye sees the stars, baby"
and so we drank and made war
"crooked paths lead crooked hearts to empty gunships, sir"
ominous probes from the deepest of space are my fucking people
my skull hollow swirling purple cosmos
the ground is not for those such as you and i
"here in the terrible, baby"
fuck you she says her fate forgotten
goddamn concrete wolf coming for me
"we'll get married right here, mama  right here in this cathedral  right here where no god holds sway"
the patience of death the patience of time
face your foe in this field of forever
"two for the pain, darling"
the night cometh and that right soon
no funerals for mountains or songbirds
the crushing weight of the ocean and the women who love them
forty days and forty nights in the desert trapped by a malfunctioning exoskeleton
thrice i blessed the snakes that crawl
those narcoleptic holy blues
in her hands she holds the sun  in her hands we are timeless
meaningless prophesies and mindless speculation
acid fucking heart
"motherfucker, i'm just another ghost in your mind's haunted forest"
the computations are all wrong the mechanics have all rusted  damn it all the spells have failed
she; sees with her whole mind
iris like spiders
life is a simple thing to forget sometimes
this far out in the system where nothing is as it should be
it's midnight  midnight god damn it  midnight and the maddening itch
"run this son of a bitch over with your tender moment, mama"
love me peel the flesh from my bones
the orbit the station the nexus the nebula
citizens of the wrong empire
translucent jellyfish skinsuit
death by rainy days
the blossoms of the pig god
i will adopt your chariot your chains your sun
here at the end of sad boy season where the path of the chickenbone man diverges
splintered by remembrances
walking along thumping fingers across the white picket fence leaving the blood behind
love is unknowable love is the face of the monster under the escalator
visions of pussy intergalactic birthing cosmos
she; the river the fucking tomorrow
and a spear from the trunk of a lightning struck tree
racing towards that last second
chasing the light with drugs too heavy to carry
lifeboats and open hands we falling fast
just a brand new ghost 1 day old
"another heart's atomic days, baby"
fuck around and watch her make enemies of fools
if jesus was a velociraptor and god herself a dream what oh what are we
thinking about the size of stars and the appetite of god herself
slipping behind beneath around
the sin of the morning the breeze's rebellion
here at the end of all things where the stones offer no protection and the saviors have all fled
"just another hopped up grifter looking to make a name for himself, mama"
console the androids dry their mercury tears
hymns to fistfights
"only god herself knows the distance between the stars, baby"
she spends her days in kindness she spends her days counting raindrops
i wear this idiot's mask because it's mine and it fits
she has anarchist eyes
who needs skin says the melting motherfucker
the birds in the sky warn this is a precipice
when the heart behind your shattered ribcage meets my fucked up quarks: a love story
the nightmare race toward dawn
she; held my hand
last on the starship when rome falls
son of a bitch the compass needle spins three sixty
anywhere between one and fifteen that's how many fucking swords should be strapped to your back at any given time
here i trade my left eye for your heart
mortuary madonnas
and down we go submerging without breathing
gravity or the bastard's regret
scattered fragments of her yesterdays
"huffing that ""holy shit i got stork legs"" paint"
sundresses and the sound a knife makes when it skips off bone
"love, lust and DIY spacesuits"
she; the lady in white held by celestial chains
a kiss from the mosquito queen
this little piggy forgot what hope tastes like
in december the ghost realizes her worth and leaves us behind
johnny six-guns and the indomitable trudge
agree and be bound by it
god herself holding a match head to the wound
a quick flash of her blade sent the bunnies scampering
my lil blood splatter baby
from the roof of her mind the lightning
and then at last the bones
blue skies and a loose tooth serenade
mr 2D slipping through your mind's cracks
this little piggy is crumbling
she; the fucking comet that screams across your sky
"all these models, modes and illusions i hold so dear"
women have 212 bones
mighty mighty deer eyes
there is a giant striding across this land that cares for neither gods nor man
"it was sometime after midnight, is what i believe"
"it's the rats island now, baby"
skulls in a hole la dee da
sometimes motherfucker reality blurs
all these little gods and tiny deaths
for the love of one tired old man the queen of the heavens scattered her armies
"there's an ocean in my pocket pink, purple and blue"
i am the pig god and the static is mine
her toes in the grass will save your life
brain a mess of sticks and tangled weeds
she; a huntress in chains
will this sunbeam end  will it putter and stop somewhere out in space
simple sally sings a sweet song about self harm
i'm not fucking dying on the range for you
technology or another atomic morning dreaming
walking the dark with all my other sleepless dreamless restless babies
"the chocolate call of midnight comes early some nights, mama"
i will find you out amongst these stars and i will destroy you
you can sharpen your sword or you can count blades of grass motherfucker you can't do both
took her to topeka with murder on my mind
who will guard my crossing now that she is gone
when she manifests her celestial form just for you
chemtrails drawn in limitless space
"hope is easy to run from, baby"
sad (like an old friend)
"let's ignore gravity, the sky and the sun"
divine retribution courtesy of god herself's personal hit squad: pious patricia's pistol packin' pussy posse
the night burns
for the truth of ruin
sexy like a giant fucking foam octopus suit
administer the vibe recommission the groove
midday monster's mayhem and malaise
"high powered weaponry, the ziggurat and me"
in the back booth where no gods hold sway where the coffee is black and the knives are sharp
choice and the savage rain
she carried the sea on her back but that was the picture before she destroyed herself
and a god of mars to loan me the spirit
woke up to floating geometries and extra bones in the pile to choose from
"here's that shit again, shakey late nights"
a dharma most fucked up
these being the adventures of the doomed boy and his terrible girl
here and now the slow pledge
"a house without catacombs, eyes or mind"
the big hollow empty pain inside
painted the front door the color of god
spears of brass and iron to pierce my side
dust off the throne (she's coming)
we were the rush the turn the inevitable conclusion
is it because she chained the dawn to her side
2 a.m. the last threshold after midnight
oh motherfucker what do you see when she looks at me
"an elephant, if done right, should smell of whiskey"
stupid prolific and easily distracted ghostly passengers without a train
drugs in hi-def 4k clarity to ease the pain
the ocean never touches the floor
i float and leave no path  the cosmos whirls and spins on my behalf
it's cool she'll bring my blood back to me someday
all i have to offer you is rust
she doesn't want the pedestal the scepter the crown
the god of the death of penguins denying what the future holds
it's like making sweet love to a pillowy cloud full of goddamn rage
take the bones of your love and run
"these stars can't hold me within their bonds, baby"
all the whores know frank the one-armed hooker is a poor pollinator and should've boarded a ship to the territories ages ago
starship earth is fucking with my monkey brain right now hurtling through the goddamn cosmos like right this fucking second
all the pills in this new world
a line a million matchsticks long
big red as fuck self destruct button
snakes and hands the junky's lament
johnny six-guns and the chaos planet dreaming
this clapboard shack where we would fight and fuck and plan
she is sunshine and i bet you wish she ain't
"tiny injectable jellyfish, baby i've had my fun"
cowards write songs about her
just another dope boy prayer
her back was made for mountains
the six-faced god of future time judging you diagonally
this drum doesn't beat when the ghost of the rat king calls the tune
white flowers for future spectres
i have lost the thread that circles the world
"i salute your sad ass trip across the pavement, little earthworm no halfway crooks"
so instead discuss with those who believe in the celestial fox
sad the robots had to learn fear
you and me skinless in the dmz
"the first couple thousand laps around the drain are free, baby"
she; leviathan: hunter of the concrete seas
your heart knew it was a race
this world she holds but doesn't care about
here in the jungle jungle snake snake
in the trailer park where the rider of the dawn refuses
my brain sounds like what the 1950's imagined a ufo sounds like
naked i stand exhaling spiders
met a motherfucker from slabtown who told me a story about god
a chest full of arrows and still we labor on
i wrote your name above my heart with the fucking brain fluid leaking outta my ear
god herself pulsing out of my skull in neon 3/4ths time
"we passed normal about six fucking exits ago, sweetheart"
unstable orbits and the women who love them
"babygirl, my life ain't worth running for"
when she comes for you (and she will) you should already know if you're going to fight
arms up weaponless before her
held tight to the bosom of the hive
death's black bunny points the way
another sneaky bastard slipping around the twelve tippy toeing until dawn
all my quarks are fucked up
"rusted shopping carts, dead trees and me"
"these are cold tile thoughts, baby"
eye to eye to eye with the dead
she; the demon perched above
a wishing well that only grants diabolical wishes
i (state your name) do hereby swear to end up in the circle of traitors being chewed upon by the great satan
how many millions of earths will fit in that obligation
deft in the desert with old gods and ghosts
"get yourself a new life, fucker with a brand new sunbeam"
she was a dancer a hunter in the light
no safety no succor the dreamer no longer dreams
oh to see these painful days
midnight's abrupt tonal shift
"named the fucking sneeze guard ""jerry"""
unzip your face show me your stars
the king whose light shines from high atop trash mountain
teleport my guts three feet to the right
"this little piggy sees you, mama"
go west and meet your end
the god of piss and blood
together to find the turtle's lost shell
on this planet we found all cracked in twain
"do your hair, baby  (god's abandoned us and we on our own)"

coffee with old turks
vomiting up the monsters
here we sit simple and alone androids with telepathy
gravity holds me down but that ain't my fucking plan not for long
my seams are coming apart  my stitches are starting to split i can't contain the holy fire
chained to a planet without dragons
i touched the poison limb
58 o'clock nothing's well
devoured from the inside down
"slip through on the glide, baby"
"please, the emptiness of the time"
get god that yon godly fuck to tickle the prostate
amplified by the mind's buzzing bees
joints and sinew replaced by drugs and thoughts of you
bullets in the green fields and she knew she just fucking knew
"the extras are unknowable, baby"
out here in the empty with the crows and the ghost of the rat king's mocking laughter
the mind; the fucking storm cloud
prepare yourself for she is the seed
"i heard the voices again upon waking, mother shush little one she said tis naught but eye floaters plotting revolution"
tippy toeing up on midnight shadow mice and chocolate snacks
spits a bloody tooth at your feet asks for a kiss

three quarters of an hour passed midnight is for robbing banks and chocolate cake
afraid of waking up at sea
you can take your chance or stay here and be the queen of the trash planet
make a wish as a reagan era spy satellite fails to maintain orbit and plummets burning to earth
god doesn't give a fuck if she said to wait pull apart my ribcage before i detonate
knife the taxman
from the bottom of the impact crater where i was born
"faster than your wizard's curse, baby"
we'll disappear two fingers in the air let'em watch some motherfuckers evaporate
listen up man: all sonnets are about fucking
high powered drugs and suddenly the mechanical man feels
she swallowed the sun so i could rest a few moments more
dummies with dull knives
"it's the crooked arrow of time for you and me, baby"
BUT HOW MANY FUCKING EARTHS WOULD FIT INSIDE IT
high and dreaming  or maybe alone and screaming
here comes the crumble man bathed in bones
death on a suburban sidewalk
"the guitar riff after wife and kids, household pets will drag you back from the void"
"forgiveness, mama"
may your flesh grow over your teeth
fuckers act like they make the sun shine
there's no honor in her cruelty
his whirling churning twisting turning lonely yearning mechanical heart
here in the never the never ever
tea kettles at midnight stealing your shit
yeah suck my dick ghost ship
a thousand miles of darkness
two star maintenance
oh the things i used to know
here is the lover destroyed
"non, je suis"
sexy snack girl she shoots while we fly
"you got nothing but trouble, starship girl"
she fell in love operation apocalypse
she was sweet she was kind she was war
refuse to be cute
at dawn dueling ribcages
impact! shovel meets skull
i would command the seas and the trees the angels the bees
maybe the emptiness is for dancing
"blind i witness, motherfucker"
the widows are under the bed chanting their rhymes
flash a little steel
ask god to explain herself i fucking dare you
stomped the fish that crawled from the sea me me me
crooked as fuck and looking for a prophet and a partner
existence on the ass end
the cage of the real you
my whole fucking brain is red dye 40
out and about with the vampires
we don't die here in the sun
woke up swallowed my skeleton got out of bed
questionable man very questionable
now that's just plain reckless
all my fucking chernobyl babies
"i don't want my driverless car to look like a ""driverless car"" i mean like throw a motherfucker some whimsy a driverless dolphin or a driverless brontosaurus maybe"
"hiding in a hollowed out book that doesn't even exist, mama"
but fuck you want for everything
"in order to grant the boon he requested she would need his true name, a sharp knife and the little piggy who got none"
i am the cup i am the torch
daddy was a derby car  mama an engorged heart
an ode to a song about stabbing the motherfucker with stars in his eyes
aw baby let's end this shit six days from forever
pinned for eternity under this stone slab
"ah yes, protracted suffering horatio i knew her well"
after the apocalypse fucking ends everything feel free to take the virtual reality tour of the palace i built out of the space shuttle
how long these chains we drag behind
my mind is all filled up with the idea i could pry open your jaw climb inside and inhabit your skin
watch her shift her shape glory glory glory
"i emerged from that cocoon already dead  that's right pre-life, baby"
obviously my perfect heart is no match for her indifference
traveled through the center of the planet only to emerge fresh as fuck on the other side
the possibilities of dawn are tearing me apart
looking for a fight but this goddamn moon won't oblige
be warm be dead be gone
"left that son of a bitch in a crater with a bag of snakes, mama"
because like a dumb motherfucker i took your hand before you jumped
"tears, flowers and pain here on death's lonely isle"
enough to make a woman burn
my thoughts are round and go where they please
the birds man the fucking birds
i hate everybody (and i need to stop)
"the seas of love are cruel, baby"
floating meaningless nameless painless
tastes like metal in the microwave
rumi and operation shitty thunder
the city the desert erased
"pre-nuclear age, motherfucker"
all of the lies none of the truth
all the wonders of the new world
because nothing matters says the steel trap to an indifferent universe
if you wish to know you must suffer the gypsy's touch
because i can't let you fuckers meet death
the sun like a hammer blow
when the razor meets the infinite meets her mouth
run (god damn it)
the heart... she burns
we'll leave this life behind and follow the herds where they lead
"me, an atomic testing site and you"
a neon pulsing pussy powers the pink pyramids of precious priscilla
the tippy toe man has judged and found the universe wanting
blood under the leaves
"struggling with the things already known, baby"
no rights  endless nights knife fights weirdly glowing toxic superfund sites
is it love or sparks and faulty wiring
ok kids... albino vultures bloody pink feathers albino vultures bloody pink feathers
a shark is made out of cartilage like an ear and a mother's love
dreams of manhattan dreams of a project
at war with the lizards
crashing captain kyle's crap comet
lost and leaving strange clues
93 million miles of bullshit away
"put em up, man  your weapon less hand"
holding hands with flowers and malcontents
sometimes i forget beauty
take my hand mama this time we'll push the eject button together
today we'll be shedding the needles
hugs in pain
fuck you written on a slip of paper in a small drawstring bag in a safe in a small house in a small town in a little country on a small out of the way planet in a distant galaxy
when god herself unsheaths her fiery sword and cuts this fucker in twain
let the hunters come
love and horror unmitigated motherfucker
blunt force trauma comma big mama
the anchor of the tetragrammaton
here on trash island pull a knife on the sun tell him to fuck off try it  it's fun
an essential ending
the man in the ill-fitting suit
heartbroken but i am the dreamer without a dream
"love, sugar and melodrama"
been screaming so long and so loud only god herself hears it now
just another dumb motherfucker chained to a stone in mythical wisconsin
graveyard spooning
slap my face mama the real world is calling
this fucking hollow world in which i abide
rain holds oblivion's knife to your throat
she set the dogs to drag me from bed
a small planet built for fuck you (my guts are on fire)
she has a knife i have a propensity to ignore her more violent tendencies
love the things the drugs don't cure
find all my secrets in a mouth full of blood
the tomb of the inverted pyramid
gonna spend the day in the sun watching the almighty snort pink fucking chemtrails
sometimes you gotta take that stupid heart out and give it a kiss
took my fucking funeral eyes for a walk
because i know her she'll get bored and murder the sky
opened my mouth and a black cloud fell out
"i got all the fucking quaker oats in the world, kid"
"scorched earth sex appeal, mama"
prepare the dreamer for the dream
here in this fantasy version of rhode island where the gravity is too strong and it's fucking crushing you and everyone you know
infamous in fifteen
"the temple of knives in psychedelic japan, baby"
the ghost of the rat king versus the chubby fun puddle's strap-on sunshine
"in the desert, flyboy... where you can give the drugs any name you want"
i am the grey taint to her strawberry skies
as useless as a map of a place i've never been
the one-armed hooker that sits on god's blasphemous left side
digging two holes for the brother of man
"lost, gracious and unafraid"
me and my clone each on an atoll each all alone
my dick and balls is the tippy toe man gonna crinkle his way into my kitchen tonight
knives and pennies my pockets are empty
offended by fire and the path the future takes
i come from the mud no need to be dry
stand on my grave mama i don't wanna reach my full potential
"no fucking savior for you, baby"
hypnotist: when i snap my fingers you will reveal your deepest desire me: a soft slutty jane goodall  (crowd goes fucking nuts)
the royal order of the goddamn chattering skull
this savage sun's irresistible pull
levitation via sunbeam
all the fetishes held in a circle of salt
exhausted and terrified
no more time for questions
"she, the mother of pigs, a goddess with no name"
passed whole through the membrane
while you were resting... atomic testing
take my hand mama we're gonna assassinate old father time
"love, rust and the ghost of kali"
the birds know where the devil's at
fuck you fuck you and fuck you my starship my cathedral
she brings her own prison her own chains
maybe a quarter maybe a dime
the lover the coroner and me
boy in decline
lovely princess tater tots what shall we do today
lots of answers no questions
"dying lazily, baby"
one fucking fuzzy sunday
her: i love you  you: intense high-pitched alien screeching
brought the doom unto this house
making mommy morbid
fuck the light and everything it shines upon
holding closed the monster door
meteors falling
be wary the unfamiliar march
"baby, you make my bones ache"
she's more than she seems shanghai dreams and neverending screams
dying under some foriegn sun
it's not skill it's a lifetime of repetition
*whispering* human continuity error
it's a living burial girl
dying before nine
"not enough in the whole blessed fucking world, mama"
let's never speak of the sun let's close our eyes tight against it for a while longer
am i dead yet morning sweat
voodoo pink hearse
here's what i see: the end times
ooooohhhh bona fide crazy person
under the skin; needles
under the pyramid (endless chanting)
death and the casual applause of ingrates
the force of her regard would destroy you
it's an i love you nosebleed
"amazonian fucking space goddess repelling all borders, baby"
disjointed gravity and it's effects on the human mind
the very clever raven meets the big dumb dog: a modern fucking love story
she asked me to be warm so i created the seasons
got a motherfucker lining up the convergence
she's crumbling
scenes from imaginary jersey
what's left of this hollow world
the monsters are coming  me versus the world
stand alone no reserves
march seventh at seven seventy- eight pm
pain is just a bunch of nerves being dicks to your brain
the gypsy the mirror the shard the curse
this is not what it might seem awoke from the dream  an 80's scream queen
say a prayer for the disaster days the you got nothing days
the screaming the ghost of the rat king requires before he lets you sleep
crushed into bed
maybe i'll crawl under the floorboards fall asleep
all the simple ways to die under the sun
"i'm nothing but promises, mama"
dulling the spears of the king following the trail of the boar god
here in the new kansas where nothing goes right
how many free men to climb the mast and join the captain
"I AM THE KALEIDOSCOPE, BABY  THE FUCKING TECHNICOLOR DREAM"
tits out in the garden party of god's life
i got the dope eyes
lucky for you dumb bastards her nature is forgiveness
concentrating on growing my hands to world crushing size
precision my new favorite thing
the tired dreams of the dispossessed and dismal
self digestion and the goddamn idiot mind
behold the sleepwalker
apocalypse mine
a fat ass and graveyard dirt
somedays i sparkle
slap your face with melted cheese
neon jenny death machine
fucking deep pressure horizon
"i got nothing but unanswered prayers, baby"
by the extra bones of the thin-fingered man
dimensional bleed through
from one distant motherfucker to another
"i got questions but no answers, mama"
a place in the sun for the go-go birds to dance
a mind in decline fanciful trips in imaginary rocketships
no cookies for defeated ass suckers
chase the space foxxxxxxxxx
got that shallow grave shit got that your ribcage all entwined with mine shit
i have no truth to be honest
beware cryo-sleep the ghost of the rat king will play with your dreams
the tender lies she tells
a lighthouse but it screams
in my dreams she wore the buffalo head  in my dreams she rode the fire
little lost labyrinth boy
"bones, gristle and fat  baby, whata ya know bout that"
here i am alone this idiot child of god
"no, life is not fair for the swift brown hare"
this fucking day leads to the other side of the next
some mischief some mild sunday evening mischief
"it may be the depression speaking but ""couch"""
fingerblasting fate's fanciful fortunes
escape plan: delta armadillo
turn your eye naked to me
backwards in the time sludge
"belief in nothing or nothing but belief, motherfucker"
she trusts me with her treasures her heart and her gold
a bullet engraved with unrealistic destinies
a thousand thousand thousand things
dimensional phase shift or no body no crime
for i am a fool
unprotected in open space the saliva on you tongue begins to boil
another one and another one run with the other one
awoke in equal measure majestic and mundane
purple tides pulled sideways
never thought to make it to 100 so i drew a picture of my bones
this is my sword the fucking savage hope
love on the rim of my impact crater
system breakdown (tear in my ballgown)
call that kitty chopper she owns the moon
he is the stealer of dreams exactly what he seems
I SHALL BE INSUFFERABLE BY NOON
chapter 12: unreality
under the bed dreaming of portals
we have passed through the center of the serpent
oversight is when the chubby fun puddle sees the crystal
high as fuck couch fusing mutant tippy toeing into midnight
this little piggy has some thoughts about the divine
fucking books of sand
"self devouring prophecies, baby"
"the chains, galaxy spanning, holding one planet to another"
the dare or god herself's sweet blackhole pussy
i am always near death for death is always near me
sexy like the malfunctioning door on an escape pod
time is the enemy the adversary
the dials don't turn not for me maybe for you
"find my voice and erase my mind, mama"
swallow hard the forest spirit
all soft and warm  all sin and tragedy
atomic bomb testing 1961 moon chalet red wire green wire
"t minus armageddon, baby"
bolts and feathers and bits of wire
penis meanis
knit me a heart all stitches and forgiveness
"satellites for circling, baby"
fuck off i brought my love down up from the sewer
the fat tittied fertility goddess came to me once again in a dream angry she never got a name
i love you the upgrades the features the birth the creatures
"tie our intestines tight together, toots"
king me baby trash monster
we're fucked self destruct
the universe strider the world fucker
this lie is a myth this myth is a life
half body chill
"it's tippy toe season, mama"
desperately delightfully stupid
your broken bottle versus my rusty sword
maybe if they closed all the roads heading west your heart would still be yours
the cosmos makes short work of the stupid
"let's fuck in the living rain, baby"
to think different to accept the seismic shift to take out your mind and put that motherfucker back in upside down
ask yourself how many men can these hands hold
a slash of blood across the chest for the robots they always know
"fucking rad, spaceman"
in ten we die
here in a zoo in space chimpanzee bites my fucking face
from the riverbed the mechanical man's last thumbs up
"fucking high test mutant love, baby"
a warped hazy shadow like i somehow turned into one of those weird ass fucked up see through fish
big mama murder mouth has something to say
will you support me when my thoughts are slow
blood red love and the dead static in my fucking head
psst... the thief of clubs plots with the poison queen... pass it on
hand grenade wood floor
listen you motherfucker take that goddamn finger away from the self destruct
"honey, we're gonna be a mess"
got that boom that full body resonance
filthy mouth juice
nameless planet of blue sand
here's to the wind and the whistle and the hopeful hookers waiting
touch my heating pad and i will stab a fucking sword into the heart of your star
i took the severed toe to the stars
take me home and prove i'm alive
fuck you unlucky star
i can see where time fails us
i have given my pain a secret name
all the planets we shall be avoiding today
"dim the lights, darling i'm dying"
an old pain's new masquerade
out by the roots of the tree where the statue of the fat tittied fertility goddess lives
open the fucking portal
roses are red violets are blue ghosts and madmen  make up the ship's crew
what the fucking sea knows depth pressure darkness
bending the light towards greatness
"it's the rot, mama"
awoke without skin in terrible pain
to love me is to love stale cake like real stale open box ass cake
walking while on fucking fire
strange circular bends of the arm
i awoke to find the spirits had come
a quiet afternoon filled with maniacs
goddamn bedlam in the backseat
"sometimes it hurts and sometimes that's just fucking it, you know"
i am a chubby fun puddle
check your disconnect
come back you fucking mutant  I LOVE YOU
"it's a fighting retreat, baby"
"in the morning a chest full of crows, curses and doom"
robot parts salvaged hearts
sleeping with a sneer
baby it's ruthless
all the rituals have failed
it's not a cry for help it's a decaying orbit
"motherfuckin' space tiger stalkin' the stars, baby"
my rock and roll baby pulling planes from the sky
there's a bullet hole in my forehead made to fit your little eye
"put a fucking leash on that cloud, baby"
swallowing explosions just for fun
such a whimsical title for the monster that makes the fluorescents flicker
long distance drive or put a name to your sadness
it's a boom you're a corpse surprise
here we go with these hangman days
"it's all pussycat theater, baby"
fuck you and your fast blood
quick glitch when you watch the dark
"in the impact crater, little manipulator"
400 million years beyond the red king's crown
the future finds you lost
dance with me you beautiful reckless bastard
the dead branch of god herself's regard
all her heart's rusted machinery
immediately shoots squid ink out of my bellybutton
mama's poison kisses
one hooker two hooker three hooker whore
i must sleep young elizabeth taylor i'm so tired
so cute pinhole in the spacesuit
huffing paint with this broke wing angel bitch
the trashy pyramid man
whispered gypsy curse 2020
here in the dope shit nebula
stick a knife in the table and fucking dare her
her breath on my stainless steel faceplate
WWAD What Would the Androids Do
"savage hearts, baby... savage hearts"
three to the tenth power that's your fucking inner eye
super hyper space moth calico style
"i can't move the earth, mama"
i mostly rage for things that are lost
so hungry my guts are trying to grow a hand
"even my fucking thoughts are prehensile, baby"
be warned: if you let him past your firewall the ghost of the rat king will use all your computational power to try and find love
she my babies the queen of hostile intent
in the center of the brain a big ass fucking cosmic drain
she is the quiet the path through the mountain
oh but i do and i do and i do
i just thought about tentacles for one whole microwave minute
on this planet where the lower half of man are buffalo
i don't eat or sleep or think or breathe
in the endless expanse alienating every sad bastard i meet
"failed probability maths baby, we all gonna die"
"crack the bones, ma"
the engine hum with that interstellar pussy i come from
we had joy we had fun i'ma fucking lizard in the sun
she caught my heart out on the open plain beating like a motherfucker
the infinite delights of my small mind
the capital d death of stars has some questions for our boy johnny six-guns
wrap your cold hands around my cold cold heart
i just wanna eat all the garbage and cry
today you are an inconvenient goddess
wagered a leg in a race against the deer god
"waitresses, mystics and rocketships"
i have forgotten the trees because the trees they have forgotten me
a mind grown wild in riot
talent none wars that ain't won
you get the lead role in the captain's disaster theater
"welcome to the 701 club, motherfucker  worship the cable"
"not enough amperage to keep the head alive, baby"
to breach her golden shell
this what if is long as fuck
got motherfuckers out here translucent
the scales of the snake that devours the world
the ship bound androids bored by legitimate people
sing a song on the fields dying
life is hard  birthday card bones in the backyard
desperation's forked tongue
i'd kiss her but my mouth is filled with misery
inside and down walking on the lake under a ceiling of ice
dented tin crown babies
I AM AGING... A TERRIBLE BEAUTY
"hide it in the vents, ma"
she's my blue-eyed escape velocity
the hideous nature of your resolve
fucking haunted hilton
the meaningless confessions of a lost starship captain
"there are no stars tonight, baby"
when the groove has other ideas
may all your fucks be holy
"she dulled her sword for you, motherfucker"
DEATH CULT 5000 MOTHERFUCKER
i clap a third time the sun dies
stories where heroes don't make it
just a big ol' messy fucking stone tied around your neck
relax all your finger bones
here a more beautiful place
atom bombs over olympus
that son of a bitch out there in the darkness
in the night when her jaw was all concrete angles
hooker planet
i am the saboteur or so i've been told
"been everywhere, baby meth in kansas heroin in berlin  huffing paint in the fucking stars"
i sit and i sat  worrying about this and that
time's forgotten whore
i failed the test of her mechanical eyes
"apocrypha, warnings and portents"
"there are faster ways to the bottom, motherfucker"
ah baby i'm sorry but time is fluid
the future ex mrs ghost of the rat king materialized in my cabin voicing a terrible prediction
miss sketchy dalliance
leeches in the spacesuit toot toot toot
"whispers, small dreams and little spoons"
sleek: copper and chrome
"IT'S A GIANT FUCKING SPACE MONSTER VALENTINE, MAMA"
"poisoned love on the tracks, baby"
she fell in love the first time on roller skates
god herself's drunk whore bang
the six-headed hydra of love
woke up looking like a sad failed love affair
I AM THE GARBAGE KING OF MIDNIGHT
tigers know how to be sorry
here in the nothing lost amongst the z axis
"turn off the gravity, baby let's dance"
we pay our way with drugs and salt
external pressures and shadow mice fucking with my mind
here in the mist here in the pink parade
"she stole my hope, baby"
there's a restaurant in my pocket that only serves the lonely
thumbnails of when you used to be great
apropos jones high octane chase across fucking galaxies across lifetimes
panic in the skies
thinking about junky corporate pyramids in america
love and other impossibly immense interdimensional distances
"we all suffer the fate of the rat king, he learned"
haul my corpse to ibiza and feed it drugs
"cosmically inconsequential, baby"
fucking love sniper

"the morning brings it's own terrors, mama"
the universal sign for all my bones are loose under my skin
she's the keeper of secrets she guards the road
"she's all meteor tails and screaming event horizons tonight, baby"
open up my belly and climb right in we'll share the same skin
moses on the halfpipe
she'll chew the sun just for you
devour the fucking divine
how does it feel going through life so hard to the touch
nobody dies till i find my voice
how small do you have to shrink before the air becomes too big to breathe
new realities for the tip tip tippy toe man
fucking quarks
it was the year of the rabbit when the gypsy refused to give me the code to the airlock that would eventually save my life
steep hill iron lung what fun
eight thousand eight hundred eighteen the stupid and the divine
a small paisley desert to carry and call my own
this is the smell of the beast
this fucking river is a weapon
skirting this black hole absence of love
the lurching
the sun is not the time for the ghost of the rat king the sun is the time for the mechanical man all titanium spine and loose teeth
five hour blinks
the capital d death of love
i've been concentrating all the powers of my mind on making the sun explode
your ribcage locked with mine
god herself pussy pulsing like a strobe light
mighty mary loose teeth pressed like a loose leaf fights the monsters underneath
this fucker is all periwinkle desert
the sucking heart of the galaxy we share
oh to fight the mechanical man
the bass line of my fucked up technicolor nights
terrible things in her name
"ephemeral crows out here in the nether, baby"
time got that slip and slide riding backwards motherfucker
dirty ass massive meteor babies
winter rain and all the ghosts my beta brain can conjure
what cruel joke this earthly prison
the last man breathing still dreams about the knife the sun the girl
nonlethal variations
been dead a hundred days gone now
here in my imaginary florida it's all cold feet and the ghost of the rat king
with two quick strokes the gypsy opened my arm and carved a secret upon my bones
it's a problem of stones  it's a problem of snakes
"i gave one eye to the stars, baby"
if the monsters take your hand you can do whatever the fuck you want
in the hall of the harpies where heroes hang
love in the time of predatory lenders
this is an unforgiveness loop
miss galactic trash planet 3059
today you will lose at ritualistic combat and the box will go in the sea
the human animal in space
who gonna creep for that midnight pudding
a ribcage tangled for two
swallowing the silver picture frame hoping you feel the same
under the ghosts of these tired stars
she was a fat tittied fertility goddess shaped like a forty five
you have to stop - the fuck i do says the drunken messiah of the glen
"the question is: how fast baby, how fast can we run"
ion trails and one-armed hookers named frank
motherfucker is just a cold heart behind dirty glass
the buffalo-headed lady who lives at the edge of your conciousness will guard you from ghosts amen
she was gravity's mistress but only when she was bored
all hail the crushing emptiness
deer god in the hallway
old tree bones to hold my guts in
"taxes on my iron lung, ma"

another day to assemble your face and relearn it's mechanics
all the horsey moves L shaped thoughts
"arm wrestling the deer god in the spacial rift, baby"
super strong stimulants to open the galaxy wide
my ears are hollow today
i named the nebula medusa
"take heart, ghost of the rat king"
to bring her the desert or the sea
"aboard the starship hms britney spears we all share the same fanciful fate, motherfucker"
the bones don't change their prediction: we go west
woke up with crows in my chest
cold war decompression pills versus the harsh vacuum of space
got those all quarks no quasar blues
saturday and the clones of birds
half cut the short way
i asked god herself but she didn't have an answer so how am i supposed to decide when quantum fucking entanglement exists
the edge of the viral blade
the math the gypsy used to foretell our future seemed at first to be flawed but it wasn't and we were fucked
fuck these words especially
the king on his throne all blood piss gristle and bone
we began to falter more and more so in desperation we allowed the poisoner to run the engines
we have no time says apropos jones who goes it alone
"look ma, stardust"
the prince meets the monsters and finds himself a man
"run, sweetie"
wholly unlike running for your life
the empress with horns
a dashboard shiny chrome skull
the AI moans... computational ecstasy
the dreams of crystals and wires on the planet of autonomous men
"every iteration worse and worse, mama"
"given control to the voices, ghosts and madmen apropos jones and johnny six-guns  the chickenbone man the ghost of the rat king  the fat titty fertility goddess the AI god herself  the starship hms britney spears"
just after he voiced his dire warning the chickenbone man exploded into a field of purple fractals
the ship began to boast of the serendipitous
you try luring the minotaur out into the open desert
glorious goddamn space eggs dropped by god herself all across the cosmos
"baby, athena knows what the fuck's up"
endless endless endless fucking space
she was the greatest pilot i ever knew she had seven and a half fingers and didn't believe in fate
"angels and demons and serious things with wings  ain't that right, ferdinand"
when the sleepwalker promises yellow
my tongue still hasn't grown accustomed to the size of it's new cage
there are higher beings out there all fucking space manta rays and shit... beware
because it should sound pretty
persimmons or delirium tremens
"the power and the current, baby"
we shared pills and a distrust of the ghost of the rat king and a cryo pod built for two
in space the dreamers still dream but the ghosts only exist as long as you do
hands my baby the sun just because she's cold
the slim line of god herself's thoughts
out here on the edge where the blessed are the forgotten
byzantine and the open air drug markets of andromeda
only the most ancient of star charts show the way
you knew as soon as she said i love you that they could build a prison that would hold you
now imagine we didn't pay the price for this
the nemesis promise
share or i'll let the hunters have you
ah little probability wave i'm sorry but if i don't quantify you then you don't exist which is fine by me because i don't need you fucking with my shit right now
the hyper sleep drugs are beginning to wear off the madmen have barred their doors while the undead shuffle aimlessly down the ship's corridors
shadow mice building up in the corners of my eyes
"listen mama, everything is rusty and the key might not fit"
"two knives in zero gravity, baby my blood stays on the inside"
on a ship full of filthy libertines
god herself all spread at the edge of everything pulsing with disco day-glo colors

we'd be so bored with forever
the knife the eye the keyhole
"stranded in the emptiness, mama"
turn! you coward
the very smallest of talk
since i would not be the big spoon i now have to figure out how to get the angry ghost of the rat king out of my spacesuit
she the queen of this spiral arm
a lifetime of another motherfucker's regrets
a roadside cross to mark the spot i loaded the ghosts and madmen into my baby the starship hms britney spears and we went to find god herself
just a whore unmoored that's me
unusual compounds stacking up in my mind
according to the gospel of fuck you- all old punks go to heaven

SUPER NEON SPACE EAGLE
a warm blanket in the temple of god herself
"one shy of infinite, motherfucker that is what we are"
innocent until the sword is drawn
25th century space pope rhianna on the dashboard
rebuilt mean
from his seemingly empty chair the ghost of the rat king charts a course and complains
