How close we are
And what did you see?
The secret’s safe
And always on my mind
I know the consequences in my conscience
This will be the best night of our lives
When we survive!
Alright, alright!
Let’s make it the best night of our lives!
So now we party like animals
WE PARTY TIL THE MORNING SUNLIGHT
And we know everything is fine
You see, we’re all still alive

We only get one chance
So let’s try to survive!
Yeah, we only get one chance
So let’s keep it alive!

How close we are
And what did you see?
Your secret’s safe, and
Abandon my mind
We know the consequences in my conscience
This will be the best night of our lives
When we survive!
We’re alright, we’re alright!

You’ll always be by my side
So now we party like animals
And party your whole fuckin’ life
We only get one chance, so…
