Lies that we've inherited generation to generation
That one can do anything, that all human life is gilded in gold

Time doesn't care for your feelings
Time doesn't know how to hate
Time draws the conclusion
And the path to your fate

No future for those that destroy
No rainbow for those that conserve
Life is a sentence, time naturally burns
Hell on earth that our species deserves

Breed before the fires start
Bleed out into the dark
This need for validation
This greedy life's ambition
An element of species narcissism
A grandiose idea of self-worth
In a vessel of organic matter
In a league with its own feces

We know that we're wrong
We know what we've done
Yet we still carry on

The curtain has closed
As only time knows
'Cause that's how it goes
Bed of fire or decompose

We know that we're wrong
We know what we've done
Yet we still carry on

The curtain has burned
No lessons are learned
Our ashes in the urn
This meeting is adjourned

O into nothing
"What are you now that I once was?
What I am now, you will soon be"
