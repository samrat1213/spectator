An agreed upon hallucination
By the bulk of the populace
A dimensional irregularity
A reflection of ones self

Divine authority, as above so below
Misery setting in, seepage of phlegm and ooze
Divine authority, as above so below
Misery setting in, seepage of phlegm and ooze

Stench of negligence, the stench of selfishness
The stench of a species failed now fills the air around me
Stench of negligence, the stench of selfishness
The stench of a species failed now fills the air around me

Appearing whimsical and harmless
Preparation of the disembodied mind will now commence
Appearing whimsical and harmless
Preparation of the disembodied mind will now commence

An agreed upon hallucination
By the bulk of the populace
A dimensional irregularity
A reflection of ones self

Divine authority, as above so below
Misery setting in, seepage of phlegm and ooze
Divine authority, as above so below
Misery setting in, seepage of phlegm and ooze

Stench of negligence, the stench of selfishness
The stench of a species failed now fills the air around me
Stench of negligence, the stench of selfishness
The stench of a species failed now fills the air around me

Open up the veins to drain, to bleed, to spread the fucking strain
To recognize humanities disdain
Everyone is slain, the pain to see is just so inhumane
A joy I can barely fucking contain
Barely fucking contain
Fuck
