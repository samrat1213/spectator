Born only of despair
Hope crumbles under the horrors we bear
Death into life, the flask of our idols
Spills poisonous smite upon their arrival

A river of ice meets a mountain of fire
All hope torn asunder by human desire

Under a serpent's tongue
The fruit of life
Heaven and hell
Cast from the flame and the flies

Back to the soil
Our ties to the planet
Severed by knife
Severed by knife

We'll cry of the cancer
And we'll fail for the cure
Let the sorrow consume us
The burden's impure

We'll cry of the cancer
And we'll fail for the cure
Let the sorrow consume us
The burden's impure

Sick from the filth
Spew forth black blood
Unchain the machines
That hold off the flood

I see no hope
I don't feel the fear
We don't have to stay here
We don't have to stay here

A river of ice meets a mountain of fire
All hope torn asunder by human desire

Emptiness
Godless gluttons
Emptiness
I give you
Emptiness
Godless gluttons
Emptiness

We'll cry of the cancer
And we'll fail for the cure
Let the sorrow consume us
The burden's impure

We'll cry of the cancer
And we'll fail for the cure
Let the sorrow consume us
The burden's impure

Flesh to the dirt
Necks to the stone
Scorching the soul
Hollowing bones

Flesh to the dirt
Necks to the stone
Scorching the soul
Hollowing bones

Don't bring me back from the dead
Don't bring me back from the dead
