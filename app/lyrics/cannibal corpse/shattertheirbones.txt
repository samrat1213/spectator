Putrid foul zombie make their ghastly approach
A dreadful horrid feeling sets in.
Scrambling for weapons an attempt to defend
Against a gruesome horde of undead.
Shower them with fire make them burn in the flames
Some how they continue to march
Ravenous savages they'll tear you apart
They'll eat your fucking guts and your brains.
How do you kill what is not alive?
Break them down to stop their descent
Smash the bastards into the ground
And when they're down shatter their bones

Shatter their bones
