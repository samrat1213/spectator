[Verse 1]
Let's start a fire, biggest one you've ever seen
You bring the matches, I'll bring the gasoline
Ignite it, delight it, the flames grow higher
Burn the world upon a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Raze!
Light this motherfucker like a Roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
Raze! Let's not worry about consequence
If it's standing, we'll bring it down

[Verse 2]
Destroy it all, show no inhibition
Revel and rejoice in unbridled demolition
Smash it, fuck it, nothing will remain
Detect it and wreck it but never take the blame

[Chorus]
Raze!
Light this motherfucker like a Roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
Raze! Let's not worry about consequence
If it's standing, we'll bring it down
[Post-Chorus]
We have ignition

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Shake the Earth from its very foundation
Lay waste to the world without hesitation
Break it, take it, you don't need any reason
Fuck it, destruct it, it's demolition season

[Chorus]
Raze!
Light this motherfucker like a Roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
Raze! Let's not worry about consequence
If it's standing, we'll bring it down

Raze!
Light this motherfucker like a Roman candle
Burn this bitch straight to the ground
Raze! Let's not worry about consequence
If it's standing, we'll bring it downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
