The creation of this object that I have in my hand
And the gift that we've been given to induce such violent pain
Step up off of your knees
This is communication through frequencies
Vibration attacking all your body's sensations
It's the gift that we've been given

Hello, hello can you hear me still?
This is not the church, get up off your knees
I do not preach

And you have no time to bleed as you fall to your knees
It's the gift that we've been given
Hello, can you hear me still?

And this is not the church, and I do not preach
And I have no time to bleed
The creation of this object that I have in my hand
And the gift that we've been given to induce such violent pain

Step up off your knees
This is communication through frequencies
Vibration attacking all your body's sensations
It's the gift that we've been given

No time to bleed
As you fall to your knees
