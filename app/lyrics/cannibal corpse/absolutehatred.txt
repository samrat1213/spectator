Never leave your nest unguarded
Next of kin the first to go
Absolute hatred cast upon the family
Payback for the hated one

I am the judge, jury, executioner
And pallbearer all in one
Process of elimination
Affirmative action has just begun
Expectorate upon your soul
Malicious devilry is unleashed ten fold
You cannot hide

Witness of my stopping power
Reaction time is not enough
Psychological torment tearing at you sanity
it has to be, it must be done

Hatred flows, uncontained, feel my wrath
Through the death of your entire tribe

Hatred flows, uncontained
I must archieve my revenge through hatred

<i>[Lead - Owen]</i>
<i>[Lead - Barrett]</i>

I've regained my pride
Victory's mine
You cannot hide
The footsteps you hear are gonna be mine
