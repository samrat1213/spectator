Temptation to kill again
The sensation comes over me
An addiction to murdering
I can't stop killing

You tried to stop me
Dead, before you started
Put me away
Before I put another
In the grave

Pulverized
Knocked down it came up behind me
In the dark
Overwhelmed, I feel life slip from me
This isn't happening, pulverized
I won't sustain these injuries
Pick up the pieces of me

Temptation to kill again
The sensation comes over me
An addiction to murdering
I can't stop killing

You tried to stop me
Dead, before you started
Put me away
Before I put another
In the grave

Pulverized
Knocked down it came up behind me
In the dark
Overwhelmed, I feel life slip from me
This isn't happening, pulverized
I won't sustain these injuries
Pick up the pieces of me

Temptation to kill again
The sensation comes over me
An addiction to murdering
I can't stop killing

You tried to stop me
Dead, before you started
Put me away
Before I put another
In the grave

Pulverized
Knocked down it came up behind me
In the dark
Overwhelmed, I feel life slip from me
This isn't happening, pulverized
I won't sustain these injuries
Pick up the pieces of me

An addiction to murdering
I can't stop
