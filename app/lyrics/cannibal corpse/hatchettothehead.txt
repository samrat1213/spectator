Skull fragments are flying through the air
Brains and blood scattered just about everywhere you look
Swing of the hatchet gives permanent damage,
Head fractured, gaping hole
To incise the cranium

Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore

Hatchet to the head

Rekindled gore obsess rend the weak
Mutilate then murder consciously
Death brought to the enemies of the past
A life of beheading I must have
Pure revenge is burning inside me

Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore

Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head

Forced from deep inside to hunt you
Bludgeoned torn apart veins erupted
Forever headless rotting corpse
Recognition you are now beyond

Wretched, onslaught, slaughter

Faceless flesh remains from the victims
Hacked with brutal force until slain
Consumed with anger, lunacy
Relentless killing dependency

<i>[Solo: Pat]</i>

Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore

Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head

Chop it off!
