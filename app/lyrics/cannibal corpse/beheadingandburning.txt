Descend upon the village on a mission of death
Setting fire to their homes, attacking the men
We hear their women screaming as we hack off their heads
We show no fucking mercy to them, they will be annihilated
Targeting their necks a ruthless slaughter begins
Our axes swing with malice, blood drips from the blades
Utterly defeated, their forges put to rout
Our legions will pursue them until they have been eradicated
Burn
Torch their village
Burn
Reduce their feeble world to ash
Hack
Chop their heads off
Hack
Leave their headless bodies rotting
Massacre
Slay them all
Fire
Consumes their world
Massacre
They will die
Fire consumes their world, fire consumes their world
Their women have been raped
Their children are in chains
Defenses have been broken
Out conquest is complete
Take their leader captive, march hum to the square
His weaknesses exploited now we take his life
Demoralize the captives, their leader died on his knees
His severed head a trophy, his body feeds the pigs
Burn
Torch their village
Burn
Reduce their feeble world to ash
Hack
Chop their heads off
Hack
Leave their headless bodies rotting
Heads are falling
Corpses burn
We are coming
We bring death
