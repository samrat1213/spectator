Come one, come all
to the most pointless show on the earth
an exploration of the depths we can sink to
linked to our inherent lust for torture

Bring out the children there's still time to
teach them the ways of human slime
to ignore the compassion they have inside

Dominion over leaving beings, degradation behind the scenes
Maliciousness within our genes

Unwittingly caged for transport
City to city, unable to move
Separated from contentment
Only for human entertainment

I... I hate you people... you deserve to die... for you are evil

In the delight of suffering, shame finds its bed
Lies down and in its slumber kills common sense

With the price of admission, prepare to teach your children hell...
They'll learn the word "submission" well
Growing up submitting to the ignorant, swollen coffers
Growing up ignoring all the worst that humans have to offer

I... I hate you people... you deserve to die... for you are evil
I... I hate you people... you deserve to die...

In the delight of suffering, shame finds its he'd
Lies down and in its slumber kills common sense
