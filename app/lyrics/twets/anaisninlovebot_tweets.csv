I am so filled with my love of her. And at the same time I feel that I am dying. Our love would be death. The embrace of imaginings
"I who have been sleeping one hundred years, with hallucinations hanging like curtains of spider webs over my bed."
"ALL THAT I KNOW IS CONTAINED IN THIS BOOK WRITTEN WITHOUT WITNESS, AN EDIFICE WITHOUT DIMENSION, A CITY HANGING IN THE SKY"
"This morning I awakened with a profound and desperate desire for you. I have strange dreams. Now you are small and soft and pliable in my arms, now you are powerful and domineering and the leader. At once mothlike and indomitable. June, what are you?"
"I will not rest until I have told of my descent into a sensuality which was as dark, as magnificent, as wild, as my moments of mystic creation have been dazzling, ecstatic, exalted."
"But I lie. I embellish. My words are not deep enough, not savage enough. They disguise, they conceal."
"""The mountain of words has sundered, literature has fallen away."" I meant that real feelings had begun,"
"I saw her breasts when she leaned over me, small but full. I felt her hands over my body, her mouth near mine. One moment my head was near her legs. I could easily have kissed them. I was stirred madly. Immediately I was aware of the frustration of my desire."
We were not in love with each other's writing. But what are we in love with now?
"Writing is not, for us, an art, but breathing. After our first encounter I breathed some notes, accents of recognition, human admissions."
"I am thinking of his capacity to be awed, which means to sense divinity."
"no metallic eyes or eyes of crystal as in other women, but liquid, throwing a mist dew and vapor. no definite smile but a hovering, evanescent, uncapturable smile which set off all pursuits."
Let us dream together!
Beautiful women and handsome men arouse fierce desires in me.
I am constantly reconstructing a pattern of something forever lost and which I cannot forget; I catch the odors of the past on street corners and I am aware of the men who will be born tomorrow.
"Sound within sound, scene within scene, woman within woman—like acid revealing an invisible script."
"He appears to care. He becomes soft, sentimental. Everybody is taken in. He creates an illusion of warmth. But if any of them came with a real need, they would find out."
"At the same time I concede to myself that he knows the technique of kissing better than anyone I've met. His gestures never miss their aim, no kiss ever goes astray. His hands are deft. My curiosity for sensuality is stirred. I have always been tempted by unknown pleasures."
"I liked him just before he talked. I liked his pregnable self, sensitive and porous, just before he talked when he seemed a very soft animal, or a very sensual one,"
"To hurt and to be aware of hurting, and to know its ultimate necessity, that is intolerable to me."
"I have seen romanticism outlast the realistic. I have seen men forget the beautiful women they have possessed, forget the prostitutes, and remember the first woman they idolized, the woman they never could have. The woman who aroused them romantically holds them."
"You are veiled now. Be real! Your words, your writing, the other day. You were real."
"In a different way, I am devoted to both, a part of me goes out to each of them. But I love June madly, unreasoningly. Henry gives me life, June gives me death. I must choose, and I cannot."
"""Do you realize what a live force you are, just to speak of you in the abstract? I feel like a machine that has lost its motor. You represent everything that is vital, live, moving, rising, flying, soaring...."""
I will be home tomorrow night. I am finished with hotel life and solitude at night.
I will love her. I will enrich her. I will immortalize her.
I will cover the walls with words. It will be la chambre des mots.
"what I want is a life in depth, which is hard to find."
My curiosity for sensuality is stirred. I have always been tempted by unknown pleasures.
"we lie still in each other's arms, lulled by our love, by tenderness—sensuality in which the whole being can participate."
"He calls me a romantic. I get angry. ""I'm sick of my own romanticism!"""
"You are the only woman who ever answered the demands of my imagination."" She answers, ""It is a good thing that I am going away. You would soon unmask me. I am powerless before a woman. I do not know how to deal with a woman."""
"Blond hair, pallid face, demoniac peaked eyebrows, a cruel smile with a disarming dimple. Perfidious, infinitely desirable, drawing me to her as towards death."
"I hate men who are afraid of women's strength. Probably Jean loved her strength, her destructive power. For June is destruction."
"He is puzzling to me. He looks raw, easily hurt. I talk warily."
"The hours I have spent in cafés are the only ones I call living, apart from writing."
"If I love you, it must be because we have shared at some time the same imaginings, the same madness, the same stage."
"She poses for me as she leaves. I want to run out and kiss her fantastic beauty, kiss it and say, ""You carry away with you a reflection of me, a part of me. I dreamed you, I wished for your existence. You will always be part of my life."""
"she and I had understood each other, every detail and nuance of each other."
"My mind must not die, because I am a writer. I am the poet who must see."
"But I must kiss her, I must kiss her."
Sentimentality? Romanticism?
"I love her for what she has dared to be, for her hardness, her cruelty, her egoism, her perverseness, her demoniac destructiveness. She would crush me to ashes without hesitation."
"As I sat in front of her I felt that I would do anything mad for her, anything she asked of me. Henry faded. She was color, brilliance, strangeness."
"A startlingly white face, burning eyes. June Mansfield, Henry's wife. As she came towards me from the darkness of my garden into the light of the doorway I saw for the first time the most beautiful woman on earth."
"We have unconsciously created a highly effervescent relationship within the security and peace of marriage. We are widening the circle of our sorrows and pleasures within the circle of our home and our two selves. It is our defense against the intruder, the unknown."
We are both wrathful to the point of madness; we desire death.
"When I had exhausted my pain, we went out in the garden."
"Sensuality is a secret power in my body,"
"Her beauty drowned me. As I sat in front of her I felt that I would do anything mad for her, anything she asked of me."
"no metallic eyes or eyes of crystal as in other women, but liquid, throwing a mist dew and vapor. no definite smile but a hovering, evanescent, uncapturable smile which set off all pursuits."
"The ivory tower of the artist may be the only stronghold left for human values, cultural treasures, man’s cult of beauty."
There is a perfection in everything that cannot be owned.
"There is not one big, cosmic meaning for all, there is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person."
a look of lust and cruelty.
"Things I forgot to tell you:  That I love you, and that when I awake in the morning I use my intelligence to discover more ways of appreciating you."
"You are like me, wishing for a perfect moment, but nothing too long imagined can be perfect in a worldly way. Neither one of us can say just the right thing. We are overwhelmed. Let us be overwhelmed."
"I appear not to care. I create an impression of remoteness, but if anyone has a real need, they discover I love."
"Let us be overwhelmed. It is so lovely, so lovely."
"The burning of your eyes, of your gestures, a bonfire of faith and dissolution. You have the power."
"There is not one big, cosmic meaning for all, there is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person."
"I despise my own hypersensitiveness, which requires so much reassurance. It is certainly abnormal to crave so much to be loved and understood."
"I get deeply tired because everything touches me, I am never indifferent."
Abnormal pleasures kill the taste for normal ones.
"The fever, the hope, the mirage, the suspended desire, unfulfilled, would remain with her all night and the next day, burn undimmed within her and make others say: “How sensual she is!"""
"Eyes full of surprise and wonder, full of reflections like the river. Hungry eyes, avid, naked..."
"I want to hear raucous music, to see faces, to brush against bodies, to drink fiery Benedictine. Beautiful women and handsome men arouse fierce desires in me."
"I want to trespass boundaries,erase all identifications, anything which fixes one permanently into one mould, one place without hope of change."
I am constantly reconstructing a pattern of something forever lost and which I cannot forget; I catch the odors of the past on street corners and I am aware of the men who will be born tomorrow.
"Life is so fluid that one can only hope to capture the living moment, to capture it alive and fresh...without destroying that moment."
"Stories are the only enchantment possible, for when we begin to see our suffering as a story, we are saved."
"I love your silences, they are like mine."
"Thedream wasalways running ahead of me. To catch up,to live for a moment in unisonwith it, that was the miracle."
"You have a vehement silence, one feels it is charged with essences, it is a strangely alive silence, like a trap open over a well, from which one can hear the secret murmur of the earth itself."
"I am attracted by unconventionality. I don’t really want to become normal, average, standard. I want merely to gain in strength, in the courage to live out my life more fully, enjoy more, experience more.I want to develop even more original and more unconventional traits."
All I wanted was humor and wisdom.
"At certain moments I remember one of his words and I suddenly feel the sensual woman flaring up, as if violently caressed"
"I touched the bottom of suffering, and then I rebelled, violently, and definitely."
"He cries, ‘Tell me, tell me what you feel.’ And I cannot. There is blood in my eyes, in my head. Words are drowned."
"I desire violently, and I wait."
"an air of the unformed, waiting to be formed, an air of eluding, waiting to be crystallized, an air of evasion, waiting to be catalyzed."
"Something in her was violently sensual, alive, earthy..."
i am all pain and no memory
"no metallic eyes or eyes of crystal as in other women, but liquid, throwing a mist dew and vapor. no definite smile but a hovering, evanescent, uncapturable smile which set off all pursuits."
One handles truths like dynamite.
I elect something I can love and absorb myself in it.
"The enemy of a love is never outside, it’s not a man or a woman, it’s what we lack in ourselves."
"But with action came anxiety, and the sense of insuperable effort made to match the dream, and with it came weariness, discouragement, and the flight into solitude again. And then in solitude, in the opium den of remembrance, the possibility of pleasure again."
In the world of the dreamer there was solitude: all the exaltations and joys came in the moment of preparation for living. They took place in solitude.
"When one is pretending, the entire body revolts."
"I want to dance. I want drugs. I want to know perverse people, to be intimate with them. I never look at naive faces. I want to bite into life, and to be torn by it."
"Her skin was as luminous asthe finest sea shells, with a pale pink glow to it."
worlds self-made and self-nourished are so full of ghosts and monsters.
"Yet Stella asked, mutely, with every gasp of doubt and anguish: Let us live together (as if human life would give a certitude!). And he answered, mutely, with every act of faith: Let us dream together!"
"It is my world, my ego. Avowed, admitted, honest. I will no longer be ashamed of it, or disguise it, or embellish it."
"I gathered poets around me and we all wrote beautiful erotica. As we were condemned to focus only on sensuality, we had violent explosions of poetry. Writing erotica became a road to sainthood rather than to debauchery."
her body emerged like that of Venus coming out of the sea.

her body emerged like that of Venus coming out of the sea.
Books created my world. How will I create worlds without them? Without them my world is small and silent. Enclosed. Remote.
A love that could not overcome all obstacles (as in the myths and legends of romantic ages) was not a love at all.
"She lay in the darkness of her white satin bedroom, the mirrors throwing aureoles of false moonlight, the rows of perfume bottles creating false suspended gardens."
It is a sign of great inner insecurity to be hostile to the unfamiliar.
"For me, the adventures of the mind, each inflection of thought, each movement, nuance, growth, discovery, is a source of exhilaration."
"Sex must be mixed with tears, laughter, words, promises, scenes, jealousy, envy, all of the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, novels, stories, dreams, fantasies, music, dancing, opium, wine."
"It comes on unexpectedly, like a fever, and goes away, like a fever. It is distinct from all other activities."
"I am writing. It is not analyzing, or meditating, or a monologue, it is writing. It is living in terms of immediate phraseology, with great excitement as before, a discovery of appropriate words, an anxiety to capture, retain, to be precise, felicitous."
"I want to bite into life, and to be torn by it."
"In chaos, there is fertility."
Beautiful women and handsome men arouse fierce desires in me.
There are many ways to be free. One of them is to transcend reality by imagination.
Creation which cannot express itself becomes madness.
"as upon a stage, conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses, helplessness, despair, and present to the world only a smile, an eagerness, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest."
"I have always been tormented by the image of a multiplicity of selves There were always, in me, two women at least, one woman desperate and bewildered, who felt she was drowning, and another who would leap into a scene,"
"I feel I am in a prison. I feel I lose my fire and my color. It should be a necessity, as the sea needs to heave, and I call it breathing."
i have been swallowed by love. devoured by it.
"I am an insane woman for whom houses wink and open their bellies. Significance stares at me from everywhere, like a gigantic underlying ghostliness. Significance emerges out of dank alleys and sombre faces, leans out of the windows of strange houses."
writing erotica became a road to sainthood rather than to debauchery.
"the paralyzing fears, fear of love, fear of people coming too near (nearness brings wounds),"
"He said it was because she was intelligent, and intelligent women mixed literature and poetry with love, which paralyzed him; and that she was positive, masculine, in some of her ways, and this intimidated him."
I will haunt my own Neptunian soul. I will revel in my own passion.
"my first vision of earth was water veiled. I am of the race of men and women who see all things through this curtain of sea, and my eyes are the color of water."
"My whole beingcalls for anact of violence,but I still use velvet gloves"
How much intimacy is there in the world for a woman like me? What I am? One unit? A monster? Am I a woman?
"a veiled woman, half-dreamed"
"I disregard the proportions, the measures, the tempo of the ordinary world. I refuse to live in the ordinary world as ordinary women. To enter ordinary relationships."
"If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing in writing, then don't write, because our culture has no use for it."
"The ivory tower of the artist may be the only stronghold left for human values, cultural treasures, man’s cult of beauty."
Only the united beat of sex and heart together can create ecstasy.
"I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living"
Passion gives me moments of wholeness
I want ecstasy. I am a neurotic — in the sense that I live in my world. I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted to myself.
There are two ways to reach me: by way of kisses or by way of the imagination. But there is a hierarchy: the kisses alone don't work
"Where the myth fails, human love begins. Then we love a human being, not our dream, but a human being with flaws."
"I am apparently gentle, unstable, and full of pretenses. I will die a poet killed by the nonpoets, will renounce no dream, resign myself to no ugliness, accept nothing of the world but the one I made myself."
"We are like sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image we long for, need, love or desire, often against reality, against their benefit, and always, in the end, a disappointment, because it does not fit them."
"you walk inside my dreams, I love the pain and the flame in you, but do not touch me."
"A piercing joy, that leaves me empty, conquered, silenced."
"I want to love you wildly. I don’t want words, but inarticulate cries, meaningless, from the bottom of my most primitive being, that flow from my belly like honey."
"I dreamed you, I wished for your existence."
"But at some time or other you will have to accept having a body, a reality, being in bondage. You will have to enter the prison of human life and accept the suffering."
"One woman within another eternally, in a far-reaching procession, shattering my mind into fragments, into quarter tones which no orchestral baton can ever make whole again."
"I kissed his shadow. I kissed his shadow and this kiss did not touch him, this kiss was lost in the air and melted with the shadow. Our love of each other is like one long shadow kissing, without hope of reality."
"Sound within sound, scene within scene, woman within woman—like acid revealing an invisible script."
"In this mood of lostness every object became extraordinarily heavy, every room oppressive, every task overwhelming."
I walk ahead of myself in perpetual expectancy  of miracles.
"A voice that had traversed the centuries, so heavy it broke what it touched, so heavy I feared it would ring in me with eternal resonance, a voice rusty with the sound of curses and thehoarse cries that issue from the delta in the last paroxysm of orgasm"
"The leaf fall of his words, the stained glass hues of his moods, the rust in his voice, the smoke in his mouth, his breath on my vision like human breath blinding a mirror"
"the chaos of her phrases; her sudden, sulkysilences."
"What you burnt, broke, and tore is still in my hands. I am the keeper of fragile things and I have kept of you what is indissoluble."
"I felt as soft as a summer day, all bloom and scent, all joy of being."
This morning I got up to begin this book I coughed. Something was coming out of my throat: it was strangling me. I broke the thread which held it and yanked it out. I went back to bed and said: I have just spat out my heart.
"And as I ran the wind lashed me, and then the voices of people like whips on me. Being touched! Do you know what it is to be touched by a human being!”"
"All the pores open and breathing the softness, the warmth, and the smells.The whole body invaded, penetrated, responding, every tiny cell and pore active and breathing and trembling and enjoying. I shrieked with pain. I ran."
"I walked slowly at first, and the garden was very soft, and I felt the softness of the garden so acutely, not on the surface of my body, but all through it, the soft warm air and the perfumes penetrated me like needles through every open bleeding pore."
"I was born without a skin. I dreamed once that I stood naked in a garden and that it was carefully and neatly peeled, like a fruit. Not an inch of skin left on my body. It was all gently pulled off, all of it, and then I was told to walk, to live, to run."
"My first vision of earth was water veiled. I am of the race of men and women who see all things through this curtain of sea, and my eyes are the color of water."
"Talk—half-talk, phrases that had no need to be finished, abstractions, Chinese bells played on with cotton-tipped sticks, mock orangeblossomspainted on porcelain. The muffled, close, half-talk of soft-fleshed women"
"When one is uprooted, transplanted, there is a temporary withering. I always panic at this and think it is permanent. I thought my life was shrinking... I began to sprout new leaves."
"I feel a fatigue at feeling, at the fervor of my dreams, the fever of my thought, the intensity of my hallucinations."
I have the power to multiply myself. I am not one woman.
"There was in me confusion between love and devotion. I thought all my acts were acts of love, yielding up of the self, the personal. But I did feel hurt that they were all willing to immolate me, and felt unloved according to my own definition of love: sacrifice."
"Reality doesn’t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls."
The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery.
I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted tomyself.

"no connection with the daily world, only with dreams and fantasies."
"I see the symbolism of our lives. I live on two levels, the human and the poetic."

I prefer my dreams.
I watched life and wanted to be a part of it but found it              painfully difficult.
