Locked down
I have been judged for my sins
I have been sentenced to death
My ears can't silence the voices
Forever in hell

Sin
Death
Trust
Blood

Sin
Death
Trust
Blood
It's the serene obscene

Baptized in sin
Praying for death
In hell we trust
Penance in blood
The serene obscene

Baptized in sin
Praying for death
In hell we trust
Penance in blood
The serene obscene

There is no hope for repentance
With blood on their hands
They grip the gavel and sentence you to hell
And you will pay with your life
For taking a life enslaved and shackled
To an existence of tortured penance
I want to ask them all

Show me their hands
Show me your hands

Sin
Death
Trust
Blood
It's the serene obscene

Baptized in sin
Praying for death
In hell we trust
Penance in blood
The serene obscene

Baptized in sin
Praying for death
In hell we trust
Penance in blood
The serene obscene

Show me your hands
Show me your hands
