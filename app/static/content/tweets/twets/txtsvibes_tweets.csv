sometimes simple things can make me cry.
"I'm not perfect. I'm just a person, made by God. I have flaws."

"People change, things go wrong, shit happens, but life goes on."
"Technically, I'm single.. But my heart is taken by someone I can't call my own."
"tired, but i have goals."
It's better when things happen unexpectedly..
"Feelings can be controlled, but tears never lie.."
I wish I could rewind time.
"I'm not the person I used to be, I admit, a lot of shit got to me."
"If you're mine, you're only mine.. I don't share."
Apologizes don't fix broken hearts
I need an escape from reality.
Sometimes I'm just tired of trying.

Comparing yourself to others is a battle that you can never win.
Drowning on my own thoughts.
"one day i’ll say, i’ve made it!"
"Forgive, let go and heal."
Words can't express everything.
Don't push someone away and expect them to still be there when you're ready.
Take a rest but don’t quit.
I wanna be successful so bad that it stresses me out.
Please be real. Don't play with someone's heart just to make yourself happy.
Don't trust easily. You'll get hurt.
"When you really love someone, stupid conversations make sense."
I hope one day you find someone who appreciates you for exactly who you are.
"Cry as hard as you want to, but just make sure that once you stop crying, you never cry for the same reason again."
i’m working on bettering myself.
"I'm not heartless, I'm just tired of getting hurt."
Move on. Someone better is waiting for you.
a heart full of love only for you.
I love those random memories that make me smile no matter what is going on in my life right now.
The hardest decision in life is deciding whether to “walk away” or “try harder”
Do you ever listen to a song and remember exactly what life was like when you first heard it
A person who seems jealous or clingy is actually someone who cares the most.
I didn't expect to get this attached to you.
keep it private. people  love to ruin things.
sorry but i’m not interested in someone who wants everyone.
if i show u my soft side my heart is yours
People with mixed music taste have the right personality for anything.
"P R A Y,   W A I T,   &amp;  T R U S T"
I think one of my favorite feelings is laughing with someone and realizing half way through how much you enjoy them and their existence.
my eyes want to see you the most
"i miss ur smile, ur face, ur hugs. i miss u"
Sometimes music is all you need to make you feel better.
I tell everyone to be strong knowing that i'm the weakest one.
bring me to the place where pain doesn't exist.
Sometimes you gotta learn to be quiet even when you got a lot to say....
"You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice.."
"we fight, we fix and stay, that’s maturity."
imagine having someone that actually gets excited to talk to you.
I need a long long long long hug.
being a cold person makes life easier.
Nothing is more beautiful than those easy people whom we can be comfortable with.
"the eyes, they never lie"
my bed knows all my pain.
I'll never show anyone what I'm feeling.
need a vacation from my head.
I want to fall asleep and wake up in a different life.
"and suddenly, i lost my smile again"
"""Pisanthrophobia"" is the fear of trusting people due to bad past experiences."
Do what you need to do to be happy.
Never fall for sweet words. Fall for sweet actions.
"My ""haha"" and ""HAHAHA"" are so fucking different."
"twitter isn't just an app, it's a diary"
strong people cry at night
"I wanna be happy, that's all."
always learn how to be strong alone.
"being called ""baby"" makes my heart melt"
stuck between i don't want to feel that type of hurt again but i want to feel that type of love again.
mature conversations ft. the right person
i hope u miss me sometimes
"saying ""im tired"" when you're actually sad."
having insecurities sucks
"i don't hate, i ignore people"
I know you're tired but keep going.
night drives with good music
i hate when a good song is attached to a bad memory
"if i repeated what you did, you'd be mad too"
never attack someone with personal stuff they trusted you with.
i'll never give up on you
i wish i was with you rn tbh
Be teachable. You're not always right.
Pain is part of growing.
"no matter what, im here"
i really missed your voice.
i love talking to you for hours
you deserve someone who is afraid to lose you like you are afraid to lose them.
"if i told you to leave me, hold me more"
You’ll find peace when you stop caring.
when you open twitter to look for motivation but everyone is just as tired as you.
Even at your worse you'll still have me.
I found my happiness in you
only one person can change my mood in just seconds
toxic people love playing the victim
i'm too young to overthink.
I pray my friends get through the battles that they don't tell me about.
missing so many things
I can fake like i'm fine
i still remember how our first conversation started
Please God heal those people who are in pain.
"smile, and let the world show how blessed you are even in your hardest battle."
if i cried over u i really love u
All I want right now is a healthy sleeping routine.
Don't let someone treat you bad just because you love them.
overthinking takes you to a place that doesn't exist.
"i just kept myself quiet, so no one will get hurt because of my anger."
"don't trust my smile, i'm sad."
you can't force people to love you.
always trust the process.
unexpected blessings are the best.
you glow different when you stop caring what people think about you.
Real love is not easy.
Genuine people are rare.
I can be the coldest person if I want but I'm afraid to lose people I'm afraid of being lonely.
I hate how sensitive I am. I literally break my own heart
"to my fav person, i love you and take care everyday"
"Being hugged when you are crying, makes you cry even more."
music saves me from overthinking and pain like no one did.
Letting go is another way to say I love you.
"We're like strangers now, but our memories are still in me."
I hope I get an unexpected text from you.
"Don't make a promise, because promises can also break my heart."
"don't give up because of one chapter didn't turned out well, keep on going, your life doesn't end there."
Beautiful personality is greater than a beautiful face.
Sorry for being cold when I'm sad.
we're too young to be unhappy.
Be kind to unkind people someday they might learn..
You don't need to be perfect. The right one will fall in love with who truly you are.
Hearing someone you love laugh is easily one of the best things on earth.
"this time, love yourself more."
not everyone will understand you and that's okay
You have no idea just how much I want to be with you all the time.
showing you love on your bad days
I miss my normal life.
"I just wanna say, appreciate what you have while you have it."
I can’t even explain how much I love you.
a lot of feelings but nothing to say
"Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days."
"keep me in your heart, always."
i never lie when it comes to feelings.
"i have said too much, shared too much, cared too much, and now i want my energy back. i no longer want to get close to anyone."
I want you mine and only mine.
can i just deactivate myself
"i still miss you, i still want you, i still love you."
I’m a very emotional sensitive strong solid person.
late night calls? i miss that shit
"Dear pain, You changed me a lot."
i just want u to be in my future.
i stop trying to communicate when i feel unwanted
Never forget who helped you when everyone else was making excuses.
I say sorry a lot. Mostly because I feel like everything is my fault.
You can't force people to treat you right.
Be strong but not rude.  Be kind but not weak.  Be humble but not timid.  Be proud but not arrogant.
"Stop explaining yourself to other people. You owe no one any explanation of what you do. Your life is yours, not theirs."
Love isn't supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be worth it.
"Sometimes, staying is more painful than leaving."
Be mature enough to accept rejection and failures.
"Heal, learn and grow."
Mind your own twitter.
You're the happiness I never realized that I needed
"I hate those days, that remind me of everything I want to forget."
"Accept your past without regret, handle your present with confidence and face your future without fear."
"Since you've been around, I smile a lot more than I used to."
"Yes, I'm thinking about you right now."
Don't let your past steal your present.
No more toxic issues please.
Never let a person get comfortable disrespecting you.
Hi. You are worth it :)
Self love ft. self care.
being financially stable and genuinely happy is an ultimate goal
"do me a favor, stay in my life."
can i rewind back to where i was happy?
i wish i was important to you.
i made a mistake and i'm sorry for that.
my feelings for you will never change
seeing my friends happy makes me happy
i need an unexpected thing to happen.
give me attention before i lose interest
i need someone to hug me everyday.
i wish i could delete toxic people in my life.
always pray and never give up
"a ""can we talk"" can fix a lot."
"if you love someone, never leave them."
after everything i still love you
God please give me strength.
music changes my mood.
i feel incomplete without you.
"Find someone who makes you smile, because it only takes a smile to make a day better."
"Be strong enough to let go of something that's hurting you and no longer makes you happy. If the tears outweigh the smiles, then it's a sign to finally move on. You deserve to be happy, not miserable."
Crying helps you ease the pain.
"One mistake, millions of regrets"
Make yourself a priority.
"The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes and weaknesses, but still thinks you're completely amazing."
"Friends can break your heart, too."
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.
"I trusted you, you lied."
"I know a lot, I just keep silent."
Overthinking can kill you slowly.
"Be smart enough to hold on, be brave enough to let go."
"I promise, I will love you at your worst and hold you at your weakest."
I just need your time and attention.
My mind is full of thoughts.
Music sounds better when the song describes how you feel.
you're my favorite secret.
i'm not very good at telling people how i feel
Quiet people notice everything.
we young but we are stressing like we 50.
i miss waking up being excited about something.
I see you in all my favorite songs.
i still remember our first chat.
real ones stays in bad times.
it's always better when nobody knows anything about you.
I only want positive energy around me.
"please don't expect me to always be kind and loving, there are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand."
i badly want to restart my life.
please remember this
I automatically distance myself when I feel unwanted.
I love people who appreciates my weird personalities.
"I wish i had a delete button in my life to delete some people, some memories and some feelings."
you are my favorite place.
"To my friends, that genuinely care about me. Thank you, I love you."
everything about you is special to me.
Yea I'm strong but I got limits too.
eyes for you &amp; only you.
I feel so sad and I would deeply like to apologise to myself for being the way I am.
You can fall in love with eyes too.
my soul needs a hug
"dear me, i'll make you proud one day"
i want you to stay and never go away
"sometimes, i'm tired of being nice"
distance sucks i need you here with me
leaving without an explanation hurts
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
"i still miss u, i still want u, i still love u"
"if you don't appreciate me, i'm gone"
I never wanna feel heartbreak ever again.
I'll never forget the first time I saw you
"Dear crush, please fall in love with me."
"Real feelings don't just ""go away."""
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep.
"You stopped trying, so I stopped caring."
you stole my heart since that day.
don't bestfriend my bestfriend.
Give yourself a break sometimes
God keep me strong.
"Be patient with yourself, you are growing stronger everyday."
I pray we all marry someone that doesn't leave when it gets tough.
You make me smile every single day.
You deserve a relationship that enables you to sleep peacefully at night.
A girl's twitter is full of hints.
We can't force people to appreciate us.
I am tired but I never quit.
I want to be the person you're scared to lose.
The pain eats you until you feel nothing anymore.
"She says she doesn't care, but her eyes tell a different story."
Sometimes you just need to be selfish to take care of yourself.
"behind every favourite song, there is an untold story."
"We try to hide our feelings, but we forgot that our eyes speak."
Follow your heart but take your brain with you.
"“If you are reading this, God still has a plan &amp; purpose for your life.”"
I love those random memories that make me smile no matter what's going on in my life right now.
"People say you don't know what you've got until it's gone. Truth is, you knew what you had, you just never thought you'd lose it."
The best way to live your life is to not care about what other people think.
"Nobody is ever too busy. If they care, they would make time."
Missing my favorite person
I’m not sad but I’m full of feelings I don’t like.
i have four moods:  oversleeping  overthinking  overeating  overspending
When you find both love and friendship in one person.
I want to sleep until i feel better.
"I hope you find someone who make you feel wanted every time, all the time."
Silence says a lot more than you think.
Remember that I believe in you.
Some people are bad for your health
"Spend more time with people you love, and do more things that you love."
"You’re my best friend, my human diary, you mean the world to me."
Thank you for being the reason I smile.
"True love never dies, because true love waits forever."
You can't deny your feelings forever.
My only relationship goal is to be with someone who motivates me to become a better person and show me the potential I don't see in myself.
"Life is weird. First you wanna grow up, then you wanna be a kid again."
You're always on my mind.
"If you believe in it, then fight for it."
thoughts feel heavier these days
no one can help you unless you help yourself.
maybe i just expect too much
self-love is the new relationship goal
"when a girl is silent, she's either overthinking, tired of waiting, falling apart or crying inside."
Never give up on prayer. God sometimes answer in unexpected ways.
Even the kindest hearts get tired too.
"Yes, you will be successful soon. Claim it."
sometimes you just want to feel wanted.
I’m keeping so much inside.
it hurts my feelings when i’m talking to someone and i can feel them not caring about anything I’m saying.
"Just because we haven't been talking, that doesn't mean I haven't been thinking about you all the time."
You have no idea how beautiful you are in my eyes.
i care so much more than you think.
sooner or later
"one day, i’ll marry you."
People who check up on you because they care are the best kind of people.
i need someone to hug me everyday.
"I hate waiting. But if waiting means being able to be with you, I'll wait for as long as forever to be with you."
"Appreciate what you have right now, because you don't always get a second chance."
"You are, and always  have been, my dream"
"i had choices, but i chose you."
i overthink because i notice everything.
"If it’s still in your mind, it is still in your heart."
you really don't know pain till you sat and begged God to heal your heart.
Late night talks with friends can be some of the best therapy.
"I don't fall in love with faces, I fall in love with personalities."
i hate feeling like i’m being ignored
"i'm not feeling okay, but it's fine"
keeping everything as a secret is better
my biggest fear is losing my loved ones
i will never be the same as before
"i need more happiness, sleep and peace"
"i'm sorry for the pain, that i caused"
to feel unwanted is the worse thing
I’m like 4000% tired.
Finding myself while losing everyone.
Silence gives answers.
"Sometimes you have to distance yourself from people. If they care, they will notice. If they don't, you will know where you stand."
Everything in life can teach you a lesson. You just have to be willing to learn.
I will be by your side till the end.
Never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about.
"You meet thousands of people and none of them really effect you, then you meet that one person, and your life is changed forever."
i’ll say i’m fine but i’m not.
i tweet a lot when im hurt
eye contact and heartbeats.
sometimes silence is better.
i love you but i can’t say that.
sorry if i'm not enough
all i ask for is peace of mind.
"When you are angry, be silent."
You're forever in my heart.
"I want you to love me for who I am, not who you want me to be"
"Sometimes you never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory, that you wish you could experience again."
sad but doing my best.
i appreciate people who try.
i need you on my bad days too.
"Fuck second chances, people never change."
"it takes years to learn the difference between who to let go and who to be patient with. the same way it takes years to know what you deserve and what you don’t. so hang in there, growth and experience come with time."
I didn’t realize growing up meant dying inside
perhaps we’ll meet again when we’re better for each other.
Good music taste is attractive.
i need more of you and less of this world.
"I’m bad with words, I hope you’re good in reading eyes."
feeling lonely kills me
"If you love someone tell them, because hearts are often broken by words left unspoken."
Smile. It looks good on you.
i loved you to the moon and back.
"I'm not perfect, I make mistakes, I hurt people, but when I say sorry, I actually mean it."
"I’m here for you. Through whatever, whenever."
I love when people remember the small things you thought they'd forget... that makes them even more special.
"Relationships are worth fighting for, but you can't be the only one fighting."
"I'm actually really nice, until you annoy me."
Don't promise if you'll break them in the end.
"You can fake a smile, but you can't fake your feelings."
I just wanna watch the night sky with someone and have deep conversations.
"Happiness is a choice, not a result. Nothing will make you happy until you choose to be happy."
"A smile can mean a thousand words, but it can also hide a thousand problems."
i need a break from all this bullshit.
"you gotta love her on her bad days when she is moody and irritated, just as much as you love her when everything is going well."
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile.
"behind my smile, there's you."
"I don't need someone perfect. I need someone who loves me, respects me, cares for me and understands me."
"I fell in love with your personality, your looks are just a bonus."
"I'm not perfect. I'll annoy you, make fun of you, say stupid things, but you'll never find someone who loves you as much as I do."
Maybe you're the right person but we're not in the right time.
never forget how much i tried to keep you.
"Be with those who stayed, not who promised."
Every song has a memory.
"Dear bed, you’re my true love."
In need of someone who is prepared for: - Long talks - My dreams - Random texts - My crazy side - My mood swings
"when i love, i love stupid hard."
i love you since the day i found you.
a gentle reminder:
i still talk to God about you.
thinking of you never ends.
I hate when my fav person is sad.
Don’t become the person who hurt you.
"I pretend to look around, but I’m actually looking for you."
"I’m an over thinker so if you don’t give me an answer, I’ll think of one."
eyes don’t know how to hide love
One lie can ruin a thousand truths.
"Inhale the best, exhale the stress."
"If it makes you happy, do it."
"if you stay, i'll keep you."
Life goes on. Move forward. Be better. Do better.
Have you ever cried because you're just you?
"Talking to you, laughing with you, being with you, changes my whole mood."
Happiness is a choice. Choose it.
Food will never break your heart.
"In 10 years, I wonder who is still going to be by my side."
imagine how a single message can change a whole mood.
I hope everything becomes better
i miss how happy we were together
my heart is full of unsaid words
"i’m me, i'm sorry i can’t be them."
i'm tired of acting like i'm not hurting
"you’re not mine, but i still get jealous"
"i'm hurt too, but i'm always silent"
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
i wanna delete a lot of people.
idk but fast replies makes me feel important.
some people's mindsets are absolute trash.
it's better to be lowkey and private. it's peaceful.
"Everything I was afraid of happening, happened."
You are my favorite stranger.
You think you know people but then they surprise you.
Enjoy yourself. Heal yourself. Trust yourself. Respect yourself. Believe yourself. Love yourself.  Be yourself.
much of love for one person.
"No matter how strong of a person you are, there's always someone who can make you weak."
I still love you but you don't care anymore
"I like being alone but i want someone to be alone with, if that makes sense."
You know what’s attractive? Effort.
"Some people can be so quiet about their pain, that you forget that they’re hurting. That’s why it’s important to always be kind."
I miss how everything was.
Sometimes music speaks what you feel inside.
"The best feeling is when I look at you, and you're already looking at me."
Bad days build better days.
"Once I stop caring you’re not getting it back. I’ll be cold as ice, I promise."
"Even if i had a million reasons to leave you, i would still look for one to stay."
i have so many moods
how do we skip the sad parts
A relationship is about two things: 1. Appreciating similarities  2. Respecting differences
The best is yet to come. Just be patient.
Note to self: Stop trying so hard for people who don’t care.
when they start praying for you that’s another type of love.
"Stop overthinking about something. If it feels right, go with the flow. If it feels wrong, don’t think about it too hard and just walk away."
It hurts to let go but sometimes it hurts more to hold on.
You’ll be happy again. You will understand your heart better when you heal. You will be okay.
Bad relationships change good people.
I'll be fine. I just don't know when.
Treat me right and I'll treat you better.
my eyes talk instead of me.
"I can't control my feelings, but I hate how my feelings can control me."
Never be afraid to say what you feel.
"Fight for me, and I promise you I will do the same."
I want you to be happy. But I want to be the reason.
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
Don't let little things destroy your happiness.
"chatting without ""HAHAHAHAHA"" makes me feel like i'm in a serious meeting."
I hate missing someone and not being able to do anything about it.
"I don't care about losing people who don't wanna be in my life anymore, I've lost people who meant the world to me and I'm doing just fine."
"I love you, but I hate you. I miss you, but I'm better off without you. I want you out of my life, but I never want to let you go."
"If you're lucky enough to get a second chance at something, don't waste it."
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right.
It's so hard to forget someone that you shared so many memories with.
It's okay to not be okay sometimes.
I wish you loved me too.
my jealousy means i actually care about you.
"You know my name, not my story. You've heard what I've done, not what I've been through."
need a message full of true feelings.
I’ve met a lot of people but nobody feels like you.
nothing feels heavier than unsaid words.
I never want to lose you.
"not everybody will understand your silence, remember that."
"Sometimes I push you away, because i need you to pull me closer."
"if they care, they'll find time for you."
⠀  ⠀⠀⠀                 PRAY ⠀⠀      Everything will be okay  ⠀
"Listen to the silence, it speaks."
"Dear best friends, please stay in my life forever."
I like conversations where I don't have to think about what to say.
I wanna travel the world with the love of my life
"you can hide it from the world, but God knows whats inside your heart."
why can’t life just be easy?
"the little details can make you fall in love, and can also break your heart."
"Never ignore a person who loves and cares for you, cause one day you may realize that you've lost the moon while counting the stars."
Moving on doesn't mean you forget about things. It just means you have to accept what happened and continue living.
Stay with those who would fight the whole world just for you.
Never losing myself again for anyone.
"The ""i"" before ""miss you"" and ""love you"" is important."
God will never put you through anything you can't handle.
Private life always wins.
Unexpected text messages are always nice. The fact that the person took a little bit of their time to make you smile.
May you fall in love with someone who never gets tired of saving you from your own chaos.
"High expectations lead to disappointments, always"
"i didn't change, i just realized."
"not a secret, just not your business."
Inside every person there’s a person you don’t know
Don’t let the pain destroy you.
I love your voice and your laugh a lot.
"Absolutely, my heart only wants you."
we tweet for our unsaid thoughts.
"it’s okay, tomorrow is better."
i’d rather be alone than force myself in a circle that i don’t belong.
a person who smells good is a big turn on
"i'm different at social media, at school, at home, and at public. so don't act like you know me well."
"not attracted by looks, i'm attracted to mindsets."
"my phone is always in my hand so if you think i'm ignoring you, i am."
I either talk too much or i don't talk at all.
"I felt so much, that I started to feel nothing."
"look at my eyes, i’m full of you."
I hate overthinking but I just can’t stop.
"Dear someone, you have this incredible way of making my heart happy."
Don’t be afraid to fail. Be afraid not to try.
the silence said it all.
Never take someone’s feelings as a joke.
Smiling instead of explaining why you’re sad is much easier.
Find someone who knows you’re not perfect but treats you as if you are.
Memories never die.
"Always remember that everything that happens, good or bad, helps you grow. Even if it’s hard to see that right now."
me: *sleeps for 4 hours* tired me: *sleeps for 8 hours* tired me: *sleeps for a week* tired me: *sleeps for a month* tired me: *sleeps for a year* still tired
Maybe I was wrong again.
Still tryin to heal from things I don’t speak about.
"When you finally meet that someone who tries their hardest to be with you regardless of how difficult you are, stay with them. Stay with them because finding someone who is willing to be with you at all cost doesn’t happen every day."
Don’t be afraid of losing someone who doesn’t feel lucky to have you.
"People can say anything about you, but only you know the truth."
"What comes easy won’t last long, and what lasts long won’t come easy."
"Once you start loving someone, it's hard to stop."
"You were born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection."
"There's always that one person that can make you smile, even when you're at your lowest."
"Just when you think you know people, they disappoint you in ways you never thought they could."
"Mentally, the worst feeling is feeling unwanted by the one person you want the most."
That awkward moment when you have to stare at a text for five minutes to figure out how to reply
"A great relationship is about two things: First, appreciating the similarities, and second, respecting the differences."
"Don't wish for it, work for it."
"Don’t listen to what people say, watch what they do."
"yes, i tweet about you."
Having someone who can handle all your moods is such a blessing
I want to delete all my feelings.
"Remember, you deserve to treat yourself with kindness."
"Long distance relationships are hard but they’re also incredible. If two people can love, respect, trust, and understand each other from a distance, nothing can break them apart."
"I choose you. Again and again, I will choose only you."
Accept people as they are.
Let me listen to your problems at 3am and fall in love with you even more.
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes
It's not about having the perfect relationship. It's about finding someone who matches you and will go through everything without giving up.
Don't ignore me for days and then start talking to me again like nothing happened.
"Right person, wrong time. I hate that."
"Never change who you are just because you're afraid of losing them. If they really love you, your imperfections won't matter."
Unexpected messages can do alot.
Never give up on something you really want.
songs bring back memories.
i wish i could see you every time i miss you.
tired of saying it's okay.
"don't be sad, all this shit will pass."
you’re still my fav. notification
good people like you matter
explanations are exhausting.
i’m not afraid to try again. i’m just afraid of getting hurt for the same reason.
Waking up today is a Blessing given by God.
My feelings for you will never change.
overthinking breaks your own heart.
I love direct eye contact
Do you ever feel like no one really knows you?
A break from the whole world is needed af.
you know nothing about the battles i fight alone.
Your first heartbreak changes you forever.

You never know what someone is going through. Be kind. Always.
Train your mind to be stronger than your feelings.
be with someone who supports you 100%
"half strong, half broken."
Bestfriends make life so much better.
i spend 90% of my day overthinking
trust me i want you and only you
delete the old version of me from your mind.
i believe in using songs to say things.
just stay and be my last
"smiling has always been easier, than explaining why you are sad."
my heart is different now
"WORST FEELING,  being compared being ignored being rejected being replaced."
"When I'm sad, please don't ask me what's wrong, just hug me."
It's okay not to be okay.
Healing yourself is the greatest comeback.
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
Don’t forget how strong you are.
"One day, all the pain will make sense."
"Be patient, have faith, the best is yet to come."
find someone that accepts all sides of you.
"happy or sad, i always listen to music."
interested in you and only you
stop being nice if it breaks you.
Being attracted to someone's smile is a real thing.
Having someone who has your back is one of the greatest blessings ever
Nothing kills you like your mind.
i hide my feelings a lot.
I hope better days are coming.
eye contacts that end up with a smile.
Be real with me or just leave me alone.
some parts of you just never heal.
The best revenge is to show them that your life is getting better after they’re gone.
i act i'm fine but i'm dead inside.
unsaid feelings really hurt.
i crave for peace of mind.
i wanna go somewhere where no one knows my name
"i’ll always love you, i promise"
"go     for           someone              who            is       not  only  proud         to           have               you,                  but            will         also     risk  anything     just         to           keep               you"
you’re more than enough for me
i still fall in love with you everyday
"suffer in private, glow in public."
Everything feels so heavy lately.
Life’s better when nobody knows anything about you.
"i’m just focusing on becoming a better version of me, physically, mentally, and emotionally."
Don't make someone feel special if you have no intention of staying.
i wish i can delete my sad feelings.
Some endings don't have proper goodbyes.
Sleeping is nice. You get to forget about everything for awhile
Find a person who feels proud for having you.
"damn, i'm so in love with you"
can I airplane mode my life?
my heart wants you
"Learn to be done with people. Not mad, not bothered. Just done."
"i suffered, i learned, i changed"
"smile, like nothing happened"
"Have you ever tried to share your problem with somone because you can't handle it anymore but instead of sharing them you chose not to, because you think that you might just bother them"
I talk too much when I like someone
"Right now, I want to hug my favorite person."
"I can’t replace you, no one is you."
"One day, someone will choose you and keep on choosing you everyday."
"we are strangers, again"
I appreciate those who stayed when im at my lowest.
i miss the life without covid.
i need someone to tell me that i'm not as bad as i think i am.
Loyalty means everything.
don’t break someone who trusted you.
Eye language never lies.
Losing toxic people is a win.
i wish i could unmeet some people
soon I'll make my parents proud.
"Dear self, stop expecting too much."
"one day, u gonna have everything u've prayed for."
I don't know what I feel anymore
"When we first met, I had no idea you'd become so important to me."
need a long break from everything
"You smile, I fall deeper."
a simple okay hides thousands of feelings.
Trusting people is getting harder.
remember that the right person will never get tired of you
my mother deserves the world
disappointment happens when you expect too much.
being understood without having to explain yourself is the best kind of feeling.
i wish memories left when people did
no girl deserves to wake up &amp; feel like she’s not enough.
Hug me tight. I like that.
i get jealous easily because i really care
mixed feelings &amp; unsaid thoughts
eye contact makes me go crazy
don’t try to compare me to anyone
i wish i had more time with you
don’t lie to me. i hate that shit
be strong enough to handle shits in life
late replies make me lose interest
ⁱ'ᵐ ˢᵒʳʳʸ ᶠᵒʳ ᵇᵉⁱⁿᵍ ˢᵘᶜʰ ᵃ ᵐᵉˢˢ
"i know we can't see each other rn, but i hope we will meet soon so i can hug u"
"I made someone smile, I made someone laugh but damn, I forgot my own happiness"
"Don't talk, act. Don't say, show. Don't promise, prove."
"To my favorite person:  I've been thinking of you every second, every minute, every hour, and every day. I always care for you, just be safe."
"Whatever happens, life goes on."
"I'm strong, but not all the time."
A person who cares silently is a person who loves truly
I get jealous when someone's else has your attention
"I want you, nothing else but you"
a lot of shit changed me
"i dont want others attention, i want yours"
"i love you, always and forever"
"it's okay if your heart feels heavy, your emotions and feelings are always valid. take a deep breath, I promise your heart will feel lighter eventually. it will take time, but you will feel better. you're here. you're going to be okay. it's going to be okay."
one notification from u gives me millions of happiness
"if it makes u happy, go for it."
"I won't call but I care, I won't text but I think of you everytime, I won't meet, but I always miss you, I won't say, but I always love you."
We aren't afraid of love; we are afraid of not being loved in return
Feel the pain until it hurts no more
You hate me?   It's okay. I wasn't born to please everyone.
I always end up saying I'm fine even though I'm deeply hurt inside.
don't ever lie to me to protect my feelings.
accept the situation and move on with smile.
you're always in my prayers.
"Stuck between idk, idc &amp; idgaf."
My mind really needs a mute button.
I'm working on being a better me for me.
"Patience is the key, because when the right time comes, it will be very beautiful and totally worth the wait."
You can’t please everybody.
Don’t get surprised by how fast people can change.
hug me till i forget all my sadness.
Real love won't quit on you.
"I'm a private person so if i open up with you, damn i trust you."
"take care always, i love you."
"I just want peace, no heartaches, no tears, no pain"
"twitter is my daily diary, tbh."
private relationship ft. true feelings
"without music, life would be so boring"
trust me im always here for u
sometimes it’s better to say nothing
Keep it private until you know it’s permanent.
eye contacts that end up with a smile.
Risking is better than regretting.
you are not afraid of new love. you are afraid of old pain.
that shit hurts but i act like idc
need that “i only want you“ energy
having me is so boring ikr
Notice everything but be quiet.
i love it when i catch u staring at me
seeing you happy is everything to me
"nevermind, i know you don't care"
i know i’m not perfect but i’m trying
"people change, memories remain"
you’re that part of me i’ll always need
Twitter is a place to confess your feelings
"I'm fine, I just miss talking with you"
"Love the personality, not the looks"
"I like being alone, it's peaceful"
I don’t react but I notice everything
"""Im proud of you"" just hits different."
"i found someone, i never want to lose.❤️"
talk to God before you sleep
forehead kisses and tight hugs
"i love you always, never forget that"
"i love music, especially ur voice"
prayer is the best healer
I wish I could tell someone everything.
you deserve someone who will do everything to keep u
"If I tell you my problems, it means I trust you."
never use a person to forget another.
normalize being nice for no reason.
"Pain changes people. It makes them overthink, trust less, feel worthless &amp; shut people out"
Maybe one day I’ll be enough for someone
No one knows how much I cried that day
things will get better. things will get better. things will get better.
Everyone deserve a person that can make their heart forget the trauma in the past
"I go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace"
"Sometimes people need their space. They’re not cutting you off, they just need time to breathe and take care of themselves. They need some space to work on themselves. That has nothing to do with you."
"I disappear sometimes, that’s my thing"
If i told you i love you i meant that
old songs hold a special place in my heart.
"someday, someone will love you and you will forget why others couldn't"
i wanna live in my imagination
fast replies makes me feel important
every second with you is special
i could spend hours looking at you
i wanna netflix &amp; chill with my fav person
i love you and it’ll always be you
i have special feelings for you only
i miss you but u seem fine without me
i seriously never get bored of you
smile again like you've never been hurt
crazy how things change so fast
ur notification changes my entire mood
i dont like sharing my fav person
i wish i can repeat that moment
i’ve been acting like im ok but im not
just a text from you makes my day
i’ll never stop caring about you
"don't break me again, i am fragile"
i wish i could see you all the time
can't explain how i feel right now
laughing with you fills my heart up
you’re the person i prayed for
i want endless conversations with u
"to the people who appreciate me, ily"
i love this
It’s nice when someone remembers small details about you.
"Girls don’t stalk, they investigate."
being alone really makes you realize a lot of shit.
don’t lose people who are rare to find
music understands me when nobody else can.
i wish i can hug u whenever i miss you
You will always be my special person
true friends are always there for you
I am okay &amp; not okay at the same time
you are the only one my heart wants
"dear heart, please keep me strong"
outside: okay inside: empty
and all of a sudden..
Sometimes you have no choice but to move on.
only you can give me that feeling.
i hate missing you every night
"keep ur feelings, no one cares anymore"
late replies kills the whole mood
can i just quit everything? i am so tired
i don’t want to be tired anymore
i hate that i can't tell u what i feel
pretending not to be jealous is never easy
every minute i have a different feeling
i wanna travel the world with someone
tired of pretending to be stronger
crying over stupid shit is my talent
kinda hope you’re thinking about me
"i'm young, but i've been through a lot"
i always try to be enough for you
i’m very soft please take care of me
badly want a hug from my fav person
being compared? i hate that a lot
sometimes it’s better to say nothing
"I’m sad, I need cash."
Choose people who are good for your mental health.
"maybe, i'm the problem."
keeping myself busy to feel okay
it’s okay to let some friendships die.
"I just wanna flex God, He never left me"

Be weird. Be positive. Be open minded. Be happy.
jealousy can break a whole mood.
Be with someone who feels like home.
You are worth more than second thoughts and maybes.
Don’t expect to get what you give. not everyone has a heart like yours.
your happiness is my happiness.
Distance doesn’t separate people... silence does.
i am still here and will always be here
i love you as much as i hate  my time without you
you are the first in my mind always
i get so happy when you talk to me
as always i pretend to feel no pain
i don’t wanna overthink this shit hurts
if you're sad i can be sad with you
i love  it  when  you  make  me  feel  special
i’m literally so moody and i hate that
you can’t find me in someone else
A girl’s twitter is full of hints
Be careful who you open up to. Only a few actually care.
I am changing. I am growing. I am becoming better
music is a life saver.
I deserve someone who actually cares.
that random stranger you met online and now a big part of your life.
Sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself.
"“u changed” you hurt me, remember."
God knows how much i prayed for you.
i miss being excited about something.
forehead kisses is only for a special someone
don’t make me feel special and leave like i never mattered
i love people who  replies  fast that shit is attractive  af
i want to hug you and never lose you
i’m very    very      very        very         very          very        very      very     very   very  very   very   very     very     very        very          very         very       very     very   very  very   very      very       very      very   very sad
"dear money, i need you right now"
wishing for a better days full of happiness
i'm happy when you're around
i still read our chat when i miss you
i listen to music and think too much
my jealousy means i care about you
i'm just trying my best to be okay
i smile everyday to hide the pain inside
one person can make you feel a lot
you're mine whatever happens
just wanted to feel special again
i cant explain how much i love you
Find someone who understands your silence.
maturity and mindset are most attractive than looks.
"we may not talk, but i still care"
my favorite memory was meeting you
"What hurts you, changes you."
"imagine, you're not good-looking, but someone saves your photo."
Don’t beg anyone to stay.
I distance myself for a reason.
songs explain what i can’t explain
i look at ur pics when i miss u
I still fall for you every single day.
Not proud of my actions recently but I'm really trying to be better.
trust me i'm lucky to have you.
"still a ""HAHAHAHAHA"" person though i'm hurting that much."
call me for no reason i love hearing your voice
I want to be with you all the time.
I love you so much no matter what.
we all deserve genuine happiness
i wanna hug someone and cry so bad
i saw your flaws and loved you more
"maybe i don't show, but i'm broken"
just been tired of everything lately
i will love you with everything i have
one person can make you feel a lot
"nobody cares how u feel, just smile"
you'll always be my favorite thought
"chill alone, listening to music"
"Make sure your circle has quality, not quantity."
"If I date you, I won’t control you. Do what you want. Your actions will tell me how much you respect the relationship."
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile.
"i want you, i need you, i miss you."
"sleep late, wake up late, regret, repeat."
music is lowkey therapy.
sometimes home is a person.
"not single, not taken, just waiting for something real"
"someone who wants you, will make you feel wanted"
having clingy but mature partner is perfect.
all good things take time.
i wish i was someone’s fav
you are enough.   you are good enough.   you are smart enough.   you are strong enough.   you are beautiful enough.   you are kind enough.   you are brave enough.   you are enough and you will always be.
"That ""grow together"" type of love."
"I wanna build a relationship with someone who cares about ""why"" I've been quiet all day. Not someone who gets mad cause I'm ""acting different”."
being kind might hurt u sometimes
you make me sad yet i still love you
eyes don’t know how to hide love
can i rewind back to where i was happy?
i feel like i’m already tired tomorrow
"i like clingy, but from the right person"
smile even though ur hearts breaking
unexpected texts are my favorite
even the strongest heart gets tired
seeing ur best friend changes hurts
im scared of losing someone i really love
i miss you the minute we stop talking
"stupid me, thinking i was good enough"
Let yourself be happy.
"Pray. Things will get better, not now but soon."
"You learn, you change, you grow."
Choose someone who always choose you even at your worst.
I need a break from everything.
The right person will make you fall in love with yourself too
Don’t hurt the person God sent to heal you.
Be with someone who’s in the mood for you everyday.
Not everyone’s “I love you” is sincere
I always motivate someone but I can’t motivate myself.
you will always be special to me
sometimes hug is all we need
Never give up on prayer. God sometimes answer in unexpected ways
Be a private person. Live peacefully.
Praying for a clear mind &amp; a happy heart.
Nothing hurts more than trying your absolute best and still not being good enough.
Finding both love and friendship in one person is the best thing that can happen.
"don’t worry about me, i got me"
"leave, if u can't handle my attitude"
"typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  delete.  typing,  unsend feelings"
i need someone that appreciates me
"i’m so sensitive, be nice with me"
i just feel empty when i don’t talk to u
i listen to music and think too much
"to my fav person, i really need ur hug"
i smile whenever i see your texts
things end but memories last forever
I changed myself for myself.
quick replies make me happy
"If you’re ever stuck between me and another person, don’t pick me. I’m good."
I wish I could block my thoughts and feelings.
find someone who believes in you when you don’t.
"Everything, in time."
never wanna feel that pain again
I owe myself an apology for all the shit i let slide
Your trauma is not your fault but healing is your responsibility.
A partner with the same vibe as yours &gt;&gt;&gt;
"you’ll always have me, i promise"
"i love you still, i always will."
There’s so much I wanna say but if I talk about it I’ll start crying.
Friendship isn't about who you have known the longest. It's about who came and never left your side.
"My life, my choices, my mistakes, my lessons. Not your business."
long walks with the right person
silent crying hurts the most
you're someone i'd never wanna lose
the best part of my day is talking to u
private relationships are always better
i get jealous i get mad i get worries i get curious  that’s only because i care
"missing the same person, everyday"
one notification can do so much
i notice a lot of things but i keep quiet
i wanna go everywhere with you
i know i’m not perfect but i’m trying
i’m tired both mentally and physically
sorry for being a boring person
i want endless chats with you
"you’re different, you’re special"
"happy or sad, i always listen to music"
a smiling face doesn't always mean a happy heart.
nothing hurts more than being ignored.
old messages really hit when you know that the bond is never coming back.
"dear music, thanks"
Save your heart for someone who cares.
Loyalty is rare.
You glow different when your soul is happy.
Be patient. God wants you to have the best.
"Rest when you’re tired, never quit."
Self-care is important nowadays.
"I trusted you, you lied."
Remember: “Your mental health is important.”
Hearing “im so proud of you” when you feel like you aren’t doing enough really does lift a lot of weight off of you.
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is"
Always choose to be happy.
"Be strong, s e l f."
"Someday, I’ll be someone’s first priority. Maybe."
Real feelings don’t change fast.
The best apology is changed behavior.
"I wanna build a relationship with someone who cares about ""why"" I've been quiet all day. Not someone who gets mad cause I'm ""acting different”."
yeah i'm broken but i'm strong
"just wanna be alone, but with you"
i hope you still want me in the end
i will never give up on u ily
your reply is my happiness
You know someone means a lot to you when their mood affects yours.
"i love clingy, only when its from u"
Being kissed while you're asleep is one of the most purest forms of love.
"It’s ok. I mean it’s not ok, but it’s ok."
Tweeting your feelings is better than saying it to other people.
Unexpected friendship is the best.
Life is teaching me a lot right now.
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me
my late night thoughts are all about u
everything feels better with you
another night wishing you’d miss me
i dont wanna see u with anyone else
no one understand my sadness
i miss our late night conversations
life’s too short to not say how u feel
knew a lot of shit but i kept it to myself
everything in my life is falling apart
my heart is very tired and sad
"sorry, i’m not good enough for anyone"
"together or not, i’ll always love u"
i just want to be happy with you
"dear self, one day i’ll make u proud"
"i don't hate you, i hate what you did"
happy memories can make you sad
don’t force anyone to appreciate you
"really, i'm afraid to lose you"
i wish every notification is from you
Deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
mood: to be with you rn
Everything happens for a reason
Life’s better when nobody knows anything about you.
Be thankful for the real ones in your life.
Love is not a reason to tolerate disrespect.
Hate is heavy. Let it go.
"Losing someone who doesn’t appreciate you is a gain, not a loss."
a smile hides a thousand tears and a broken heart.
disappointed but not surprised.
"maybe i don’t cry, but it hurts.  maybe i won’t say, but i feel.  maybe i don’t show, but i care."
sending warm hugs to those who feel sad and empty.
Don’t be afraid to fail. Be afraid not to try
"If you can only read my mind, you’ll definitely understand everything I feel"
I love you ♥️
one mistake broke everything
i always cry in silence
"removing myself from situations where i don’t feel loved, appreciated, or respected."
so hard to trust people nowadays.
i gave wrong people the right pieces of me.
"That feeling when you're not necessarily sad, but you just feel really empty."
Make sure the person you’re choosing over everybody is choosing you too.
the fight between your heart &amp; your mind ain’t no joke
"if you don't know the whole story, shut up."
eye contact with same feelings
tbh telling someone how you feel is honestly the hardest thing ever
i wanna sit on a rooftop with someone  and talk about all my feelings with them.
don’t use someone to forget someone.
i never faked my love to someone.
You are my 11:11 wish.
"so young, so damaged."
"I love you, that means I’m not just here for the pretty parts and the happy days. I’m here for the rough and the bad days. I’m here no matter what."
Love should heal you and not hurt you.
Pretending to be okay was never easy.
Cuddling with you would be so perfect right now
"Dear heart, thank you for being so strong."
sleepless nights and endless thoughts
I know how ugly I am.
Idc about losing people anymore.
I can't unlove you.
"Due to personal reasons, I need a hug."
I wish I can just disappear.
Take a rest but don't give up.
somewhere between sad and tired
Kiss me when I get jealous.
Been so down lately.
Please be afraid to lose me.
The worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why.
Cold replies fucks my mood.
Overthinking leads to negative thoughts.
"go     for           someone              who            is       not  only  proud         to           have               you,                  but            will         also     risk  anything     just         to           keep               you"
just want to delete everything
"every text i get, i always hope it's you"
you’re the reason why i’m happy
"i forgive, but i never trust again"
"you are enough, you are worth it"
"you broke me, but i still wait for you"
i lie when i say i don't get jealous
please don’t fake your feelings
i wanna see u and hug u so bad
ur my happpiness please stay
"yes it hurts, but im used to it"
everytime i see u i fall in love again
i hope you realize how hard i'm trying
i'm okay but i didn't say i'm happy
my silence is my expression of my pain
so tired of being sad all the time
fake happiness is the worst sadness
"if i stopped annoying you, u lost me"
my eyes are craving to see you
sometimes i really need to kill my mind
"i dont share whats mine, never"
i want someone to take care of me
if they love you they’ll never hurt you
i don’t get jealous i get uninterested
i hate that every song reminds me of u
lost myself trying to find someone else
my main goal right now is to be happy
I miss how we used to talk every minute of every day &amp; how I was able to tell you everything that was on my mind. I miss our conversations.
"I'm not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am."
I appreciate long text messages
"I don't have a type. If I like you, I like you."
Parents notice your fake friends before you do
"l love you, but I hate you. I miss you, but I'm better off without you. I want you out of my life, but I never want to let you go"
I want my first marriage to be my ONLY marriage.
"Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you"
Apologizing doesn't always mean you're wrong and the other person is right. It means you value your relationship more than your ego.
Guys have no idea how long something they said can stay in a girl's mind.
I wish I could take a break from my own thoughts
"The couples that are meant to be, are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart, and come out even stronger."
I just want perfect skin and hair and teeth and body proportions and endless supplies of money and intelligence is that too much to ask for
Be with someone who knows exactly what they have when they have you. Not someone who'll realize it when they've lost you.
I want a relationship that lasts.
Missing someone who doesn't miss you back in return is probably one of the worst feelings anyone can feel.
"Girls have periods, cramps, babies, and everything else. the least a guy could do is text us first"
My life. My choices. My mistakes. My lessons.
You can delete pictures but it wont delete the memories.
Don't give up hope. Things always have a way of working out.
"Never call a girl ugly, even if you're just joking."
Sleeping is so hard when you can't stop thinking.
"I like someone, they like someone else. Story of my life."
to feel unwanted is the worse thing
that grow and learn together type of love
"i'm sorry for the pain, that i caused"
"success takes time, don't give up"
i pray that everything gets back to normal
"i need more happiness, sleep and peace"
"i'm not feeling okay, but it's fine"
i hate that i distance when i'm sad
all i want a day without sadness
i will never be the same as before
my biggest fear is losing my loved ones
there’s so much i want to say to you
keeping everything as a secret is better
every minute i have a different feeling
i hate feeling like i’m being ignored
Treat me like a queen and I'll treat you like a king. Treat me like a game an I'll show you how it's played.
Why can’t things that are good stay?
"I could never hurt you, the way you hurt me."
Maybe it’s not always about trying to fix something broken. Maybe it’s about starting over and creating something better.
What do you do when the only one who can make you stop crying is the one who is making you cry?
"This is the problem with getting attached to someone. When they leave, you just feel lost."
I don’t know how to deal with you being gone. I’m not doing well.
"I tried to forget you, but the harder I tried, the more I thought about you."
I lost everyone I thought I’d never lose.
Imagine how heartbreaking it must be to suddenly stop talking to the person you thought you’d marry.
unfortunately i don’t care anymore
u are the story that i never want to end
i’m so bad at starting conversations
im too young to be this stressed
"if you don't appreciate me, i'm gone"
"i still miss u, i still want u, i still love u"
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
Don’t show so much of love on anyone because it creates a non-curable pain when they avoid you.
"I wish I had the guts to walk away and forget about what we had, but I can’t because I know you won’t come after me and that’s what hurts the most."
Even a strong woman gets tired.
You lose yourself trying to hold on to someone who doesn’t care about losing you.
One bad relationship could make you never want to fall in love again.
"You don't need a perfect boyfriend. All you need is one who loves your weirdness, wants to spend time with you &amp; respects you."
"She’s hurt, mentally and emotionally. But everyday, she walks with a smile, because that’s who she is, the girl who never stopped smiling"
"I'm going to smile like nothing is wrong, talk like everything is perfect, act like it's all a dream, and pretend like it's not hurting me."
I miss laughing with you.
"Sometimes a girl keeps going back to a guy who treats her bad, because she's not ready to give up hope that maybe someday he'll change."
"I wanted to text you, but then I remembered we don't talk anymore."
"Parents, problems, friends, fakes, love, crush, dating, responsibility, drama, heartache, failures, stress, happiness. It's life."
it’s hard to sleep with a heavy heart
another night، same shit، same mood
"After someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore.."
H.o.m.e.w.o.r.k = Half of my energy wasted on random knowledge
"I need a hug. No, actually, I need your hug."
"At the end of the day, it's always you."
"The girl who laughs and talks a lot and seems very happy, is also the girl who may cry herself to sleep."
Everybody has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were.
"I don't understand our relationship. Sometimes, we're friends. Sometimes, we're more then friends. Other times, I'm just a stranger to you."
Do you ever just want to pack up and leave out of the blue without saying anything to anyone like just leave and start a new life
"Go for someone who is not only proud to have you, but will also take every risk just to be with you."
"Hearing ""I miss you"" from the right person is a great feeling."
"At this point I don't even care. I'm just going with the flow. Whatever happens, happens."
i choose you and i’ll keep choosing you
trust me i want you and only you
yes i over-think but i always over-love
you’re the only one i’ll do my best to keep
can i rewind back to where i was happy?
leaving without an explanation hurts
Stay strong. Even when it feels like everything is falling apart..
I wish guys would realize that the little things mean the most to us. If you just show us that you genuinely care it will make us so happy.
"I cared, you didn't. I cried, you laughed. I was hurt, you smiled. I moved on, you realized what you had. Too late."
"Out of all the things I've ever done, meeting you was one of the best."
"We aren't dating, but I'm afraid of someone new getting close to you."
"Every girl is beautiful. Sometimes, it just takes the right guy to see it."
"Truth is, I miss you. All the time. Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Everyday."
"sometimes, i'm tired of being nice"
i want you to stay and never go away
me to everything lately: “whatever”
i had a lot to say but i choose to be quiet
give me attention before i lose interest
wish i could erase some memories
i overthink too much and that shit hurt
i still remember our first conversation
"for me, there’s you and nobody else"
"When I say ""I won't tell anyone"" my best friend doesn't count"
People change like the seasons
If someone seriously wants to be a part of your life they will seriously make an effort to be in it. no reasons no excuses.
"Bro, you don't have to be rich to be romantic. All it takes is a little effort to show her that you really care."
It's hard to forget someone who gave you so many things to remember.
I wish I was better at telling people how I really feel.
"I will never say ""I love you"" unless I mean it 100%"
"Stay strong, life is hard but believe that there's always a rainbow after every storm."
"I've changed? No... I just grew up. I stopped letting people push me aroundI learned that I can't always be happy, I accepted reality."
"I can't promise that things will be perfect, but I swear I'll never leave."
it’s sad to see a good person change
pretty eyes. pretty heart. pretty soul
3 types of people in life: • who helped you in difficult times • who left you in difficult times • who put you in difficult times..
i get attached to everything i can’t have
a lot of feelings but nothing to say
if i show u my soft side my heart is yours
i just need to hear ur voice and sleep
can i skip being sad and just be happy
"sometimes, prayer is all you need"
music and late night conversation
i never wanna see you with another
i wanna be that person u’r scared to lose
"Right person, wrong time. I hate that."
"If you focus too much on the painful past, you'll miss the beautiful future."
"i need a hug right now, a long tight hug"
"I want a relationship where everyone is like ''damn, they're still together?''"
I kinda like someone who gets jealous &amp; protective but still trusts me.
I need you more than you need me and I hate it.
"You're the only one who can make me smile with a simple ""hi""."
I wish I could take a break from my own thoughts
"""I love you"" and ""I'm in love with you"" are two totally different things.."
It doesn't matter who hurt you or broke you down. What matters is who made you smile again.
I almost wish we never met.
"Something I learned about people... If they do it once, they'll do it again."
Open your mind before your mouth.
"i miss ur smile, ur face, ur hugs. i miss u"
"stop asking if im okay, im tired of lying"
i love people who make me feel special
i wanna vibe with you all day &amp; night
"we might not talk everyday, but i love u"
not in the mood for anything but you
i wanna hug you until i get enough
my life: 50% sleeping &amp; 50% twitter
my eyes want to see you the most
"we fight, we fix and stay, that’s maturity"
i look okay but deep inside im broken
tired of being the one who keeps trying
overthinking kills relationships
it is difficult to explain so i stay quiet
"keep it private, people love to ruin things"
show me how much i mean to you
can't stop looking at your pictures
i want a life full of memories with you
you're my favorite part of the day
im sensitive please be gentle with me
best friends hug is always different
crying from jealousy is a painful feeling
i miss my friends so so so so much
i need someone like me in my life
i appreciate people that ask about me
miss being a little kid with no worries
sleep is the best way to escape feelings
sucks when your effort is ignored
no one understands what im feeling atm
"i still like you, i just got tired of trying"
i love having someone to talk to all night
"after all of this, i'm trying to be okay"
you're my happiness when i'm sad
"i can’t replace you, no one is you"
i promise you i care more than i show
Being ignored is honestly the worst feeling ever.
"Sometimes, I wonder what goes through your head when you hear my name..."
"Believe with your eyes, not with your ears."
About 98% of the contacts in my phone are useless
Please don't be in love with someone else.
"Being strong doesn't mean you'll never get hurt. It means that even when you do get hurt, you'll never let it defeat you."
"When a girl cries, it's not usually over one thing. It's built up anger and emotions that she's been holding in for too long.."
"Being called ""babe or baby"" is just a good feeling. 😍😘"
"I say ""I'm done😠"" but in all honesty a simple ""I miss you""😔 could change that in a heart beat."
my mood can change for no reason
real ones will always be there for you
can we go back the time we are happy
i’m really bad at expressing my feelings
damn i miss my fav person so much
in the mood for disappearing for a while
"""auto silent"" when i'm in bad mood"
only my close friends know the real me
"i hate waiting, but i'll wait for you"
i want to delete all the memories with u
every minute i have a different feeling
please be safe i care about you a lot
i want someone i can talk to all day
you’re the only person i wanna see
hard to find someone loyal these days
i hate pretending like it doesn’t hurt
there’s a lot in my heart but i can’t say
endless love for that one person
sometimes i think about u and smile
"The only reason why people hold onto memories is because memories are the only things that don't change, even when people do."
praying for a better tomorrow
"share everything with me, i care"
"i was hurt too, but im always silent"
music and late night conversation
I'm really hoping something good happens between us.
You gotta fight for what you want.
"You treat me like an option, I'll leave you like a choice."
"I seriously over think everything, which makes me stress myself out and create problems that weren't even there in the first place"
I want a relationship where we can be boring as hell around each other and still be completely okay with that
i hope tomorrow is a better day
Learn to let go. Not everyone in your life is meant to stay.
"Once you've been hurt, you're so scared to get attached again. You have this fear that everyone you like is gonna break your heart."
I'm a lazy texter. I read a text and I forget to even reply. If I text you 24/7 then you must be freaking special.
"When you really care about someone, their happiness matters more than yours."
"Tell her she's beautiful, not ""hot."" She's a person, not a temperature."
I only want 3 things: See you. Hug you. Kiss you.
"If you don't care, stop talking about it."
I don’t need expensive stuff to make me happy. All I need is someone who’s always there even when the whole world’s walking out.
I'll always be there when you need me and I hope you'll do the same.
I forgive but I never forget.
"A jealous girlfriend, is a faithful girlfriend."
"People come and go in your life, and the right ones will always stay."
Be real with me or just leave me alone.
"You really piss me off sometimes, but that won't ever change my feelings for you."
"Don't make a promise unless you can keep it, don’t say something unless you mean it, don't act out unless it’s needed."
My sleeping schedule is so messed up.
I love a person that understands me 100%.
I love hearing old songs I used to love. They’re like memories you can always go back to.
"My life. My choices. My problems. My mistakes. My lessons. Not your business, mind your own problems before you talk about mine."
I want you. Simple as that.
The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. And the kindest hearts have felt the most pain.
i wanna be someone’s first choice
a message from u changes my mood
"to my special someone, i miss you"
i need someone who never change
i don’t want us to be strangers again
mine or not i’ll always be there for u
so many different mood in one day
i hate it when i can't control my tears
maybe one day someone will come into my life and actually mean what they say
i won't be surprised when the next person hurts me. i'm so used to it now
"i know that im a nice person, but some people just bring out the worst side of me"
nobody seems to appreciate the love i give
realized that i don't really matter to anyone
I like those people you can joke around with and have so much fun with and then have a deep conversation with and it’s not weird at all
I miss having a life without stress.
Hiding ur feelings really hurt.
The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. And the kindest hearts have felt the most pain.
"We all need someone to talk to, someone who listens, someone who understands."
I say I don't care. I say I don't miss you. But I know I'm lying and I really do love you.
You are my favorite hello and my hardest goodbye. ❤
"I'm a girl. I don't smoke, drink or party every weekend. I don't sleep around or start drama to get attention. And yes, we still do exist."
"If you need me, call me.I don't care if I'm: - sleeping- having my own problems- angry with you.I'll be there for you."
"As you start and end your day, be thankful for every little thing in your life. You will come to realize how blessed you truly are."
"Stop letting it bother you, just let it go."
"Saying ""I'm tired"" when you're actually sad."
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you &amp; smile.
"As long as you're still the same person I fell for, my feelings won't ever change"
I'm single but I know exactly who I want.
i hate being lied too that shit hurts
"kinda have feelings, kinda heartless"
one unexpected message can heal a lot
feeling that i’m not good enough
i want u to know that i'll always care
i saw your bad side but still love you
you’re my favorite person to talk to
aint attractive but i can make u smile
"I get jealous. Don't touch, talk to, or flirt with what's mine."
i wish i could unmeet some people
everyone leaves in the end anyway
keeping myself busy to forget you
"once you lose me, u lost me forever"
i wanna mute my overthinking
i’m just tired of everything and everyone
i'm sorry for being a moody person
i smile because i need to be strong
i wanna meet someone exactly like me
"always remember, iloveyou everyday"
"When trust is broken, sorry means nothing."
A kiss on the forehead is one of the sweetest thing in the world.
"Go for someone who is not only proud to have you, but will also take every risk just to be with you."
"Sometimes all you need, is someone who can make you smile."
"Dear God, I wanna take a minute, not to ask for anything from you. But simply to say thank you, for all I have."
I wish I could turn back time to when everything was perfect.
"Honestly, I always feel jealous whenever you give someone the kind of attention that I want from you."
So many friendships end with “we just stopped talking”.
"I say ""Alright"" ""Whatever"" or ""I guess"" when I don't feel like arguing."
"You are the first thing I think of every morning, the last thing that stays on my mind every night."
"When a girl cries, it's not usually over one thing. It's built up anger and emotions that she's been holding in for too long.."
"The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes &amp; weaknesses, but still thinks you're completely amazing."
Don't let someone who is no longer in your life continue to run your life.
I hate how I let the dumbest things bother me sometimes.
Short girls love hugging tall guys.
"When two people really care about each other, they always find a way to make it work. No matter how hard it is."
A jealous woman does better research than the FBI.
"I love my mom no matter what goes through, no matter how much we argue, because I know, at the end, she'll always gonna be there."
Don't stress over people in your past. There's a reason why they didn't make it to your future.
"Yes, I'm thinking about you right now."
"When you really love someone, even if there are a million reasons to leave, you still look for that one reason to stay."
I shouldn't be jealous. You aren't even mine.
Everything is funnier when you're with your bestfriend.
Smile. Why? Because it makes you attractive. It changes your mood. It relieves stress. And it helps you stay positive.
"I’d rather look back at my life and say “I can’t believe I did that“, rather than saying “I wish I did that“."
"If you care about me, act like it."
I lose interest when I get ignored.
It hurts when you have someone in your heart but you can't have them in your arms.
Don't ever give up on something or someone that you can't go a full day without thinking about.
"If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost."
My feelings confuse me sometimes.
"I want you to be happy, but I want you to be happy with me."
i should have hugged you harder the last time I saw you
teach me the art of letting go
hopeless but still hoping
one day you'll miss me as i missed u
i forget my sadness when i talk to u
"im sorry, im really sorry for being me"
i still remember our first conversation
one smile from you can fix my day
"i want ""delete sadness"" button"
i just want a day without overthinking
i wish you wanted me like i want you
i just want a long hug till i feel better
i always hide what hurts me the most
tbh my overthinking kills my own mood
can i get a “hey i miss you ” from you?
Reading old messages and wondering where it all changed.
"Forgive, yes. Forget, never"
Please don't be in love with someone else.
"Yes, I made a mistake. No, you don't need to keep bringing it up."
"I didn't choose to fall in love with you, my heart did."
"When a girl is quiet, millions of things are running through her mind."
"I'm going to smile like nothing is wrong, talk like everything is perfect, act like it's all a dream, and pretend like it's not hurting me."
I'll never forget the first time I saw you.
My biggest problem is that:  I give people chance.  After chance.. After chance.. After chance.. After chance.. After chance..
"I wanted to text you but, I don't want to annoy you,.."
I don't really talk to a lot of people anymore
One mistake and everyone judges you.
"I don't know what my future holds, but I'm hoping you're in it."
"Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person"
"I don't care how we met, I'm just happy we did."
i don’t want us to be strangers again
your happiness is my happiness too
"sometimes, it's better to remain silent"
"we might not talk everyday, but i love u"
need someone who care about me
jealousy can ruin my mood easily
i really need some people to unknow me
"Smiling outside, dying inside."
Why does everything hurt so much lately.
Sometimes I wish you were in my place just to know how I feel.
"I've been hurt, but I'll be okay. I've been lied to, but I'll trust again. I've been heartbroken, but I can still love."
I'm feeling hopeless again.
I stay up late some nights just thinking about you.
Sometimes you try so hard to take care of everyone else that you forget to take care of yourself.
Treat me right and I'll treat you better.
"""Never say goodbye, because goodbye means going away, and going away means forgetting."" - Peter Pan"
I dislike people who act different in front of certain people
"She's not mad, she's hurt. There's a difference."
"Yes, I'm jealous but I keep it inside."
"I just want one relationship, with no cheating, no lying, no ex's getting in the way."
"I hate that feeling. The feeling when you're sad and you have no idea why, but you just are."
"I might not text you first, but that doesn't mean im not dying to talk to you."
Don't ruin other people's happiness just because you can't find your own.
"Once you find someone who can make you laugh uncontrollably, hang onto that person, because they will make you happy."
I think it's cute when you know that someone is making an effort to make you smile.
"Just remember, I was there when no one else was."
A perfect relationship to me = Two people never giving up on each other.
Not talking to you kills me.
"Learn to appreciate what you have, before time makes you appreciate what you had."
"Girls are sensitive, they overthink every little thing and they care way more than they should, but that’s what makes their love so strong"
I hate how jealous i get over you
"If your girlfriend is pretty and many guys want her, that's another reason to keep her and treat her right. You got what they can't have"
We used to talk for hours. Look at us now.
"I wanna write ""I miss you"" on a rock and throw it at your face so you know how much it hurts to miss you."
Admit it. You like someone you can't have.
"Sometimes a ""sorry"" just isn't enough."
Everyone can make you smile but not everyone can make you happy.
"If someone really loves you, they will never hurt you. And if they do, you'll see that in their eyes, they're hurting too."
"You know you miss someone, when as soon as something good happens, they're the first person you want to share it with"
"So I kinda, sorta, maybe like you a little more than I originally planned."
"Just because a relationship ends, doesn't mean two people stopped loving each other. Sometimes, they just stopped hurting each other"
Have you ever been so sad that you can’t even cry you just sit there and think about how sad you are
Don't lose yourself trying to love someone.
"Just because someone isn't in my life anymore, doesn't mean the memories about them aren't in my heart."
I’m really tired of having feelings.
"My problem is I can't stay mad. I always end up forgiving people, even when they don't deserve it."
A kiss on the forehead is one of the sweetest things in the world.
A real boyfriend: - calls you for nothing - texts you all the time - wants to see you - gets jealous - is overprotective - loves you
You shouldn’t judge me by my past. I don’t live there anymore.
"no girl wants to hear about your ""other girls""."
It's hard to love someone secretly.
I want a relationship where we can be boring as hell around each other and still be completely okay with that
I spend 90% of my life on twitter
"When two people are meant for each other, no time is too long, no distance is too far, and no one can ever tear them apart."
"Dear family, Just because I'm laughing when I'm reading a text, does not mean I'm flirting with someone."
Shy people usually end up being some of the coolest people you know after you start talking to them.
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay."
"One day, all this pain will make sense to you."
I told myself I deserve better. Maybe one day I'll get better.
let the pain teach you how to be strong
"""why are you sad?""   i don't know anymore"
"tired of wishing, i wanna start having"
"i want you to be by my side, always"
listening to music &amp; thinking of you
i need to rest my mind from everything
looking at you gives me happiness
if i reply fast just know you're special
i wanna be kissed &amp; hugged by you
I hate it when memories hits me.
My life needs to get refreshed
Wish if I could block my feelings
I wanna hug you until I get enough
My tweets are messages for you
Be patient. Good things come to those who wait.
Long hugs save souls.
continue to forgive. continue to grow. continue to love.
Not everything has to make sense. Just let it go. Always choose peace.
"It’s okay to be different, it’s okay to be you."
stop trying to press rewind. It's life... not a movie.
"life teaches you to be strong, all by yourself."
Self love is a daily commitment.
No one needs to know. Just do your thing &amp; be happy.
"always be in love w/ a soul, not a face."
Your privacy is your peace.
"Smaller circle, higher value."
vibe alone until you're valued.
"One thing about me. . .i notice weird vibes, bad energy, and sneaky shit."
"Life goes on. And so, the healing process continues..."
Your presence can give happiness. I hope you remember that.
Everything is great when you dont give a shit.
What people think of you is not equivalent to who you are.
stay positive. be happy. live free.
Hugging you is therapy
Different is attractive.
"Dear self, we going to make it."
I prefer a small circle and a lot of privacy.
What you prayed for is coming to you soon.
Mindset matters a lot. You better improve it.
All our clocks are different. Your time is coming.
Train your brain to handle your emotions.
I'm proud because I survived when I thought I wouldn't.
I like me better with no feelings.
Note to self: Stop trying so hard for people who don’t care.
"Stay a mystery, it's better that way."
Don’t sacrifice too much for others and treasure yourself more.
Better to vibe alone than w/ fakes.
"Forever humble because what God gives, he can also take."
Patience will bring you everything you ever wanted.
Ignore those who judge. Just keep moving forward.
When you learn to spend a good time with yourself. You learn to spend a good time with others.
Praying that the future me will be happy.
Mindset is my biggest priority rn.
Letting them realize is better than revenge.
Life is what you risk.
Watch how they get mad when you don't let them use you.
"Some deserve good vibes, others deserve good byes."
They think I'm quiet but really I'm observing.
Better times are just around the corner.
i can't explain the way i'm missing you
"instead of telling u how i feel , i tweet"
i really want to hug you but u r so far
Need someone who care about me
i wish some things never changed
i just want a day without overthinking
there’s a lot in my heart but i can’t say
"i hate waiting, but i'll wait for you"
current mood: i wanna talk with you
feeling unwanted changes u a lot
i want someone who only wants me
I feel unappreciated but it's okay
i'll just hide this pain until i feel okay
"i know everything, i’m just quiet"
i just don't want to get hurt again
Loving myself makes me stronger
i can’t control my feelings over you
I actually take relationships seriously.
It's hard to love someone secretly.
"When two people are meant for each other, no time is too long, no distance is too far, and no one can ever tear them apart."
"When someone likes you, they'll text you a lot, stay up every night with you, compliment you, and always have time for you."
"I've lived I've loved I've lost I've missed I've hurt I've trusted I've made mistakes but most of all, I've learned."
I don't hate you. I'm just tired of loving you so much and knowing you'll never feel the same.
"Tell your girl you love her for no reason. You shouldn't need a reason to love her, and care for her &amp; assure her that she's YOURS."
A jealous girl is a faithful girl.
i need you here by my side
Every night I miss you.
The worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why.
Always thinking of you.
"Please stay, even at my bad times."
Trying to fix myself.
In the end it’s always you.
Can I hug u until I feel okay?
Note to self: let shit go.
Sigh. I wanna be okay.
I hate being jealous.
Im annoying as fuck.
I miss how interested you were in me.
I hate myself so easily.
"Hi life, please stop breaking me."
Fast replies are so attractive.
"dear heart, please keep me strong"
"i'm not weak, i just cry when i'm hurt"
i hate how sensitive of a person i am
never wanted perfect always wanted real
"if I get mad at you, that means i care"
"people always leave, i am used to it"
I’m still trying to be happy and fine
"instead of telling u how i feel , i tweet"
"Once i lose interest, everything changes"
"i care about you a lot, stay safe"
I'm lucky to have someone like you
the way i smile when i think about you
"My heart is full of you, always will be"
I am okay &amp; not okay at the same time
"i dont want others attention, i want yours"
i want to love you without getting hurt
talking to you makes everything better
take me back to the last time we met
Sometimes you just need to wait and pray...
"sometimes,  you just have to stay silent, because no words can explain  what’s going  on in your mind"
my mood changes in 0.5 seconds
true friends are always there for you
eyes talk better than words sometimes
Take me back to the good old days
my thoughts always destroy my mood
I act like nothing happened when it hurts
i wish i can hug u whenever i miss you
you’re the one i’d do my best to keep
it's hard for me to stay away from you
I'm too young for this painful shit
i appreciate honesty more than anything
"i'm tired, but im still trying my best"
my mind is full of unwanted thoughts
i miss having someone to talk to all night
it’s hard for me to express what i feel
I’m the happiest me when I’m with you
Wish I could fix all the mistakes that I did
i forget my sadness when i talk to u
"i love you, stay safe where ever u are"
"i just care too much, that’s how i am"
i hope you never get tired of me
"missing the same person, everyday."
My only wish is to be with u forever
i’m too young to overthink everything
"i'm not sad or happy, i'm just okay"
you're my favorite part of the day
"i miss you. but its okay, i’m fine"
no matter what i will still love you
I feel empty when you're not with me
million feelings for one special person
i love seeing the ones i love happy
i’ll always have you in my prayers
you stole my heart take care of it
i see something in you that i can’t explain
one conversation can fix so much
you will always be my special person
"i want you, i need you, i miss you"
im tired of being tired of being tired
I just want to stop thinking and sleep.
"if i care for you, i care until the end"
i want to spend all my time with you
"Somehow, God will fix everything"
"i was hurt too, but i'm always silent"
i wanna see you and hug you so bad
I never faked my love to someone.
I’m not good at telling people how i feel
i wish i could unmeet some people
mixed feelings &amp; unsaid thoughts
i need to sleep to forget everything
so many different mood in one day
i just want to end this sadness rn
I hope everything becomes better
"once i care about u, i will never stop"
I need someone to make me feel okay
i want to delete everything now
i miss how happy we were together
i wish i can repeat that moment
appreciate what you have right now because you don't always get a second chance.
i need you here by my side
you stole my heart since day one
i should have hugged you harder the last time I saw you
tears are words the heart can’t say.
"the more you love, the more it hurts"
"when you feel so much, you just cry"
"missing you right now,but I can't do anything about it"
you don't know how much you mean to me
life is full of regret
these feelings won’t go away easily
"to be honest, you're the only one i've ever spent this much time and effort on."
i can't imagine living a happy life without you being a part of it
thinking of you... again
when we first met I honestly had no idea you would be so important to me
never miss an opportunity to tell someone how much they mean to you
you are my everything
appreciate me before im gone
"my mistake was making you a priority, when I was your second choice"
don't lie to me to protect my feelings
it hurts the most when the person that made you feel so special yesterday makes you feel so unwanted today
"trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller and smaller after every mistake"
sometimes we create our own heartbreaks through expectations
i feel like i’m waiting on something that ain’t gonna happen
my special talent is getting sad at night
can’t get u out of my mind
stay with me
"i don’t deserve you, you’re too good for me,i’m just nothing"
eventually a day to smile will come
I'm a person who couldnt stop loving once i started.
"Pretending to be happy when you are in pain, is just an example of how strong you are as a person."
It hurts when you have someone in your heart but can’t have in your arms.
"This is the problem with getting attached to someone. When they leave, you just feel lost."
Even a strong woman gets tired.
I learned that people leave. Even if they have promised a thousand times that they won’t.
I am not the same person I once was.
I hate that I’m still hoping.
Moving on is not easy.
One day you’re going to wake up and realize that you should have tried.
Sometimes ignoring is the best way to pretend that you are not affected from things that hurts you secretly.
"Letting go doesn't mean giving up, but rather accepting that there are things that cannot be."
"It's sad how someone can go from being the reason you wake up smiling, to the reason you cry yourself to sleep."
"And in the end it's not the people you miss., it’s the memories."
"Never let to know the reason of your sadness to others, they won’t get it."
Missing someone and not being able to see them is the worst feeling ever.
"Trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller and smaller after every mistake."
All I need is a hug from u.
Sometimes I hate myself.
I miss you so much rn.
People will see your success but they won’t see your struggle.
"I try not to miss you, I try to let you go, but in the end, you're always on my mind."
I want to block my feelings.
Idc about losing people anymore.
I can't unlove you.
"I never changed, I just see shit differently now."
I hide my jealousy with a smile.
I wish I can just disappear.
In the end it’s always you.
Trying to fix myself.
trapped inside my head
The worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why.
i be so in love with the fake scenarios i create in my head.
fuck all these relationship goals just get someone you can vibe with and be yourself around without having to stress about shit
my only enemy is my inner me
REPEAT AFTER ME: I am allowed to do what’s BEST for me even if it upsets other people
The people who truly care will always find a way back into your life.
"Sometimes you have to forget how you feel, and remember what you deserve."
"If you stay, stay forever. If you go, do it today. If you change, change for the better. If you talk, make sure you mean what you say."
"Whatever you do, never run back to what broke you."
"The older you get, the fewer people you trust."
"Life is weird. You can go from being strangers, to being friends, to being more than friends, to being practically strangers again."
"Nobody wants to hear this, but sometimes the person you want most, is the person you're best without."
"Work hard in silence, let your success be your noise."
Happiness can be found when you stop comparing yourself to other people.
Sleep + Music = 2 ways to escape everything.
Strangers can become best friends just as easy as best friends can become strangers.
Travel. As much as you can. As far as you can. As long as you can. Life’s not meant to be lived in one place.
Don't promise when you're happy. Don't reply when you're angry. Don't decide when you're sad.
Surround yourself with people who bring out the happiness in you.
Damn. I'm so into you.
I care but usually I don't show it.
I hate myself so easily.
"Strong mind, fragile heart."
"Don't make life too stressful. Always find time to laugh. It may not add years to your life, but it adds more life to your years."
Worry less. Smile more. Listen carefully. Take responsibility. Accept what you can't change. Embrace the lessons. Love your life.
Happiness isn’t getting what we want but being satisfied with what we have. The way to be happy is to be grateful even with the simple blessings we have.
"When you have found a reason to walk away, never look back. Just keep walking. For it is better to get lost moving on than to get stuck and stranded broken."
"Sometimes it is better to be alone, because you are more assured that no one would hurt you."
"Every text I get, I always hope it's you."
I really do forget to text people back sometimes.
I cry when I'm angry &amp; that's the very worst thing because you're trying to act tough and mean but instead you cry
"I care too much, that's how I get hurt."
"I'm at that point where I don't even care if people like me anymore. If you like me, cool. If you don't, okay."
"I will never say ""I love you"" unless I mean it 100%"
"If a girl texts you first, you better feel special."
"You meet someone, and you don't really notice how special they are until suddenly they're all you think about."
"If two people are meant to be together, they will eventually find their way back into each other's arms, no matter what."
"I miss our long talks. Your smell, your smile your laugh, your kisses your hugs I wish I could have them back."
my attitude is based on how YOU treat ME.
"In life, you'll realize that there is a purpose for every person you meet. Some will teach you, and some will bring out the best in you"
"Sometimes, I think you forget that I have feelings too."
"No calls, no texts, nothing. But here I am thinking about you like crazy."
"Every girl has her bestfriend, boyfriend, and true love. But you're really lucky if they're all the same person"
"Good morning texts, Forehead kisses, Really long goodbyes, Holding hands, Silence that isn't awkward &amp; Waking up beside you Thats all I want"
Everybody has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were.
"I really hate that ""not good enough"" feeling.✋😔"
"Admit it, you're afraid to text him/her first sometimes because you feel like you're annoying them."
The best feeling in the world is being loved back by the person you love.
"If I open up to you, then you're probably special."
I forgive but I never forget.
I'm not addicted to texting. I'm addicted to the person I'm texting
I like getting paragraph texts
Your mental health should be a priority.
normalize avoiding people who aren’t good for your mental health.
I don’t know what this lil girl is going through but 🤡SAME🤡
The ugliest thing u can do is bring up someone’s past when they’ve changed.
i pray my friends get through the battles that they don't tell me about
Sometimes You expect too much from someone because you’d do that much for them.
Please take care of yourself.
i appreciate people checking up on me.
"Lord, please clear my mind from overthinking. i’m tired."
It’s time to turn your pain into peace.
"if you need me, i'm here. if you don't, i'm still here."
"Don't rush things, trust God."
"I love sleep. You forget about pain, problems, stress, everything for a while."
I’m always thankful for the good people around me.
Learn how to comfort yourself because no one will do it for you.
"To be happy, you need to be strong."
Take me back to the good old days.
Self improvement is my biggest priority.
"I pretend like i don’t care, but you’re stuck in my head."
"When I am alone, I overthink. And that's why I hurt myself with my own thoughts."
"i never fake my tears, so when it falls, i’m really hurt."
Stay away from those people who only talk to you when they need you.
don’t ever compare me to someone else.
"Relationships are so scary to me... No matter how good things are going or how in love you are, your significant other could always just lose feelings for you and be gone just like that."
ignore people who ignores you.
music heals me every time.
"i want you, i need you, i miss you."
"Cry now, make yourself better later."
"Love isn't always happy, sometimes it's painful."
"Little things mean the most, always."
"When i’m really done, I leave in silence. I only fight when i care."
I can feel myself losing interest in everything.
I need someone who can love me when I’m at my worst
may you receive what you’ve been praying for.
"Dear me, I'll make you proud one day."
Take me back to the days where I sleep without overthinking.
"In the end, promises are just words."
I want to be free in this toxic world.
Take me back to the days where I sleep without overthinking.
sometimes it feels better not to talk.
i'm both clingy and bully when i'm comfortable with the person.
"im tired , im stress, im hurt, but im fine"
not proud of my actions recently but i'm really trying to be better.
"If it makes you feel like shit, walk away."
Not everyone will like you. That’s life.
“I’m still waiting for the plot twist of this year.”
I still smile although I feel pain.
Taking a risk is better than regretting.
trying to be better everyday.
"A year ago, everything was different. And now I look back I realized that a year can do a lot to a person."
i appreciate people checking up on me.
sleeping after crying hits so different.
Mentally and physically tired.
You deserve to be happy.
Never give up on things that make you happy.
"“Learn to love yourself first, before others.”"
"“If you break someone’s heart and they still talk to you with the same excitement and respect. believe me, they really love you.”"
Please be safe i care about you a lot.
"Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down."
Be with someone who loves you harder on the day you can’t love yourself at all.
"Pain changes people, but it also makes them stronger."
It’s crazy how fast everything can change.
"When you ignore me, you’re teaching me how to live without you."
Continue to grow even you're alone.
Never regret a day in your life. Bad days give you experience and good days give you happiness.
"I prayed for you, your happiness."
"My life isn't perfect, but I'm thankful for everything I have."
I prefer being lowkey and private.
Having a trust issue is not easy.
"One day, i'm gonna have everything i prayed for."
"I just wanna flex God, He never left me."
"When you feel like quitting, think about why you started it."
Be yourself; everyone else is taken.
Making mistakes is better than faking perfections.
"I’m a big fan of back hugs, tight hugs and forehead kisses."
Sometimes I enjoy being alone.
You will be happy again like before.
"All of my friends have a place in my heart, old or new they’re all special."
"Happy times come and go, but the memories stay forever"
"“Lord, hold me when I do not know where I’m going.”"
"Relationships are so scary to me... No matter how good things are going or how in love you are, your significant other could always just lose feelings for you and be gone just like that."
"Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one..."
i need someone who never change
Bad things happen: - Every day. - To everyone. The difference is in how people deal with it.
"Do not be embarrassed by your failures, learn from them and start again"
Note to self: No matter how hard it gets you got to keep going.
I‘m too young to overthink.
"one day, i'm gonna have everything i prayed for."
Sleeping is hard when you can‘t stop thinking.
songs explain what i can’t explain
I hate how sensitive I am sometimes.
"My life, my choices, my mistakes, my lessons. Not your business."
Stay away from those people who only talk to you when they need you.
praying for better days.
I just need one person who will never give up on me.
"no rush, we will get the love that we deserve."
"Being compared to others? Yes, I hate that a lot."
"Make me feel special, that’s all I want."
"Trust me, family problems can kill all of your happiness."
"Life imposes things on you that you can’t control, but you still have the choice of how you’re going to live through this."
Finding both love and friendship in one person is the best thing that can happen.
an overthinker notices everything.
"Trust me, I tried my best."
Being toxic is not cute. Grow up and learn how to love properly.
I want a relationship with someone who never has me guessing where I stand with them.
"Whatever comes, let it come. What stays, let it stay. What goes, let it go."
Don’t be afraid to change you may lose something good but you may gain something better.
⠀        T R U S T   G O D ' S   P L A N  ⠀
Overthinking is the biggest cause of our unhappiness. Keep yourself occupied. Keep your mind off things that dont help you. Think positive.
Stop trying so hard for people who’ll never care.
"In the end you’ll see who’s fake, who’s true, and who will risk it all for you."
Just trying to be a better version of myself.
"If you’ve been broken and still have the courage to be gentle to others, you deserve love deeper than the ocean itself."
"My mom told me, “sometimes people pretend you’re a bad person so they don’t feel guilty for the things they did to you” ...damn that hit me."
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay."
Hurt in private. heal in silence. shine in public.
"“I love my mom, today, tomorrow and always.”"
"Dear God, I know you are listening please give me strength"
“How many times you would forgive people?”  “As many as God would forgive me.”
"“I’m not okay, but I can still manage.”"
"To those having a hard time right now realize, it’s only temporary"
Know your worth. Know when you’ve had enough. Know when to move on from the people who keep ruining your happiness.
"Breakups are ok. Starting over is ok. Moving on is ok. Saying no is ok. Being alone is ok. What is not ok is staying somewhere where u are not happy, valued, or unappreciated, that's not ok."
"Anyone can give you material things but giving attention, loyalty, effort, and honesty is priceless"
Self-love is the new relationship goal.
"Some people pretend they are strong, but they are broken inside."
Sometimes you just have to breathe and tell yourself it’s okay.
"Lord, bring me closer to what’s meant for me."
"Be nice, but please learn to say ""no""."
Face your fears and wipe your tears
i’m trying to stay strong
Sudden deaths makes us realize that we should treasure and cherish every moment we spend with our loved ones. Let’s show our affection to them while we can.
"I respect people that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is."
"Forgive, let go and heal."
Motivate yourself to become better everyday.
"Continue to grow, even you are alone."
"Believe in yourself, even if the others don't."
Limit your expectations because life is full of disappointments.
"My life isn’t perfect, but I’m thankful for everything I have."
"Heal our silent pains, Lord."
"Note to self: if they want to, they will."
Sometimes music is the only medicine.
"Just a year ago, things were so different"
"Don’t change to make someone love you, Be yourself and let the right one fall for you."
I need a stable mental health and stable internet connection.
You will be happy again like before.
"Things will be better, just wait"
"Self, be strong."
We all deserve assurance &amp; consistency.
Always choose to be happy.
Trying your best to keep your mind positive is so hard.
Talk to God before you sleep
Life is teaching me a lot right now.
"Don't worry, everything will be OK."
I stop trying to communicate when I feel unwanted
so tired of being sad all the time
"Just because I’m strong enough to handle the pain, doesn’t mean I deserve it."
"""Stop overthinking you're breaking your own heart."""
"Stay strong, God is with you."
Making someone else happy is one of the best feelings.
"God has a plan, trust him, enjoy him."
Try a little harder to be a little better.
Don't waste your time stressing about things you can't change.
"Reaching their expectations is so hard especially when those expectations are from your family, friends, and love ones."
So many feelings go unsaid.
We fall in love with the people we can’t have.
I don't know what I want anymore.
choose yourself. every. single. time.
"Cheating is a choice, not an accident."
"Prayer is a one word, but it's powerful than you've never imagined. Just have faith."
all i want right now is someone who is afraid to lose me
A private life is a happy life.
"Dear me, I'll make you proud one day."
I think a guy fighting for his relationship and showing his feelings is more attractive than someone who act like they don't give af.
Sending love to everyone who is trying best to heal from the things they don’t discuss.
biggest lesson learned this year is probably to not give so much of yourself to people who will not do the same for you.
Seriously my favorite thing is when people remember little things I told them... like seriously? you actually listened to me thank you.
Fall in love with someone who will never stop choosing you
"I just want someone to look at me and say, “she’s worth everything”"
"Be a better you, for you..."
You glow different when you’re doing better.
“people are always going to judge you anyway. So forget everyone and be yourself”
Self reminder:  “You’re still young and you’re not supposed to have your whole life figured out yet. Don’t stress. Everything will work out.”
“a whole day with you please”
Can we just skip the sad parts?????
"“Reminder: you are enough, more than enough.”"
"Be strong, s e l f."
"Golden rule: never expect, never assume."
People tweet because no one listens.
I wish I can fully smile with no pain inside
"“I said I was fine, but I never said it didn’t hurt.”"
"Look at the eyes, they never lie."
"As much as the world fails you, never regret having a good heart"
"No more begging for love, no more begging someone to stay"
"“If it makes you feel like shit, walk away.”"
"I pretend to ignore you, but I really miss you"
"“I use laugh, to hide pain.”"
"Lord, thank you for waking me up today! I am strong. I am healthy. I’m blessed indeed. Thank you for showering your graces upon us, Lord! I am beyond grateful. You are amazing!"
Sometimes you need a mute button for your mind and feelings
God knows how much I tried to be happy again
Don’t forget to take the advice you give to others
“I always feel this feeling that I can’t explain.”
"sometimes, memories are the reason why forgetting is hard."
"when maturity hits you, silence is better than explaining."
some friends really on that family level.
i grew up without sharing my problems to my parents.
All good things are worth waiting for and worth fighting for.
"Someday, I hope that my sadness will be replaced by something beautiful."
when i was a child i'm afraid of darkness but now it's my comfort zone.
You will be the happiest human soon.
"To the girl who’s reading this, never be jealous of other girls, you’re beautiful in your own way."
"and in the end, all i learn was to be strong, alone."
Don’t beg someone for their time or even try to convince them to choose you.. The world is too big and you have too much to offer
Be postive always. - God
note to self; stay so busy. so you don't have time to be sad.
we all deserve assurance &amp; consistency
"Stop overthinking. you can't control everything, just let it be."
"Still young, still doing mistakes, still growing, still learning."
i pray that september will be full of good news &amp; blessings.
"i'm sorry, i'm not the best person you have wished for"
hearing “i miss you” from ur favourite person puts u in the best mood
one hug from the right person takes all your stress away
you deserve someone who thinks you’re too important to lose
Some disconnections will bless your life
"Relax, everything will be worth it"
We all fighting different struggles but I pray all of us make it thru
"i miss being a kid. no sadness, no stress, no overthink, no heartbreak"
only one person can change my mood in just seconds
"date in private, love in private, be happy in private"
Love when you're ready not when you're lonely
Your body makes you sexy. Your smile makes you pretty. But your personality makes you beautiful.
"I love my mom, today, tomorrow and always"
Sometimes you need a mute button for your mind and feelings
Everyday is a second chance to make things right.
I have more conversations in my head than I do in real life.
Always remember that there are so many beautiful reasons to be happy.
Hurt me with the truth but never comfort me with a lie.
"Remember, what goes around comes around"
"Stop stressing over it, just let it be, everything will be ok."
You deserve someone who is sure about you.
"People will hate you, rate you, shake you, and break you. But how strong you stand is what makes you."
Don't waste your life on negative thoughts. Stay positive and stay occupied.
Your struggle is part of your story.
"if it makes you happy, no one else's opinion should matter."
find someone that accepts all sides of you
Take care of yourself during this difficult time. Mental health is important too. Breathe. 🙏🏼
Never get tired of doing good.
"Remember, what goes around comes around."
I'm still healing from things I don't speak about.
God's love is more than enough.
"Hi, I hope something good happens  to you today."
Focus on your goals.
"One day, you'll be someone's best thing."
