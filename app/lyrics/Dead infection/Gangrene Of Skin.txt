Gangrene rules over your body
All your limbs give way from decay
You are witness of your end
Sorrowful view on remains
Your loud screams can't help you now
The end of life is your destiny
Black gangrene still attacks
You fight till death, but with no result
Internal pain is what you feel
Destroys your flesh with hideous hate
A wild life deprived of sense
You count seconds to your deathEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
