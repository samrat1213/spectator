I, the child of light, siren of sanity
Scepter of the realm of absolute morality
I breathe the fire of the gods
The wisdom of the wicked consuming all

Carved out from stone
Commandments of deception
Ten lies to lead the weak
A tyrant to the congregation
Gather the flock
Bring them within the holy spire
Give them death, give them sin
Give them fire

Only ashes left to burn
Nothing shall return
Our destiny defined
Nothing will survive

Feed the mouths of sons and daughters
With the carcass of your father
Nothing will survive

Immortal relic
Raised to the heavens
Guide them by flame
Return unto me

I, the child of light, siren of sanity
Scepter of the realm of absolute morality
I breathe the fire of the gods
The wisdom of the wicked consuming all

Bound, the heart of man
Enslaved to the lamb of Christ
Warmed in the furnace of hell
Cerebral sacrifice
Lay down the plow, pick up the sword
Embrace the blade
Sewn the seed of judgment
Now taste the fruit of the crusade

Only ashes left to burn
Nothing shall return
Our destiny defined
Nothing will survive

I, the child of light, siren of sanity
Scepter of the realm of absolute morality
I breathe the fire of the gods
The wisdom of the wicked consuming all

Into the ether, I dissolve
Demon to dust, I evolve
Encase my body in the flame
Embrace the failure, embrace the pain
Tear away at the fabric of the universe
Accept the limitations of what we truly were
Transform, the fire set me free
I am reborn, all hail the son of misery

Hail the son of misery
