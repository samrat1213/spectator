Covenant of Death LyricsWe Assemble as Those Who were before
Of the Principal Force and Form
The Lighting Flash They are
They Breathe the Word and it becomes
We make the Covenant
To the Primal Source of which we've come
We lift ourselves
On the Path that brings us to our Dream
The Continuum Force we praise
Your Slumber Being our highest goal
We make Your Way our laws
For Your ME we do decide
Amah-Ushumgal-Anna
Deep within You Hold the Key
Habsu Being the Way
To claim the Throne that's ours by Right
Zamanu Muh Lal-Li Zi-Pa-Gurud-Zuneme-E
Igi-Nu-Du-A-Hul Igi-Se-Zid-Gin
Their treacherous decisions have committed them to
Eternal Dis and Torment
For now their only shield
Is the ignorance in which they hide
In the Shadows of their fears
They feel the Gnashing Teeth and Weeping
(Translation:)
* Zamanu Muh Lal-Li Zi-Pa-Gurud-Zuneme-E *
Hostile ones, you soon shall reap the reward you have earned
* Igi-Nu Do-A-Hul Igi-Se-Zid-Gin *
Enjoy now this ignorant bliss in which you live
For the awakening soon shall comeEmbed
