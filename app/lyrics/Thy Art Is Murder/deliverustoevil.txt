Deliver us to evil
Tear the blackened hearts from the populace
Deliver us to evil
Eradicate the corrupt with prejudice

Drag them from the mansions
Take them from their hollow possessions
And have them stare in the faces of the hungry
As they burn for their transgressions

Shallow graves
Stuffed with gold
Governments
Bought and sold

Palaces in deserts
Overlooking the slums
Starving and famished
The poor are the forgotten ones
Modern slavery, the scales are tipped
Poverty and ruin in a game thatâ€™s fixed

Deliver us to evil
Tear the blackened hearts from the populace
Deliver us to evil
Eradicate the corrupt with prejudice

Drag them from the mansions
Take them from their hollow possessions
And have them stare in the faces of the hungry
As they burn for their transgressions

The rich get richer
The poor get poorer
The hands of greed
Lead the lambs to the slaughter

Bow to your empty god
Bow to your empty god

Shallow graves
Stuffed with gold
Governments
Bought and sold

Deliver us to evil
Deliver us to evil
