Violently torn through the back of the head as debris from
the skull hits the ground
Writhing and twitching from brains being splattered I'll never get used to that sound
Gaze at the fear in eyes horrified terrified just as a life will expire
Blood drips away from an utter disgrace in hell I will kill you again

Torn through with vengeance o blame
Torn through for wanting you dead

Anger summoned evil deep inside my rotting soul
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control
Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees

Prolonged brutal rampage slaughter with no end in sight
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control

Unforgiving pain is what another death sets free
Sacrifice of sanity accelerates my lack of control

Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees

Killing sprees
Killing sprees
Killing sprees
Killing sprees
