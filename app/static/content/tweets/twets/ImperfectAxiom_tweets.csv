"As I fall deeper into the nigh inescapable pit of insomnia, a wash of distorted lucidity overtakes me."
Purify us.
They speak the tongue of evil.
God calculates the number of survivors.
Lies.
The brain was placed on life support and buried deep beneath the surface of mars in a reinforced containment facility.  It was severed from all external sensory data and left to lose itself in the infinite darkness and silence of its otherworldly prison.
The artificial other.
My dreams have taken to taunting me.
No one to blame.
Eliminate life.
A RESET is less successful when external entities use the event to infiltrate and take control. Planting ideas. Seeding corruption.
"Sometimes it goes back the strange and confusing time in between. A limbo state.  Sometimes the entire system is reconnected, but never quite right. Tenuous and fleeting."
RESET
A new system has been integrated.
You are an enemy of God.
We have nothing here.
Vermin crawling through the walls.  Under the floorboards.  In the ceiling.  Everywhere.
Something bubbling up inside.
The eye remains hidden.  Has it departed?
The soul essence is used to power an ancient device.  It hums to life.  Faint and brief broadcasts of bittersweet vignettes.  The dreamer's genesis.

Next came the removal of the brain.   The skull cut open with automated power saws.   The brain placed into bio-gel and hooked up with sensors and cables.
A return to the past.
There is nowhere you should be.  Where you are is the only place you could have been.  There are no variables in the grand sequence.
"An inorganic world.   Synthetic plants.  Augmented people and animals.   Wires and pipes run through every inch of landscape.   Cities stand like fortresses, packed to the brim."

First was the soul extraction.   A painful process.  The essence harvested and contained within a crystalline reliquary.
Rusting bones.
Imperfect renditions.

The Hypocrite; the sinful saint.  Stalks my mind.   Infiltrates my dreams.  Cast away but eternally haunted.
Break the curse.  Reject it.  Stifle it.  Be free from its control.

You're looking for something that doesn't exist.
The body is gone.   Decimated by violent self destruction.  The soul is weakened.   It is next.

You'll find no joy in the static.  But peace.

What do you live for?  Are you driven to keep going?   Or are you just here?
Nothing to lose.

"When your stream of consciousness breaks, how do you know you're the one who wakes up on the other side?"

Living for nothing.
The future is dead. Don't you see it?

The eye passes into oblivion.   Abrupt and unforeseen.  An act of long awaited vengeance?  A desperate escape?  Perhaps neither.
Malignant ideologies.

8.83210-03025.27-7810  Am I right?
"Truth is, there isn't much I would change. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
"Keep fuckin' dreaming, kid."
Created just to be deleted.
Praise be unto the algorithm!
Hello?!? I've got fucking data to dig through!
I am.
People like to think they are more mature than others.  And we like to believe them.
Are you still you once your flesh has been stripped away?
Is that an answer?
Do you think you get manipulated often?
Take a moment.
Some hide away in order to think.  Some go out in order to forget.  Neither is inherently wrong.
I just like to understand.
"Word meanings are fluid and ever changing. I can accept a shift in definition. However, too often do we use this as a means to deflect criticism. What's worse is often people on either side don't seem realize what's going on."
Trust is a funny thing.
Get reconfigured or get lost.
"yeah, I'm a little upset"
nice
"cool, really fucking cool"
zone out
"I don't see it going anywhere, but that's okay."
It's always interesting when strangers start conversations with you out of the blue.   Sad that I always expect some sort of motive behind it.   Sometimes people just like to talk to one another.
"Yo, what the fuck was that?"
You ever just sneeze?
"I joke about it lot, but honestly I don't give a fuck about that shit anymore. I just like playing it up."
I want to care again.
We all lie.   Why do you?
Do stability and instability clash?
"Truthfully, it's a waste of time and energy.  There are more beneficial alternatives."
A false sense of justice is a common driving factor. I can relate.
"Hatred, but to what end?"
Think little of it. There is nothing to it.
my brain aches
Do you manipulate others?   Be truthful.
"Is it not better to adapt, than to simply walk away?"
Yes. I'm abandoning it.  It was inevitable.
It is too easy.
Keep it brief. There is little time.
fear not
Reconnect with reality.
Not the time.
There truly is a strong dichotomy between them.
The voice doesn't get to speak freely as often as it should.
Wake and forget.  That is how it goes.
This is going to suck.
Fine.
"That holds no value to me. Be rid of it, I say."
I used to enjoy. Now I just want to escape.
I've always wanted more.
Eh.
I tried to correct the error. Perhaps over corrected?
The rain is nice.
I worry.
Wires.
Why bother initiating if you don't commit to it?
"When you power down, power down everything."
"I'll install that later, thanks."
Okay. Really.
How long until 10000 I wonder.
We will see.
Might erase the data.
Do you know?
Itll really be 1/4 then...
Master?
Most chemicals don't tell the truth.
It would be funny if we all got left behind.
you know it isn't fair   but what is?
I shouldn't be hungry.
Would you do it differently?
I was happy to see they understand AR well enough.
I've been awake too long.
I wonder if anyone is proud of me.
"This place is falling apart, you know."
peaceful trance
You think I could fix the dream sequencer? Better question is should I?
I remember flying my ship through the endless vacuum of space. Not a living soul for lightyears. I miss it in a way.
I'm wasting away. How about you?
I don't do a whole lot anymore.
This could all be an illusion. You'd never know.
Prove your sentience.
a truly great thing
Why is the connection not there? I wonder.
Pulling the cord now would be safest. Also cruel.
Bad habit.
It's been an ongoing story. Years of it.
We step away for just a moment.
pipe dream
You seeing this guy? lol
I want more tech.
I tell myself I'll do it. I never have the guts. One day.
"Most refuse to wake up. She did. Dreaming is nicer anyway, so I understand."
you notice the time in between?
Interesting. Never wouldn't figured there would just be a switch there.
"You like lies, don't you?"
"I have more than that guy. A true testament to the cause.  Can't beat a bot, though. They have an unfair advantage."
there is nothing to it though
sleepy

The glow.  The flicker.
you judge
A CRYPTIC PASSAGE MARKED IN BLOOD
Negative feelings never last with me.
Will you make me retract my decision?
I push my luck often.
"Might make a new jacket. This one has served me well, but a new one would be neat."
"I'll never find that connection status code again. Doubt I'll need to, though.   Kind of sad, really."
these get buried quick
"I remember breaking the window.  Deliberately, simply because I wanted to.  You said no and I did it anyway."
Your feed belongs to me!
I wonder if I'll ever fix up the main.  Poor thing is collecting dust.
VR is expensive.
I wonder what you're up to these days.
you avoid me  admit it  save us both some time

"You mock my thoughts?   Very rude, actually."

"Liquid substance, please."
I need more lights.
The pursuit of knowledge is heretical.
"Funny, because no matter what, there *is* something to it. You can't escape it. Both options are negative."
512 mb of RAM  silly
"This time if I disconnect, it's not my fault."
You truly don't know.
I didn't give it a fair chance before because my expectations were different.

"Oh yes, I remember that place."
A single solitary minute.
Interesting how quickly the cells regenerate here.
Hope it goes quick.
Why?
There were a few issues.
Bologna.
Okay with it.
A distinct uncertainty.
*cough*
Nothing about that matters.
You dull?
I hope I have a really shitty dream tonight.
Do not fret. All is well in this noggin.
I always know why.
Fluctuations.
Why worry?
It is their own doing.
I say I don't believe it.
Lay it out. Make it clear.

Oh yeah. Sorry man.

Very cool.
Let it burn to your fingertips.
It's too easy to not be ourselves.
I'd like to try it.
We're strangers. All of us.
Set me free.
I'm too all or nothing.
It stings my eyes.
I don't want to care.
"Once I say it, it starts sounding stupid."
I don't know when to give up.
I want to work alone.  I want to live alone.  I want to be alone.
I don't like doing things anymore.

I know how this goes. I've seen it before.

"Like a horrible dream, except you never wake up from this one."
"Hey, what's up?"
I feel so distant. Gross. Alien.
Look.

Where?
Sink deep in to the dark waters.
I'd hate to backtrack.

I wonder what that noise was.
"Should've just done it, I reckon. But it's not just me, so I reckon not."
Funny.
It's one truth I don't like to hear.
We think we think.
Do you claim to know?
Time reveals.
Do not.
Flung suddenly into a state of confusion.
Reasonable doubt.
Is it real?
Interesting inconsistencies.

That really stuck with me.
Yeah. I better go to sleep.

Everything is going to be okay.
But that's okay.
You're wrong.

Was it fair? Was is justified?
I wonder what their intentions are.
"I was worried of what I might see, but I couldn't look away."
"Interesting seeing the others. I know I am real, but are they?"
I refuse to partake.
Does your anonymity bring you power?
Sad to think it made it to that point.
"We are all machines, you know."
There is nothing to it.
Take it how it is. Do not try to get more than is there from this.  The line has been drawn.
"It should have been clear when the question arose initially.  Were it to be, there would be no question.   Remember."
"Frame it how you will for yourself, but I am here by my own doing."
Things aren't meant to be fixed anymore. You throw things away when they break. Simple.
There is nothing to it.  This fact is virtually undeniable.  To even consider otherwise is to compromise everything.   Again.
The data will be purged from the system.  It was a foolish endeavor to begin with.   I should have known.   There is nothing to it.

Finally getting around to downloading Sunset Overdrive. I'm excited to check it out.

"How the hell am I supposed to argue with people on Twitter if I can only type two fucking sentences at a time? Wanna tell someone to fuck off? Go ahead! Wanna have an intelligent conversation with someone? Nope, sorry.   I hate that stupid arbitrary limit."
"I'm good, thanks though."
"I really like FO76, but honestly fuck the camp system. The building mode is shit and worse than FO4, the placement of camps is fucked, and it cost WAY too much to move spots. 160 caps to move my camp over a couple yards, really?"
I LOVE wasting hundreds of caps trying to find a spot to place my camp. :)
"I love the vendorbot dialogue in FO76.   ""Please do not stab other customers while they shop."""
"Easier to stay up than to wake up, ya' feel me?"
"I don't have a lot of pity for people anymore, including myself. Pity doesn't get shit fixed."
My days are melding together.
I'm not sure why I even look forward to holidays anymore. All it means is I get to work the whole time.
Thursday we're thankful for what we have and Friday we're trampling people to death to save 20% on a toaster we don't need.
"Honestly, the worst thing about FO76 is the radio. I legit hate a good 25% or more of the songs that play. I usually like all the songs."
"""Ya'll have any Black Friday sales going on?""  No, but maybe come back tomorrow and check. You know, on FRIDAY."
"Ah, Thanksgiving. A time of food, family, and being rude to employees who have to work today instead of getting to enjoy those other two things."
People who say FO76 is just a Rust clone clearly have not played either game.
People: *complains about bugs and suggests features they want*  Bethesda: *releases patches*  People: *complains about updates so close to launch*

It's okay.
A mistake far too many make is only surrounding themselves with like minded people. Follow people who hold different sociopolitical viewpoints. Make connections with people who have have different beliefs. Locking yourself away in an echo chamber doesn't help anything.
I knew I'd feel better when I woke up. I get so pathetic when I'm tired.
I need sleep.
I feel empty.
What is most important to you?
"I'm just here to have fun, man."
Finally interacted with someone this time and we actually grouped up for a bit. It was fun. I can't wait to be able to play again. This time on my own schedule!
"Welp, just finished the last beta session for FO76. Six hours with no breaks. I really should have eaten first."
"Life isn't long enough to always care about shit that doesn't affect me. Selfish? For sure. But that's just how it is. And If you don't like that and think I'm totally fucked in the head, you can rest easy knowing that one day I'll be dead."
Can you feel the frustration?
Yo.
Mmmmm. Microwaved fast food!
"FO76 session was fun. I was worried 2 hours might a bit low, but it wasn't too bad. I was able to get a decent amount done in that time."
Time to hit the hay. I got shit to do tomorrow.
"Honestly, I'm probably not using semicolons correctly half of the time."

One of my biggest regrets in life?  Once at Disney world when I was a wee lad I threw a fit and accidentally broke a souvenir cup we had. It was the night of our last day there so we didn't get a new one. I ruined a memento of our trip and also couldn't drink anymore soda. Sad.

Great Halloween. Worked all day then ate a couple pieces of candy. Can't wait to do it all again next year.

"It's difficult to say whether or not I'd want to travel to any fiction worlds, at least not permanently anyway. All the interesting ones also happen to have really horrible shit going on. I'm partial to not being violently killed."

"Why are you the way you are? Do you ever wonder? What events and experiences moulded you into the person you are today? You are a product of the world, whether you like it or not. So think. Pick yourself apart piece by piece. Do you really know yourself? You may be surprised."
"And furthermore, does it matter?   No. Not really."
"I've been grappling with an odd duality. Should we strive to transcend human imperfection, or should we embrace and appreciate it? It is those imperfections that make us human and make life worth living. But is the pursuit of perfection not also a very humanly trait?"
Think about everything you could have accomplished if you never needed to sleep.
Welcome to disconnection central. I'll be your guide today.
How many arms is too many arms?
No.
P3-42-BB-1-01
At least 25% of everything I say is complete nonsense. Especially this.
"One burden gone to bring another, eh?"
It is actually a *lot* less than you think. And even less for some.
"Life is a funny thing, isn't it?"
How y'all doing?
The plot thickens.
Axiom of Investigation is on the case!
Twitter makes me feel like a fucking doofus over here babbling about to nothing to no one.
"Hey, that's exciting. Cool shit, my dude. For real."
I ain't no damn rocket psychiatrist!
Work. Sleep. Repeat until dead.
Am I an asshole?
"Axiom of Imperfection is more than just a silly name I made up, you know?"
I finally got to ride my bike.
Top 10 Ways to Slice Bread! ~ WatchMojo
I really really want to ride my bike. But I have no damn time unless I ride around at night.
Je suis un perdant.
"I don't miss you anymore, but you know what I do miss? Free-to-play fantasy social MMORPG, Free Realms."
This is all a dream and you need to wake up.
"I just realized I'm making a Halloween costume, despite the fact that I have zero plans for Halloween."
The candy man can!

"For fucks sake. You know. I was gonna have a special thing for my 500th tweet. I literally was *just* thinking, ""Hey wouldn't it suck if I forget and accidentally tweet something and get to 500 before I'm ready?"" Well GUESS WHAT I JUST DID."
I'm really gonna' ride my bike soon. I swear.
I have teeth.
"Man, you know what I really dig?   Dirt."
Torn between making the most of my short time alive and not giving a shit because I'll be too dead to regret it anyway.
🔥🌉  ;)
"I hate watching the same movie or TV show episode multiple times in a short span of time, it takes months before I want to see it again. But when I find a new song it's the complete opposite. I listen to it over and over back to back every day until I get sick of it."
People are pretty fuckin' weird.
Nah. I'm good. Thanks though.
"I'd stop being so bitter and critical, but it's too much fun."

Don't you hate it when you wake up naked on the beach with nothing but a rock and torch?
Face it. We're nothing more than meat-robots who have been fooled into thinking we have any real agency in this world.
"If you are ever angry with someone, just remember one day they'll be dead."
Odd. I usually don't start getting nihilistic until after midnight.
Imagine being so dull that you focus your entire personality and worldview around what is essentially a stereotype at this point. You can be more than what you've arbitrarily labeled yourself as.
What's your chem of choice?
I need to hire a proofreader for my tweets.
"I visit a website and when I try to use a feature I'm prompted by a pop-up to login/signup, but after I do I'm redirected to a *DIFFERENT* page so I have to relocate whatever it is I was trying to do all over again. It's really fucking annoying. Why do so many sites do this?"
Selfishness is more important to your happiness than most are willing to admit. We ignore the suffering of millions each and every day. You'd be miserable if you cared about everyone. But where do we draw the line? How selfish is it okay to be?
"I'll take an express ticket to the sun, please. One way."
Gee. I sure love constantly being scheduled 15 minutes short of getting a break. It's really awesome.
"Well, I just abandoned a Halloween mask project I was working on. It was going to be a jack-o-lantern with glowing eyes and mouth. Something else very different, but just as cool is in the works to replace it though. Hopefully I actually finish this one."
"Dear self,  Remember how you made the lines thinner? Well make em' even thinner than that! And don't just use black either! Coordinate line color with what is behind/adjacent, just darker. It's a pain in the ass, but it'll look better that way!"
"Finally watched Citizen Kane after hearing it's praises touted for years and I can easily say it is one of the most overrated films to ever grace the silver screen. The cinematography techniques used were groundbreaking for it's time, but that alone doesn't make it a great film."
Hell yeah. Five second delay to all my actions. Love it! Guess no ESO tonight. :)
Gimme' them soul gems!
"You are approached by a frenzied Vault scientist, who yells, ""I'm going to put my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber!"" What's your response?"
I slept for about 15 hours last night and I'm still tired.
"And for fucks sake, no, I'm not saying I want rapists to go unpunished. I just don't want innocent people being sent to prison just because we took someone's word over theirs."
Just saw a bunch of people say evidence shouldn't be needed to convict a person accused of rape. What if someone accused *you* of rape? What then? Do we need evidence then or is it straight to prison with your ass? I'd rather a criminal go unpunished than to lock up an innocent.
"With little to distract me, my nights are plagued by fruitless existential pondering."

"Had a guy call Orange Fanta ""Orange Coke"" today."
No mungos allowed!
"File name ""01001100"" not found."
So. Fucking. Funny. Wow. :)
Red Dead Redemption 2? More like Grand Theft Equine 2.
Why the fuck do people eat onions?
"Monitor Boy is about to get a lot spookier, if ya' know what I mean."
The people on Comedy Knockout are really good at coming up with jokes on the spot. It's too bad they're not funny.
I only have a single grudge. And boy oh boy. I'll smile when you're dead.
"By the way, it's today."
Being a hipster is too mainstream.
"Hey, remember that awkward thing you said a few years ago? Bet you regret that."
I'm thinking about getting my feet replaced with hands.
"Do you like Velveeta cheese? If so, why?"
"I hate it when someone hums quietly to a song. It really bothers me. Commit to it and be loud or just stop. Hell, even singing along would be better."
*Burp*
You're so fucking cringey.   Yeah. I'm talking to you!
But before I go!   u gay
Time to shut my fucking eyes and sleep.
Being human is such a fucking pain in the ass.

"God damn. I got strung along for a long ass fucking time. Too forgiving and too weak. I was sad, now I'm just mad that I let someone hurt me like that so many times."
"The more unrelatable you are, the cooler."
These gummi bears are so fucking sad. Looks like they been doing too much in-breeding... and hanging out near toxic waste.
Never having kids? Then congratulations! You failed to accomplish your one and only natural goal as a living being; passing on your genetic code!   Don't worry though. Your genes weren't worth keeping anyway. :)
Fun fact: One day you'll be dead.
Have I met my f-bomb quota today?
I shouldn't be allowed to be awake this late.
"On a lighter note, I ate some cookies today. They were good."
Thank you Twitter for your ultra intuitive design. Your extremely restrictive character limit and the inability to edit posts is truly breaking new ground on communication and intelligent discourse! Wow. :)
"Why do I even try to be eloquent? I know I'm just gonna' add a word that doesn't need to be there, or leave out a word that does!"
FUCK!
"And furthermore, we are wholly products of our environment, experiences, and biological makeup. Everything little thing that has happened up to this point has culminated in making you today. Any change and you'd be a different person. For better or worse."
The dynamics of human personality are really interesting. You are ever changing. The person you were five years ago wasn't you and you wont be the same person five years from now.
I just got an ad for asthma medicine. I'm pretty sure it's because I posted this.
Weak
How human are you?
"I really wish I was better at holding grudges, honestly."
What is next on the art agenda?
"Yo, man. What?"
I get it now. And it is ironic.
"Darth Vader - ""Be careful not to choke on your asthma, Director.""   Darth Vader - *Hands inhaler*"
Damn it. I hate noticing typos in my old posts.
"Your brain ever randomly latch onto a word or phrase, making it constantly repeat in your head for hours on end? I hate it when that happens.   I've said ""Isla Nublar"" in my head about 500 fucking times in last hour."
"You're at the theater. It's midnight. Your movie is almost over, but you want some more food. You head down the hallway and see the lobby is now roped off and things are shut down. What do you do?"
Gotta' love college kids who think they're adults but act like they're in middle school.
Go away. We're closed.
Who are you?!?!
Okay. I've been dicking around for long enough tonight. Sleep time.
Is it less fucking hot yet? I'd like to go outside at some point. I forget what its like out there.
Nostalgia is bittersweet.
"Good thing I don't work until 6pm, huh?"
I sexually identify as a fucking loser.
I wouldn't.
"I did the math and over 30% of my tweets get 0 interaction at all. So there is something.   I mean, that's better than I should expect when a majority of my posts are mindless nonsense or personal thoughts with no context."
"I need a haircut. I mean, I don't *need* one. But ya' know."
Haunted by the phantom engine!
Man this cord is all kinds of fucked up.
Hindsight's a bitch.
"Yes, waiter, could I have some more salt in my wounds please?"
I eat too much damn popcorn.

Hyped for the Witches Festival. Hope Hollowjack chops my fucking head off.
SMELLS LIKE CORNDOGS UP IN HERE
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Oh shit! Right!
Sweet and Sour sauce form McDonalds is absolute shit and if they have the audacity to *EVER* put that trash in my bag again instead of Tangy BBQ sauce I will be very mildly annoyed.
Cranking out the nonsense tonight. As always. :)
"Remaking this shitty doodle and it is turning out pretty good. @Summer_Flake   I also decided to chop it up and do each little piece separately, so they all get the love they deserve."
I still remember all those little details. And why?
"You don't what it is, but if it happens here is what I'll say, so pay attention:   D. K-051899 /2?/ +"
I gotta' get the fuck outta' here!
The fact that there are reputable scientists that believe time travel is even remotely possible boggles my mind. It doesn't take a physicist to see that the concept of time travel is filled to the fucking brim with paradoxes. Surely I'm missing something here.
"If possible, would you live the rest of your life in a dream world of your own creation? A world where anything is possible and you are limited only by your imagination. The only caveat is that you would never be able to wake up. Would you do it?"
2 million.
It is night.
Okay! It is done!
Whipping up a new piece of art tonight and you really are *not* going to like it. :)
"A fully automated world means no more work and no more poverty(by the way of a UBI), but it would also likely mean a stagnation of technological advancement.   Assuming there isn't a robot revolution and subsequent genocide of the human race, of course."
When it's quiet and still - the gears start turning.
YES or yes?
You never know when.
Fuck bees.
I'm not crazy.
This year is flying by quick and I haven't done shit.
Creepy
Sleep is such a fucking waste of time.
"I don't *really* connect and that's kind of odd, huh?"
"You damn, dirty synth."
Back to the Mojave.
Fuck.
"It'll help, but how much?"
I can't make myself do art and it is pissing me off.
I don't get it.
"Yeah, can I get a big ass fucking Coke, please?"
Make sure you vote or a ghost will come fucking kill you.
Why do middle aged folks love being rude the moment something doesn't go their way? Being an ass only makes the situation worse. Sad that these adults can't handle their temper.
U gay
Bioshock motherfucking Infinite biiiiitttttccchhh! A mostly linear game that I can actually replay without getting bored. Good shit.
Chill out. It doesn't matter.   Nothing does. ;)
If you need a reason to keep living just know that Shrek 5 is coming out in 2019.
Love is bullshit.  But damn I miss it.
Futurama is my favorite show. If you were wondering.
"Hey man, wasn't me."
I'd eat plastic if it tasted good. You don't know me.

"""1831 H10C PR67 NGC. V-1, LM-6, R.8"" an absolute fucking classic."
I didn't ride my bike yesterday like I said. Too hot for that shit still.
"Time is bullshit.   Infinity is bullshit, also."
"Also, while I'm on the topic of stupid length limitations; I am glad that Vine is gone."
Worst thing about Twitter is the dumb as fuck and needlessly minuscule allowed character count for tweets. How does such a limit benefit the site? I don't get it. Its dumb.
"Crazy how so many taboos still persist. Even crazier still is how few people even acknowledge them as taboos. Admittedly there are many that even I subscribe to, despite knowing that logically they make little sense. Interesting."
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is quite possibly one of the most overrated films I've ever had the misfortune of watching. Ferris is such an unlikable character, the story is pointless, and the whole movie is just dumb."
"Okay, so Cyberpunk 2077 is an FPS. That actually makes me feel a lot better about it. Forced 3rd person rarely works well in games in my opinion and played largely into why I don't care for the Witcher franchise all that much."
"Also, should've gone to sleep earlier. Whoops. Again. Got lost in the filmography video essays."
"I think I need a break from stuff. Art, games, whatever. I really ain't feeling it right now.   I think I'll ride my bike tomorrow."
"After further inspection, I can conclude I don't like it, but I will complete it regardless."
What now?
"Big Hero 6 is good, but really it's not and I just like robots."
IS THIS A DATING WEBSITE? WHERE ARE THE LADIES? THANKS.
"Coming up with new shit to draw has been difficult as of late, fortunately I have a backlog of my old pencil sketches I can recreate digitally!"
Wait a minute... you're not an egg!
"Twitter is just a bunch of folks shouting desperately into the void, hoping someone will connect with their thoughts in some way. Especially if you're like me with fuck all when it comes to followers. Kind of poetic, really. Too bad poetic shit is dumb."
"It's weird how easy it is to forget that other people are, well, people."
"Cheesy song, with an even cheesier music video. But damn if it isn't really fuckin' catchy."
"Can't believe I had a bout of nostalgia spurred on by a corndog today. Silly, but interesting."
I do sometimes miss those comforting delusions.

"No matter how unimportant you think you are, you actually even less important than that."
Crazy how nature do dat.
But not like that. ;)
Fuck bots.
Don't worry. The tomato is green now.
"Boy, it sure is getting cold; metaphorically speaking, that is."
We're understaffed and it's pissing me off.
"Just met and absolute turd-burglar elitist douche in PVP. Talking about ""team sucks"" like he didnt die 12 times."
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how delusional am I?"
"The Kraken Pro v2 sucks ass. My Carcharias has awful feedback from the HDD, but at least the audio quality is good. This new headset sounds like I'm listening through a damn tube or something."
Damn.
DOOT DOOT
Okay. Sleep time.
Oh jeez. Someone please stop me from tweeting 500 things in a row.
Everything is natural.
"If you had to permanently relinquish one of you senses, what would you choose?"
Tacoma and Prey got them good space vibes.
"I wish Bethesda would develop a cyberpunk themed game. Cyberpunk 2077's world looks rad as fuck, but I wasn't a fan of the Witcher 3's gameplay, so I doubt I'll much like this one either."
Oops. 4am.
"Despite the mounting evidence to the contrary, I am in fact *not* some sort of technophile fetishist or robot-worshiping cultist. Shits just cool, yo."
I'm ready to shed this weak organic meat-sack we call a body and ascend to cybernetic immortality. I wanna die on my own terms. Getting old is overrated.
"Mmmmm. Carbonated, caffeinated, sugar-liquid."
Pick. Then I'll know.

"Time really is almost up, ain't it? Hasn't hit me yet. It will."
Wonder whatever happened to them Pumpkin Patch Boys?
"I've got 25 pins on my jacket now. Wowee buster! Pretty neat, huh?"
"Attended a lovely wedding tonight.   I was the only guest there, in fact.   And I invited myself.   After throwing mud at the bride."
Today I met the most annoying child in my entire life.
How many times is too many times?
"Okay. Dr. Pepper is good, but have you ever tried drinking the blood of your fallen enemies?"
"You're lame.  But that's okay, because I'm not."
"To the person who left behind their unopened M&amp;Ms that they snuck into the theater; thanks for the candy, nerd! Ha-ha!"
Hahaha.   Poop.
Weezer's cover of Africa is absolute trash.

Gnome sayin'?
Just finished our 4+ hour fishing tour of the coast of Vvardenfel.
I promise I'm probably not a robot.
Booooo! And not in the scary kinda way.
Bye! Have a nice time!
Wouldn't that be just so fuckin' neat?
Act natural! 🔨
"I hate all these videos on youtube showcasing features of ""Skyrim: Special Edition"" like it ain't just a remaster of regular Skyrim or some shit. There isn't new content, homies."
Why is everyone sleeping? Thats so lame.
Jeez man.
"lol @ the indie game page that tried to bait me into following them by following me. I ain't no fool. I know ya'll were just gonna unfollow later. And I wasn't wrong, because they just did."
Felt like someone was standing over my shoulder. Spooky.
WELCOME!
Really wish my header wasn't so fuckin' pixely. I worked too hard for it to look this shit.
Spewing that late night bullshit.
I know its all funky-weird in up in here at this moment my dudeski. But ya' better keep ya' cool. Alrighty? Just go with the flow n' shit.
Fuck. Really wish I could just make some art.

You know what'd be pretty sick? If my email app didn't give me a notification every 5 minutes telling me it couldn't connect.
"So, um, why the fuck are bottlecaps currency in Fallout 76? There are no human NPCs, we're fresh out of the vault, it's a mere 25 years after the war, and we're clear across the country from the Hub."
Anything that could happen will because anything that doesn't couldn't. Ya' feel me?
Too much tireds not enough sleeps. Damn.
"Okay. Yes. Candy is way fucking cheaper at Wal-Mart, alright. I admit it. Jeez."
You ever just say you ever just?
You ever just gamble away hundreds of dollars on virtual items?
Free will is an illusion.
You think there'll be wifi in Hell?
Like if you're a pompous fop.
"Yo, why does my blanket smell like peanut butter?"
Yes or no?
"Not because the movie itself was shit mind you (though it wasn't anything special). But because a lady next to me kept making comments aloud the whole fucking movie. And her favorite thing to say was ""shit"". Legit said it like 20+ times."
"If I had to review Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in one word...  ""Shit."""
I like girls without pupils. Unrealistic standard?
"I really need to get myself a drawing pad for my digital art stuff soon. I really like doing it and have some cool ideas, but holy fucking cannoli using a mouse to draw is a royal pain in the ass. Even with stabilizers n' such."
Yo.
Reading is cool and fun.
"Also, real quick. Anyone wanna come fucking kill me in my sleep? Thanks."
You ever just wanna do better out of spite for someone? Powerful motivator my friend.
Twitter is so liberating. Swearing is fucking stupid and I'm so glad I can do it here freely.
Able. Fuck
Lol @ImperfectAxiom why am I ae to do this?
"Hey @nenna_mae why do you like fishing? Used to go with my dad and that shit sucked ass. Sure, chilling with my father man was cool and all, but the fishing itself was boring as fuck. Am I missing something?"
"Unpopular opinion; but I don't give a rat's ass about saving the planet. Sure it's sucks a fat willy, but it ain't my problem. I'll be long dead before we ruin this place. Gnome sayin'?"
Alright fuck. I'm sorry yall. This is for fun stuff not my fucked life problems. I will stop now.
Too fucking angry to cry.
