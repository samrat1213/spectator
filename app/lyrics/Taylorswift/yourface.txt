I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face
In every space
Every room

And I know if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call

And now I wonder to myself
Who were you? Where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna turn around
