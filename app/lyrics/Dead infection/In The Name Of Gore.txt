Tear your empty soul apart
In the name of the holy gore

Flesh is gone, soul is gone
Existence gives belief for the dead
Uncertain step without a chance of life
Rips your f**king health off

Mouldy worms excrete product of emaciated microbs
Prince of circulation of the blood commands to stop

It causes loss of the mind - its name is pain
It destroys flesh - its name is death
It builds revenge - its name is hate
It vomits bile - its name is goreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
