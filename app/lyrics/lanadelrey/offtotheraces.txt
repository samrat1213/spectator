My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass
Way about me
He loves me
With every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sitting sipping on your Black Cristal

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he's got a soul as sweet as blood-red jam
And he shows me
He knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul

He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like
About me
Admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make-up
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac
Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you but I'm going down

God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him

Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you

You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said "Hon'
You never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man."

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin

Boy you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love
