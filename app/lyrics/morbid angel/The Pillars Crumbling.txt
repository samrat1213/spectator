The Pillars Crumbling LyricsHypocritical guidance has confused the masses
Veiling the instinctive nature of a higher cause
Accumulation and consuption
Evaluated by your possessions
Unabated cleansing of a deeper being
Dissociative dissent, liberation through ignorance
Disseminate devolution, dissipation of disruption
Isolation and dejection, disenchanted exhilaration
Discomposed reverence, subservient
Constant denial of truth
Constant distrust
Constant obedience
This has spawned a new type of human
Who live in fear and addiction
Lead them
Guide them to extinctionEmbed
