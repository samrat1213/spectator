I said
I'll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown
I'll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown

A crowd so lost when you fucking left us
A public without their lungs
Your relentless prowess helped so many
Your memory will never be lost
Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones

I'll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown
I said
I'll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown

Can I please get a chance to fucking breathe
I'm sick and tired of expecting this hate
It's up to you, what do you want me to be
I can be your best friend or worst enemy

Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones

A force much bigger than you or me
I'm here for you to feast upon
Either way I'm taken away
Hand on my shoulder your presence lives on
Either way I'm taken away
Hand on my shoulder your presence lives on

Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones
Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones

Said
I'll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown
I will inherit the crown
