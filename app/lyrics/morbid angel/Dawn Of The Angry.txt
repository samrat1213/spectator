Dawn of the Angry LyricsCold finger on the trigger
Behind the line drawn in the sand
Anger rise!
We fight a war with much at stake
The rights of birth that no one can take
Overflowing with anger
Soon to be awakening
Will be martyrs on to glory
Dawn finds us in this rage
My finger on the button
With what's so foreign in my sights
Anger rise!
We wage a war
Our nature to preserve
By any means
Our enemies be gone
No longer can we wait
As an enemy drains our future
As the light of a new day shines
Our anger fuels our march this dawn
As it must be
Dawn of the mad
Call of duty, now
All the minutemen rise and shine
Call of duty, now
Only sovereigns stand the test of time
My finger is on the trigger
Behind the line drawn in the sand
My finger is on this button
With what's so foreign in my sights
Anger rise!
We wage a war
Our nature to preserve
By any means
Our enemies be gone
No longer can we wait
As an enemy drains our future
As the light of a new day shines
Our anger fuels our march this dawn
As it must be
This dawn of the madEmbed
