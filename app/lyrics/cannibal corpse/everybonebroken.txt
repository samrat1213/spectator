Die, shattered you'll die
Bones broken in half
Blood flowing freely
Limbs severed in hate
Brains splattered, demise
Skin eaten in wrath
Eyes ripped from your head
Lie shattered, you die

For believing you could be free
Weakness only invigorates me
These broken bones once yours, I hold
Cause of death will never unfold

Torn, mangled, and maimed
Life withers away
In hellish decay
Bones shattered, you die

For not seeing things I see
Your pummeled body strengthens me
These broken bones keep me aware
Of how I lust to shred and tear

Every bone broken is my only goal
Sucking the marrow of your fractured femurs
Every bone broken, your truculent toll
Succumbling to my offensive demeanor
Every bone broken enhances my soul
Your twisted corpse is contorted dead rot
Every bone broken, your life I stole
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught

<i>[Solo - O'Brien]</i>

The snapping and cracking of skeletal remains
The pleasure of devouring decomposed flesh
The feeling of power from crushing your skull
The stench of decay overwhelming my brain

I slaughtered your body and returned it to dirt
Not a trace of proof that you ever existed
Pure satisfaction through what I have accomplished
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught
