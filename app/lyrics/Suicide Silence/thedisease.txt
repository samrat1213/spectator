I'm the one man army 
Of disease
I'm the one man army 
Of disease

The creation that is the sickness
This is time to destroy everything
and never rebuild 

I am the disease 
I'm a disease
To the world 
I'm the plague of
Disaster 

And I'll continue to move forward
Like the monsters of money
Crime, crime and deceit 

This is time to destroy everything
and never rebuild 
I'm the one man army 
Of disease

We've brought this world to its
Knees 
We've brought this world to its
Knees 

Now it's spread like wildfire 
Wildfire 

This world is dead, let it die 

A fucking sick disturbing race
A close-minded existence 

We are the fucking sick 
It's the plague of us
And we're the disease
Of this disaster
You call your world

This world is dead let it die 
So shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
And let the killing begin
