As the blood begins to gush out the side of your neck
I thrust my cold steel into your face, your closer to death
A twelve inch blade will help decide your ultimate fate
This summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

Vocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brain
Your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away
As mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and head
Vigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

I'm chewing bloody skin from the cadaver
Consuming lifeless meat, mangled and tattered
Half-eaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter
I am revitalized

Odium, embedded in my skull

To kill and eat your prey a way of nature
The taste of death must consciously be savored
My cannibal existence never dangered
Just look into my eyes

Subjugate, intensity to blame

Gnawing on the head, sliced to fucking shreds
Knife to the gullet results in cessation

<i>[Solo - O'Brien]</i>

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived
