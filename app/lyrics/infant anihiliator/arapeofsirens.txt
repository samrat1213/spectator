The harlots' harmony echos within our cave of castration
Accenting the weeps from the men remade as women
Stripped of their appendages
Probed and beaten
A cult of deviant savages
Seducing bastards in the darkness

Bringing life to the night
Herding boys into the light
Becoming one more carcass

In the dark, they have no name
In the dark, they corrupt and maim

Twisted nymphomaniacs
Parasitic vixens
Creeping
Twisted nymphomaniacs
Parasitic vixens
Creeping

Shadows from the fire flicker on stone
Illuminating heaps of cocks and bones
Faces in the mist obscured; unknown
Sirens of the mire
The whispers of doom
All who heed consumed by gloom
One peer behind the veil reveals your tomb

The chants of the coven sweep through the land
Temptresses of violence walk among the damned
Through the wind
They call you in

Luring them to the circle to lay, erect
While dissecting
Slowly peeling at the shaft
The loss of blood brings the lured to reality
They gaze in horror at their penile cavity

Fall blind to the coven
Become their prey

Gnawing at their anus
Penetrating them with their own penis

Fall blind to the coven
Enslaved
Their prey
Never to be seen again
Enslaved
They pray

Shadows from the fire flicker on stone
Illuminating heaps of cocks and bones
Faces in the mist obscured; unknown
Sirens of the mire
The whispers of doom
All who heed consumed by gloom
One peer behind the veil reveals your tomb
