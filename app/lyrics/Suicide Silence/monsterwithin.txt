The monster within
Will never let you in
(Ayeeee!!!)
(Yea, Come On!!!)
Face to face
Here we are struggling again to keep this all in
Clawing to escape our sanity
(We will win)
You have left us without a choice
(We want out)

Monster within
Will never let you in
Distraction from the end game
I am so sure you think you’re it
Don’t even test this
I am so sure you think you’re it
Don’t even test this

Lost control
I know what we are
A menace I’d managed to keep very far
We have a hold on your scent now
(Yes we do)
We will not stop ‘til you see us
(We are one)

Monster within
Will never let you in
Distraction from the end game
I am so sure you think you’re it
Don’t even test this
I am so sure you think you’re it
Don’t even test this

Forgiveness means nothing
When you will be forgotten
Forgiveness means nothing
When you will be forgotten
I will make you see a god
Forgiveness means nothing
When you will be forgotten
Just so you can pray for death
I will make you see your god
See your god
(Ohhh!!!)
Because you will be forgotten

Monster within
Will never let you in
Distraction from the end game
I am so sure you think you’re it
Don’t even test this
I am so sure you think you’re it
Don’t even test this
