It is dawn and the rivers are red with blood - one small reminder of
what’s to come. Now, behold the future unfold the way it’s never been
told before. Fuck the prophecies of God. I will destroy him like the
piece of shit he truly is. I will bathe in his mother’s placenta after
I have raped and bludgeoned her to death. His mother, the modern
Virgin Mary, will become my dead harlot. My followers, a new beginning
draws closer. Truth is becoming irrelevant as it’s re-written by my
scribes. We will rise to conquer all that stands in our way. Man won’t
remember the past, as he treads upon the dust of his forefathers. Lies
solidify the system that I have built to enslave them all; a portrait
of perfection designed to entice them with false hope. Fed by the
hands of their master, my pets confide in me. Blind with Illusions
that veil all their eyes, I claim their lives with the blood of all
who died. I, the Omnipotence of this new world, unearth and
reconstruct the fossils of evil.
