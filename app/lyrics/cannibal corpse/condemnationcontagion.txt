Upsurge of plague
Fear the unknown
Impaired by pathosis
Afflicted by death and engagement in horror
Sickness abound
Terror defined
Germophobic daymare

Clusters of pain
Grim outlook proclaimed
Infected by illness
Mutations now propagate syndromes of ailment
Ordained confinement
Sustained isolation
Mysophobic nightmare begins

Hallows of death surround me
Feeding my fears of the end
Protocol overboding
Mandatory quarantine enforced

As the powers begin to employ
Invasive measures arbitrarily enact
The imposing ominous presence of order
Amidst the insurrection of deniability

Condemnation contagion
The virus of septicity
Pandemic panic
Endemic unease
The outbreak of human respiratory disease

Condemnation contagion
Transmission through proximity
Global terror
Pathogenic disease
The widespread epidemic of social unease

Is this the end of all that we know?
The evolutionary tale of natural selection
The ultimate mechanism of devolution
The inevitable order of things

Overcome by cataclysmic dread
Deluged by trepidation and despair

Condemnation contagion
The virus of septicity
Pandemic panic
Endemic unease
The outbreak of human respiratory disease

Condemnation contagion
Transmission through proximity
Global terror
Pathogenic disease
The widespread epidemic of social unease
Condemnation contagion

Accursed we are
Damned till the end
So mote it be

Afflicted we are
Doomed till the end
So mote it be
