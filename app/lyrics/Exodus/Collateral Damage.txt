[Verse 1]
Blitzkrieg, insurgence
Under the thumbs of the powers that be
Conflict, tension, unlawful detention
They don't give a fuck about you or me

We are all just collateral damage
The shit they step in on their way
Just puppets used to their advantage
To chew up and throw away

[Pre-Chorus]
Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is my declaration of war

[Chorus]
Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce
We decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die
We ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end
We are betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid
[Verse 2]
Illuminati of the one percent
We chase their carrot on a string
Wall Street deceit all stuck on repeat
Peons serving to the kings

To them it's all just a natural selection
A birth right of gluttony
Like a kind of immaculate conception
Of inbred conformity

[Pre-Chorus]
Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is my declaration of war

[Chorus]
Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce
We decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die
We ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end
We are betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaid
[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Lee]

[Verse 3]
Street punk makes a fatal mistake
Dared to look him in the eye
Ten rounds, just standing his ground
Only choice, he had to die

Just another violent confrontation
Murder in the first degree
Another ready, aim, fire
Do more time for petty larceny

[Pre-Chorus]
Convergent, we move to deploy
I won't be your whipping boy
Insurgent, I can't take anymore
This is my declaration of war

[Chorus]
Fight, oppress
Coalesce, we no longer acquiesce
We decry, defy
No longer learning how to live, we're learning how to die
We ascend, defend
I recommend we battle to the bitter end
We are betrayed, unafraid
Belligerent, resilient
Collateral damage repaidEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
