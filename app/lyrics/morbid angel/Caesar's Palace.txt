Caesarâ€™s Palace LyricsJust close your eyes
Can you remember?
The generations not so long ago
I feel the shameless urge that we must restore
Our former king to his rightful throne
And with me lords and maidens
We wait for the chosen son's return
I come alive
It's a time for celebration
Our will to restore
Make our past become the future once more
Still he lives! 2000 years have passed
And still we're yearning for his return
We fulfill a wishful prophecy
And so the chanting begins:
Hail Caesar, hail Caesar, we render unto you
What is still yours
Share the wish as it must be
Our king and palace
Mode it be
Gods enslaved, traitors burning
Might and splendor forever returnEmbed
