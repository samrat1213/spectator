The fabric of our mortal consciousness slowly deteriorates
The masses have been returned to a state of primal action
Sit back, and watch as this material realm decays to a pile of bubbling flesh and bone

Microbial proliferation, from the frothy tissues, stings the nostrils of the humans thinking they have survived
An utterly terrifying demonstration of natural selection 

They're dismantling delicate limbs at a molecular level
Their fleshy tissues begin to diffuse, as the maggots slowly eat the eyes
Their numbers have grown and humans are left alone to wait for the day that the king will claim this decayed throne
To take this crown of thorns as my own 

The fabric of our mortal consciousness slowly deteriorates
The masses have been returned to a state of primal action
Sit back, and watch as this material realm decays to a pile of bubbling flesh and bone
