Make me bloom with your flowery prose.
Trying shutting your mouth and listening for a while.
I'm ready to be written.
He has the tongue of a poet.
"Gather around, I have stories to tell."
"If you play your cards right, that could be your skull I'm holding."
"After much speculation and internal debate, I've come to the conclusion that people exhaust me."
They scream to come out. I hold tighter down on the pillow.
Mind crimes and other head games.
Fire eyes and a goddess in her bones.
I love you. Those 3 words are overused and under felt.
I doesn't matter what I do or don't do. It never did.
Your hate only gives me power.
The predictability of people make me wanna s!it my fucking wrists.
You're running out of track.
It's just like Einstein said. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Insanity.
You will fade just like the colours in a photograph.
You will burn in a memory.
I'm just waiting for death.
Never chase. There is nothing more unattractive than pining after someone who does not want you.
Walk among the dead.
Meet me at the library between Plath and Poe.
The rise and the fall of it all.
I'm not real and neither are you.
You are a strange one.
Swallow my words and they belong to you.
Don‚Äôt give me your heart when it‚Äôs your soul I‚Äôm after.
Broken-winged creature of the night seeks flight.
Forsake me harder.
You say witch like it‚Äôs a bad thing.
Being normal is vastly overrated.
I am wicked in many ways.
I'll take thee away into a land of enchantment.
They like to play. They don't like it when I play back.
This time I'm going in guns blazing.
"If you can't handle my honesty, then get the fuck off of my page."
Easy to get my attention. Harder keeping it.
"I want to be a mountain goat in Switzerland because every time they move, it's a crap shoot."
"Did I ask you for anything? No, I don't believe that I did."
"If you know, you know."
You're gonna have to adore me better than that.
Nothing makes me feel alive. I'm dead dead dead.
"My kid is the only one who keeps me on the planet, but that is too big of a burden to share with her."
Violet skies and purple rain.
Tell me how ugly I am.
I know all of the tricks human's use.
That pedestal you put me on was made to falter.
Please refrain from projecting your shit issues on to me.
Waiting for my turn at the ledge.
"One after another, they fall off the cliff's edge."
I'm.really.tired.
To let go and to be let go of.
I'm just here to spill words.
To be  nothing to anyone.
Pray/prey for my wretched soul.
Spells and incantations.
One moonlit evening.
Whispers in the night.
Lullabies of the sweetest lies.
"Enjoying the show, motherfuckers?"
Nothing I do is right. I'm just wrong.
"If it made you weep internally, it was worth it."
Her heart fire burning for the world to see
Watch me bleed.
Pierce right through me.
Red roses and all of her thorns too.
Fuck nudes. Send me your inner most desires and aspirations. Let me delve into your psyche.
Do what you want. I don't care.
And then there was light.
"Enjoy your power tonight, fuckers."
I‚Äôm exactly where I‚Äôm supposed to be. In the darkness.
Power still out but had to check in on my darlings.
Back into the shadows I go.
People suck the life source right out of my soul. Exhausting.
"My light goes with me, motherfucker."
"I‚Äôve been rocking the winged smokey eyes, the messy bun and the mental illness since before you were born, sis. Sit the fuck down."
The storm rolls in. It is the calm before.
"and in my spare time, I like to read autopsy reports, view crime scenes and watch medical examiners trying to determine manner and causes of death."
"""Good things will happen.""  Of course they will, death."
"By all means, don‚Äôt let the cold hard facts get in the way of your idiotic opinions."
I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I have a lot of shortcomings but those aren‚Äôt them and you don‚Äôt know me. Walk away.
"Back in the day, clubbing, we were pre-drinking in the car and before I could stand in that long line up to enter the club, I had to pee in a back alley on the streets of downtown Toronto with my best friend because we couldn't hold it in for the club. One of my finest moments."
So that I may devour you.
Don't be afraid. Come a little closer.
You've run out of lies.
Self-proclaimed Alpha Males are never Alpha. Ever.
Let's die together. I'm ready.
Die for me. Show me your devotion.
"It's quite insane, my brain."
I‚Äôll jump off a cliff and scream your name.
My personal hell and I wouldn't have it any other way.
I see animal abuse of any kind and I'm launching on your ass.
You're going to live and die on that lonely little hill of yours.
Bleed your brilliant hues of hate unto me.
Wretched are the ones who claim divinity.
Cleanse yourself of mediocrity.
Claim your understanding of their wretchedness.
Wood for the fire. Burn these troubled souls.
Revenge in the shape of a kiss.
Witch sees all.
Take no disrespect.
I'm just here to bewitch you.
I put a spell on you.
"If you don't do, what *they want, how *they want, when *they want it, *they have no use for you.   *people"
Obsidian dreams of obliterated nothingness.
It is not written in the stars but in the darkness in between.
I only relate to the gloom.
"Under blackened skies, your hand in mine."
I see the dark inside of you.
Everyone here is playing a game. You just have to figure out which fucking one.
The damage I could do if I wasn't raised right.
I need to frolic more.
"I'm in a vile mood, I'd better go."
"Mostly I'm either sad, stressed or anguished, but always full of disdain. That never goes away."

"Trust me, you don't want to be on my radar."
Where in the bible does it say fuck this shit?
Might fuck around and let myself be stolen by you.
My heart doesn‚Äôt want to know what my head tries to tell it.
The ghosts are restless tonight.
My brain is not braining tonight.
The problem is me. It's always been me.
Alienation of self.
When you can feel them watching you. That.
Not a fiddler‚Äôs fuck was given today.
"He died right in front of me and there was absolutely nothing I could do to help him. Now tell me again about Jesus Christ, your Lord and Saviour."
I am the good. I am the bad.
I am the dark. I am the light.
I am the calm. I am the storm.
I am the hunter. I am the prey.
I am the knife. I am the blood.
"I've never had to avenge myself. Karma always takes care of that for me and if I'm a really good little girl, it lets me watch."
Study them like little lab rats.
I'm always watching the ones I don't trust.
They seek out the ones they know to be broken to see how much more damage they can cause.
Drown with me.
Lost alone.
Whispers of silence.
Fallen for the dark.
My psych meds are taken for your protection.
I think that you are quite delicious.
I owe you exactly nothing. Remember that.
When the people you tried to help are the ones stabbing you in the back. That.
"Block me again, baby. Feels good."
Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]   via @YouTube
"Alice, are you sleeping yet?"
I probably know you better than you know yourself.
"If I die, would you remember me?"
I'll endure it all while I quietly close my eyes.
I want to bleed out and feel myself getting weaker with every drop.
All the pain. Give it to me.
Send me your suffering so that I may feel alive.
Give me your hurting so that I may thrive.
That beautiful heart of yours. I'll cut it out of your chest and have it on display for the world to see what a heart is supposed to be.
Look at the stars.
Do not to purport to know who I am. I do not even hold that privilege myself.
"My soul is a raven. Soaring for meaning, enticed by slaughter."
"Don‚Äôt make an enemy out of me. I‚Äôm far too tired to put any effort forth, so I‚Äôd make a really shitty one."
What is the word for when people constantly believe your random tweets are written specifically for them?
I hope I die flying.
Swallow my soul. Gobble it up.
You're not special. Everyone dies.
Got my little crown on. Who will let me rule them?
"If you have to smile with only mouth or eyes, choose the eyes, otherwise you look like a fucking psychopath, but what do I know, maybe that's the look you're going for."
Blood and bones. Sticks and stones.
Comical consternation.
Disdain mixed with humour is my resting bitch face.
I was not put on this planet for your entertainment. I was put here for my own.
We're all just skulls here.
"Do those people actually exist, the ones who make you feel alive?, or are they all just a bunch of soul-depleting, tiresome, energy draining, hellish little vampires of human torment and misery?"
Maybe a soak and a cuddle.
Strangest case I ever did see.
I recognize passive aggression when I see it. I wrote the fucking book.
I'm just here handling my own shit. I'm sorry I couldn't handle yours too.
"If they allude to you being the black sheep enough times, you become one."
Where‚Äôs my shooter?
Queen of fucking nothing.
"Narcs don‚Äôt love, they deceive."
"If I change my avi one more time in the next 24 hours, I want some to step up and shoot me in the fucking head."
"I pissed you off? Well, take a number with the rest of the derelicts while I file your claim under ‚ÄúG‚Äù for Garbage."
Almost hit a crow today on the highway as it swooped down trying to feast on the carcass of a dead raccoon. Roadkill almost killed us all.
Fuck off.
Let the riffraff see themselves out.
"I'm a killer, in my mind. I've probably killed you a thousand times."
Do you know where your demons are?
I'm just waiting for one more person to say one more thing before POOF my head explodes.
Operatic arias but we're all just screaming together in a grande room.
Dreamt about you. You died.
The art of hiring a hitman.
‚ÄòMaybe the only reason you think you‚Äôre not good enough is because you‚Äôre surrounded by a bunch of fvcking cvnts.‚Äô
My pink little rosebud would love a silver-tongued devil.
Sing me to tears.
"Oceanic tides, tumultuous, violence of the moon, just like my moods."
"Wildflowers, growing rampant, like my will to infiltrate those that I love."
"Soaring skies, my wings, not yet anointed."
"Deep within the dark woods, a tree, etched with his name and mine."
"Tumbleweed, blowing aimless across deserted plains, my heart."
"Sleep well, Alice."
"Alice is special. Don't fuck with Alice, or else."
Her name is Alice.
It's all downhill from here.
Close your eyes and get lost in that guitar.
The world is full of unkept promises.
Hold your breath waiting for it because it never comes.
"Go to hell, Jezebel."
"Ahhh, motorcycle drivers. The louder the rev the smaller the dick."
"For those who understand me or attempt to, I thank you."
Die a little more each day.
Some fuck that shit and a whole lotta nope.
Purge everyone.
Purge everything.
"This one, Alice. @ComeForMe999"
"Might have to start insisting on peace, demanding it."
May the hells devour you.
Find me wandering amongst the ghosts.
Sorry I can't control when my bitch comes out.
Intimacy is seeing you laugh at something I said.
"I'm boycotting 'may the fourth be with you' twitter. I love Star Wars, but I can't stand the unoriginality of that particular phrase. See you on the fifth."
Violently at peace.
Growl like the animal you are.
I'd love to meet you for an hour or three. Pick your brain and see what you see.
"If the words fit, choke on them."
Thank you for fucking off.
"Where there is treachery, there are people."
"I might seem bad but once you get to know me, I'm much, much worse."
I certainly wouldn't put up with me. You shouldn't either.
"I often wonder to myself as I peruse the Twitter, are people that stupid?  Yes, yes they fucking are."
Through every forest Above the trees Within my stomach Scraped off my knees I drink the honey Inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive
I'll run away with you. üé∂
"You, strange as angels. üé∂"
Do you feel the words that you say or is it all auto-pilot?
Look them straight in the eyes but guard your back.
"Great, I see a donkey."
My default answer is no.
"Whatever you say, dear."
"And now children, I must sleep."
I‚Äôm of two mindsets. Kind and Kill.
Scene of the crime is inside my mind.
"If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, fuck off."
The asylum is outdoors.   It‚Äôs community.  It‚Äôs society.  It‚Äôs the general population.  Lunacy as far as the eyes can see.
"If you can‚Äôt handle a melancholic, cynical realist, see yourself out."
You‚Äôre not real.
The deed is done. No more resurrections.
Dead inside.
"‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt like what you are getting, change what you are giving.‚Äô"
I‚Äôm so sick of typical.
Give me more of you.
Did we take our funny pills today? You guys are fucking hilarious.
I go where the energy takes me.
"If I lived in the States, I would have killed by now."
The world is not the problem. It‚Äôs people. It‚Äôs always fucking people.
.. and sometimes the answer is Vodka. Most times.
Shoot me in the head with an Uzi or gtfo.
4 hours sleep and I‚Äôm off to drive north for 2 hours. I planned that well.
Ihre Zeit ist jetzt. Nimm es.
Moonfever.
Rancid reveries of your rotted existence.
Wretched thoughts of a withered soul.
Rampant cesspool of your ruination.
Lucidity of your waking nightmares.
Fetid stench of your rotting dreams.
Chicky chicky chicky cha cha kms
I adore sleep.
I think that my love of wings has to do with my longing for flight. Escape.
"Peace and quiet, ftw."
Going through the same motions time and time again but with different people is not only tedious but detrimental to my peace of mind.
Never confuse me expressing an opinion with me giving a shit.
I've dealt with a lot of people and that's why I don't like any of them.
"If I wanted to be ignored, I'd get married."
I don't want to know how you feel about me. I want to know how you feel about you.
Heart like a crime scene.
Lick these words off my tongue.
Isolate me in your crazy.
Retreating into the ether.
Open your mouth. I wanna jump in.
Don't worry about it. I don't.
I'm yours to forget.
Infinite oblivion of the blackest obsidian.
Your obsession is my weapon.
Eyes of the devil with no soul to sell.
Svicide dreams and a kiss to the forehead.
Bloodstained and your name on my lips.
"I live on the dark side of the moon, watching you."
"Just like the moon pulls the tides, I gravitate towards her."
Get me the fucking scissors.
"""Twitter Accepts Elon Musk‚Äôs Offer to Buy Company in $44 Billion Deal""  .... so which platform are we moving to next, guys? I'd like to set up my account before the shit hits the fan."
The beauty of life is you don't know how much time you have left which is also the blemish.
To scream silently and be heard.
Do you know what it's like to be at war with your own mind?
"I'm happy for all of the achievements you've attained in your life, but you have to understand that for some of us achievement is waking up each day and choosing life regardless of what our diseased minds are telling us to do."
Don't hide your insanity. Embrace it.
I am the monster.
Dare I follow?
Cute that you don't think I know my worth. Fuck off.
"You, with the sad eyes."
I don't think that asking for the basic minimum aka common courtesy is asking too much. Do you?
"When they say something sweet to you and then delete it? Nope, I'm not about that energy. Stand by your words or burn with them."
Evil deliciousness.
Counterfeit mediocrity.
I don't need this bull shit I won't put up  with it
I'll know it when I see it. I'll embrace it when I come across it. I'll love it and never leave it.
I will no longer entertain it.
Transparency witnessed through every charade presented.
Scorned bitch from a lover's tryst.
Feigned sentiments laced in cruelty.
Disdain and malice for the contemptuous ones.
Antipathy echoing down the corridors of my soul.
Mood.
I am the Queen of Night &amp; Torment.  Who are you?
"If I knew of a predator here, someone who's played many mind games with many different people. Someone who is relentless in their cruel treatment of others. Would you want to know who this person was or prefer I just let karma take the reins?"
Evanescence - Give Unto Me Lyrics   via @YouTube
Don't fuck with my people lest ye get fucked thyself.
Blow me away with your loaded questions.
Hold the weight of your own words.
Unbreak this broken.
"Beautiful, you are."
There is something so pure about a guy and his guitar.
Anyone know why there was a ring around my moon?
You don't care and that's okay.
Words bleed out of wounded souls.
Leider nicht.
"But I really, really want to."
I‚Äôm tempted to stir some shit but I know I shouldn‚Äôt.
Windy waters and stormy skies. My lake says Hi.
I do not receive your shit energy.
That moon though. Look up.
"If you write a rude, misogynistic comment under one of my tweets and then delete it because you do not have the balls to stand by your words, just know, I think you're a fucking coward. Have a nice day."
"Sure, Jan."
We are all just fading stars in the darkness of forever.
I'm foul. Few can handle me. I'm ok with that.
"I don't worship shit, except him.. maybe."
Resurrected to die again.
Skulls and skins. Broth and bones.
I keep my enemies in my back pocket.
Your lack of forgiveness tells me there is no room for growth.
Wish I fucking cared.
You think that you're better than everyone else and I think that you are laughable.
"Get off your high horse and meet me down in the trenches, motherfucker."
Territorial to a fault. Move away from me.
Don't think I don't see you coming.
"FTR, I‚Äôm team Depp."
I choose death.
Many a weak man.
"People disappoint me time and time and time again. I try not to care but I do, I do, I do."
Give me the broken. Give me the suffering. There is no place in my life for the contented.
My heart hurts.
Give me your silence so that I may feel peace.
Music so beautiful you have to close your eyes.
One for one and then it's done.
I miss you. I miss me with you.
Why am I the only one who feels the pain so deeply? No one else gives a damn.
"My God, the beautiful souls I come across here as well as the utter trash heaps. Peaks and valleys."
'Fear not the flame of my love's candle. Let it be the sun in your world of darkness.'
'Somehow it matters more to me.'
'Why should I care if they hurt you?'
'I'll drink your deadly poison.'
'Place onto me your burden.'
'I'll endure your suffering.'
'Give unto me your troubles.'
'I want to heal you. I want to save you from the dark.'
'All I want from you is your hurting.'
'That distance see through your disguise.'
'I've been watching you from a distance.'
Damsel in distress? I am the distress.
This is what I seek. Passion Ardour Devotion. Where is he?
It's true.. experience makes you so much wiser.
I'm getting better at spotting the discrepancies.
Do what I say.
"FFS. Twitter, I swear."
No one ever compares to him.
Baddest bitch in this fuck.
Last thing I remember is that you were a whore.
"Who wants red wine?  I do, I do."
Grumpy by nature.
"My brain ain't right, bitch."
"Broke that curse myself, motherfucker."
I've lost the fucking plot and I'm okay with that.
Aw. You found a new girl to harass. Adorable.
Patterns. Circles and triangles. Fuck 'em all.
Not enough for myself. Too much for everyone else.
Hateful little bitch.
Black and white. Filled with spite.
Soul filled asylum.
Heart of a lunatic.
Pretty little smile full of anarchy.
Tried saving you when I can't even save myself.
It's the Lord's Day. stfu. amen.
Too many people outside. Get the gun.
I wanna sleep for 65 days. Is that okay?
"Fuck it, I'm gonna go and listen to the birds."
Do I stay up until tonight seeing as it's morning and I haven't slept yet or do I go to sleep now?
"This man, this man. xx"
I could teach you a thing or two.
Atrocities in the name of love.
Leave me in silence.
Innocence defiled.
Gracious days long gone.
My respect for you lies in your treatment of me.
I watch good people fall and bad people rise and it breaks my fucking heart.
You are literal proof that angels roam the fucking planet.
'Wait till they get a load of me.'
"You know when people talk to you like they think you're stupid, but you know that you're not stupid but they keep talking to you like they think you are? Yes. Love that shit."
I'm too old for you. Move along.
Watching 911 calls on YT. LOL!! I'd love for some motherfucker to try my address.
[Redacted]
"The older I get, the less I care."
I hope you hate me a little.
Fucketh thee.
Inside jokes but with yourself.
What I want does not exist so I will go to my grave not wanting anymore.
Human decency and respect has nothing to do with your sex.
Rare are the people who actually give a true fuck about anyone other than themselves. Rare but existing.
I've always screamed for help but no one ever hears me as those screams are locked inside of me.
Your brain doesn't function like mine and that's okay. That's all right.
The beauty of a scar yet to be attained.
The lure of the English moors with their haunting mists and perilous cliffs.
Oceanic tides pulling you towards oblivion.
Blackened skies serenading me in shades of obsidian.
From alone to lonely to loner.
Ich bin m√ºde von Hintergedanken. Reinheit der Seele ist eine solche Seltenheit.
Einer nach dem anderen. Alles das selbe.
Nicht in Ordnung. Nicht Messe. Nicht akzeptiert.
Du hast ein Problem? Reichen Sie eine Beschwerde beim Spiegel ein.
"Die Leute werden versuchen, Ihnen all Ihre Energie zu entziehen, wenn Sie sie zulassen. Lass ihnen nicht."
Christ. You again.
I liked you better when you were gone.
Find me in the profoundness of your soul.
Find me in the rattle of your bones.
Find me in the beat of your heart.
Find me in the pulse of your veins.
Find me in the depth of your thoughts.
Evanescence is a mood.
The sex tweets just don't do it for me.
"How the fuck does a kid know what they wanna do for the rest of their lives at 18? Back then, I had stars in my eyes. Fine Arts/Arts. Acting. Now, if I had the choice, it would be a major in Criminology with a minor in Psychology. The education system is flawed."
"Find me within the trees, he said. The dark forest holds all of the answers."
"Understanding your personality in four questions:  1) What is your favourite animal in the world? 2) What is your second favourite animal in the world? 3) When you think of the ocean, what do you think of? 4) When you think of darkness, what do you think of?  Answer below."
I'm going to continue being me. What you do with yourself is up to you.
I need an emoji that says I love you but not love you I want to spend the rest of my life with you in wedded bliss love you just love you as a person love you.
You have a problem with me?  Good.
Die with me so I know it's real.
Where do I see myself in 5 years?  I don't.
A muse and her ravens.
Sanity is overrated.
"I‚Äôm all rain, ravens and wretchedness."
"If you want to be happy, just be happy is about the stupidest thing I've ever heard."
"You've gone through life with a healthy, disease free mind. Good for you. Mine was damaged from the start."
"I try so hard not to be sad. Too hard. If you're sad, you're sad. Ride with it."
"Haunt you in your dreams, lover."
Addendum: I'm not bothered by it.
"Right now, at this precise moment in time, I'm content. All I can really ask for."
I will never be good enough. I know that now.
The intrigue of new people is not lost on me even though I hate 99% of them.
Escaping the ghost of you.
You look like a fucking skull.
"I‚Äôm sorry guys, that‚Äôs all I have tonight. Everything is poo aka shit."
Will Smith. Will. Poo.
Putin. Pootin. Poo.
Putin gets a whole war and I can‚Äôt even get one kill without my ass landing in jail.
If you only knew.
My rage is never far from the surface.
"You‚Äôre not special, you‚Äôre typical."
Don‚Äôt take me seriously. Never take me seriously.
Kudos to those that quit drinking. I would never. I could never.
I wanna go in a blast of gunfire.
People playing hard to get when they‚Äôre already hard to want.
"A lot of people don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs you. They just care that it‚Äôs someone, anyone."
Isn‚Äôt she beautiful?
Hahahahahahaha.. no.
Off to the lake to see some gorgeous.
The road was long and it led to nowhere.
you wonder where the real ones are what giant cave hides them as the deathly talentless bow to accolades as the fools are fooled again you wonder where the real ones are if there are real ones ‚Åª·¥Æ·µò·µè·µí ∑À¢·µè‚Å±
Married to the woods.
Enshrouded in nightmare.
Is there nothing pure anymore?
Inundated with unsavoury characters.
A deluge of mediocrity.
Cataclysm of madness hovering.
Shattered dreams chasing you with their thorny spikes.
Listen closely. Trust no one.
"Fuck, now I'm hungry."
Filet mignon rare/medium rare. Garlic mash and asparagus. Red wine. A shiraz. Leave the bottle. Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e
Chris Rock&gt;Will Smith
"Since I was a little girl, the Oscars have always been my little safe world of beauty and decadence. Thanks for thugging that shit up with your ghetto behaviour #WillSmith. Apparently, you can now assault someone in front of millions with no repercussions if you're famous enough."
I've come so far but where the hell am I going?
I have ceased to give all fucks.
Ever taste blood and wonder who you‚Äôve killed?
Comical. That's what it is.
"And you go about your day, don't you? Not even realizing the wrath I hold within."
Watch out here I come.
"I mean your voice, come on..."
You have no idea how sick I am of the people on this planet.
Taxi down that runway of anguish.
Lotta heartbreakers out there. Beware.
There is something about me that is not fit for human consumption. Fucking good.
I cry a lot for a self-sufficient functioning human being.
"If the energy does not match, abort: default repository not configured."
Masquerades and murder.
Too evil to let go.
you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies you've run out of lies
'I'm not the one who's run out of lies.'
Please don't fuck with me because then I'll have to fuck back and you would not like that.
Your eyes are fucking empty.

"I'll take the man with the wings for $500, Alex."
The pain is the one who calls the loudest.
Don't play with people lest they play back.
That smile is what I need right now.
The skies can open up and take me now.
I once fell from Cloud Nine. Wouldn't recommend.
Take my hand and lead me to darkness.
Motion sickness from this downward spiral.
My mind is a fucked up place where good thoughts go to die.
Dream with me in shades of blood and gore.
Sing me a lullaby of corruption and deceit.
I spend my time healing. You spend yours suffering. We are not the same.
Looks like a 'Dune' night. *turns TV off*
That betrayal was my blessing.
I envy the dead.
Life is just one disappointment after another.
Normalize not being a cvnt.
"If I cared for your opinion, I'd beat it out of you."
"""Your eyes are too big for your face"" and other complimentary insults."
I do not receive crap energy.
"Sharpen that knife, baby."
Should have exalted you sooner.
Love is not enough.
"Then, he kissed my cheek."
We never said good-bye.
I've died a thousand times.
I won't be loved.
Pay attention. Fucking learn something.
One day you will understand that being a friend is more important than being a lover.
You kill me and plead insanity.
The girl with the haunted eyes.
You can be mad over there and I'm going to be at peace over here.
Feature in the works! Can't wait to see it!
I didn't change. Your perception of me did.
"No, are YOU ok?"
My sweet hell is mine alone.
Counting the days to my oblivion.
"There I go, angering people with my existence again."
"‚ÄòHow do I politely say, suck my fucking dick?‚Äô"
Staring right through people in the land of promised nothing.
Heralded yet withheld.
Adored yet despised.
Encouraged yet dismayed.
Escaped yet remained.
You wrong that read.
I don't know you. You certainly don't know me. Let's fucking keep it that way.
I think my windows are about to blow out of their frames.
"The crappier the weather, the better my mood."
Let the night take me.
Let the wind sweep me away.
Let the rain drown me.
"Inclement weather, how exciting!"
I just mute the ones who irritate me.  I only block the rotten souls.
Poisoned lips whisper the sweetest lies.
Fuck! I'm getting petty in my old age. Reciprocated energy or blocked. That's it.
They will say whatever they have to say to get what they want. They don't mean it. They never mean it.
Can't build a future when we keep making mistakes of the past.
"My superpower is seeing through people. Not their bodies, their intentions."
Clean that filthy mouth before speaking to me.
Swallow my soul but remember to choke on it.
Take away my peace and scream war.
Where's your fucking heart?
Not having a good mental health day. Hope you guys are faring better.
A long-term follower who suddenly unfollows you? I return the favour. I don't want to hear about it and fuck you too.
You wanna die? Cuz I could arrange it.
The curse of an existence.
The skipping of a heartbeat.
The selling of a soul.
The weight of a promise.
Look how pretty! üì∑: _phantasy_captures_
The violence of a look.
We‚Äôre thinking of causing a commotion. Who‚Äôs in?
Hello. üñ§
I like to keep my enemies close.
My generation is
Something so beautiful within the shades of grey.
"Whenever I think of my life pre-social media, I feel so sorry for you young fucks that never got to experience it."
Did you hear my words or did you ignore them?
The weeping willows need my attention.
Fuck off with your stupidity.
I‚Äôd kill for my kid.
"Watching true crime and it‚Äôs adorable the way these people get off on a clerical error, lol!! If it were my kid, I‚Äôd be the judge, jury and executioner."
"If you‚Äôre going to be a delusional fuck, do it on your own time."
"You ever respond to a tweet and then think, fuck that, you‚Äôre on your own with your fucked up ideas? Ya, just happened to me."
World Sleep Day. Perfect.
Heart for sale.
Skull for rent.
Hate means you still give a fuck.
The moon is partially hidden behind a cloud. Looks ominous.
Look at this gorgeous crowd of mine.
"Hey @ThetweetofGrimm, can I get an ETA? I'm about done here."
I‚Äôm just another skull.
 Ä…õ…ñ …¶÷Ö»∂ «ü’º…ñ …Æ ü ä…õ  ü÷Ö ã…õ.
"You be the bridge, I'll be the fire."
Put me out of my misery.
Annihilate me.
"Better yet, paper birds."
Flying paper airplanes off a cliff and chill?
Everything I touch dies.
Tired of being tired.
Pressed petals held with their promised secrets from yesteryear.
I was born on a Wednesday so don't talk to me about woe.
Queen of Swords. Bloodshed. The war of the mind. I fight it every day.
Never met a vodka I didn't like.
You ever come across someone who only wants to talk about themselves? Couldn't give a fuck what you're up to just want to verbally assault your ears with their bullshit? No thanks. My ears are closed for business.
The normals are so cute when they tweet about darkness.
"I have you by the balls, bitch. You just don't know it yet."
Pretty face don't mean no pretty heart.
Show me a God who cares. I'll wait here.
Dangerous liaisons.
Focus on yourself. Eyes on your own fucking plate.
"They say when you say you don‚Äôt care, you actually do. They are wrong."
Don‚Äôt worry about it. I probably don‚Äôt care anyway.
Get your head out of your ass.
I do this shit to myself.
"The most important thing is laughter. You have that and your health, you‚Äôre ahead of the game."
I love humanity but I hate humans.
He‚Äôs a people person and I hate people.
"When I say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bring your drama my way.‚Äù, I mean it."
Soul crushing pain has me in its vice grip.
You‚Äôre too happy to understand my sad.
I will live to die again.
Magnetic vibes electrocuting me.
I'm the haunted one.
Ghost girl disappears.
Ghost girl haunts the living.
Ghost girl dances on graves.
Ghost girl seeks meaning.
Ghost girl seeking the mist.
I would only corrupt you.
Love letters and other suicide notes.
Love letters and svicide notes.
Scarred wrists and a gleam in your eye.
The beauty of shibari around your throat.
Sawed-off shotgun and tears on your pillow.
Downward spirals and other directional pulls.
I have a bad attitude and no apologies to give.
I didn't mean my own.
Swear to God I'm ready for death.
·¥π·µÉ ≤·µâÀ¢·µó‚Å±·∂ú.
Savoury&gt;Sweet
I'm no delight. Remember that.
DST? What the fuck for?
"It‚Äôs morning, good night."
I hope that all of my Australian friends are safe and well. Fucking floods.
I am the cloak. I am the dagger.
Reciprocated energy is my favourite.
You know I mean you. I love that.
"Intrigued, mister."
I love when my words hit their intended target.
Damn. You caught my eye. Very few do that.
I'm always watching.
I watched you disappear.
I watched you block me.
I watched you give up on me.
I watched you break us.
It starts with love.
I need to move away from that conflicted state of existence and surround myself with peace.
I'm watching you.
Foul hearts and rotted souls.
Sometimes the profile pics are a little too pretty and I feel compelled to ugly myself up a little. Enjoy.
People can say whatever they want to say. Words in the wind. It doesn't affect me.
I'm watching murder because that's what makes me happy.
"I just wanna wear this, drink my red wine and edit photos. Is that so wrong?"
My problem has always been myself.
"I like words, not people."
"You are a vision of loveliness, my flower."
"Instead of going up, my twitter count keeps going down. Good."
"If all brides are beautiful, why are all wives so ugly? I will never marry."
"Most men don't want a firecracker, they'd prefer a dish rag which is why I don't prefer most men."
"Tit for tat, motherfucker. You get what you give."
Silent screams pack the most power.
"The killer in me is the killer in you, my love. üé∂"
"Think horseradish/wasabi burn, which is more concentrated in the nasal/sinus cavity. I can do that, I enjoy that, but spicy chili pepper SHU pungency, no thanks."
"I'm in an 'I'd like to kill everyone I come across but I don't want to do any jail time' type of mood. Oh wait, that's every day."
I just wanted to let you know that I hear you and I've felt that pain.
The more I have to engage with the world around me the more I realize I no longer wish to be a part of it.
Filter myself into non-existence.
Do not romanticize the twitter.
I am a fucking train wreck.
Ignore is short for ignorance.
Your opinion of me is your opinion.
Pray that I never want you.

‚ÄòI avoid drama because I‚Äôm scared of me not them. My attitude goes from zero to prison real motherfucking quick.‚Äô
Bring you to tears with my pathetic life.
Take me back to the beginning.
Tell me your secrets.
Would you like your very own chalk outline?
"Fucking go then, like they all do."
My wounds will be with me forever.
"Can anyone offer me peace? No, I have to find that for myself."
"Hold their hands, or don't. They're gonna fuck you over regardless."
I've been alone from the start.
I am so fucking tired of everything and everyone.
"Take your racist, narcissistic, pathological lying, hypocritical, I can do no wrong, holier than thou, petty piece of shit attitude the fuck off this page.  All pessimists welcome."
Wtf am I looking at? Wrong answers only.
A bouquet of scandal for the sanctimonious.
"Do you ever just look at someone's face and think,  ""I'd smack that."""
Head in the clouds and other maladies of thought.
Oblivion is closer than you think.
Mental seclusion of an inattentive mind.
I cry alone.
I've died a thousand times.
I could listen to water move forever.
Went for a walk earlier..
"Lonely star, join my constellation."
You don't have to love me just love me.
"Summon me, my darling."
Wretched love whispering vile obscenities.
A vessel of corruption permeated with sin.
I wanna live in the forest.
Devil worships at my altar.
They came after me.
"Don‚Äôt fuck with me, little man."
"You stupid, stupid boy. You don‚Äôt see me."
See yourself through my eyes.
Drunk.
You come across comme un jackass.
You think you‚Äôre clever? lol
"Hush hush, darling."
Tightrope walking on a razor's edge.
My heart is an apocalypse.
I'm all about the edges.  The edge of reason.  The edge of sanity.  The edge of a cliff.
The poetry of trees.
"Take my hand, ffs."
Your problem with me is your problem.
You don't know fuck about shit.
Froth at the mouth so I know that you're wild.
Sleep is all I have.
‚ÄúLeave my loneliness unbroken‚Äù ..
I‚Äôm done trying to keep the peace. Let‚Äôs start wars.
He doesn't 'out' you because he's a decent human being. Me? Not so much.
I used to believe in 'the one'. No longer.
Iced out. Crystallized intelligence. Snowbound and loving it.
Please don't put me in the position of showing you how ice cold my heart can get.
Who are you? Who am I? We don't know.
I see dead ‚ÅΩ·µó·µí ·µê·µâ‚Åæ people.
"Ballerina girl, all feathers and lace."
I can almost guarantee that your receipts are nothing like my own.
Would it kill you to know he was dming others and telling them he was in love with them the day before he added your name to his bio? Probably. Get over it.
"Selfish fucking people, thinking of no one other than themselves."
So many monsters.
I'm going to settle my scores and leave this planet in peace.
That one is fiery. Let me eat them.
You can kill someone without murdering them.
"Shhh, breathe into me."
"You are witness to an online predator grooming their next victim, do you.."
I've already hurt. Now it's your turn.
"Cry me a fucking river, bitch."
I like when people try and fuck with me.  See what wrath I'm capable of.  Try me.
"Butchered and bare, I invoke thee."
Devour the ones who swallow you whole.
Bloodstained and belligerent.
Crimson flowing like your shattered dreams.
Tell me you've loved. Show me those scars.
"Love always ends up in the trash heap, but hatred lasts forever."
Love? What the fuck is love?
"Violent to the Femme, motherfucker."
"I see you over there, skulking in the afterlife."
"Bang, bang, you're dead."
You can only be a menace for so long before the troops gather and open fire.
Humans bore me.
Torment everlasting summons you.
The fallacy of hopes and dreams.
Anguished incarnates seeking absolution.
Shadows lurking in places unseen.
Seeking the ruin of your failed existence.
Which do you like more?
Falling asleep to the waking of the birds.
At least you‚Äôre up in the morning. I‚Äôm going to bed.
My heart belongs in a jar.
The wickedest monster of all.
Blow my brains out or don‚Äôt even bother.
"Seedy, sly and underhanded. Just how I like ‚Äòem."
The duality of a cunning ego.
Go insane with me or gtfo.
"I need your heart, delicately seared and served on a platter, with a nice Shiraz."

Svicide girl with a head full of trauma.
"I love him so much, it just turns to hate. üé∂"
"Pull the other one, why don't you?"
I still feel you hovering. Don't.
You're gonna need to fuck off a little faster than that.
"Run, but you can't hide."
"She's all love, ardour, need.  I'm all fuck, that, shit."
‚àÇœÉ‚Ñì‚Ñì œÅŒ±—è—Ç—ï
You. Strange as angels. üé∂
Breathe.
You are not anonymous and the internet is forever. Think before you post.
A strong rainstorm deep within the forest is one of the most beautiful sounds you will ever hear.
Don't include me in your fucked up fantasies. I am not that girl.
Now you can watch them wilt and decay.
"Here, I killed some flowers for you."
Flowers in a vase are just the saddest thing.
Madness creeps like a stealthy stalker.
Chasms of lunacy lick the corners of my mind.
The darkness drowns me in waves of obsidian.
Chaotic disorder of a damaged psyche.
"My mortal hell, where entropy reigns supreme."
Putin is Pinky. Where‚Äôs the Brain? Narf.
"Question everything, always."
No soul to sell.
Save me from myself.
"Depression lingers, like honey on a spoon."
"Sadness envelops, like mist in the trees."
"Laughter erupts, like uncorked champagne."
"Tears stream, like rain falling through the clouds."
"Thoughts arrive, like ravens breaking through the sky."
Deeper into the forest.
The trees are always listening.
Oblivion is closer than you think.
"Come, walk into the darkness with me."
My void is your void.
No one gets my humour and I‚Äôm ok with that.
Ludicrous with a taste for trysts.
"You don't fit in because you are feared by those cotton-headed, do what you're told, never question anything types."
Fuck. Forgot to add the source. It was ‚Åª ·¥Æ·µò·µè·µí ∑À¢·µè‚Å±.
Fire another one at me.
Mouth full of bullets.
I like to prowl ordinary places  and taste the people  from a distance
"Talk to whomever you like. Fuck whomever you like. No one gives a single, solitary shit about it."
You give them the fuel to ridicule you.
"I'll believe what you tell me until you're caught in a lie, then I will no longer believe anything coming from you."
The people with the brilliant ideas are not necessarily the loudest talkers.
I hope I die soon.
"All for you, Devil."
Swallow my soul.
Strangers are coming.
"Love is respect, not abuse."
I could be your worst enemy. If you'd want me to be.
".. and then, there are those who do not learn from life's lessons. Failing repeatedly to understand them. Doomed to repetitive patterns. Over and over and over again."
Narcs only love themselves.

"If you don't like my profile, fuck off. If you don't like my words, fuck off. If you don't like my pictures, fuck off. It's really all so fucking simple.  Fuck off."
"It's not murder if they annoy the fuck out of you. Then, it's a favour."
I‚Äôve adopted your attitude. Look out for some ‚Äòyou‚Äô coming back at you.
"It‚Äôs not stalking if you‚Äôre on a mission. Then, it‚Äôs an assignment."
My skies are always stormy.
"Everyone is entitled to an opinion, even the stupid fucks, unfortunately."
I'm fictional.
I don't wanna be a human. I wanna be a raven. I wanna shit on humans.
They tell you they love you then show you they don‚Äôt.
"When I say fuck you, what I mean is fuck you."

"The millisecond you recognize that no one gives a fuck about you, is the exact moment you regain your freedom."
"Jesus Fucking Christ, the patheticism here."
I don't care who the fuck you're salivating over. I'm not here for that.
They all wish for death until they see me standing there with my knife.
Careful what you wish for because I‚Äôm a dream believer and your days are fucking numbered.
I would commit murder for you. Your own.
Sit at my altar in sacrifice.
Exsanguinate yourself to show me your divine reverence.
Harden me with your lack of care.
Wrench me away with your fossilized bones.
Rip me apart with your gaze of thorns.
"Happy Birthday to you, wherever the fuck you are."
Love? Fuck love. Give me understanding.
Please excuse the intrusion but I had a spelling error in my bio for fucking weeks and no one pointed it out to me. I would have appreciated if someone had. Please check your bios for such errors. My apologies. It‚Äôs the OCD in me.
Better things to do than acknowledge your piteous existence.
I would like to think that people reach out to check up on me without having ulterior motives. I would like to think that but I don‚Äôt.
Tree by night. Tree by day.
Mother Nature says Fuck You.
"Clownlike, happiest on your hands, Feet to the stars, and moon-skulled, Gilled like a fish. A common-sense Thumbs-down on the dodo‚Äôs mode. Wrapped up in yourself like a spool, Trawling your dark as owls do. -Plath"
"Vague as fog and looked for like mail. Farther off than Australia. Bent-backed Atlas, our traveled prawn. Snug as a bud and at home Like a sprat in a pickle jug. A creel of eels, all ripples. -Plath"
You need to die.
"The inside of my head, a battlefield."
"The next time you die, make it for keeps."
Obsidian beats of scarlet wounds.
"It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me. I get annoyed whenever I see the devastation he breeds."
I was never the player. I could never do that to another human being. Fuck all the players. It‚Äôs their turn to bleed.
I used to brood and bleed. Now I release and flee.
"There comes a time when you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move on from it."

Wretchedness in human form.

Wickedness in the prettiest of vessels.
I liked it better when you were dead.
Try not being a cvnt today.
"The dark origins of Valentine's Day, that's what I celebrate."
I gave you my heart and you wasted my time.
I am skilled in the art of torturing myself.
Blood on your sacred hands.
Make voodoo dolls and chill?
The silence that destroyed the pain.
The teardrops that doused the flame.
Bleeding crimson onto to bleached bone.
Ensnared thoughts like a crown of thorns.
I'm intrigued by troubled minds because I have one.
Forget about me better than that.
Hide me in your thoughts until you can no longer find me.
Cute the way you think there are no consequences.
I can hear the ravens calling me home.

I always knew you'd be a problem I'd have to take care of.
Take your hate and deprecate.

"Our planet offers us beauty, oxygen and nourishment. We give it war, crime and disease."
Heathen swine. Cleanse thyself.
You are the disease.
Scratch your eyes out.
Riotous psyche shrieking into oblivion.
Decrepit fervor of a piteous soul.
Foul little flower.
Shelf full of pickled hearts.
Bleached these bones myself.
Shove these roses down your throat and bloom.
Claim your chaos.
Tame your treachery.
Save the date but for my sv!c!de.
Welcome to the inside of my head.
Murder my dreams.
Slaughter my hope.
Eviscerate my soul.
Assassinate my character.
Kill my kindness.

"Sloppy seconds ain't my style, motherfucker."
Just remember that it doesn't matter. Nothing does.
You have the intelligence of a fucking gnat.
Think of me whenever you see ravens fly.

Be the stars to my darkened skies.
The ravens are my midnight.
My 21 day challenge is to get someone to do away with me.
My soul is not fucking pretty.
Strangle me with sin.
Punish me with perversion.
Maim me with morality.
Curse me with corruption.
Drown me in debauchery.
You will never rid yourself of me.
How many more deaths must I endure before the end comes?
Stop my heart with your depart.
Bruises are the prettiest shade of everything.
Make me shiver with your lack of consider.
Break my bones with your stone cold heart.
Leave yourself alone.
Get to the part where you broke my heart.
Did you ever have the feeling you could take no more?
I was put on this planet for pain.
"This was mine, he said. ‚ô•"

"If you're into nightmares, I'll make your dreams come true."
"When I die, I'd better be dead. That means no subconscious floating around the ether please."
Death? Where do I sign up?
Place your heart on this cutting board.
Painstakingly averting dishonourable intentions.
Discriminate behaviour deterring scrupulous actions.
Symbolic meaning offering no clarity.
Help me.
This world is dead.
Give me something to believe in.
The softest touch on the sharpest dagger.
I am not fit to live. Kill me.
It's just a kiss away.

Crime of passion. Would that be so bad?
May the bowels of hell open up and swallow me whole.
"Get over here, Devil. I'm ready for you."
Give me all of your money for sweet bugger all. - Whores.
"When are you up for parole? Me, flirting."
Fuck. Forgot my wings today.
I'm about as imperfect as you can get and I'm okay with that.
"All of us, fighting those things in our heads that no one else knows about."
I miss myself.
What I miss never fucking existed except in my own head.
STFU before mine overheats.
We all have an internal combustion engine.
Tired of listening to your incessant chatter.
Militant offerings of a love warfare.
A padded cell built for two.
Insane asylums and other vacation destinations.
My mind is a madhouse.
Emotional vortex swirling down towards oblivion.
Maelstrom in my head.
Ever stare off into space and not realize you‚Äôve zoned out?
The cost of love will not be my peace.
Combative hearts fighting for their truth.
The saddest eyes I‚Äôd ever come across and all I wanted was to see them happy.
"One tear escaped from those cold, uncaring eyes."
Pour me a cup of your ambivalence.
Verbal hypocrisy. Pretty little liar.
"When you shake their beliefs, they call you demon."

"Your sacred hands, blood stained."
I'm not okay and that's okay.

Fighting over what/who everything/everyone belongs to is a waste of time. Nothing is yours. Everything and everyone is on borrowed time.
"I'm sorry, I don't do political twitter because I honestly don't give a fuck. They're all corrupt."
"You might not be alone when you die, but you will die alone."

Cotton-headed masses with the blinders on.
Fool your brain into believing you are sated.
Nothing will last. We are all transient.
Reach out for anything that offers escape but even that will slide through your fingers.
"Good luck with that. Eventually, it will turn into a problem, as everything does."
Got my murder eyes on.
Mindless monotony of repetitive routine.
If I repeat it enough maybe it will stick.

Some of us are just looking at the skies.
I left my heart in 2021.
"Unfortunately for me, love doesn't just dissipate. It lingers and it wishes and it howls and it begs me to listen."
Moon up there flirting with me.
The blood of your enemies. The crushed bones of those who have wronged you and the black souls of death.
Baise toi.
When they say that they‚Äôll protect you what they mean is they‚Äôll devour you.
You make it far too easy for me.
No way out.
"Dismal, drab, and desolate."
Somber shadows tickling the edge of my psyche.
My mind shrouded in darkness.
I assert dominance by hissing at people in public.
My resting bitch face is disdainful disgust.
I'm all cynic and cyanide.
Don't cut yourself on my broken.
You'll have to kill me to cure me.
Meet me where the stars don't shine.
Wrap your arms around my indignation.
"I'm a lefty, but I write with my right hand. Can someone explain this?"
I always knew you‚Äôd pull the trigger.
Existence. Therein lies the madness.
Mood: Get the fuck away from me.
lol! The snow literally looks like it's been chewed on.
"Snow plow boxed my car in. Waist deep snow (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù) and no fucking shovel. Used two dust pans for digging, some kicking (the snow not the car), some fancy in car manoeuvring, some cursing and a whole lot of fucking rage but my car is now free. Fuck winter.  True story."
You are not okay.
The forest and I. A love story.
I am composed of solitude.
My heart loves you but my brain can't stand you.
"You have to crawl deep within their psyches and hide well so just when they feel like they've forgotten you, !!boom!!, there you are again."
"All toxins need removing, especially those of the human variety."

Overflowing cesspool of psychological disturbances.

"Come a little closer to my cage, my darling."
"End of the world, you comin'?"
I'm more deranged than you think.

"The first full moon of 2022 will be the Wolf Moon, expected to grace our skies at 6:48pm EST on January 17. This full moon was so named because villagers used to hear packs of wolves howling in hunger around this time of the year."
Because of you.
"Cut me loose.. .. I reach out.  Cut me off.. .. I reach out.  Cut me out.. .. still, I reach out."
I am not awake.
"Dig my grave a little faster, darling."
Kill me like you mean it.
Bring me your corruption.
Meet me at the slaughterhouse.
Seashells and hidden hells.
Stuffed that pain down but it's back again.
I'm bleeding out with every move I take.
You killed me in your mind and left me behind.
You aimed at my heart and pulled the fucking trigger.
Rope of the finest quality still burns.
Pills of poison. Internal promises.

Provocative seduction.

Carnal corruption.
Recklessly sinful.
Spiritually wicked.
You do not want to be on my radar.
I believe in seek and destroy.
Someone once told me I had 'strong eyes' and I had no clue what they meant. Maybe they meant death glare.
Shrieking into that goddamn abyss.
I'm a fucking ghost and you can't hear me.
Funny how I'm here tweeting but no one recognizes that I'm already dead.
Everything comes to an end.
Everything will break.
Everything is dark.
Don't fuck with me unless you're ready.
"Come closer, little flower. Fuck with me more. It energizes."
I'm in the hands of consequence.
My hate is not fake.
"""Aren't you excited for......""  No bitch, I'm excited for death."
I could kill you but I think it would be far worse for you to let you live.
I'm always the villain in everyone's story.

Stormy heart. That's why the tears keep coming.

Take the mask off and you will find another.
Existential angst fuelled by psychiatric maladies.
Sorrowful meanderings of hidden connotations.
Fragmented figments of illusory meaning.
Bury the broken ones and watch them bloom.
Death whispers in my ear.
"For every one person who thinks, ponders and carefully considers before opening their fly trap, there are a million others who spew verbal diarrhea like it's going out of style."

Tug-of-war but it's only my head trying to make a decision.

Leave a legacy? For what? For who? They're going to die too.
"Before doing anything today, remember that none of it matters. You're going to die regardless."
"And there she was, a beautiful flower growing down in the pits of hell."
"Dangerous minds and you, over there, unaware."
I'm never more dangerous than when I've been awakened before it's time.
I hate waking up.

You do not break people for your own amusement.
"My head smartened up in a hurry. My heart, not so fast."
I belong to death.

Be gone shallow enders.
I tend to gravitate towards people of substance.

Charmed by your combativeness.
Besotted with your belligerence.

Stop talking to me with words in your mouth.
We are desperately in need of a cataclysmic event.
I'd be the belle of the ball in this.
Damned if I do. Disappointed if I don't.
A cold day in hell has arrived.
A dumpster for all of those lies.
Bleached those bones myself.
Licked a promise and it dissolved.
I felt nothing and it felt good.
I am a tree now.
I'm going to close my eyes now and you're all going to disappear.

Waste deep in demise.
The cold is soul deep.

I guess it's too much to ask to dissolve into nothingness.
You stop trying when you realize it always ends the same way.
"You are just like the other and the other, just like you."
"There is no such thing as an ego death. Short of blasting your brains out, you're stuck with that fucker for life."
Don't waste your hate on the undeserving.

Everyone's gone mad.
I have nothing more to contribute tonight other than hate and venom. If you all would excuse me.
I'd rather cut off my hand than reach out for anyone again.
To die on my birthday so my tombstone dates are aesthetically pleasing.
Find me amongst the ruin.
I'll take up residence in your mind and kick you out of your own head.
Fade away until you are no longer here.
I would destroy myself before giving you the chance to.

Choke me with your promises.
Burn me to the ground with that look in your eyes.
Kiss me on the forehead before placing me in my grave.
Blow my head off and let these thoughts escape.
Crack open my rib cage and let the ravens out.
Drown the flowers in my mouth.
Hate me harder.
Be the one who makes them curse their existence.
The urge to kill is strong with that one.
I'm in the wrong place. There has to be a chill kill app somewhere on the nets.
"Games, games, games, games, games. What the fuck else you got?"
I love the ones who admit to being a piece of shit. Like that shit absolves them of anything.
I like to refer to myself as violently destructive.
All this talk of craving another human being. I crave alcohol. I crave annihilation. I crave your head on a platter.
"Trust me, I'm not interested."
I could blow up your perfect little world in an instant.

Anyone else celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve (December 24th) or is it just me?
Christmas is like any other day for me. I only celebrate for the elders of my tribe.
To fly away and be free.
No one can save me from destruction of self.
Cut you like a promise.
Watch the petals decay with me.
"Wilted flower, barbed wire thorns."
Those damaged boys who like to steal hearts for collection.
Look away so I can steal your heart.
I'm waiting to hear of your demise.
Transplant of heart to excise the demons.
Your eyes are the prettiest shade of dead.
Sky full of stars and your hand in mine.
Love like blood.
Suicide love.
Solitude is where it's at.
Whoever wired my brain up did it wrong.
Your hate doesn't affect me. Your love does.
Throw that hate over here so I can absorb it.
Hand yourself over to me.
Sleepwalking through life.
Learn that lesson before it kills you.
Wings of deceit floating through the ether.
Recipe for disaster simmering on the back burner.
We are all broken to varying degrees.

"Speaking of unhinged, can I pour you a cup?"

Isn't it sad that we've all mastered the ability to turn feelings off.
You're just a picture on my wall.
Can I eat your face?
I will always be left to hover amongst the stars.
Death doesn't come to me. It walks with me.
Fade myself out into non existence.
The ghosts are listening.
Can you tell me what you're on because I need a bit of that insanity in my life.
Mouth full of blood.
I am a monster.
The reason I don't engage is because I know how ugly I can get.
"The things I could tell you, little flower."
Remain silent and do not move.
Giggle in the corner like a fucking lunatic.
Join the masses with your fake laughter.
Stare down the homicidal.
Devour the minds of the soulless ones.
"When they ask your profession, tell them motherfucking warrior."
"Life goes on and so do we, until we don't."
Time for those tides to turn in my favour.
We all put up with a lot of shit.
"Stop creeping my page, swindler."
Take your inadequacies and leave at once.
Zero tolerance for idiocy.
I exist within the madness.
Make me an offer I can't refuse.
Stealing hearts for a living.
"""You're a demon."" said the demon."
Windy af. Hope the world ends.
Demonic stirrings of a love long lost.
Not even the Devil can save me now.
"Take a step back, reflect. These are real people you're dealing with here."
Tidal forces are calling my name.
Try not to fuck with me too much. I fuck back.
You sold your soul to the devil and now you seek absolution?
"If someone else is paying for the roof over your head, please stop talking about how tough your life is."

Be careful how you treat people lest it come back to bite you in the ass.
Sitting behind a computer desk doesn't make you a god.
Pieces of shit being pieces of shit thinking no one is going to call those pieces of shit out on being pieces of shit.
Hahahahahahaha! And don't you fucking forget it.
"Forgive and forget? Fuck that, avenge."
It's all there. I must simply unleash it.
My murder. My crew.
There is a part of you they can't touch. You have to listen to that part.
Always let them throw the first punch. Anything you do after that is self-defence.
Gather intel before making your move. Always.
Don't tell kids that they didn't see what they said they saw.
The 'you' you showed me wasn't the 'you' you are.
Can you see why I feel numb?
Ever wonder what it would feel like to lay on a cloud?
"Shall we scrap? I promise you, I'll win."
"You made it my business to know everything about you just by being the vile little bitch that you are, darling."
Pull my strings.
"If you are smiling in your avi, do not follow me. Thanks."
"I'm not interested in the man, I'm interested in the misery."
"In the end, vile people will be their own downfall, always."
"You, my dear, are off your fucking rocker."
Kind souls are where it's at.
The heart does as it pleases.
I am not alive.
I'm looking right at you.
Keep that blade sharp.
Bring guillotines back.
"Soul eater, rip mine to shreds."
Gasoline heart and a match ready to strike.
"Shh, let the night take you."
Oblivion will whisper your name.
"That warm, loving embrace you so desperately covet."
Wings of gossamer shining in the pale moonlight.
Floating through the ether. His hand on my back.
Sorrowful musings for the reckless ones full of contemplation.
"Trust me, you don't want me to speak my mind."
Maybe there is some truth to what she says. Maybe a little bit more than you're willing to admit.
"I‚Äôve never been lonely. I‚Äôve been in a room I‚Äôve felt suicidal. I‚Äôve been depressed I‚Äôve felt awful, awful beyond all But I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering me ‚Åª ·∂ú ∞·µÉ ≥À°·µâÀ¢ ·¥Æ·µò·µè·µí ∑À¢·µè‚Å±"
Don't.
Eyes full of sadness.
"No more games, I can't."
To always make our way back to each other.
Beautiful souls make me cry. So few of them left in this world.
Get angry at it. Fix it. Stop letting the world make a pansy out of you.
I've always been the devoted one. The one who would break herself to fix another.
My heart is an apocalypse.
Tell the devil I'm on my way.
Let the wind take me home.
A place in time where everything stands still.
Darkness and a death wish.
The beasts that howl within.
"I‚Äôll seize the night, thanks."
Killer eyes and a heart to match.
Obliterate me already.
Cruel intentions of a devious nature.
Silken webs of deceit.
Entangled within a narcissist's snare.
Handful of promises taken with a shot of vodka.
Watch the ravens peck your eyes out.
You ever just wanna shake some sense into someone?
"Fuck you, I'm delightful."
The ravens are coming for me.

"Train wreck of a person, your track is running out."
"People are like magic. Once you figure them out, poof!!, they disappear."
I've got the devil in my back pocket.
"For the people who have me blocked, I'm happy with your decision."
They get so fired up when you don't feed into their bullshit. Little critters.
"Some people just don't appreciate my random acts of kindness. I mean, I would want someone to tell ME if MY make-up looked whorey."
Everything you say you are is the opposite of who you think you are.
"Me, you and a rope built for two."

"Of Twitter's 206 million daily active users, why do I keep coming across the same 3 fucking assholes?"

You can dub me another of his stupid girls.
Real people feel shit down to the core of their being.
What a fool I was. I was actually going to go and get him and try my best to take care of him.
"I'll be deep within the dark woods, waiting for you."
For someone to say I love you and actually mean it.
It came to me in a dream.
"Shhh, close your eyes and peace will come."
All rise.
Real people find real people and to hell with the toxic ones.
Swallow me whole or die trying.
Death of decent people.
We're all in mourning here.

You're fucking diabolical. Seat next to me is free.
Lonely soul of debauchery.
Broken. Damaged. Deadly.
You are reflected in the shards.
The sound of breaking glass.
Uncensored spirit of depravity.
I'm due a soliloquy.
Dream about us.
"When you have a plan, don't tell a fucking soul what it is and make/watch it come true."
Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead. ‚ô¨
Venus says hi.
Fling yourself off a bridge. That's what they're there for.
"Beautifully damaged soul, come and sit next to me."
Just another broken soul screaming into the void.
I think you have a lot of very special gifts to share with someone.
Are your pupils dilated because you like what you see or because you've taken amphetamines?
"I need you to die, if you don't mind."
Fuck off forever.
"You know who you are. You know what you do and now, I do too."
Keep going. You're a circus in a clown. Entertain me.
I don't regret a goddamn thing. Not one fucking thing.
Think I'm catching another death.
Your brain fills your head with lies and you believe.
The ruins are my dreams.
Taste my sin.
The hounds of hell are closer than you think.
Where's the sanity in you?
I'll fuck you up if you let me.
The Devil knows what you've been up to.
You'll sleep easier if you don't piss me off.
People are tedious at best.
Run away together already and get the fuck out of my life.
Blocked me yet still reading me. That's fucking pathetic.
your delusion &lt; my reality
"You're not a goddess. You're not a god.  You're not a demon.  You're not the devil.   You're just like the rest of us, a human trying to navigate and survive this septic cesspool we call life."
People are the reason I can't have nice things.
This desperate clinging to another soul is fucking blasphemous.
Imagine the power of seeing everything but doing nothing.
I have zero respect for women who desperately fling themselves at men. Same goes for men desperately flinging themselves at women. It's called self-respect. Get some.
Throw myself over the balcony. See if I can fly.
The only God is nature.
Religion is a business.
"Alexa, burn them all to the ground."
I excel at not giving a shit.
"I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not."
"I also don't have a lot of interest in being a good person or a bad person. From what I can tell, either way, you're screwed. ‚Åª ·¥∞·µâ·µÉ·µà ·¥∏‚Å±·µè·µâ ·¥π·µâ"
No more tears left to cry.
I move freely through you.
There's nothing left to break.
Smells like politics. Get that shit off my page.
Are we not doomed?
I'm just the firecracker. You lit the fuse.
"Sorry I'm late, I was planning your demise."
Caught in a crossfire of your own making.
"En garde, motherfucker."
"You, reflected in this dagger."
"Seeping into their brains, the oozing rot that I claim."
Plague their nightmares.
You believe in the fallacies.
Cowering spirits meant to soar.
No reprisals for the wounded ones.
"I've dealt with your kind before. No, thank you."
"Rattle my bones, baby."
"Curse your existence a little bit more, I don't think the devil heard you."
Let's find a shooting star.
People can suck my dick today.
You don't have to love me. I love me.
I need to die a slow death.
My skies are dark and evil.
Sometimes I feel like it's better when I'm not okay.
Death makes me feel alive.
Elixir: vodka and I don't give a fuck.
Give me a love just for me and a home by the sea.
You. I saw you.
All this love and bullshit. Give it to me.
Flirting with disaster.
'You give me sixteen different flavours of hell.'
"'You say it's love that you need, but it's war that you've got.'"
You're a strange one.
Shout until my bones break.
Just to hug you and give you strength.
"Why do you do that, pick out the perfect bloom and watch it die in your hands?"
'That whole ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù act is dead and tired.  You don‚Äôt have emotions? Cool. Go seek therapy and be toxic somewhere else.'
"My heart, harbour for the broken ones."
The ghosts are watching me carefully.
Crawling into this sadness.
Nothing sustains happiness. It is fleeting.
Having a sadder day today. Hope you guys are faring better.
You can not compete with a memory.
I keep questioning love but it offers me no answers.
"Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?"
Hi. Fuck off.
Even the devil had to start somewhere.
That dark cloud follows me around.
I know a place we can hide.
Your problem with me is your problem.
I'm a firm believer in dying.
Broken can not fix broken.
I always want to fix people. That's my problem. I need to leave them the hell alone.
You keep looking up when you're meant to be going down.
The real heroes are the ones who keep the same avi up. I am far too vain and artistically inclined for that to happen.
Love on the rocks. Make it a double.
I love re-watching old horror movies that scared me as a little kid so I can sleep with the lights on for a week and crap my pants every time I hear a weird noise.
Someone has to be the bad guy. Let it be me.
It's like a train wreck. I can not look away.
Genuine hearts run obsolete.
Searching out authenticity in a world filled with deception.
Ubiquitous thoughts that have no meaning.
Atmospheric blooms of despondency.
Tethered to the fakeness of it all.
"Die, my darling."
"Come, let me show you pain."
I'm going to come back as karma.
We're all broken here. Let's not make it a competition.
"They treat your heart like a daisy. Plucking out one petal at a time, until they hear what they wanna hear."
"You're not the darkness, you're a shade of haze."
I've got one foot in the grave.
You're going to have to hate me a little more than that if we're meant to get along.
"Did I make your meaningless existence worse, my darling?"
Pot. Kettle. Black. You.
"As well, I try and help. But no one ever believes me, until it's too late."
"I speak truth. If you can't handle it, you need to take a good, long hard look at yourself."
Wagering bets ftw.
"I stand by my words, do you?"
Please do not feed the monsters.
Twitter can be a fun place when you start making bets with yourself of what people may or may not do.
The confusion lays not in what you said but in what you are doing.
"Do what you want but above board, not this underhanded shit."
I'm so happy you've found love again. and again. and again.
Woke up at heinous o'clock.
"Get ready for a short lived honeymoon period, followed by a suffocating devaluation and brutal discard."
"And all this, is interpreted as them having a wild card too have their way with you."
"Ultimately, by showing that you need the narcissist, you have showed the low levels of self esteem and self worth within you."
"You have showed yourself to be a willing and cooperative victim, wide open to any of the nonsense or bullshit they want to launch your way."
"You have showed them that, despite all their uses and abuses, you would still rather them be a part of your life, than not be a part of your life."
"You have validated the narcissist's expectation, which is that you need them and can't manage without them."
I fucking love it/you.
I'm waiting for you to love me.
This red wine says fuck you.
"Don't fuck with me, little one."
On hiatus? They won't even notice your absence.
Silent screams are the most powerful.
The Devil sees all.
The Devil knows your name.
Chilly today with a 99% chance of red wine.
"If I laugh any harder, I'm literally going to die from it. You'd love that, wouldn't you?"
The price you pay will be your self-respect.
Prepare for torture of the mental variety.
You're on a suicide mission.
The same bullshit as before. They don't change.
Your life of misery begins again.
I will always be a sad bunny.
I have no time for colour in my life. Blacks and greys. Tones and shades.
Anywhere dark is the place to be.
Sewage rot and rat infested caves. Let's go.
The Devil believes in you.
I am the ghost that haunts you.
I feed off of hatred.
You scream profanities at the world. Weak.
I keep my rage in check. That's power.
"I wish you well, love."
Secrets are meant to be kept.
Mouthful of roses.
Nothing came between us but you.
I am the best I can do.
I need to come back to myself.
"Fake love is in the air, everywhere I look around."
This hate is bigger than the two of us.
"If anyone says anything bad about me, believe them."
He'll give you the sun but I want the moon.
Put your boots on. Dig your grave.
Your obsession is my weapon.
Eyes of the devil with no soul to sell.
Retribution will be mine.
Worship at my feet you wretched beast.
What you allow is what will continue.
Bloodstained and your name on my lips.
Suicide dreams and a kiss to the forehead.
Pull out your tongue so you stop talking.
Crack you open and eat whatever's inside.
Whisper your corruption into my ear.
Catastrophic collisions of magnetic energies.
The sweetest prize is a violent demise.
"Save it for the grave, my love."
Castration and other parlour games.
"Take a bow, motherfucker."
"Who the hell knows why people do what they do. Moreover, who the fuck cares?"
Death wins.
"Baby, don't be like that."
I prefer people of the non-homosapien variety.
Robotic men and and their compartmentalization skills. Teach me.
"I suspect a lot of things but don't worry, it doesn't matter."
I love when they think I'm talking about them.
I see you acting all tough and distant when all you really need is a motherfucking hug.
How does it feel when your heart grows cold?
"My whole fucking life, in mourning."
"Black is all I wear, forever."
"The more rot within you, the more growth without you."
We are all decaying. Soon to become one with the earth.
My moon is watching me closely tonight.
No human contact.
Sit yourself down and stfu.
My hobbies are alcohol and death.
Why do people have to be so ew?
Try and use me and I'll sell your ass to a secondhand store.
"If you walk with me and you drag your feet, ima kill you."
Side by side but that tree died.
Pop you in my mouth like candy.
I would love to taste that hatred.
Let me feast on you.

To kill a motherfucker or not to kill a motherfucker.

"It was so cold, we burned."
Dance the ghost with me.
Two worlds and in between.
We have the empire.
"We have the kingdom, we have the key."
A hard reign held up by rage.
I'm here for you.  *runs away*
Let the sky fall down on me.
Churchgoers. lol.
If you could all just form a line to the left please and I can disappoint you one at a fucking time.
The feminine urge to hang you by the ball sac.

"Honestly, I'd rather just watch the moon."
"Honestly, I'd rather just watch the forest."
"Honestly, I'd rather just watch the ocean."

"Happiness is not found, it is a fleeting emotion that is rarely experienced."
Go find yourself a flowery girl who agrees with your every uttering. It will never be me.
I have no soul. It's all just ugliness awaiting provocation.
"The more you try and defend yourself, the more you are attacked. Fuck that for noise."
I study you like a lab rat.

Same sky 2 hours later. Rain cometh.
Power and control. That's all they want over you. Power and control.
"Different day, same sky."
"Fuck family sometimes, I swear."
They always talk about how you left. They never talk about how impossible they made it for you to stay.
My sky says hi.
Break all your bones to make my arsenal.
Die faster.
Wish I gave a shit.
Can I have your skull when you're done with it?
"I know insanity well, my love."
Soon the end will begin.
"Feed me to the wolves, idgaf."
Never let yourself down.
Shove it back where it came.
You've got empty eyes.
"I think about death every hour of every day, hbu?"
Sinkholes and strokes.
Hurricanes and heart attacks.
Hangings and hand grenades.
Earthquakes and electrocution.
Tsunamis and slit wrists.
"I felt it all and now, I feel nothing."
"'I'm crazy, but you like that, I bite back Daisies on your nightstand, never forget it I blossom in the moonlight, screw eyes Glacial with the blue ice, I'm terrifying'"
"They watch, they see. You cry, you bleed."
I love my lonely.
I'd love a hand to hold.

Shrouded notions tease my subconscious.
Phantom souls hovering around me.
Shadows and presence fill my waking hours.
Bedeviled yet bewitched by your haunting aura.
Put your boots on. Dig your grave.
Rot in the sewage.
Sneaking around the back alleys and shit.
Share it with the world. Nobody fucking cares.

Please stop with your declarations of self-love. I'm becoming nauseated.
That's the thing about people. They think they know you. They don't know shit.
Go. Stay away. Stay. Come back.
Strength of character. Now that's fucking sexy.
I don't need constant validation of love on here. I'm unloved. I know it. Sobeit.

Wretched thoughts of a withered soul.
Lucidity of your waking nightmares.

I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them.
"I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people just don't care back."
"I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it."

I've learned that it's not what happens to people that's important. It's what they do about it.
"I've learned that no matter how thin you slice it, there are always two sides."
I've learned that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.
I've learned that you can keep going long after you think you can't.
"I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel."
I've learned that either you control your attitude or it controls you.
"I've learned that heroes are the people who do what has to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of the consequences."
"I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel."
I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.
I've learned that Family isn't always biological.

"I've learned that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become."
I've learned that two people can look at the exact same thing and see something totally different.

How many times must I die before you consider me dead?
The birds will sing me to sleep.
Mon petit bijou.
Une peau de feu.
Tout dans les yeux.
Rien dans la t√™te.
The dead know what the living do not.
Resurrect me.

Cross me and I'll show you heartless.
Meet me in the woods at midnight.
"""Every step that I take is another mistake to you."""
"If you're right about them, it's not called judging. It's called an accurate description."
"The watchers. They are out there. Never contributing, just observing. Waiting to find fault with the image of you they have created in their mind."
We're all just ghosts here.
I have no hatred yet I am filled with disdain.
Show me some fucking originality.
Everything you're doing has been done before. Everything you're saying has been said before. Everything you're feeling has been felt before.
I prefer the colder months because no fucking people.
When you claw your way out of the abyss only to have it suck you back in again.
One day you will realize that down in the dirt is where it's at.
"Sometimes, I'm so horrible I have to mentally reel myself in lest my horribleness stain the innocents."
"You never knew me. In fact, I'd wager a bet you never even knew yourself."
Insipid optimism. Never been a fan.
You want the light? I am the dark. Run away.
"My brain has fucked with me for so long, it would only be right if I died of a stroke."
Stuck in a loop of wrongness.
"I'm like a cat. I watch, I stalk and when the time is right, I pounce. Do not ever think you are immune to these feline tendencies."
There are knives in the kitchen.
"You think they have your backs? They don't have your back, they have their own back."
"and you, over there, a stone wall."
What is beautiful is the sharing of heart and soul.
What an island she made of you.
"The more I ponder heartache, the more I realize we are doing it to ourselves."
"There is a freedom in no longer searching out their words, no longer caring how they would react to yours."
"My God, I am Beatrice in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing."
"""Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprizing what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak. She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self-endeared.""  Fuck, it's like Shakespeare knew me."
Truth hurts but I'm here to fucking deliver it.
The amount of people who think I'm writing about them is fucking laughable. Get over yourself.
"When you've seen their true nature, you no longer buy into their alternates."
Watched The Poughkeepsie Tapes. Thought of you.
Some people just have a face you wanna smack.
No face is pretty enough to hide all that ruin.
"Like lambs to slaughter, you will be lead."
Splintered shreds of a mind once intact.
Fractured psyches. Emotional warfare.
The rise and fall of your shattered ego.
Your petty existence has no place in my world.

Your truth is your lie.
Crimson lips and a bloodless soul.
My eyes complement the murder in my soul.
A love massacre.
"All of these men and their robotic ways and I over here, passion for days."
"The heart wants what the heart wants, my love."
"Lockdown order.  Stay at home order, but the schools will remain open. Defeats the purpose.  Makes no sense.  Get a fucking clue.  Do better.  Leadershit."
"Drown a rose, save a flower."
God gave me a devious face.
Am I evil? I can be.
"I'm still smiling, somehow."
"Everyone asleep and me, awake still."
Do you feel it too?
There is an emptiness within me.
Dare to dream. üñ§  Louis Armstrong - What A Wonderful World (Lyrics)   via @YouTube
I would've hugged you until you felt love.
"You've made your bed. Now hover over it, ghost."
I think that ghosting people is fantastically inappropriate. Grow a pair.
You keep your answers. I could never expect an honest one from you anyway.
The only question I'm left with is why?
Only the ghosts ever stay.
I prefer a naked mind to a naked body.
Sometimes I wish I had a pill to make people disappear.
"If it helps you to think of me as your nemesis, then hate me. Hate me hard. Whatever gets you through the day."
"People always need someone to despise, a villain. I always seem to end up being that person."
"You lovely soul, you."
I'm at the lake.
One by one they leave. Never believing they had a friend in me.
Let me get lost in you.
The eyes of infinite depth.
Chameleon hues but I can still see you.
Love him to a fault.
What you crave is something your mind has created.
"Be true to your nature, which is wild and free.  Watching you tamed is sad for me."

Searching for something inexplicable.
"A free-spirit, roaming endlessly."
"Even with someone, I've always been alone."
Repetitive days and impossible nights.
"The head knows, the heart doesn't care."
Haunting of souls.
A dreamer's intent.
The call of the void.
Tethered in thought.
Sleeping with ghosts.

She doesn't think anyone is smart enough to see through the fa√ßade.
Take their eyes so they may no longer see. Relieve them of their vanity.
Your ego betrays you.
You continuously overshoot your importance in anyone's lives.
You are a vile human being and you will be treated as such.
I'm here to fucking remind them.
How quickly they forget.
I will give your words all the consideration they deserve.
I don't hate anyone. I don't care enough to.
You're dead to me. DMs will not be entertained.
Can't even fucking tweet in peace anymore. Everyone thinking everything is about them.
Now fuck off and leave me the hell alone.
"Now I know you are watching, intently from behind your blocked/locked doors. Doesn't sound much like you are moving on, does it?"
"Murder me? Bitch, you'd be doing me a favour."

Hallucinogenic heights and free falls into the unknown.
Roses on wrists and thorns in your skin.
Gasoline pipe dreams and your garage door is closed.
Cyanide trance and a noose around your throat.
Suicide dreams and a dagger to the heart.
An extroverted wallflower.
The pills make me loud.
This is why I am so tired all of the time.
I need time to decompress after socializing.
Being with people drains me.
"I learned to behave like an extrovert, but it consumes a lot of energy."
I am a closet introvert.
"Sad, sadder, saddest, saddened."

"You try and just tweet your words and retweet those of others. But no, there is a mess of background noise here, a static. People underhandedly discussing you, judging and blocking you from behind the scenes. Nothing based on fact and all stemming from their own insecurities."

"Elusive, yet lasting."
Ghost girl. Floating aimlessly in your mind.

Birds are my people.
"Did you know that a group of ravens is called an 'unkindness' or a 'conspiracy' and that a group of crows is called a 'murder'? Clearly, I'm travelling with the right flocks."
I'm all feathers and bones.
I am so impossibly tired.
"You're like an annoying little gnat, buzzing around my head and eventually, I will squash you dead."
Don't get involved in other people's (love) affairs.
"Did you know there were actually people here you can have a real conversation with? A real discussion without issues, jealousies or ulterior motives getting in the way? Wow, I'm floored."
"When you meet 'real' people here, you forget about the trash you've come across in the past."
He knows I'm a fucking mess but he's still a sweetheart.
Stay up all night.
"Darling, you've got a big storm coming."
I don't need friends. They disappoint me.
Just look in the mirror as the years go by.
Ladies who like putting flowers in a vase. Why do you want to see something beautiful rot before your very eyes?
Shame on your fucking parents.
Never ceases to amaze me the way some people treat others here. It borders on disgusting. Were you raised in a fucking barn?
I'm not taking the blame for your limitations.
"Unfuck yourself. Whatever bullshit you've done or think about yourself, un-fucking-do it."
Don't bullshit me. Just tell me how it is.
Don't take me for a fool or I'll give you a mirror and show you the real one.
"Drink up, darling."
Don't involve me in this shit again.
But you keep talking because you know everything.
"People getting so caught up in their heads. Stuck in their own minds so that the only truth they can see, is their own."
Would the married man I'm apparently 'going after' please stand up so that I may know who the fuck you're supposed to be?

Sometimes a song is all you need.
"Go, stay, fuck off, die, whatever."

Does anyone know how to dissociate on command?
Did you know you should bury a body vertical instead of horizontal because it makes it harder for search and rescue to find it?

Your circle is small because you don't have many more people left to bullshit.
The only thing you know about me is nothing.  Not a damn thing.
Loyalties will kill you in the end. That's why I'm already fucking dead.
I wish I knew what in the hell you were talking about.

I thought maybe we could be alone together.

"Does this maintain my survival?  If no, let it go."
Talk is cheap. Show me what you're made of.
Don't listen to what they say. Watch what they do.
I don't wish you death. Maybe just some uncomfortable stomach cramps. I wish you dysentery.

The difference between narcissism and self-confidence is humility.
"Narcissists constantly crave affirmation as they are hyper-aware of others' opinions, while confident individuals don't seek to prove themselves."
Narcissism is self-focused while confidence considers the well-being of others.
Confidence and self-absorption rooted in narcissism are not the same.

Keep me blocked. You are not a good person.
They were right about you.
You lay into her and I sided with you because you said you could never involve yourself with a married man and I had such respect for that.
So does it make you proud that you have a man who blatantly cheats and deals with multiple women as long as he claims you are first on the list?
Who are you really?
"Two women, one man. You are both getting played. You are fighting for this man while he sits back, amused by this battle for his attention. He could care less how this is truly affecting both parties as long as when it‚Äôs all said and done he still gets the benefits he desires."
People and their double standards. Laughable.
You are now in the exact same role you debased her for being in.
"If you ever have to fight over a person (man or woman), you‚Äôve already lost."
It ain't real until their @ is in your bio.
Just carry on being your fabulous self. Not a god-damned thing they can do about that.

Want to kiss your cheek and tell you it's going to be okay.
Want to run my hands down your back and scratch.

Men often get confused when they encounter a pretty face with a harlot's spirit.
That's okay. You like your little box. It's safe there.
"Do whatever you must. Block me, unfollow me, ignore me. I will survive it. I will survive you."
"You live in a very small, confined box of your own making."
False expectation leads to its own confirmation.

This burden is too heavy.
Imposter. That's what you are.
There are only two types of people on this planet. Stupid and not stupid.

You knew that this would break my heart and you still did it.

Stabbed through the heart with a huntsman's sword.  Rotting from the inside out.

Come a little closer.
A shot of vodka like an angel's touch.

"You lost someone that actually gave a shit about you, stupid boy."
"If anyone I love dies from this virus, I'm going downtown packing to say hi to all the protesters."
Why are you here?
I actually care a great deal for others until they give me a reason not to.
"Your opinion is just that, your opinion."
I care until I don't.
"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come."
I did not burden you.
I loved you at your darkest.
Some people just do not deserve to see my words.
Don't ever fucking hide your words. Speak your truth and bloody stand by it.
Americans like to put people on a pedestal with the sole purpose of shooting them the fuck down. Time and time and time again.
"'If you ever date a man who says he‚Äôs an alpha, he‚Äôs a beta.'"
I'm a butthole by proxy.
Your problem with me is your problem.
"Men who fall for thirst traps, stay away from me. You're weak."
"If looks could kill, you'd be dead."
People only like you when you've got your head stuck up their ass.
"Hell hath no fury like me, motherfucker."
I look out for the ones who look out for me. Fuck the rest.
Smelled manure. Thought of you.
"You will be dealt with. That, I can promise you."
You switch accounts like you switch personalities.
"33822352 633333, 624323635332."
"You don't speak, you natter."
"You seem to think that the more words that come out of your mouth, the more intelligent you sound when the opposite is true."
Your problem is you talk too much yet have nothing to say.
"Here kitty, kitty. Come and talk to Femme."
Why is my name still in your mouth?
I don't understand why this bitch wants to die.
*dances around your mind in a tutu*
Dance with me.
I'm looking for a new obsession.
Don't let them govern your truth.
"Shhh, did you hear that? I think a leaf just fell."
Fall scented nights and I don't know where I fit anymore.
I can't be mad at you if you're following your heart.
I'm so fucking jaded.
I prefer the night. No people.
There's something in the release.
"The longer the bio, the more problematic the person."
When they have 'taken' or 'no dms' in their bio. All I see is insecurity.
I'd rather hear your silence than your ignorance.
Let her blossom to you at her own pace.
I'll do it slowly.
Might fuck around and murder you.
"If you listen very carefully to the wind, you can hear me calling out your name. Nah, just kidding. Fuck you."
I bloom in moonlight.
"Well, I guess you put me in my place, didn't you? Bravo."
Twitter can be a fickle fucker.
My hands are tied.
I'm still here but my heart is in the corner taking a breather.
God blessed me with one child and she was the best damn gift I have ever received.
I remember telling myself that you had no feelings for me. I should have listened more carefully.
You touch my hand and find it's cold and dead.
Observing life from afar.
How wonderful must it be to be able to get out of yourself and just breathe?
I'm sorry I couldn't relate to your big world ideas. I'm too busy trying to sort out the fucking mess that is inside of my head.
All I see is darkness.
I need to snap out of this morosity.
Delicate heart enshrouded in silk.
It doesn't listen to reason. It wants what it can not have. It breaks far too easily.
My heart is a child.
I open my mouth and butterflies flutter out. Their cocoons left behind to encase my heart in protection.
You are the one who gives meaning to what happens in your life.
I don't believe in coincidence.
"You think you know, but you have absolutely no idea."
You will find me in the darkness surrounding the stars.
I need celestial intervention.
"'Send me an angel, right now.'"
Tell it to the trees.
"The moon, the sky, the trees will listen better than any human is able."
The moon always escapes me. We play this game of hide and seek.
Bukowski's soul with a pretty face.
You are........ what? What are you?
Come a little closer. I have a story to tell.
"'Everything you see now, all of it: bone.'"
I miss the church bells of Switzerland.
"A little class, a little class in how you deal with others, please."
I seem to be attracted to the misanthropes the most which is not a good thing because I believe that I am one. I need to search for those who have light which will better complement my dark.
I have nothing you would want. Move along.
"I've had so many knives stuck into me, when they hand me a flower I can't quite make out what it is. It takes time. -Bukowski"
"'Nothing moves, but the shifting tides of salt in your body, your vision blears, you carry your weather with you the big, blue whale; a skeletal darkness.'"
'The sun goes up and down like a tired whore the weather immobile like a broken limb while  you just keep getting older'
My soul smells like rain.
I don't care how fucked up you are. You just don't do that to people you claim to care about.
'But it's cool because I checked out.
"Oh, you wanna be friends now?"
"Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now."
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen.
"I mean, why are you laughing?"
Must have missed that joke.
Let me see if I can find a reaction.
"No, but at least you're happy.' #–òF"
The moon is hiding tonight.
Put a fucking mask on it.
"Fuck, do I ever love a clever one."
Collateral damage in the war you are having with yourself.
Never be happy about the sadness of another. One day that sad person might be you.
"""I'm so tired of people who suck. They come on here like it's a video game with fake surroundings &amp; characters, not a social media platform with real people on the other end.""  Some very wise words from @Not_Jezebel.  I thank you for them. x"
It's been a really sad time.
It's ok. I'm my strongest ally.
But it's the ones you shared a bit of yourself with that still don't wish to know you. That's the heartbreak.
Some people don't want to know you and that's ok.
Plant me a rose garden but don't ever pick one for me. Let them live.
"For some people, it works out. For me, it never does."
I have no past. I won't reach back.
Doesn't matter what you're going through. The world keeps turning without you.
You must evolve with your circumstances.
Haters are just dreamers with broken promises.
Such is the life of a damaged psyche.
There are pieces of my soul that have never been returned to me.
Allow me to gather myself.
Vortex of emotions.
Energetic chaos.
Forever attempting to escape the trauma and the pain.
Soul explosion.
I am loosely attached by a long tether.
"I think we should all settle our 'mean'. At least, it's something we should strive for."
Let it go. Breathe.
Cute the way you think you're in control.
Exact no revenge. Trust me when I say that karma has that shit on lock.
Karma has always served me well.
Sad being here sometimes.
You're digging your own grave and there is not a thing I can do to stop it.
"It wants escape. I can feel it simmering in my chest, threatening to boil over."
I must contain this monster inside of me.
There is a sadness in me. It's been there for as long as I can remember.
I'm not a bad person. I can be a bad person. There's a difference. It's called provocation.
Take no prisoners.
"If it makes me happy and it's not hurting anyone, what the fuck is it to you?"
People claiming to be crazy should get inside of my head for a minute. It's all you could handle.

The only power you have is the power people allow you to have over themselves.
"""Your masks are ragged little things."" -@awhiskydarkly"
Love can be worse than hatred.
Will you sit with me for a while?
"As long as I can hear birdsong, I know I'm still alive."
"Can we burn something, babe?"
"You made your bed, now lie in it. I'll get the matches."
Close your eyes. Breathe.
"That's all people really want to hear, that you're not going to give up on them and I never do, but they always do."
"There is no rule that you have to be kind. Do it anyway, motherfucker."
There is nothing I can't handle.
Don't worry about me. Save your damn self.
"If you've never made any mistakes in life then let us all learn from you, perfect one."
I stand by the ones I care about. I don't give a fuck what the masses say.
"Deeper, deeper to the very heart of me."
"It's been a really sad day, week, month, year."
My kink is mutual respect and understanding for one another.
Just trying to keep myself afloat like everyone else on the planet.
The abyss envelops me.
Unable to see the light.
It's all darkness and nightmares.
Deeper I fall within myself.
Lost in the sorrow of my soul.
You beautiful people are all just a figment of my imagination.
I feel like every single person on this planet has fucking lost their mind.
What am I going to do about myself.
You don't scare me. I scare me.
I am so fucking tired.
Locked in a mind that fights itself every day.
The only battle I face is the one within myself.
I can't shake these blues.
Tread very carefully around me.
Saying you're a good person does not make you a good person. Capiche?
My trust level has dissipated down to zero.
It all threatens to erupt.
That scream you hold inside of you.
I'm a fucking mermaid.
I refuse to play the villain in your story. That's on you.
You can take the knife out of my fucking back now.
"Purify yourself, you dirty whore."
Blessed with another thunderstorm.
Reflections of a rain drenched street.
Don't forget the violent ones.
The moon watches you and then tells me your secrets.
The darkness talks to me.
I will not rest until you are dethroned.
It's your blood I'm after.
I'm going to be your downfall.
Confess your sins. I am your God.
I'd like to be the enemy.
I'd like to be a murderer.
I'd like to be an angel.
*hisses*
I can smell the evil coming off of you.
I can not get on your level as you are a fucking space cadet.
I only have one list. Hit.
"When you have absolutely nothing to lose, you become very powerful."
The calm before the storm.
You are rotting. I am blooming.
Obsidian clouds swallow the midnight moon.
Just have a good life and be well.
"To find your own peace, you took away mine."
Reminiscent of the Salem Witch Trials.
Me? I just report now.
I had something to share with you.
"My daughter took this picture for me about a week ago. I was going to dm it to you, but found myself abruptly and unceremoniously blocked after 4+ years of friendship. So, I'll just post it here. It will serve as a constant reminder of how very little our friendship meant to you."
You should hear the thoughts I don't share.
The moon's reflection on the lake. Beautiful.
"All good now, you?"
"Unfollow, unfollow, unfollow. Don't call us, we'll call you and keep that dog on a leash."
Nine years on Twitter and never had a problem. The last 1/2 year of being around toxic people and just look at what this place has become.
"Whomever questions your heart and your being is someone who has their own issues. It is a them problem, not a you problem."
The saddest part of all? I considered her my friend and all I was to her was the fall guy.
"Blazing heart, to die here is to burn."
Think I'm going to need to take some time for myself.
Such cruel people on this planet.
Watch me bleed when it's your knife in my back.
Never for a moment did I think that someone I respected so much would even be capable of ghosting. I was wrong.
Pluck yet another fresh bloom from the ground and watch it wilt and die in your undeserving hands.
Betrayal of friendship. Betrayal of trust.
"Humankind, brace yourself."
"If people want to walk out of your life, let them go."
Toxicity levels are at an all time high. Had to lock.
I'm free. x
We are all the same.
Like wilted flowers with no rain.
We're all dying.
Watch out for the dark ones who will try and eat your shine.
World's a hungry place.
I came out of the womb a cynic.
I am an Empath and I am fucking exhausted.
People come and go. The real ones stay.
Off the beaten path with you.
Delete it all. It never happened.
I am the rain.
My spirit animal is a thunderstorm.
'If you ever see me in the forest fighting with a grizzly bear. Help the bear cuz that bitch gon' need it.'
Bloom with me.
"I still exist in your mind, motherfucker."
"Beware of those who seek constant crowds, they are nothing alone. - Bukowski"
Truth.
We are all running out of time.
I have no time for temporary people. Don't come back.
"People wage war all the time. Not with tanks and guns and bombs, but with attitude and words and indifference."
"Enjoy the silence, motherfucker."
Another mind's crime.
I'm for the kill.
Fragility is marked by what we can and can not handle.
You can't speak your truth without some little bitch getting offended.
Walk your path. Burn your bridges. None of it matters.
"Delicate soul, you can't handle my hate."
"I put up with a lot of shit but never ignorance of mental illness. That doesn't fly with me, son."
"Whatever, tough guy. Move on then."
I will push you away and you will go.
Pavarotti's Nessun Dorma on repeat.
"Fuck, the melancholy is hitting me hard today."
I'm just looking for things that make me smile.
Turn the fucking music up.
Vodka mixed with doom.
You remind me of me.
Saw a raven today.
Your heart will betray you.
Your mind will turn on you.
Are you still mine?
Pouring now and you're gone.
Silent raindrops and your footsteps as they walk away.
Shut it down.
I am a sad little petal.
Ever cried for no fucking reason?
Saving people while I drown.
Forever searching for angels inside of demons.
You are so fire and rain.
I am the monster that lives in my head.
"Nothing is interesting anymore. Everyone is so fucking typical. No authenticity. Nothing unique. Same shit, different day."
I'm locked up for a reason.
Insane people never claim to be insane.
What you give is what you get.
I am a reflection of you.
"Relax, I only want your soul."
More laughter is needed in this world. It's the only thing that gets me through.
Don't involve me if you don't want me involved.
I have no stake in this but I will not be disrespected.
Everybody watches everybody.
No joke.
Your friend is clearly in the middle of a very deep psychotic breakdown. My suggestion would be to get her some help.
Stop talking.
Either own it or do something about it.
I'm no one's groupie.
Nature is the only truth. People are the lie.
"If you're gonna come at me then come at me. Otherwise, get off my dick."
You're behaviour is weak. Nothing I hate more than a weak person.
I will fight for the people I love not over them.
Now crawl back from whence you came.
Thank you for teaching me to never expect anything from anyone.
Thank you for not being there when I needed you the most.
You're everyone's whore.
"I didn't make for an interesting person. I didn't want to be interesting, it was too hard. What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone. -Bukowski"
"I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn't have a god, politics, ideas, ideals. I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it.  -Bukowski"
Come join me in the Psych Ward.
"That first bite fucked you up, didn't it?"
"If they share nothing with you, head for the hills. Trust me on this. I've learned my lesson."
Show me your decadence.
There is a bird on my head.
"You think I'm a bad person and that is just what it is, your opinion."

"You know, a long time ago being crazy meant something. Nowadays everybody's crazy. -Charles Manson"
Look down at me and you see a fool. Look up at me and you see a god. Look straight at me and you see yourself. -Charles Manson
"It's all about control, isn't it? Control over land. Control over people. Unfortunately, control is a figment of your ego and your imagination. There is no control."
"No one's buying what you're trying to sell, player."
It all comes back to the end.
"If you think you have a clever retort, you don't. Move on, quietly."
I'm coming for you.
Massacre of mind.
Slaughter of soul.
I am God but I feel the Devil in me.
Hi RS. @this_coil :)
"I'm Swiss. You will oblige me. Danke, Gro√üvater."
Some ghosts kill.
You hurt my girl. Not cool. Your new girlfriend irritates me. You say the wife knows. Do I call you out on your bluff?
'My thoughts are many miles away.'
'The only truth I know is you.'
'My thoughts are with you when you're asleep.'
You don't understand. I feel too much. I need it to stop now.
"Bare darkness, I feel you."
"Naked light, I see you."
"If you need me, I'll be flying with the birds."
There is no sunshine. It's all rain.
You fear life. That's why you're already dead.
Love makes you hate their pain. Hate makes you love their pain.
I don't go out and pick fights. They come to me.
You think you know. You've put me in a box. You have no fucking idea.
I‚Äôm my own worst enemy.
"'Fuck sanity, I wanna bleed. Can‚Äôt kill the pain, it‚Äôs everything. It‚Äôs all I feel. It‚Äôs what I breathe. Turn the hate I breed into what I need.'"

People will turn on you. Doesn't matter what you do. Doesn't matter what you say. They have their mind made up. No facts. Every time.
That's gonna scar.
I'm watching Crime Scene Cleaning. I know what to do with your fucking body.
"If someone starts to ignore you, do not question it. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Move on. Quickly."
Don't commit suicide. Someone has to clean that shit up.
"There, I never knew you. Feel better?"
"You can unfollow now, player."
If I wanted to be ignored I would have fucking gotten married.
One day you will see the error you made but I won't be around to care.
I get the block for doing nothing to you and she gets all of your adoration. She played you well.
Fuck off with your mental inadequacies.
One more time for the people in the back.  I am not:  @broken_stems  @sirensuicides  @Cyberua_  @1986_dead   Please get some help.
Are you ever confused.
One common denominator.
"I've said it before, if you want to know something about me, then come to me. Taking someone else's words about another at face value is a sign of ignorance."
Who hurt you so bad that this is what you have turned into?
I'm on to you.
I'm being accused of things I haven't done and that's just no fun.
I think someone is filling your head with lies.
"Actually, no. I block no one. You got something to say, @888weRone888? Fucking bring it."
Threatening people is not okay @888weRone888.
Blocking is my new Fuck You.
You will amount to nothing. You will be nothing. You are nothing.
Destruction commands attention.
So much hate coming at me today. I fucking love it.
"Wenn nichts anderes, hat Twitter mir unendliche Geduld im Umgang mit Untermenschen beigebracht."
"Don't be jealous, motherfucker. Just bow in my presence."
"Head like a freight train, gone off the rails."
The most difficult person I'll ever have to deal with is myself.

Watching murder. Thinking of you.
Blood-stained kisses.
My nails are so long now. Scratch you. Make you bleed.
Will you still love me when I'm in the Psych Ward?
"It's funny, he says he thrives on hate but whenever I bring it, he retreats. Clearly, I'm fit for no human."
A horror you can't get away from.
I'll disembowel you if you hurt an animal.
"Believe me, if I started murdering people, there would be none of you left."
I'm always watching.
Never overestimate your importance in my life.
I don't give a fuck about you. That ok?
Make it fucking happen for me.
My expectation is that you'll be gone before I return.
Cheap men who fall for any and all whores. No fucking thank you.
I am an anti-Christ and I am an anarchist and I am drunk.
I live for the day you die.
I don't deal in fragility.
We still believe in lies.

You don't like what I post? Get the fuck off my page.

Who am I?
"Era Ameno Lyrics   via @YouTube   Take me to the inside, absorb, take me Disclose, disclose, hiding, hiding oneself, take me Disclose, unperceived signs, disclose Tell me, tell me, war like, spirit martyr, disclose"
I thrive in chaos.
It's time for the mindfuckers to get a little mind-fucked.
"This place is one big mind fuck. You are all the same person and I'm in a fucking coma, right?"
You lied to me?
"If I have to see that tweet one more time, I'm going to fucking murder somebody."
Everyone's dead.
I'm just chasing ghosts here.
Lebensm√ºde.

I can smell your fear.
Fucking vertigo.
Your life is a conspiracy theory.
I miss the ocean so much.
'Don't fuck with Mr. Zero.'
To steal a tweet verbatim when there is a fucking retweet button. Someone please explain this to me.
What we have here is a failure to communicate.
I'd rather be closer to the end than closer to the beginning.
A battle of egos was not on my to-do list.
I give you the fucking power you think you have over me.
I'm attempting cashew encrusted tilapia tonight. Wish me luck.
"Let's go walking in the rain and maybe, if we're lucky, you'll get struck by lightning."
It's storming. I love it.
I will have peace.
"No chaos, just peace."
Show me how beautifully you will destroy me.
I was wrong. Again.
Goodnight.
Fuck. The shit that comes out of his mouth makes me laugh so hard. I love to laugh.
I want that one.
I think you're fucking adorable and dangerous.
Just fuck off and let me listen to my 80's music.
God-damned trolls need to be eradicated.
I'm sorry that I was born with a functioning brain. I'm sorry that my father values and respects my existence. I'm sorry that I have zero daddy issues. I'm sorry that your game won't work on me.
Simplicity does not mean simple-minded.
This constant give and take is so treacherous. I want someone who gives without thinking about their take.
I want the simplicity of you back.
The greatest thing about twitter is finding like-minded individuals.
"Rage is power. Don't worry, I'll keep it curtailed."
Do I receive a lot of DMs? Sure.  Do I answer a lot of DMs? No.

I'm tired of weak people.
"All of this, ""I hate myself, but I love you."" crap.  Love yourself first."
"You're giving it away for free, whore."
I'm not here to validate you.
Go away. I'm talking to The Devil now.
Love is for peasants.
Selfies never last long here. Too many creepers.
"Clearly, I don't give a fuck."
I've just read that only about 10% of people have an outie. Interesting.
Your bellybutton.
He wouldn't like me. I'm not a fucking whore.
"If you want to know something about me, my suggestion would be to ask me, not listen to some jealous little twitter cunt who doesn't know fuck about shit."
Little twitter birds always chirping away in the background. Can you hear them?
There is a monster that lives in me.
Stuff it down and keep it inside. It's too ugly to release.
That fucking abyss. Forever present. Taunting me to jump.
I'm just a sad little wretched thing.
Guess I am unflower worthy.

My mind is torturing me.
I just won't give myself a break.
"Honestly, I don't know whether I'm coming or going with this account. My apologies for all of the indecision. My brain is fucked."
It's the ones who love you through your tough times instead of just walking away. Those are the special ones.
I am cloaked and daggered.
Two-faced bastards.
Morals in the dust.
"When I get to 0, I'm gone. Don't act like you fucking care."
Forgive me if I unfollow you. I'm in a fucking mood. You're free to unfollow back of course.
"You can call me Queen, motherfucker."
Problem solved.
Think I'm on the wrong planet.
Politics and porn are such a fucking bore.
I am an illusion that you made up in your head.
To think that you know the first thing about me by what I tweet borders on the ridiculous.
One day I will meet someone who takes my breath away.
"Someday, you will pay the price. Not with me, maybe not with her, but someday, and when that happens, I want you to think of me."

I don't forgive or forget. Why the fuck should I?
You like my words then I love you.
My likes aren't sticking tonight. I blame it on the alcohol.
I couldn't be more drunk if I tried.
"I know the type. You do all of the work and they sit back, reaping all of the benefits. It's exhausting. No thank you."
Such a curious creature. I'm intrigued.
This is where I live now.
Water sign.
I fell in love with a lie.
I've got all the friends I need. None.
Never crossed anyone who didn't deserve it.
There goes my heart again.
Nature &gt; People
"You've had your 15 minutes of fame in my life, now fuck off."
Ridiculous humans.
"For the record, I have never initiated a DM in my life, so if you're coming at me via that method, make damn sure your intentions and motivation for doing so are pure."
I've spoken with a lot of people here and there are only a small handful that didn't come with ulterior motives. Sad.
Your president doesn't give a fuck about you.
Keep doing you. Ignoring the ones who actually care about you and chasing after the ones who don't give a fuck about you. Hope that works out for you.
"If I take the time to respond to one of your tweets, you should have the decency to acknowledge said response. Otherwise, you are just unnecessary baggage that I will lose."
Pink skies and moving water. Take me there.
"Beautiful soul, please come and sit next to me."
I come from a different time.
I'm sorry that I was brought up to believe you don't share your private parts with the world. Forgive me.
The dodo bird is not extinct. It is alive and well and commander-in-chief of the United States of America.
'All I want to say is they don't really care about us.'
It was like watching a caterpillar turn into a butterfly.
He took my dreams with him when he left me.
Beauty is back. xx
You don't have to understand me. I never asked you to.
Rain is my soul-mate.
"There is nothing better than hearing, watching, smelling, feeling the rain. Nothing."
Everything stops for me when it rains.
The breather of fire. The burning of soul.
Love? No such thing.
"I tweet what I want, how I want, when I want. You don't like it? Excuse yourself."
I hate people.
The lingering petulance echoes.
For you.
and I am not the same.
Watch me bleed.
'Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?'
'Skies are crying. I am watching. Catching teardrops in my hands.'
"Like a skyscraper, motherfucker."
Put the weight of the world on my shoulders. I dare you.
I think peonies are beautiful. Layers and layers of gorgeousness.
Kinda don't care. Kinda feel nothing.
So many secrets here. Tell me.
You're adorable.
Peonies.
Sad flowers.
How many more deaths must I endure?
Avi and header is an ode to my beautiful Laken.
"Put me in my place and if you are honourable, that's exactly where I will go."
I fucking miss you already.
I'm that old witch offering you candy. I will cook you in my oven.
"Jesus Christ, children. Don't follow me. Run the fuck away."
Arms out. Fly.
I get lost in the wind.
Full of pain.
You will shine in my memory forever.
Peppermint lip balm. Tingly. Highly recommend.
Laken. x
Fuck. I love so few and they always end up leaving me.
Heartbroken.
It's like a death when you lose the ones you love. @lithiumdrop  I wish you love. I wish you happiness. I wish you strength and  I hope you return one day.  I love you.
She's gone.
Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay  @lithiumdrop üåπ
What will happen if Laken leaves Twitter?
I try to be soft and beautiful but I can't do it. I'm hard and ugly.
Shit on my account and I'll use your face as a motherfucking squeegee.
Exposed yet hidden.
"So far away, you're close."
What do you think about the sky?
Unfit for love. Unfit to love.
Bury me deeper within your psyche.
How easy was it to forget me?
Erase me from your memory.
Bloom. Blossom. Be.
"Sorry, can't. Watching the rain."
Guess I'm more damaged than I realized.
1)How you perceive yourself. 2)How you perceive your partner (to be). 3)How you perceive love. 4)How you perceive death.
"'No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust.'"
Please refrain from dissecting my tweets. I'm not a frog in a high school science lab.
I have no love stories to speak of.
I sexually identify as your mother. Now eat your vegetables and fuck off.
"Tell people how you feel about them. They don't have to answer back. They don't have to feel/say a thing. You spoke your truth and because of that, you are free."
I rest easy knowing I said everything I wanted to say.
"Understanding your personality in four simple questions. 1)What is your favourite animal in the world? 2)What is your second favourite animal in the world? 3)When you think of the ocean, what do you think of? 4)When you think of darkness, what do you think of? Answer 1234 below."
The most unattractive man is the man who is pining after another woman who is not you and that's ok. That is exactly as it should be.
"Ladies, don't get mad when they move on. Wish them well on their journey and then laugh like hell when you see what they end up with."
So sick and tired of the ignorance. It runs rampant.
"Listen, if Americans don't want to wear their masks, that's fine but keep the fucking borders closed because we Canadians are wearing them over here."
I'm done following people who never reciprocate. What the fuck is the point?
Please stop retweeting half naked women onto my feed and get yourself a Pornhub account like every other man on the planet.
I just want to be quiet with someone.
"Doesn't matter what you do, I will go on loving you."
Do not get attached and you'll do just fine here.
I love when the tweets hit their intended target.
Do you hear me whispering your name?
You are a revelation.
It's raining flowers.
Why do the best people have to live so fucking far away?
People can sense what I am and that's why they steer clear of me.
My brain is wired this way.
"If you're happy all the time, you're a fucking liar."
My people are nocturnal.
Your attitude has taught me to appreciate the people who don't have one.
"'I'm gonna start telling men, ""I know a place"" and then drop them off at a fucking therapist.'"
Good days. Bad days. Impossible days.
Stabs me in the heart and then blames me for all of the blood on the floor.
Andrea Kiss. Beautiful.
I'm right where you left me.
Grit.
"If someone ghosts you, let them stay dead."
"He's like an unhurried orgasm. Intriguing, compelling and I will succumb."
Drowning in you.
Wilted petals.
"Whether it be friendship, kinship or love, those uncommitted souls need to fade away into the mournful dirge and float out upon the bleak, dark night, dissolving into nothingness."
'Does anyone else have that friend that you're pretty sure is your soulmate but in a friend way?'
What can you teach me?
I'm attracted to intelligence.
Never overestimate your importance in my life.
"There is no sting of silence, there is just quiet and that's just how I want it to be."
"Either way, you will be left behind."
Massacre of the mind.
Slaughter of the soul.
Pitting cherries or killing a bitch. The outcome is the same. Carnage.
Watch me play your game better than you.
Build those walls. Make them climb so high to reach you.
'Life is full of disappointment and I just added you to the list.'
No one comes close to anything. They were all disappointments.
"Trouble Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble been doggin' my soul since the day I was born Worry Worry, worry, worry, worry Worry just will not seem to leave my mind alone"
Zero feelings to speak of.
Leave me alone and all will be well.
"If you have a dick, don't be one."
"Upgrade, love. Never downgrade."
I can't believe I wasted so much time on you. Fuck.
I'm good now. Thanks.
The moon is flirting with me again.
Serene to stormy in the bat of an eye.
It's time to say goodbye.
"Oh, those bruised skies. x"
Angels singing in my ear.
"Have you ever tried so hard with someone because you 100% percent believed in their goodness, yet they gave you nothing in return? No support, no love, no interest, no care? Guilty."
I'm just off in my own little world.  Nessun dorma - Pavarotti. ü§ç
Today is the day I let you go and nothing has ever felt so good.
"When you dismiss the toxic and focus on the beautiful, life becomes so much better."
Be gone.
Stay away.
No one is worth that kind of misery. I fucking choose me.
Said it was gonna be a good day and it's turning out to be just that!
You are not who I thought you were. Do not DM me again.
Let's fucking fly together.
It's gonna be a good today. I will make it so.
I just realized I didn't lose a tc. I never fucking had one. Mind blown.
"Too damaged to fix. Not me, you."
Bruised skies are the prettiest.
Beauty is nature.
Colours did not exist before I met you.
The moon watches over me.
The prettiest shades of forever.
Flowers bloom with my tears.
All of my storms are internal.
Dance and the sky watches.
Stay beautiful.
You are fucking adorable.
I will rid myself of you before I ever rid myself of me.
I have zero respect for men trying to play hero.
Quick everyone run to try and save 'the sad little goth girl'.  She's stronger than all of you put together. Stupid fucks.
"She is fierce, unapologetic with such a beautiful soul."
A submarine being crushed from the outside by the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water.   The collapse of a massive star under its own gravitational pressure.   Your colossal ego shattering as your farce of a life comes crashing down around you.  Examples of implosion.
What I feel is emptiness.
Do you feel loved?
"It's all so repetitive. Same behaviour, different people."
"I trust very few and even then, not really."
"If one is tired of Twitter, should they"
Any females following this account:   @abellalden  BEWARE!!
I will not apologize for being loud and abrasive at times. That would be like saying sorry for being me. Nope.
I refuse to argue with stupid.
"We're going for 36 hours no sleep. Honestly, I'm forever curious to see how my brain reacts to lack of sleep."
"I would purchase words (a book) from: @fervent_enigma  @AstrumGlass  @GhostLibraries  @lithiumdrop  Seriously, think about it, ladies.xx"
"Speak your truth but if I find out that you are lying, run."
Why are people so transparent and predictable?
"Some things I will never share, with anyone."
Maybe it's just all of the loss I've experienced lately.
"Music so beautiful, you cry."
"You think I don't see you are using me to get to someone else? Little boy, please."
How fucking beautiful is this person? üñ§
Don't let the pretty words fool you. I am a most vile creature.
I can't help but smile.
'Here on earth everything's different There's an emptiness I hope you're dancing in the sky And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir And I hope the angels know what they have I'll bet it's so nice up in heaven since you arrived.'
"Ich hoffe du tanzt am Himmel Und ich hoffe du singst im Engelschor Und ich hoffe, die Engel wissen, was sie haben."
There's only one for me here. I'd wager a guess it's not you.
"Honestly, I've had my fill of men acting like repugnant females the last couple of days. If that's you, unfollow me now. Where are all my alphas at?"
'See the *stone set in your eyes.'  *storm
'I send this smile over to you.'
"People who are unaffected or have the ability to act unaffected, those are the real heroes. Teach me."
Lambs to slaughter.
Show me your misogyny and I will emasculate you.
"From one misanthrope to another, die cunt."
"Alas, he was not a God, just another boastful man."
"It's sad, what some people are."
It's not pretty what people can turn me into. I try to rise above but the anger takes control.
Lethe is literally life. lol. x
Blocking and then talking is so weak. The behaviour is so weak.
"I, myself, am afraid of how toxic I can get with undesirables. It's like an out of body experience."
"Listen, I took the high road. Deleted all of my toxicity but to hear that this little pencil dick is still yapping with his little pussy mouth pisses me off. If it continues, prepare for WWIII. Now, fuck off."
"If you want a war, you fucking have it. I back down to no one. Not even you, convict."
You think that you're the only one that can get ugly? Trust me when I say that my soul is the ugliest.
"The weakest people on Twitter are those that block you but still talk about you. Get a fucking life, you pathetic piece of shit."
"Do I want to be lifted up so high that my feet never touch the ground? Of course I fucking do. Help me fly, dammit."
"Ever notice that when you come across something soul beautiful, you close your eyes?"
"All things beautiful,  music, bruised skies and your enchanting soul."
Let no one sleep but have them close their eyes.
Cross me once and you're gone forever.
Prettiest wreck I've ever seen.
You know what? You're not even worth my time.
Bad attitude and nothing left to give.
"In order to be tolerated as a toxic piece of shit, you have to have something else going for you, killer looks, a way with words, a soul.. something."
My people here know who the fuck I am.
"Don't go away mad, just go away."
People like that only strengthen my resolve to be the best cold-hearted bitch I can be.
Liberate that beautiful soul of yours.
Don't ever cage yourself.
"We are kindred spirits, for sure."
Do you have the capability to truly love and be loved in return? (Think about this first before simply blurting out an answer.)
My heart loves quietly behind the scenes.
My heart loves you. I have no say in the matter.
Your existence fuels my spiritual growth.
"I hate when people say, ""I'm nothing special."" when I find them to be special.   You are special to me."
I shall always remember you.
I want to die singing.
Happy to have your acquaintance.
Such a beautiful soul.
Thank you for trusting me.
Nothing is greater than music.
Music alone makes me cry.
Accept people for who they are as they do the same for you.
The best people are the ones you can verbally spar with without it being turned into a war. x
"‚ÄúSleep, those little slices of death ‚Äî how I *loathe them.‚Äù  *love"
Dark eyes. Darker soul.
It's snowing. No it's not. I just haven't slept.
34 hours and counting...
Haven't slept in 33 hours. I'm starting to hallucinate. O_o
Special Account Alert: @cryingviolence xx
Happy Birthday to my lovely Lethe!  I'm popping all of your balloons!!  xxxx!!!  @ivy_alyy
Just love me.
'What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart?'
People are free to tweet whatever they wish to tweet. It's the desperate attention seekers that have to be seen and heard underneath those fucking tweets that I have zero respect for.
Jesus Christ. Grow a fucking backbone. Show some pride.
Love her. She is soft and innocent and so lovely. I am hard and cold and ugly. There is nothing here for me.
Life is a beautiful fucking mess.
"You are beautiful, ok?"
So much love.
He hung the moon.
I'm looking for a unicorn.
"I am a lovable grouch, apparently."
Line up at the grocery store. Nope. Line up at the liquor store. I guess we wait then.
It's too fucking early in the day for the poems.
"If you could travel in time, would you want to see"
Killed a bug the size of Africa and now I can't sleep.
No sleep 'til Brooklyn!
Just because I'm wearing gloves doesn't mean I won't slap you upside your head.
"No, thank you."
Sorry for all of the avi changes. Think I'm having a Twitter stroke.
What you see is what I show you.
Can't even like someone's tweets without them thinking you're proposing marriage or something.
Relax. I'm too old for you.
I like your face.
Your lips move when you lie.
'Stop tip-toeing and let them hear every fucking step you take.'
"Stay in your lane, cunt."
Don't jump the gun on love. Allow it it's time.
I can not stop watching this video. Over and over and over again. That face. I miss my boy. :(
Can't. I'm his fucking clown.
"As soon as something turns real here, it shatters itself into a million little pieces. Every fucking time."
"Soon, I will fly away."
"Let's not play with the emotions of others, please."
Combative with stupidity.
I'm in a mood today.
"Yes, little oversexed man on the internet who's clearly not getting any. Hiding behind an anonymous account on the internet, living in your mommy's basement. I'm sure the orgasms you could give me would be state of the art, unlike anything I've ever felt before. üôÑ"
A gentlemen always texts last. I'm old fashioned and I hate to be left hanging. Tsk.
"What I am, is into him. What he is not, is into me."
I have no respect for lynch mob mentality of any kind.
Cops are people too. Fuck off with your bullshit.
"Make me a charcuterie board served with some red wine. Spew some poetry, flex those biceps and take out the trash. Now that's love. üòç"
Give me real and raw.
"No, I'm his number one fan. Gtfo, bitch."
My grandfather was a police officer.
"Have you ever seen your Dad cry?  (For me, the answer is no.)"

Yum.
Fuck that indifference right out of you.
Wanna climb you like a tree.
Mind games and other mitigating circumstances.
Offer them nothing and watch them wither away and die.
Lavish them with adoration and watch them flourish.
Ocean tides and I'm a moody bitch.
Ebbing and flowing between the love and the hate.
I am a child of the Moon.
Don't call me Vi. Call me Femme.
I will never take a man wearing a bow tie without a tuxedo seriously.
You can now take all of your little conspiracy theories of mistaken identity and shove them up your fucking ass.
Maybe yes. Maybe no. Maybe fuck off.
"The inner workings of the mind are like a beautifully choreographed ballet, for other people. My ballerinas are tripping and falling all over the stage."
"But you're going to be ok, right?"
Are you writing me a fucking book? Press Enter.
How old is your soul?
"I try to make the people I care about feel special. How did he make me feel? Like an annoyance, a pest. An intrusion upon his life."
Let's go into the woods and disappear.
"Sorry friend, my ice chipper broke."
We try for the ones that matter and give excuses to the ones that don't.
Heart like a stone. Head filled with sand.
Foolish to think otherwise. Foolish to try.
They freeze you out and no amount of warmth will melt that solid interior.
Let me lick your libido.
Heart won't let go.
Headlong collision.
Show me your destruction.
Room by the hour at a hot sheet hotel.
Dime-store whore.
Money is truly the root of all evil.
"You think that your precious economy matters more than human lives? Guess what, no people = no economy."
'We must put people's lives first and foremost otherwise if we value profit above life we are dehumanising ourselves.'
Where's your God now?
"Religion is a crutch for people who can not deal with life, death and everything in between."
"If your brain is functioning correctly, you would either be an atheist or an agnostic."
You are so fucking confused if you think the Lord is going to save you.
Die a thousand deaths and then die one more.
I hope you choke on your obstinance.

Keep those blasphemous rumours to yourself.
Your whole life is a fucking lie.
You are ingesting lies.
You are looking at a lie.
Unfollow guilt free. I no longer give a fuck.
I have no friends here.
The bare minimum is all I ask for in friendship and you couldn't even muster that. Maybe get out of your selfish fucking head and put others first for a change.
24 hours and you so blind. 24 hours and you so unkind. 24 hours and you couldn't give a fuck. 24 hours and you have now run out of luck.
I do not apologize for my truth.
Guitars and Glocks.
"I'm not just after the physicality but,  the psychologically,  the conceptually,  the emotionally.  In other words, your very soul."
I would just corrupt you.
Portrait of a disturbed mind.
Poetry of promises.
I am imperfect.
The storms we hide within.
Lost in the wind.
The clouds are haunted.
'You better let me go the day you need me.'
"If you mute me and you're a man, might I suggest a day at the spa?"
The right people soften me. They're gone now so hard as nails.
Stupidity seems to be the theme lately.
"Women are cunning, vicious creatures and while they might act all sweet and innocent, it is just that, an act."
"If you for one second think that women are angels, then you are delusional and need some help."
"It's official, I hate people."
"Me? oh, nothing. Just sitting around waiting for everyone and everything to die."
I've never had a more peaceful day here. Turns out you were the problem after all.
Mouth full of gasoline. Light the match.
"Follow, unfollow, block, unblock, block again. Slander, insecurity, pettiness. I've had enough. You have now been silenced forever."
"Ruhe in Frieden, meine s√º√üe Gro√ümutter. üíï"
Keep those fucking borders closed.
Serious question. Are all Republicans stupid?
"Understand, I don't come out all claws and teeth unless provoked."
At last. There is peace.
I used to be a lunatic. Now I'm just insane.
I love you all.
Death by association.
Is it fair that I am being judged by the company I keep? No. Do I love the company I keep? Yes.
You see how I keep my account open? Nothing you do fazes me.
"So clearly, I don't give a fuck."
Weak-minded people and sharpened guillotines.
I detest people who think they are above me.
Don't fuck with me and I won't fuck with you. Imagine if I were to screenshot one of your weak tweets. You would fall apart.
Let me tell you the definition of toxic. Blocking me and then taking a screenshot of a tweet I wrote and posting it on your feed for sympathy. Stop playing the fucking victim.
"If I've learned anything in this life, it's that everything ends."
"What's happening to me? Everything he posted, I revered. This last retweet, ew."
"You are the Queen of doubt and insecurity. Nothing more. This time keep me blocked, bitch."
Do you know what gives me goosebumps? Gregorian chants and Haka dances.
"My boy, it's been a week since we lost you and it's not getting any easier."
Do you want to play a game?
Welcome to the dark side of the moon.
"Go, find your Maiden of the Sun. The Moon and I have better things to do."
"Muted you, turned off your bitch's retweets. Carry on then."
You'll know I like you if I get childlike with you.
I like my men how I like my libraries. Full of knowledge but quiet.
By the light of the moon I go.
Go to the light. Let the darkness take me.
"The more he searches for the light in others, the darker I wish to become."
My intuition told me that you were an asshole.
'Stay away from people who always consider you expressing how you feel as you arguing or being extra. It's called Gaslighting. Toxic people do that so they don't have to take accountability for their own behaviour.'
Daran ist nichts zu √§ndern.
Du versuchst es so sehr mit einigen Leuten und sie geben dir nichts zur√ºck.
My words are no longer yours.
Match my energy or gtfo.
You can't turn a robot into a man.
Mission aborted.
I have lost your frequency.
Show me your neglect.
Indulge me in your inadequacies.
Thus it shall stay.
"'The killer in me is the killer in you, my love.'"
Don't rattle my cage.
So many spectators here.
Getting ready to lose my mind.
Show me unique. Show me unusual. Show me some semblance of fucking originality.
Why are people so fucking typical?
"When people block you and later unblock.  No, bitch, you had it right the first time. Stay gone."
Where did I go wrong?
Sadness has nothing on me.
"Reflective, introspective. The eyes deepen."
"For me, pain is prose."
It doesn't matter what they think. Write for you.
You can see their whole story. It's in their eyes.
I will never again find the joy of innocence.
I need the wind to take me.
I'm teeny tiny. Are you big and strong?
"5'4"". Short girl. Built like a... none of your fucking business."
Please stop chasing pipe dreams. They are exhausting and unfulfilling.  Note to self.

"What was once a loving bundle of purrs and attitude is now a box of ashes. My heart, my heart."
Touch my soul and watch your clean hands turn dirty.
Thinking about causing a scene.
Crazy doesn't give a fuck.
"Enjoy your plums, motherfucker."
Our boy is home. x
We pick up my boy's ashes today. That is all.
"They say one thing, do another and don't mean any of it."
Go in for the kill.
Stalk my prey.
Don't think me an innocent.
Mouthful of fire.
Infernal idiosyncrasies.
Plaguing propensities.
Nocturnal nuances.
My circle is so small that I'm the only one in it.
Stuck somewhere between sadness and despair.
Can't mistake your words. They are unlike any other.
Cunts and claptraps.
Annihilation comes to mind.
Or you killed. Let's be honest.
My volatile temper is going to get me killed one day.
"Daydreamer, night stalker."
Regrets and reveries.
I hate the summer solstice. I need all the light I can get on a continuous basis.
Fuck. I miss my boy.
Just move on. I'm damaged goods.
Mental illness blows.
"I struggle with suicide ideation, but I have a kid to take care of so it just can't happen."

"I could never be a ""Karen"".   I'm way too fucking pretty for that."
Don't point that gun at me unless you plan on using it.
"Crucified, all the nails in my heart."
2020 is a motherfucker.
I don't know what or who I am anymore.
We're all crazy but we don't have to be cruel.
"My anger is completely reactive. My rage, a different story altogether."
I am the hunter. You are the prey.
"I die, again and again."
Kill me with your words.
Open fire with dictation.
Mouth full of bullets.
"Crushed petals, a first love."
"Cheap shoes, a sidewalk whore."
I am two people. I want to be sweet. I want to wage war.
"Gritty, dirty, show no mercy."
That is it for me. Done. Finished.
"Like a tornado, I destroy everything in my path."
I'll cut your heart out to make you feel what I feel.
"When you lose something within a circle so small, the effects are astronomical."
The sadness is palpable. I could cut it with a knife.
You don't have to understand them. These words are for me.
Suicidal eyes and flowers on your wrists.
"Grieving is like an ocean. Sometimes calm, a reprieve. Sometimes violent, waiting to pull you under. It comes in waves."
"There are a lot of sweet people here. As well, there are a lot of assholes."
My hair is black like the feathers of a raven.
You know what's sexy? HUMILITY.
"'Stop disturbing women you're not ready for, please.'"
I am no longer asking for peace. I'm demanding it.
Can I now go back to mourning my boy? Fuck.
"To the true friends I have here, I love you and I appreciate you."
"You, a good friend, unfollow me while I'm in mourning? I have no words."
We needed a miracle. We didn't get one.
I am such a sad creature.
Goodbye is a fucking crime.
Fade to black.
My boy is gone. üíî
Will I ever forgive myself for signing those papers or will I forever be plagued by the ghost of an innocent?
"Sometimes, this place helps me so much."
"If I sighed any deeper, I could probably dust your house too."
"Soon, it will all turn black."
Everything is fucking blue.
It's all blue now.
There is less and less keeping me on the planet.
Feral: like a wild animal.  Would you tease a wild animal? Would you fuck with a wild animal? Would you get close to a wild animal without the protection of a cage around it?  I have no fucking cage so stay the hell away from me.
Double entendre intended.
"If I lived in the States, I'd be packing."
"Some people on here suck so much sewage, it permeates out of their soul and leaks into their words like a stink infested rubbish bin."
The date has been set. Release for my boy. Agony for me.
Blue.
I'm here. You can adore me now.
Interesting account you have there. I'd like to explore.
"Sweetie, don't push my buttons unless you're ready for the fallout."
You wanna spar? I'll fucking spar. You want peace? Give me some first.
"Motorcycle mufflers are much smaller, usually no longer than a few inches. Just like your dick, motherfucker."
Damn right I live in the past. Who wants to live in all of this shit? Bring back the motherfucking 80's and let's call it a day.
My dreams are all about death now.
I see videos of cats and I just cry.
To the people who never change their avis or headers. They're the real fucking heroes.
Are you ready to play?
Perfect? No such thing.
Here kitty kitty.
Doesn't make any sense.
Do you now understand that anyone can say anything about anybody? That's the point I'm trying to make here.
"You enjoying the show, sweetheart? I know you're watching."
Feral hearts and bloodthirsty appetites.
Fucking romper room this place. I swear to God.
Hell hath no.. you're dead to me.
I am fire. You will burn.
"Come here, boy. I'll fuck you up a little."
Cartoon skies and ephemeral encounters.
"I have been on twitter for nine years now and I have never come across such juvenile, delusional, needy, pathetic, petty behaviour."
You can fuck off now.
You can block me. I'm not bothered.
"A cheating man, a married woman and a needy bitch walk into a bar."
You're not forgiven. Do better.
Just caught a fly in my hand.
I am not in the mood for weak minded individuals.
No fucking prisoners.
Where's your posse now?
Cold-hearted cunt. I hope you die a vicious death.
Inhuman people exist. Dismiss them.
Cruel behaviour only ups your karma.
"You have no soul, no empathy, no kindness in you."
Blocking doesn't achieve anything. I'm still here. Only your mind is closed. Thank you for letting yourself out.
Real life hits hard and nothing on here matters anymore. I do appreciate your support however. Thank you.üíï
"'You give them a taste of their own medicine, then they tell everyone that you poisoned them.'"
Get off my dick.
Every person eventually turns into somebody that you used to know.
Do you really ever know anyone?
You were no friend of mine after all.
"And how many times did I stick around regardless? and you? one time, and you're out? Good to know."
How many times was I met by your silence?
He used my silence as ammo against me.
"It takes me days, weeks, months, sometimes even years to get over some people and they just seem to let it all go within a moment. Like it was nothing, which tells me that it was nothing, to them."
Whatever you want.
Whatever makes you happy.
Walk away if you must.
I will do no more.
What's a little self-fulfilling prophecy between friends?
That's a cop out but it's your cop out and you're free to have it.
"If I blocked everyone who annoys me, there would be no one left to follow."
"If you don't want to see the monster, don't provoke the human that houses it."
What's that? Is that the sound of respect I hear? You're damn straight it is.
I'm rarely wrong about people. You just slipped underneath my radar.
I'm not numb. I'm not angry. I'm not sad. There's been a shift. I'm stone cold frozen.
Trust me when I say I don't care about all of the tc conquests you covet.
"If you allow something to have power over you, then you also have the ability to take that power away."
It wasn't me.
You'd never fucking make FBI.
Put a fucking muzzle on her.
I'd like someone to push me over the edge. See what I'm capable of doing.
"If all you do here is chase split-tail, then stay the fuck away from me. You feel me?"
You're fucking welcome.
I understand why people block me. They can't handle the negative. What they don't realize is that I'm the reason they appreciate the positive.
I deal in rage. You don't have to like it.
"If all brides are supposed to be beautiful, how come none of the fucking wives are?"
Move along. You'll just end up disappointing me.
Kiss your husband goodnight for me.
That's dead now. You killed it.
Our rage matches.
Diagnose me.
I am alone.
I feel alone.
I know who you are.
I'm convinced that I'm unlovable.
Shut your mouth and let me love you.
No tcs allowed. My *last one was a fucking travesty.  *only
Bewitch me some more.
Soul refreshment.
"Not my first rodeo, people."
I want more of you.
I'm Switzerland.
Who are you to me?
"'Am I just a hypocrite, another piece of your bullshit.'"
Do you ever wake up in the morning and realize your life is meaningless?
Stroke my wings.
You just made me smile. I haven't smiled in a while. x
This vile content in my head.
This world is sinking.
I miss the eighties.
"Shhh, your time will come."
Keep your enemies close. Closer.
There is no God.
Dystopian dreams.
It is a very ugly time indeed.
My heart is an idiot.
You could say I have a temper and it wouldn't be untrue.
You smell like insignificance.
My playlist is a thunderstorm.
"and who do we love today, darling?"
That's beautiful.
"You're lucky she was so gracious. If you were after mine, I'd cut you with a dull blade and watch you bleed a slow demise."
I touch roses.
Cocoon me.
Surround myself with silence.
My soul feels like it's been at war for years.
Some of you motherfuckers need to respect a mourning stage between relationships. Fuck.
There‚Äôs something that I died for there.
It's in my brain now.
We are the same now.
Thus the lad was initiated into my realm.
He froze that minutia of remaining warmth within me. It's all refrigerators and glaciers now.
"Like a blue flame, my anger."
"'Is my value based only on your perception or is your opinion of me, not my responsibility?'"
This account is on lockdown.
"Tomato, tom-ah-to. Fuck off."
I should have said puddle.
Why is it always your face I see stuck in everybody's fucking business?
"Buddy, if I were you, I would stop talking right about now."
12:20am. Do you know where your love is?
"I deserve deep love. Ocean love and you sitting over there, a god-damned pond."
Watch me cry.
Watch me bleed.
Watch me burn.
Pain feels good. I'm used to it.
It's 4:45am. I'm sitting by an open window. Watching the sky turn from black to blue. My eyes are closed and I'm listening to the birds singing.
Some people have no love to give. Walk away.
Find your peace.
Question mark.
'I don't belong here.'
'What the hell am I doing here?'
This world is insane.
I've come to realize that real people barely have friends.
I found love in spite of you.
I can't find 'the one' because he only exists inside of my mind.
Go away now.
"Shhhh, your cowardice... er.. secret is safe with me."
Little boys shouldn't tread in a grown man's tracks.
"Ich denke, ich mag dich jetzt am besten."
I bet you wouldn't even look me in the eye.
"I need people that are going to stand beside me, no matter what."
See me.
Real friends share their pain.
Let it suck the soul out of you.
Let it fuck with your head.
Let it rip your heart out.
Good luck with that.
Welcome back. He's all yours.
My heart is not allowed to wander anymore.
Rosebud.
Roses and attitude. That's all I have.
"Sorry you couldn't see it. For me, it was beautiful."
I always end up finding my way back to myself.
Can't reach for somebody whose mind is closed.
Come find me when you lose your way.
Bitter moods and beautiful blooms.
Can we just focus on the roses before they were cut down to please some motherfucker who gave them to his girl to slowly watch them die in a vase full of tepid water?
"Fuck you, racist."
I'll show you violence.
You claim indifference yet your page is full of simpy genuflections. Grow a fucking pair.
"I am outraged to the core by the George Floyd incident. Everyone on this planet is equal and if your momma didn't teach you that, then your momma done did you wrong."
"The best tweets are the ones where you don't give a fuck who likes them. Like my music, for instance. You don't like it? Your loss."
Don't be mistaken. You are perfect as you are. We all are.
"I'm not your fucking groupie, mister."
Will it ever get better? Will it ever?
'The picture you see is no portrait of me.'
"All those people, they trusted you."
Desperate to feel. Something. Anything.
"You're just desperate, aren't you?"
My conscience isn't a source of strength.
Weighed down by guilt.
I'm trapped by emotions.
You're free in all the ways I'm not.
'Singe ich ein Lied f√ºr dich?'
"Take aim, motherfucker."
Pedestals and shotguns.
I had one nerve left and you're fucking on it.
Stop with that fucking nonsense now please.
Go chop some wood. Keep those home fires burning.
"They don't want honesty from you. They want a quiet, little flower who agrees with everything they say in order to build up their teeny tiny egos."
It's when the stupid tweets come out of me that you know I'm tired.
I'm the best damn pouter in the free world.  *no pigeons were harmed in the making of this tweet
"Another all nighter. Wake up, guys. It's morning time."
It's raining again and I love it.
I feel like I'm being watched.
You're a warrior and don't you fucking forget it.
"Cigarettes, tattoos some red roses and you."
Don't tell me how to fucking Twitter. Ever.
All kinds of trouble today.
Look no further. You will find all the rage you need right here.
Bloom for me.
Do your mental disorders want to play with mine?
Never stay where you are not wanted. It's not a good look.
Hand-written letters and hearts worn on sleeves.
I bleed alone.
Stay away from this destruction.
I will poison you with one look.
Touch me and disintegrate.
Barbed wire around this broken heart.
There is a killer among us. A killer of souls.
Existential shenanigans.
I only speak to the birds now.
"'Vows are spoken to be broken. Feelings are intense. Words are trivial. Pleasures remain, so does the pain. Words are meaningless and forgettable.'"
I loved once.
Jesus Motherfucking Christ.
He is incapable of breaking that fourth wall. At least with me.
Come and sit a while. Tell me all about it.
Hi. Hope you're all doing well tonight.
Doesn't matter what people think.
"In my dreams, you let me in."
What the hell am I doing here?
We will never know now.
Don't save me. Watch me burn.
I don't even know what the fuck I am anymore.
The way you lie is so fucking beautiful. I can't look away.
ily goodbye
There are things inside of me that need to come out. Ugly things. Scary things. My apologies in advance.
I'm just sitting here quietly with this rose in my hand. I may have held it a bit too tightly. The thorns may have made me bleed.
We were never on the same page.
"A person filled with so much inner beauty, they restore your faith in humankind."
"'and for my next trick, I'll break my own heart by exaggerating my place in other people's lives.'"
Peace. I just want peace.
I want out of this head.
I feel too much.
I think too much.
I don't know what I'm doing here anymore.
Detonation of emotion.
Just gonna sit here and self destruct.
We choose not randomly each other. We meet only those who already exists in our subconscious. - Freud
I needed something for me.
Personification of d√©j√† vu. Repetition compulsion.  Empathic tendencies. Narcissistic attraction. Common denominators.  The problem is mine.   Red flags. White flag. Done.
Looking for someone else to obsess over. Now accepting applications.
I'm ok. You're ok.
You don't have to like it. You don't have to like me.
It's like the light just turned on.  I've been in the darkness far too long.
I'm a rage filled little beast.
"Crystal clear, motherfucker."
"Blah, blah, blah. What the fuck ever."
"From now on, I'll just like the words and leave you the fuck alone."
Just watching Ted Bundy interviews from 1977. Serial killers intrigue the fuck out of me.
'I'll eat a bowl of water with a fork before I give a fuck about your opinion of me.'
Show me your soul.
'they're too focused on your flower to ever truly appreciate the strength of your roots'  or the deadliness of your thorns.
Death of a friendship.
I'm going to become a bird and I will soar.
It's a fucking good day today!

"Thank you, Dave. I love your pure heart. üíï"
"I have someone I'd love to get to know better, but they're not having it.  An alcoholic friend who believes he is in love with me.   A love of all things that are apparently not good for me.  I'm going to crawl back into my shell now and hope I get swept back into the sea.  Bye"
I'm not here to judge you. I'm here to listen.
Who tries to steal the light from the brightest souls but cowardly thieves in the night?
"I'll have a lemon vodka and I'd like to sit on your lap, please."
You'll never take me alive.
*unleashes the hounds of hell*
I'm only accepting love now. The rest has to go.
It only takes one look in your eyes and I'm set free.
People who lie.
Deception and fakery.
Tellers of falsehoods.
Egotists and liars.
"People who think they're better in every way, but aren't."
People who leave you out because they don't feel you but don't have the courage to tell you.
People who want everyone to think they're good but don't give a shit.
People who band together but don't include you.
People who profess to love you and it's untrue.
People who say one thing and mean another.
Where is the fucking love?
"From now on, I go where the love is."
I could kill.
My anger is off the fucking charts.
"""Oh joy, the warm weather is here. Let us go outside and frolic in it.""  You stupid, stupid people. We are not out of the woods yet."
"The ones I love, I love hard."
"Dear Laken,   (@lithiumdrop)  I miss you.  Love,  VF  ·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶"
I get called bitch a lot but I've never been called a pushover or a doormat.

I love watching lovers dance with words. üñ§

'The dead aren't scary. It's the living you have to watch out for.'
I'm only here to haunt.
"In fact, why don't you just run along to bed since you refuse to contribute anything."
"You can be silent, but go and do it over there while the rest of the adults converse."
You know what the silent ones do? They teach you to not care anymore and isn't that just the saddest thing ever?
Sometimes I disappear. It's my thing.
You're just a ghost that doesn't know how to haunt.
Did you know that sunflowers move with the sun throughout the day? That's what I'm going to start doing. Face the lighted people and ignore the shadow skulkers.
Don't eat a flower today.
My favourite part of the day is going back to bed.
I love a good mindfuck.
"I don't understand how some people just let others go, like they were nothing. Could someone please explain that to me?"
It's a foreboding. Heed it.
"Oh, I see. You're one of those perky types who's always happy. I'd like to drive a nail through your motherfucking head."
Clever men are sexy af.
"If you don't know what this is, then we can't be friends. xx"
My alter-ego is a little harlot.
Forgetting all about me is not an option.
Stories live and die here.
No turning back.
"Tell anyone my secrets, I'll disembowel you."
Can I survive myself? That is the question.
I just want you all to know that I am pure evil. Rotten to the core.
I'm dead.
Why am I always cold?

Think of it like a game. Baseball. Annoy me three times and you're out.
"Wow. Your timeline is filled with porn. I'm thinking, dateless and staying that way."
"I'm just a rage filled, hateful little bitch."
He makes me angry. I have enough rage all on my own. I need someone who makes me laugh.
"Now, FUCK OFF."
"Pretty face means nothing. Some guys are into plain-janed, frumpy-assed, eyes-too-close-together, hawk-nosed complacents. Makes them feel better about themselves. Sobeit."
"Release me now, you piece of shit."
"You care, you show it. You don't, fuck off."
"I don't give a fuck how damaged you are. Silence either means you don't give a fuck, you can't give a fuck, or you don't care to give a fuck. Regardless, none of that shit works for me."

I have a friend who is a raging alcoholic. He is so far gone that he doesn't even believe he has a problem. Is there anything I can do for him or does he have to first admit to himself that there is a huge issue here that needs to be dealt with?

It's cute that you think I'm joking. It's cute that you're still fucking living.
Snap your spine like a twig I will. Mess with me.

"Drove 4 hours straight today. Exhausted. Goodnight, Twitter."
I miss you already.
I'm always quick to answer him back. I'm always the first one to reach out if we haven't texted in a while. I'm always the one who is trying to keep the conversation going. I'm always hungry for that connection with him. I think I'm going to leave the poor man alone now.
I think they call it cabin fever.
The laughs keep on coming today. Uncontrollable. Either that or I've finally cracked.
Don't poke the bear lest you be devoured.
It's when people make me laugh that I remember why I stick around this place.

I'm going to help you out here. You're coming across as too fucking thirsty with your 'my dick this' and 'my dick that'. Try not doing that and maybe you'll actually get someone to sit on yours.
"Instead of being a rude fuck, why don't you try being a brave one?"

I'd love to hear all about your conspiracy theories but tell me from OVER THERE.
I need to practice social distancing from myself.
You remind me of someone I used to hate.

I only ever showed the real me to one person here and he ended up wanting nothing to do with it.

I need to get away from it all.
You learn to run from what you feel.
Dying inside.
Crying inside.
*scream
The birds are my friends now.
Ghost kisses from all those he left behind.
Holding hands with ghosts again.
"I don't give you 'mean' me, unless I'm getting 'mean' from you and then I give it. I give it fucking good."
There is no excuse for purposely inflicting pain on a fellow human being. I don't care what the fuck happened to you as a child. Get help and own your shit.
Where is the love?
Where is the care?
Where is the kind?
Where is the good?
Cruel people and their selfish reasons.
"And just when you think you couldn't be hurt any deeper, that son of a bitch raises his knife one last time to finish you off and I am dead."
What's the question?
Being numb is the answer.
I am invisible.
I hide.

I am wreckage. I am ruin. I am remnants. This is all that remains.
You don't give a fuck and a fuck don't give you.
Escape into a nightmare.
Sleep is my only escape.
My mind likes to fuck with me.
My soul is messy.
I don't fit into boxes.
Kinda wanna defenestrate you.
Can I kill you now?
I'm still fucking there.
This means you. Fuck off.
I have no tcs. I want no tcs.
No more tcs or online crushes for me thank you very much.
"Do you like watching my words bleed, love?"
Shhh.. let me love you from afar.
I want to hug a Koala and tell it I'm sorry.
*sand *moon
Orgasm.
"The shorter the bio, the truer the soul."
He tried to steal my spark. I burned his ass.
One-sided soul recognition does not a connection make.
I broke my own fucking heart.
Roses? No. Give me the thorns.
"I'm ride or die, darling."
I knew from the moment I first saw you that I wanted to spend the rest of my life without you.
"You can be my sunlight, I'll be your moonshine."
Let me be the monster under your bed.
It's not very exciting to be good.
"I love the way you move. -me, to the ocean"
Pulse.
My mind is at war with itself.
There are some really beautiful people here and I say that without knowing what they look like.
My hair would look great wrapped around your fucking throat.
Internally struggling. Externally guzzling.
"There shouldn't be anything you say to a friend that would make them turn their back on you and yet, here we are."
Is it killing me? Is it making me stronger? Is it killing me? Is it making me stronger? Is it killing me? Is it making me stronger? Is it killing me? Is it making me stronger? Is it killing me? Is it making me stronger? Is it killing me? Is it making me stronger? Is it killing me
I have to stop bleeding. These sharks are so hungry.
STOP FUCKING WITH MY HEAD! -me to myself
Emotional extremes and other party tricks.
I need my head to stop torturing me.
Tug of war and other mind games.
Get your fucking priorities in order.
"Koalas are fucking dying and you, over there, worried about your TC talking to other people."
Skulls and crossbones for dinner.
Butterflies in your mouth. Flowers in your hair.
"If it wasn't me, it will be no one."
I will always wish for you.
Chaotic minds and clandestine hearts.
"There is nothing ordinary about you, my love."
Tickle my petals and watch me bloom.
It's a fiercely violent love.
All you're doing is making me stronger.
Stone doesn't burn.
He set fire to my soul and then watched me burn in the motherfucking flames.
Scream with me.
Can I have you?
A man filled with passion? Fuck yes.
You not understanding it does not make it any less real.
Legend has it there‚Äôs an intangible string of fate that binds two people destined to be together. I love that.
This silence is far from quiet.
He's still in my head.
Silence is a language.
"Love me in 2020, motherfucker."
New decade. Good Bye!!!! üíïüíïüíïüíïüíï
"Happy New Year to you, my bluebirds. xx"
"If you have a problem with me, it's best to let me know so that I can ignore you harder."
It didn't work out. We're stalking new people now.
I'm attracted to intelligence and you don't appear to have any.
"Exactly how many hearts have you collected, my darling?"
"Happiness is a state of mind. Not for me. I'm a miserable cunt, but maybe for you."
I'm old school. Be a man and take out the trash.
Filthy.
"You: Hi You: Hi You: ? You: Hey You: Hey You: ? You: Hello You: Hi  You: Hi  If this is what our correspondence looks like in DM, whatever your question is the answer is no."
I didn't lose him. I never had him.
I will never speak to you again. I am that stubborn and stupid.
I am a human catch-22.
I am an illusion. I am whatever you want me to be. That's the beauty of this place.
What the fuck are you waiting for?  *Asking for a friend.
"I have never blocked anyone on dm before in my life, but I blocked him. That was some toxic fucking shit right there. You can't save everyone."
Day 12 (?): No stalking. Is this what normal behaviour looks like because it's boring as fuck. I miss him.
He is afraid of she.
The weak are afraid of the strong.
The shallow are afraid of the deep.
The fake are afraid of the real.
"Careful where you dangle that carrot, motherfucker."
I don't start shit with people but I will finish it.
Hypnotic. I can't stop watching this.
I create my own love stories and their eventual demise.
"Same. That's the lure, they can't love me back."
I have an appetite for destruction. My own.
"I'm still happy you're on the planet, fwiw."
Where am I? And how can I leave?
The whole world is a sack of shit ripping open. I can't save it. -Bukowski
The only dreaming I do now is of sleeping.
He is walking around with my heart clenched between his teeth. There is no love left to give anyone else.
I don't have to explain myself to you or anyone else on the planet.
All I want to do is run away.
What a hopeless mess of solicitude I am.
My head likes to fuck with me.
No one. I am missing no one.
"So, who exactly is it I am missing?"
But that is not who you really are.
I miss who I thought you were.
"There is no such thing as weak love. It is either there, or it is not."
What I have found out in my No Stalking Saga is that so many people fall into the same category as myself.
"We meet, I fall in love, they do not, it ends."
"Heaven gained the sweetest angel on Christmas Day. Rest in Peace, sweet girl. #bthp #rip"
"Some kind of love, my darling."
'Hating people takes too much energy. I just pretend they're dead.'
End of Day Seven: No Stalking. I'm dead.
I don't know how to love. Never did.
"Falling stars, falling stars. Give me the falling moon."
A week of no stalking and I live to tell.
I truly believe that death would be the better option for those on the receiving end of my wrath.
My fucked up little head.
It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head. It was all in my head.
End of Day Seven. No stalking. I will say it's like losing someone. A death of sorts.
I feel muted. Good.
Who the fuck are you?
"I will never understand why people give up on the beautifully passionate souls and opt for the boringly tepid ones. Is it too much work for you? Are you so delicate? No, you're just a lazy coward."
I have a feeling that Trump will be the first impeached president to run for re-election and win it.
"""Truer words were never spoken - Ah, but true words leave hearts broken! Truth is only for the wise - Lovers ought to stick to lies‚Äù"
"I'm getting so good at this no stalking, I'm thinking of taking it up a level to antistalking: methodically learning his routine in order to systematically avoid him."
"Day Seven of no stalking. Still hard, but he makes it so much easier with his silence. üñ§"
We don't get to choose who we love. We just love.
"I'm here, in an empty room, wondering why I wasn't worth the effort."
This fucking chaos of thought.
"""I am not for everyone.""  I am not for anyone."
End of Day Six: no stalking. I think I'm getting the hang of this.
I honestly don't know what the fuck love is anymore.
New Year's Resolution: Break Free
One-sided love is called unrequited. I hate that fucking word.
Wasted love.
What a fool I've been. Laughable.
He didn't care. He never fucking cared. LOL.
Day Six: No stalking and all is well.
Admit defeat? Never.
I will always find the humour in everything.
Don't stop dreaming just because he was a nightmare.. er.. you had a nightmare.
"Love me better than that, please."
A part of me will always want what we never had.
"You have to respect the logical thinkers. I'm all fantastical, perplexing, nonsensical, romantic foolishness."
Who wins? Who loses?
Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart.
*screams for release*
It will not control me. I will control it.
Day Five: no stalking. I think I'm numb.
Is it getting harder or is it getting easier? I have no fucking clue.
Day Four: no stalking. I'm turning into cold stone.
"End of Day 3: no stalking. I miss keeping tabs on him, making sure he was okay. I can definitely feel the disconnect this evening."
I'm going to teleport myself back to the '80's just for the music. Swear to God.
"Empty, hollow, alone."
I feel so alone but there are people all around me.
When will this become habit and not torture?
Don't stalk. Don't stalk. Don't stalk. Don't stalk. Don't stalk. Don't stalk. Don't stalk. Don't stalk.
Day Three: No stalking. Fuck!!
Please do not touch the moon.
That was a tough day of 'no stalking'. I certainly hope it gets easier.
"I just want to live my life in peace and you, over there, permeating my mind like a fucking cancer."
"Do you ever want to take two stubborn people, who clearly belong to one another, throw them in a room together and not let them out until they agree to be together forever? I do."
A promise is a promise. Even if it's made to myself.
"Day Two: No stalking. Fuck, it's hard!!"
I am profoundly enchanted by the flowing complexity in you. -John Keats
I miss the birds.
"Assimilate, acerbate, annihilate."
"It's hard not to stalk when you're a stalker, but I made myself a promise. No more."
"Stop the glorification of 'busy'. If you care, then you MAKE the time."
He didn't ghost me. He never existed to begin with.
"I like your face. There, I said it."
No more obsessions. Just purity of thought and cleansing of spirit.
I love talking to people when they have no idea what I'm capable of doing to them.
"I'm just out here looking for my people. My tribe. So far, no good."
"Well, I'm afraid that's just not going to cut it, Brian."
"No make up, no filters? Fuck that! Give me all the make up and all the filters!!"
"Please, tell me the error of my ways. I want to be perfect. Just like you."
I will not be a slave to your opinion of me.
Strength is what I find attractive. Physical strength. Emotional strength. Mental strength. Strength of character. All the strengths.
"Thank you, Dave.  Beautiful compliment. üíï @RiveredelaLune"
No.
I'm too old to be wasting so much time.
"It's cool, we're just not looking for the same things."

Last full moon of the decade occurs on 12/12 @ 12:12am.

Feral philosophies.
Devastation leads to desensitization.
No one gets to tell me who the fuck I am.
You don't like animals? Cool. Get the fuck away from me.
All of my hate goes to abusers of animals.
You can calm down with all that hate. The Nazi Party is no longer hiring.
Your entire existence irritates me.  *mutes*
Your behaviour irritates me.  *mutes*
Your face irritates me.  *mutes*
Your timeline irritates me.   *mutes*
"No, not you, motherfucker. Him."
I am standing at the precipice of the abyss that is you. I'm about to dive in.
This darkness wants to consume me.
I'm leaving you (alone).
Smother me.
This will not end well.
I can't keep going through the motions. It's fucking exhausting.
You bring out the ugly in me.
I deserve to be alone forever.
I am a fucking monster.
I'm in the mood for annihilation.
"Pressure, pressure, pressure on me until I explode with defiance and everything obliterates into nothingness."
In vino veritas
You can have your perfect life. My life is messy. My relationships are complex. My outcomes are uncertain.
"To claim ownership of land on a planet that you will only be on for a temporary amount of time is foolish. You don't own the land, it's like your mother. So fucking take care of it."
I'm in the mood to kill a motherfucker.
"Eventually, we move on, don't we?  What other choice do we have?"
I'm.. sad.
I deluded myself into thinking you were someone that you are not and now I am in mourning for that person.
It was all a hallucination. The whole fucking thing.
"One's a little too cold (distant), and one's a little too hot (obsessive). One day, I'm going to find the one that's just right."

It would appear I am a magnet for lost souls of the masculine variety.
My soulmate died before I had the chance to meet him.
To try and convince me of your truth is to insult mine. I see all of your lies.

Misanthropic until the day I fucking die.

"I like fucking with people. In my defence, they set themselves up so perfectly for it and usually deserve it."
I see you downgraded. But that's none of my business.

"Don't mind me, just getting my power back."

Maybe you could unfollow first and we could just avoid all of the unpleasantries.
I don't want to follow you anymore but I want to give you the respect of telling you so.
I don't understand why people have to be such fucking shitbags. Do better.
You are a wretched little creature.
Your existence is futile.
"Boys, boys, boys.. get your shit together."
"Oh well, they come, they go."
"I believe in love. Not for me, but hey, I still believe in it for other people."

"If you can't handle my truth, then you need to fuck off. Bye."
Would it fucking kill you to show some emotion? Probably.
"You can't make people care. If they don't care, they don't care. Nothing you do or say is going to change that."
Shallow fucking people. The world full of them.
I'm tired of always being the one putting in all the effort.
Maybe there is no depth there. Perhaps I just dreamt it up in my head.
Just another sad girl trying to find her way out of her own fucking head.
When did I get so jaded?
Crush my petals between the pages of your favourite book and remember me always.
"What I'm currently reading just hurts my heart. Let's continue to be civil, kind and respectful towards one another, please."
He's got the devil in his eyes and I think I like it.
You are safe in my heart and that's where you will stay.
I don't wish you anything bad. Just that someone you care about treats you the exact same way you treated me.
I'm Canadian. We're not all that fucking nice.
"You know you're over it when you read them and think, 'Yup, whatever'."
I am inevitable.
I refuse to be put in the same category as your pathetic little groupies. Know the difference.
"Stop petting my peeves, motherfucker."
It's time to surrender.
The abyss calls me by name.
The darkness envelops me.
What terribly sad creatures we are.
"If another girl can take your man, she's doing you a favour."
Release me from this state of being.
There is no saving me now.
I have fallen into a permanent state of unhappiness.
Certain people just belong together.  @broken_stems  @sirensuicides   Now stop fucking around and prove to me that true love always wins out in the end because I want to believe it.
I am such a hateful creature.
"Vegans make me laugh with their 'vegan' burgers. You don't need a burger, you're a fucking vegan. Eat your bird food and stfu."
"Dirty fucking trick you played on my heart, darling."
"Fuck you, my love."
Same goes for screaming.
Some people are just shit. Cut them out immediately.
"If I start crying, I don't think I'll ever stop."
I'm generally miserable.
Take no prisoners.
I'm the human version of a fucking tsunami.
"Too many people using mental illness to profess their 'crazy', while those of us who actually suffer from it quietly watch from the sidelines, knowing full well that it's not a thing to boisterously 'brag' about. It's dark and it's scary and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
You're all over the fucking place. Stand still and breathe.
Spill your soul to me.
Bleed with me.
I don't allow myself to dream anymore.
Who checked on you today? Exactly. Fuck you.
Emotional blackmail is a disease. Get well soon.
Close your eyes and feel with me.
You will never be enough for the wrong person.
She is a mess but she is a masterpiece.
When you relate with the words.
You think you know someone. You don't know shit.
*flies away*
"Take me there, motherfucker."
Yes.
You're only coming through in waves and I'm getting seasick.
Unbullshitafy yourself.
Illuminate me.
I'm ambivalent.
"'I gave it all and you gave me shit, love.'"
"'I gave you ride or die and you gave me games, love.'"
"You fucked up, didn't you? Always looking, always searching for something fresh and new and all the while, there I stood, right in front of you, waiting.. wanting. You had me eating out of the palm of your hand, but you didn't care or you never knew."
Thank you for showing me how unimportant I really am.
Don't pay attention to what they say. Pay attention to what they do.
"The power of love, a force from above, bitch."
My heart never learns.
I put a spell on him because he's mine.
"I've removed all of my selfies. Now you can't steal my soul, motherfucker."
I'm at my absolute bitchiest when I'm behind the wheel.
My 'followers' count is going down rapidly. Good.
"I love the way everyone is jumping on this Asian bandwagon..   mina sako arigato, k-k-k-kawaii..   Guess what?..  you're white."
I don't give a fuck if this gets any likes. It stays.
Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in.  Breathe out.
My pain is fragmented and belongs to many.
You don't know me. I don't know you. Let's keep it that way.
"I scare myself. Atleast, the thoughts in my head do."
You don't scare me.  No one scares me.
"Yo, douchefuck. How many times I gotta tell you I don't wanna see porn coming down my motherfucking feed?"
*haunts you forever*
I need everything to stop.
"I am no one's 'side chick'. Move on, motherfucker."
""" Ä·¥á·¥Ä·¥Ö"" (three hours ago)  Fuck you then."
That moon is so fucking beautiful.
"The number of chances you give someone doesn't tell the world how loving you are without telling them how desperate you are to believe they care as much as you. True love resides in the first chance, stupidity in the second..'  I am such a fool."
You wouldn't know friendship if it bit you in the ass.
"I may not solve the inner torment and angst you go through as a human soul, but I could be the loveliest distraction."
"Under boob, side boob, tits and clits, coochie crack.. It all just gets really boring being anatomically described by the opposite sex in these animalistic ways. Do you even have a brain? Does it function?"
You make me wanna say bad words and do wicked things.
"The next time I crush on someone, just stab me in the heart instead. The end result will be the same, but faster."
Go away now. I've had enough of you.
I've fallen into 'photography twitter' and it's fucking beautiful here.
'I would tell you that I loved you If I thought that you would stay But I know that it's no use And you've already gone away'
It's you.
"Distort me better, my darling."
I like to feed the delusions of others right before I devour them.
I'm looking for new people to corrupt.
"A massacre of red roses, laying on the floor, bleeding out, dying."
"He is not the friend for you if he spends all of his time making everyone else feel special while you sit back, watching, feeling anything but."
"That's ok, boo. I now see where your loyalties lie."
and there's nothing more disappointing than when you realize you are not the only one it's being shown to.
"Coward: someone who runs away or abandons his responsibilities or obligations during times of danger, distress, pain, or fear of the unknown; someone whose concern is only for himself. ie: Gutless Wonder Namby Pamby Yellow Belly Fraidy Cat You"
It never fails. Those who intrigue me at first end up boring me at last.
You are not a part of the team if you're not willing to get your hands a little dirty.
I will never love again.
Get the fuck over yourself.
"If my attention alone is not enough, then you can fuck off."
I love when his little harem retweets the words he wrote for me. It gets me off.
Fuck it. I'm going walkabout.
My heart hurts today. I'm going to bed.
This bleeding heart nonsense is getting old quick.
"If you believe that God created the Earth in 7 days, then I have some swamp land in Florida I'd love to sell you."
"Pretty face don't make no pretty heart, motherfucker."
Take no shit.
No one can leave me hanging because I'd rather let go and free fall into the unknown.
You're a friend of mine. Don't fuck it up.
Danger ahead.
"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me, motherfucker."

"You, go away. You, come closer."
"Shhh, don't ruin it. Just shut your mouth."
"Ignore people long enough and they'll return the favour, motherfucker."
If I had a heart I would love you.
If I had a chance I would take it.
If I had a match I would light it.
If I had a seed I would plant it.
Can I get a motherfucking AMEN?
"If I send you a DM and I see that you've been active, but couldn't be arsed to reply. Then, by all means, you can do as the motherfucking birds do and flock off."
Vodka is my poison. Music is my therapy. Rage is my friend.

Beware the heffalumps and woozles.

I'm pretty sure I've had enough of your shit.
"I could write 20 tweets and nothing from him. 1 lame ass tweet from her and he likes and retweets the shit out of it. Go fuck yourself, hard."
"Love me, motherfucker."
I would love to touch your face.
Nothing pretty here. Move the fuck along.
"Bangs are for twelve year olds, you stupid cunt."
Do you know what ugly is? Ugly is wicked thoughts and bad intentions and has very little to do with what you look like. You are beautiful and I am ugly.
Yes. I am.
"RIP, sweet man."
For me. They can have you.
That's it. You're off the menu.
I'm gonna shank a bitch.
How in the hell did I get so jaded?
Life is far too short to be feeling someone who doesn't feel you back.

Avi is me. I'm fucking adorable.
I can't even keep a promise I make to myself.
My fascinations are true crime and people who run away from me.

"'Go on, take everything, take everything. I want you to.'"
That's ok. I've lived it all before.

In a relationship  with vodka.
I love those men who have the presence of mind to stay the fuck away from me. Down boy. Good boy. *pats head*
I am 100% out of control and not in the good way.
Don't make excuses until I make demands.
"I am so tainted, so horrid, so cynical, so corrupt. It's no wonder why everyone leaves me. I am such a vile creature."
The only issue I have is one of abandonment. I don't know where it originates from or why it stains my soul the way it does. I only know that it's been with me from a very young age and that people never fail to feed that particular paranoia within me.
"You can't kill a shadow, my love, and that is all that I am."
"For all the beauty in the world, you need the same amount of ugly to recognize and appreciate the difference. That's where I come in."
"Watch your back, motherfucker."
Do I fucking look amused?

Run along back to the shallow end where you belong. You can not handle the deep.
I tried my best with you which is more than most people get.
I refuse to take responsibility for your actions.
Your behaviour has everything to do with you and absolutely nothing to do with me.
"No make-up, no filter?  No need to say that, we can see for ourselves.  No offence."
I like your truth.

It would appear that I'm always last in line when it comes to you.
"I get the message. You're a loner, a rebel. Have fun with that."
Gone are the days I chase after people who do not want me in their life.
Hi. I love you. Love me back.
I love being ignored. It shows how much someone dislikes me and makes it hella easy to move on.

I accept the sadness. It is all I know. My mind rejects happiness. It is far too fickle and fleeting.
I'm screaming but nobody hears me.
"I believe the world is beautiful, it's just hard to see through the tears in my eyes."
I embrace my darkness. It's an immense part of me.
"Each and every day more tiresome and burdensome than the one before. I don't know where the will to carry on is coming from, I'm just happy that it's there."

Reflections in the glass of you of me of two things  that were never meant to be.
The moon and I go way back.
If they can let you go.. GO.. run fast.. away from them.. find someone who can't get you out of their head.. and doesn't want to.
"I see you there with your blue twitter verification check mark, and I wonder, who the fuck are you?"
"I like a man who knows how to take charge and if he's doing it wrong, I can just swat him over the head or something until he does it right."
'Husband? I never found a man good enough for that.'
"You've got to keep that delicious energy vibrating on my frequency, my darling."
I'm already damaged. I can handle the wreckage.

Silence is short for 'I don't give a fuck'.
"Before you, there was no one. After you, there will be no one."
I remember you.
"I don't hate the game, I hate the player."
"I exist, but I'm not living."
The hardest prison to escape from is the one in my mind.
Can you love someone who has no heart?
I'm alive. I'm dead.
"If you have to diminish who you are to avoid conflict, then your peace is an illusion."
Love me to death.
Pretty little heartache.

Sadness looks like me.

It's lonely here.

I'm going to need you to die a little faster.
"The older I get, the less I care."
I send these vixens your way to see if you will bite. You bit. Weak fuck.
"Can't gaslight me, motherfucker."
You bring out the ugly in me.
Smooth sailing right into an absolute dark abyss of sorrow and despair.
Struggling so hard against it when giving in is being set free.
It's always coming after me.
I can feel it coming.
That black hole is hungry for me.
Avoiding my eyes in the mirror again because I know the sadness will be all I see.
"It has gone from losing to lost and somehow, I'm okay with that."
You are a light seeker and I am the dark.

"You think you have me on some hook? some line? some dangling carrot? Think again, motherfucker."
Touch me here.
"Fuck off, boy. I'm way too old for you."
You never have to ask anyone about themselves because eventually they will show you exactly who they are. You just need to pay attention.
You hear that?
"Well, he wasn't good enough for me so he'd be perfect for you."
There isn't a human on this planet I can't handle.
"There isn't anything I say here that I wouldn't say right to your goddamned face, fucker."
"I'm not bitter, I'm fucking annoyed."
"Lady, the fact that you felt the need to unfollow/block me because your TC was throwing a little too much attention my way makes you a weak individual in my eyes. Keep walking around with those blinders on. You'd make an excellent wife."
Now that's what I call a man.

You have clearly lost the plot.

"I like people that make me think, make me feel, make me learn."
I'm a work in progress.
There comes a time when we have to stop blaming everything that 'happened to us' in the past and just work on loving the person we are today.
"Fuck you, I'm adorable."
"'You can spend minutes, hours, days, weeks or even months over-analyzing a situation; trying to put the pieces together, justifying what could've, would've happened... or you could leave the pieces on the floor and move the fuck on.'"
My opinion on the matter is fuck you.
And so you turn off that switch inside yourself and all that nonsensical stuff that used to irk you no longer has that power. Carry on.
Mood.
"I will get down to the crux of the matter, probably destroying everything along the way. It's what I do because I need to know and I will stop at nothing to get the information I want."
I go back to black.
That should make some of you happy.
It won't be much longer until I disappear from here.
I really need to smarten up when it comes to matters of the heart.
My superpower is caring for people who do not care back.
Who says that murder's not an art?

Carried a bucket around with me today for all the overabundance of love abounding. Gave me something to hurl in.
Make my kid cry and you will be a dead person walking.
I don't have a Valentine.
"‚ÄúDon't threaten me with love, baby. Let's just go walking in the rain.‚Äù"
The only way to get over it is to go into it.
"Well now, aren't you just a beautiful boy."
I guess I just got tired of trying to convince you that you're worth it.
No point telling anyone anything if they don't want to hear it.
"There ain't no mystical, magical, motherfucking man that's just gonna save the day. You gotta buckle up, stay strong and handle your own shit. #DiaryOfADeadGirl"

"Delusions of grandeur much, motherfucker?"
You greedily eat my words. You can't consume them fast enough. Yet they go ignored. Fuck you.
No more time will be wasted on you.

"Instead of trying to convince people how wonderful you are, why don't you just let them figure it out for themselves? It's called humility. Have some."

My superpower is wasting time on people who don't give a fuck about me.
I am so disappointed in you that I can't even speak. Nothing left to say.
"Fall in love with me, so one day we too can sit at the dining table staring at our phones and ignoring each other."
'I don't even care anymore. And do you know what's even better? I don't care that I don't care.'
The only competition I have is myself.
"I like to think that I'm a pretty tough bitch, but one 'dog reunites with owner' video and I'm bawling like a motherfucking baby."

What is your purpose?
The reason I don't like jocks is because they spend too much time exercising the body and not enough exercising the mind.
There's nothing married people like more than the thrill of setting up someone single. It's like they want me to be as miserable as they are.
"The moment I saw his face, I knew I was in trouble."
He is quiet stoic proud strong smart reserved introspective funny angry lovely.  He is you.
The little boy in him is holding hands with the little girl in me.
Thanks for piquing my interest and then feigning indifference when I reciprocated. You're a goddamn motherfucking scared little waste of space.
I don't have time for your issues.
"Listen, if you're not going to talk with me, get the fuck off my page. Nice meeting you. Yadda, yadda, yadda."
"If I wasn't an empath, I'd be a killer."
"Broken bits of fragmented pieces that, when viewed whole, become something beautiful."
Don't talk to me about pain.
Heart fracturing like a kaleidoscope of burning colours.
I like that wide-eyed stare of horror they give me when they realize they're dealing with crazy.
"I gave you ride or die, you gave me nothing."
Where do you put all the hearts you break?
"Happy Birthday, @hazmatnz!! I'm popping all of your balloons!! ;)"
What does it feel like to be my prey?
Lethal. Brutal. Deadly.
"The walls I build are for your protection, not mine."
I would like to enter @DothTheDoth's mind for a time. See what makes it tick.
Make like a tree and fuck off.
I can't give you blind devotion as I have a brain that functions.
"You're fickle and now, you're unfollowed."
You hate someone because of their political preferences? How very mature of you.
"I'm like a cat. I want attention when I want attention. I want to be left alone when I want to be left alone and, oh ya, I will scratch you and bite."
"Sometimes, the anger takes control and it's like I have no power to stop it."
"""He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed."""
"Beautiful boys with sad, sad eyes tug at my heartstrings the hardest."
Sleep because fuck everything.
I've got a crush on you. (still)
I go after what I want. May God help you if it's you.
"Did I scare you away, flower?"
'The way out of a room is not through the door. Just don't want out. And you're free'  -Charles Manson
Hate me harder. I feed off that shit.
"I am a vile, jealous creature. Keep your distance lest I focus all of my green-eyed monster rage upon you."
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend, grasshopper."
"To him, I am one of many which is most unfortunate and very sad."
I just wanted to give you your smile back.
You're like a bullet in my heart. Thanks.
I only want the best for you and that would be me. ;)
I will not be a part of the chorus. I either star in your life or I'm not in it at all.
Do I
"Dear #oomf   ·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶ ·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶ ·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶  Sincerely, VF"
"Precarious. Yes, that's a good word to describe my mental well being."
I'm drowning in your sin.
I am on fire.
Fuck. He has blue eyes.
"Not you, you dumb fuck. Him."
I would let you touch my purest places with your dirty fucking hands.
Or forever.
If only for a moment.
Take me away.
"I'm a mirror. If you're cool with me, I'm cool with you, and the exchange starts. What you see is what you reflect. If you don't like what you see, then you've done something. If I'm standoffish, that's because you are. -JayZ"
"I like people when I'm not with them, or around them, or in their general vicinity."
Enya's voice is akin to what I feel an angel would sound like.
"Messing with me is like messing with the wind. As soon as you gain your ground, I'm going to knock you on your ass."
I don't need your heat. I'm already on fire.
He shared more with the world than he ever did with me and isn't that just the saddest thing of all?
"If you like your steak medium well or well done, might I suggest a fucking hamburger instead?"
Can somebody help me?  No.  No one can help me.
I didn't even know that I was lost until I found him.
People can be so fucking beautiful and looks have nothing to do with it.
It's sad. So sad.
All I know is that he hung the moon for me.
"The difference between her and I is that her heart has been broken many times and my heart has only been broken once, a very long time ago. Who's stronger? She is, for allowing herself to fall again and again and again. I don't have it in me to do that, to feel that pain again."
Stranger danger but he's so beautiful I can't stay away.
"""They serve like a mockery in way of reality because they think everything is smiles and sweetness and flowers, when there is something bitter to taste. And to pretend there isn't is foolish."""

"Hell hath no fury like me, motherfucker."
You have annoyed me for the last time. I no longer allow it.
That's fine. Delete your words to me and keep retweeting her and her and her. I get it. No further explanation required.
Is there a reason people here 'like' photos and then unlike them? Respond to a tweet and then delete the response? No big deal but the behaviour annoys the fuck out of me.
There are realms in this life where the terms of sense and nonsense do not apply.
I'm fighting the wolf. I am the wolf.
It would never work out. He's a Republican.
'I expect pitiful progress from politics. Our lives have been far more improved from reason based science and technology than they will ever be from confirmation bias based politics.'
'I feel no anger at politics. I accept that politics is based on emotion rather than reason with the result the political brain is ruled by confirmation bias not reason.'
*him/he
Clever replies like this are the reason I stick around. üòÜ
Where the fuck are the assassins when you need them?
'Put his hands on her'??.. Give me a fucking break. The truth is right here. LOOK AT IT AND SEE.
"I don't hate life, I hate people."
"You can't deny truth, my love."
"Large, large, big, big. Large, large, big. Does the man know any other words?"
Do you know what you need? An AK-47. It takes care of a lot of problems.
"'Me flirting: So, who's your favourite serial killer?'"
Shut up. I can't hear his silence.
"'Haunted by your soul Haunted by your hair Haunted by your clothes Haunted by your eyes By your soul, by your hair By your clothes, by your eyes By your voice, by your smile By your mouth, by your soul By your hair, by your clothes By your eyes, by your voice By your smile'.."
I love you. Love me back.
Give me kisses.
"Driving: Impossibly beautiful, fall coloured trees against a dark backdrop of stormy grey skies. Music: Rachmaninov Piano Concerto in C Minor. Would highly recommend."
"Mute me. It feels so good when you do, baby."
Piss me off and I'll go Medusa on your ass.
I am chaos and contempt.
No wonder you can't find a woman. That air of desperation surrounding you fucking stinks.
"You have a problem with me? That's your issue, not mine."
The mind can only tolerate so much disappointment before it refuses to further process that particular emotion and that's where indifference comes in.
I like to leave little post-it notes to myself while working. Keeps me motivated.
"As a species, humans suck."
"When forever is divided by zero, you find yourself somewhere in between."
"One day, you're going to realize that your behaviour is directly related to how others are going to treat you. My suspicion is that you are well aware of this fact and use it as a crutch to keep people away. Congratulations, it worked with me."
It's in my head.
Caged in like a fucking animal.
I'll drink to *that.  *anything
I'm a mess. Love me anyway.
One fluid gesture. My bullet through your brain.
I'm already there.
Eeks! I've fallen into poetry twitter and I can't find my way out. Send help.
"Watching a panel interview on the news:  Me: Who is that second from the left. She's ugly. Actually, is it a man?  My father: No, it's not a man, but she's French.  Well, that explains it then. üòÜ"
Thanks for making me a fighter.
"Sometimes people change and you wonder what the hell it was you ever saw in them. Then you realize, they haven't changed at all. You have."
Humans are such predictable creatures.
You turned out to be nothing.
The weak see themselves out. Goodbye.
"You've got to be stronger than that to deal with me, love."
I caught myself alive once.
Your silence is my favourite sound.
Heads up. Nobody gives a fuck.
I caught myself a live one. üòÜ
Most of Trump supporters are stupid people who are not aware they are stupid.  #dunningkrugereffect

Make it stop.

"If my DM's are bothersome to anyone, just let me know and I will stop at once. I'm not going to perish. I'm not going to die. I will just respect your wishes and move on. No biggie, but you would first need to communicate that to me so that I am aware."

You dodged a bullet with me. Believe that.
I have no enemies here but a lot of people perceive one in me. Whatever.
I now have to stop looking out for you here and that just makes me sad.
I love hard but I don't give a fuck even harder.

"If you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave."
Your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone.
These wounds won't seem to heal.
This pain is just too real.
There's just too much that time cannot erase.
You still have all of me.
You used to captivate me by your resonating light.
I'm bound by the life you left behind.
"Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams."
"Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me."
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone.

Retweeting people I can't stand just to get my attention is called idiocy. Either that or you're a fucking liar.

The comment on that post turned me cold. I am now made of ice.
There are limits as to what I'm willing to put up with.
You can take your cold shoulder and your shitty attitude and don't let the door hit you on your way out.

"This whole breathing thing, in-out-in-out-in-out, is getting pretty repetitive and boring."

I am fine with the rage that continuously threatens to engulf me. It doesn't put up with anyone's shit and neither do I. We understand each other. We get along.
Lord I love an obsequious runt.
"It's ok, they don't have to see your worth. As long as you know what it is, you're good."

Open your fucking mind and see things from all sides.
'Emotional violence.  Leave in silence.'
It's not my heart. I don't have one of those.
My brain has taken me hostage.
I scream in silence.
Silence speaks too. Loudly.
All that I will ever be is a scream.
I don't mean to be rude but could you fuck the hell off at once please.
You've lost all of your friends because you never learned how to be one.  I never had any to begin with.
"One part of me thinks that you are strong, quiet, powerful and mine.   The other part thinks that you are cheap, obvious, weak, and anyone's who will have you.  Which is it?"

Love me. Love me. Love me more.
Hope is drunk tonight.
The only time people listened to me was when I died.
Perfect on the outside. Rotting and decaying on the inside.

I don't belong here

I feel you.
I can feel him.
He watches me.
Just another face in the crowd.

I can not deal with eternal optimists. They irritate the hell out of me.
"If you claim to have the perfect life, you're either living in a dream world, your head filled with cotton, or you're lying."
Do not profess to have the perfect life. I simply will not believe it.
There is a war going on inside my mind.
Nothing is ever perfect.
"Love me already, darling."
Unfinished business.
I can't walk away from him. I won't.
The only direction that makes sense to me is away from you.
You've been hiding for so long that you will not allow yourself to be found.
"If you're not broken, then you haven't been paying attention."
Go away. Come back.
Do you want to die? All you have to do is ask me nicely and I'd be happy to oblige.
"You're a one hit wonder with those orgasm tweets, aren't ya sparky?"
And to come to the realization that you were never with me. Never truly on my side. That I've been alone this whole time. Hard.
"I thought I was disappointed in you. But that was wrong. I'm disappointed in myself. Disappointed for believing that you were special, that you were a friend, that you had my back when, in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. You don't care and now, neither do I."
I don't know anything about anything.
My heart never learns.
I stand alone.
I deserve the truth but you lie.
I think I'm holding on to nothing.
*runs to you*
"""I wish more people cared about Earth as much as they cared about who they believe created it."""

"The only person I want to eviscerate is you, my darling."
Never have I been more aware of how alone I am in this world.
There is power in solitude.
Darkness can be beautiful too.
Full moon. Warm spring air. Heavy rain. Loud thunder. Bright lightning. Intoxicating winds. Perfection.
Dark skies. Clouds. Storms. Rain. Always with me.
Release me.
I just want to find someone who is all mine and wonderful.
"There is absolutely zero point messaging someone who, for whatever reason, can't or won't respond."

I'm a fucking accident waiting to happen.
Geography has little to do with where my loyalties lie.
"I was here for you and now, I'm not."
Some people just make you smile. I like those people.
I like seeing your face in my notifications.
"Go break some more hearts, boy. Mine has already been torn asunder."
"You never even tried with me, did you? Know why?.. because you never really fucking cared."
It's either you or it's me. I pick me. Now move along.
"If you pronounce the 'l' in salmon, then you're an idiot and I can't talk to you."
I am not a 'catch'. I am a fucking 'mess'.
"So, here I am, right in front of you. Like it or leave it."
".. so then, I skated home from work. #ONStorm"
"People get around on this site, yo. You don't think people talk, bruh?"
"Musically speaking, I still haven't been able to progress beyond the 80's."
Would you kill a bug for me or would you just catch it and put it outside?
"Scarlett, you've gone after each and every one of my TC's in the exact order that I had them. Sloppy seconds simply must be your style."
"You do twitter your way. I do twitter my way. 'As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.'"
"Fade away if you must, but I will always burn strong."
He's not talking about me either. Just some made up lady he created in his head.
"Sorry to burst your bubble, sweetheart but he's not talking about you."
Nope. This time I'm not biting.
The night carried on weeping.
The wind whispered lewd thoughts in my ear.
The stars woke me up last night.
I never thought I'd be this tired.
"Every day, wake up. Every night, fall asleep. What the hell is it all for?"
"And sometimes, when I'm tired, I just quote brilliance."
'Standing on the beach With a gun in my hand Staring at the sea Staring at the sand  ...  I'm alive I'm dead I'm the stranger'

"Kiss me awake cuz I'm sleeping, baby."
You look angry.  *follows*
"Even if you don't pick me, you'll always be mine."
I can't feel anything anymore.
I started dying the day I was born.
I scream for you to stay but you don't hear because you've already walked away.
I will not give in to the darkness. I will make it mine.
To give up pain is to let go.
Melancholy sits on my shoulder like a black crow.
Birds of a feather burn together.
You think that you've found them. You do. You do. The only trouble is that they haven't found you.
My favourites have always been the ones whose pain I can recognize.
"'Humans beings are simple, predictable clich√©s. Broken hearts, betrayal. It's all been done a billion times before. If you're lucky enough to recover, you can be sure that just as you finish filling in all the cracks in your life, the next one is starting to open.'"
"I've imagined holding your still beating heart in my cold, cold hands."
My whole entire life is just one long never ending internal scream.
Found your man in my dms again. Might I suggest a shorter leash and some reining in?
'You can't talk  Butterfly language With caterpillar people.'
Go away and take your bleeding heart with you.
"Same idea, different design."
'What about us?
What about trust?
What about love?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
"I'm not tortured, I'm fucking annoyed."
The only thing you'll ever be to that one is a fan.
That's a lovely shade of 'moo' you're wearing.
I have no respect for weak people.
"If she follows you back, I'm going to know that you begged her to."
People are clearly cattle with an overwhelming need to be herded.
Wow. So you've unfollowed everyone and now THEY have to beg YOU for a follow back? The reek of self-importance is strong with this one.
"When you don't receive exactly the response you are expecting when you are expecting it you turn into an asshole. That is your issue, not mine. I am not a motherfucking puppet."
I've been waiting a very long time for him. What's another century or two?
I deserve the truth but you lie.
I want to run to him but he won't have me.
Something in the way you move.
You are safe in my heart. I keep you there.
"Why are all the most fabulous men taken and all the single ones are all,  ""Me, me, me. It's all about me.""? I guess the question answers itself."
"I will never be the beautifully poetic tweeter because I'm far too raging, misanthropic, hellfire of a person."
'I must be sick in the head. I think I need destroying.'
I'm decayed on the inside like a poison apple. Sweet on the outside but rotten to the core.
It is April and you are the fool.
Who cares? You do. It's in everything you say and everything you do.
Happy for you. *Mean it.  *Fuck off
"Hello, I'm here."
How fucking old are you anyway?
I am swimming in a sea of stupidity today. Fucking people.
It is within the destruction that I find strength.
I'll take the pain.
There is definitely something wrong with me.
"What you did there, that was a very dumb thing to do. Are you stupid? I'm starting to think you're stupid."
*takes all the evil things that life did to me and throws it in the trash*  Nope. Still heartless.
"I will convince you that you are the only one I see, but it won't be true. I am not human. I have no soul."
"You can't hide here, my friend."
Isn't the internet fun?
Your first mistake was trusting me.
Pay him no mind. He's just a sad little man flinging his shit and seeing what sticks.
Chasing skirt on the internet. How original. *yawns*
Fuck off and take your little whores with you.
Why did you have to turn out to be such a colossal piece of shit?
"One little match, one huge explosion."
Is it rude to unfollow a friend who isn't really a friend?  Asking for a friend.
"Doesn't matter what you do, I'll just go on loving you."
"That's right, motherfucker, watch me bleed from the wounds you inflicted. I only grow stronger because of it."
"If I wasn't a bitch and you weren't an asshole, we'd be in love."
"I want movie night, popcorn and you."
I'm 'old school' loyal.

He's afraid of me. Adorable.
"I hate the expression, 'You owe me one.' One what? One punch in the motherfucking face?"
I will never complain about bird song but those loud fuckers woke me up with their chirping today.
I don't go out of my way to hide anything but I also don't readily share shit that isn't anyone's fucking business.
You know I'll always come back to you.

Too tired to care anymore.
There is zero sincerity here.
Nope. Absolutely not.
Go run. I'll be right here.
I'm out of sight and I'm out of mind.
You're a fucking grown up. Act like one.
The only truth I know is what you tell me.
Weak people as far as the eye can see.
"It wouldn't be the first time I had a friendship with a male tweeter and some jealous, insecure female living in a dream world blocks me because of it. I suspect it won't be the last. *sighs*"
So much behind the scenes action with other people here. I only care about the one on one connections I have. Keep the drama to yourself.  He said.  She said.  They said.  We said.  Mutes Blocks Idgaf

"We will not all find love. We will not all find happiness, but we will all find death. Each and every one of us."
"That sad, strong, quiet beast of a man? He's with me."
There will be food and drink and laughter and perhaps even a few murders.
"Keep that snake in it's cage, mister."
Leaving scars.
Falling for the fallen.
I'm just here for the melancholy.
Get out of the dark before the dark gets into you.  It's too late for me.
Elastic mind. Stretch it.
I know it's bad for me. I still want it.
"Good-bye to you. It's been.. well,  it's been something, I'm sure."
"Butterflies? Nah, mine all flew away years ago."
I'm free.
"I love when people tell me I'm too much. Fuck off then because clearly, you are not enough."
"Keep chatting up the little girls, player. You couldn't handle a real woman even if she landed square on your dick."
"Are you for real?.. because if you are, it's fucking laughable."
"Let's get one thing straight, you came to me but what I now realize is that you go to everyone. Tsk tsk."
I need this fucking chatty cathy at my work to shut the fuck up before my fist accidentally lands on her face.
They will tell you whatever it is you wish to hear in order to ensnare you. The only thing I'll ever tell you is the truth.
Ask any man what the word monogamy means and they will tell you it's a type of wood.
You can never win because you do not want to win. I'm familiar with the concept because I am the same.
"Drop the mask, darling. It doesn't hide a thing."
"It doesn't matter who your flavour of the month, week or day is. I will hate them all."
Potential breach.   *locks account*
The lucky bastard never saw it coming.
To all Twitter Doms: I am the voyeur. I am the sadist. I am the dominant. No need to bother with me. Thanks.
Clever one. I like clever.
"There are men out there who are way more high-maintenance than women.  No, thank you."
*accidentally attacks you with a samurai sword*
JUSTICE.
ACCOUNTABILITY.
REVENGE.
KARMA.
RETRIBUTION.
Don't touch me.
See me.
Something about that one. Special.
"Bottom line, I don't share men."
Starlings. Sky dance. Beautiful.
All those icy blue eyes on the coldest fucking people.
I am one step away from being the defendant at your murder trial.
You can't do the distance thing and I can't do the proximity thing.
"I'm an obsessive, compulsive, addictive mess."
"Stone cold, baby."
I found a boy.
I think you write beautifully.
"""I mute you.""  Really? Well I mute you too, baby."
When exactly do you think it will be that people realize animals were not put on this fucking planet for our goddamned amusement?
Is this the disease or is it me?
Too many cars. Too many people. Quantity vs quality. There is no meaning.
Thought you were different. Thought wrong.
"Break my heart, stain my soul so I know it's real."
I reached out my hand to you and you slapped it away.
I am one drink away from telling you what I really think.
I know what you look like.
"I see you over there, hiding in the corner, not saying a word. Speak."
"You get dick pics sent to your dm because you've got your tits hanging out in your avi. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out, whore."
Amen.
"You don't have to like me, fool. I like me."
I'd rather die than give you control.
I could teach you a thing or two about self-respect.  Rule#1  Have some.
That's right. They have no power over you. Realize it. Move on.
Everything I touch is beautiful.
Forever looking for that puzzle piece.
Watching murder. Thinking about you.
Perched upon his bottom lip and he's about to swallow me whole.
'She was not fragile like a flower. She was fragile like a bomb.'  tick tick tick  boom
The very things that piss you off in others are the same things you do to others. Isn't that fucking hilarious?
"'I like you in that I like you to scream but if you open your mouth then I can't be responsible for quite what goes in or to care what comes out so just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout and let's move to the beat like we know that it's over.'"
The thrill is gone.
"All those moments will be lost in time,"
"I'm not riding off into the sunset with anybody. I'm a drifter, baby. 'I was born to walk alone.'"
Watch out for those expectations. They will end up killing everything.
"If you think that my tweets are about you then congratulations, you're a fucking narcissist living in a dream world."
I'm attempting to create a friendship where clearly the other person couldn't give two fucks about cultivating a friendship with me. Good times.
It was all in my head.
roses are red fragrant and sweet much like a man when you first meet   but beneath the rose petals which are soft to the touch lies the curse of the thorn that can hurt you so much  when from the garden of life your man you must pick remember the rose and watch out for the prick
The skies are always stormy with me.
I just want him all to myself. Forever. Is that too much to ask?
"Baby, you don't have to approve of anything I do. I'm grown."
"I am the disease, you are the cure."
"My Adonis, show yourself."
I am the nightmare.
"I want  Want me back, motherfucker."
"Delicate is fine in chantilly lace, flower blossoms and baby birds but not in people."
"This whole timeline serves as a warning because all the words are true. Run away fast, little flower."
"Not all women are cold, heartless and controlling. I mean, I am but most aren't."
Time keeps moving on. Doesn't matter what you do.
I will not be herded in with the masses.
I don't want to work *today.  *ever again
"The colour of the eyes is not important. The kindness, love and intensity you see reflected within them is."
"It only happened once? Once is one too many, my friend."
'The real question is not whether life exists after death. The real question is whether you are alive before death.'
I don't have attachment issues. I don't want to be attached. No issue there.
Being awake during daylight hours is highly overrated.
That's two motherfucking motorcycles I've heard in as many minutes. Where the hell did I put my shotgun?
*sighs*
He said I was cute but psycho.
I'm the angriest little tweeter there ever was.
Why do you always see and believe the worst of me?
"If they think you're horrid, let them. They don't know you. They don't know your struggle."
You took it away. You took it away. Why would you do that?
iiwii
"I don't give a fuck if you love me or hate me, block me or mute me. As long as I'm getting you to feel something, I'm good."
I hit a nerve. My work here is done.
This will be the last time you are ever referenced by me.   Man of honour? Bullshit.
"At least the porn accounts are up front and honest about what they like. You sir, are a closet pedophile."
"I hate it when I think I see real charm and integrity in an individual and they turn out to be a narcissistic, child chasing, yellow-bellied, piece of shit, poor excuse for a human being individual."
Hypocrite. That's you.
He's got a hard on for his next conquest.
"Like a phoenix, I rise from the flames."
"'Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds.'"
At least I can say I tried.
Such a shame. I really liked you.
It would never work out. He's too flirty and I'm too jealous. There would be carnage.
"Keep burning those bridges, baby. I'll be right behind you with the gasoline."
Avi is me  staring you down for the cunt you are.  What are you going to do about it?  Absolutely nothing.
I sexually identify as your worst fucking nightmare.
"He fancies himself a ladies man when the reality is he is downstairs in his mommy's basement, quietly masturbating into a tissue."
"If you're rude to me, you're going to get rude back. End of."
Heed.
"Say nope to dope. You know, the people kind."
I want to hibernate for a year or thirty.
Over it.
*screams bloody murder*
"You and you and you, fuck off."
My straggle will handle it.
Did I say soft blocks? I meant BLOCKS.
People try to be cruel. I'm immune.
That's two soft blocks in two days. I'm on a roll. Come at me.
Strange little sad little man.
"Don't spar with me, fucker. I will win every time."
"Jesus Fucking Christ. Everyday, one of you. Every fucking day. Exhausting."
"Tongue in cheek. Read up on that, motherfucker."
You don't like/retweet me enough. Tell me again why exactly do I follow you?
A man who is strong enough in his masculinity to like and retweet other men is a sexy man indeed.
"If you don't like my new avi, you can fuck off."
"Tell me, playboy, do you ever like/retweet any men? All I see on your feed is a sea of women. Are you that desperate?"
'I've loved you for a thousand years. I'll love you for a thousand more.'
Smells like roses to me.
I just want him to ravage me all night long and take my garbage out in the morning. Is that too much to ask?
How rare to find someone whose internal beauty matches their external beauty. What a beautiful new avi @fairycemetery. üíï
All life did for me was make me a brilliant liar. Nobody knows my truth.
I'm not sorry for shit.
"To the bitch that blocks me and the bastard who ignores me, whatever gets you through the day fuckwits. I did nothing to you."
"My boss is a fucking asshole. There, I said it."
I have spoken.
"I will never stop running. Running from you, running from me."
My poetry can be read from my eyes.
My walls are built from the souls of the deadbeats that did me wrong.  They are strong. They are strong.
"If you have a personalized license plate, then I already know you're fucking obnoxious."
If he doesn't worship the ground you walk on he's just not that in to you.
I'd say your behaviour on here is typical not special.
"He wants your attention until he has it, then he no longer wants it."
"The enemy of your enemy is your friend, grasshopper."
Two against one. We win.
It no longer matters what you say. I know who you are now.
Sometimes you need to remind people that you can be a bitch too.
'At least you can see my crazy coming from a mile away. I don‚Äôt try to sneak that shit in.'
The world of psychology is fascinating to say the very least.
Are you Jason Momoa? No? Then fuck off.
One of you. Just one of you.
"Fickle, fickle, fuckety dickle."
Like and retweet whomever the fuck you please. It's not my fault you have zero fucking taste.
"Ignorance breeds ignorance, motherfucker."
What happened to you?
"You don't see shit, bitch."
"Anyone can say anything about anybody. If you want the real story, the truth, come to me."
"You deleted your end of our entire conversation where you were being a rude cunt without provocation? Gee, I wonder why? Good thing I screenshot it, you vile bitch."
I don't have a problem with people until people have a problem with me. Then I have a huge problem with people.
I'd fight to the death but you aren't worth the bloodshed.
Murder on my mind and you in my heart.
You can not control how other people will act or react to you. Only how you do with them.
Thought I was following @hazmatnz. Must have been a dream I had. ;)
"You've heard of sour grapes? There are also sour cherries. Vile, bitter, horrid, sour little cherries. ;)"
"Thanks for all the twitter love @starsboy63. Fuck, I need a cigarette. ;). üíï"
"She just pinned a clit tweet because she's edgy and shit. I bet you're 300 pounds with an ugly face and rotted out teeth, farm girl."
Yep.
"To all the people who have a problem with me, please form a nice straight line, put your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you and conga line yourself the fuck out of my life."
"If you think twitter gives you a free pass to be rude just because you are able to hide behind your computer, you would be dead wrong."
Zero time or energy for hostile cunts.
"Just to be clear, I don't do 'Twitter Crush' competitions. If you like someone here, good for you. It has nothing to do with me so leave me out of it. Unless, of course, it's the one man I have my eye on, then it's fight to the death and you'd better come prepared."
"Jealousy is a horrible fucking disease. Get well soon, bitch."
Yes. Yes I am.
"Did you hear about the poacher that got eaten by the lions? They left his head, only his head, like they were planning on mounting it somewhere out in the wild. Human trophy. Oh, the irony. I love it so much."
"I'll stab you in the chest and rip that motherfucking heart of yours out myself if I have to, but it will be mine regardless."
"I'm not needy, I'm wanty."
Me.
"Oh my god, the birds."
"Quit staring at my pics, creep."
You're smart enough to know that you're settling but weak enough to end up settling.
Your treatment of me has less to do with me and more to do with the fact that you're just a fucking shitty person.
I'm an attention junkie. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
"I'm not the stalker, bitch. You are. I have zero notifications turned on, for anyone. Remember that."
Those Geminis though....
&lt;-------- Flawed.
I miss my ocean.
"She reminds me of you @AstrumGlass. Beauty, bones. Saber-toothed sublimity. Raw. Real."
Home.
"You see   a cold, hardened man with little to no capacity for love.   I see   the sweetest, softest soul with insurmountable strength."
"Lies, lies, lies, lies Books, books, books, books Burn, burn, burn, burn Fire, fire, fire"
"Either he is trying to maintain his mystery or he has no desire in pursuing even so much as a friendship with me. Either way, bored as fuck."
"Don't attack me, I'm fabulous."
I wish some people would get a clue and then fuck off.
"'Don't threaten me with love, baby. Let's just go walking in the rain.' üíï"
"Shhh, I have a secret valentine. It's so secret, he doesn't even know it yet."
"Darling, your MO is as sharp as a knife."
"Me, when I don't get my way."
'Never kiss anyone's ass to get ahead. It's an illogical concept to place someone on a pedestal in order for them to grant you access to it.'
"Hey Everybody,  'Azi' from 'Africa' is 'not interested'.  LOL"
Which one of you lucky fucks is going to be my twitter valentine?
"I'm a bed hog and a cover hog, an eat you up and keep you all to myself hog."
My drug of choice? You.
You don't have to like me but you will love me.
You will be my Valentine whether you want to be or not.
You're such a vile piece of shit. Come and sit next to me.
You can call me a rainy day.
"The grass is greener under me, darling."
"Help me, please."
No hope for me.
Sad and broken.
I cry inside everyday. Sometimes those tears overflow.
"One man's behaviour destroyed me at a very young age. Since then, one sweet man after another has tried to pick up those shattered pieces and fix me. None were successful as I died a long, long time ago."
Close your eyes. Fly away.
"Fall for those romantic notions, bleed for the rest of your life."
What you see is not what I am.
You must have me mixed up with one of your twitter groupies. Don't let it happen again.
They think they know. They don't know shit.
I want to kill him. It must be love.
"'She had blue skin, And so did he. He kept it hid And so did she. They searched for blue Their whole life through, Then passed right by- And never knew.'"
Don't make me go savage on you. You will not survive it.
How a man acts when angry reveals his true character
You think you know anger?  You think you know rage? I will fix it so that all you ever become is that strange smell coming up from my basement.
I'm tired of presumptions. I'm tired of assumptions.
You do not know me. Nobody knows me. I don't even know me.
Head in the clouds. Forever.
"You're giving attention to someone else. I'm getting attention from someone else. All good, boo."
"'You' need. 'You' want.   What about what I need and want? Never thought about that, did you?"
Stop.
"‚ÄúWith me, illusions are bound to be shattered. I am here to shatter all illusions. Yes, it will irritate you, it will annoy you - that's my way of functioning and working. I will sabotage you from your very roots."""
I'm a lock looking for it's key.
Dark haunted eyes. Beautiful.
"I've learned how to turn it off. No harm, no foul. Move on."
I've never understood the concept of wanting someone who doesn't want you back.
"If someone else is getting your attention, you will no longer be receiving mine."
"Jealousy is not a state I wish to be in so usually, I am successful in talking myself out of it."
I'm using you to get to him. Sorry.
"You are undermining any potential respect I could have for you by your behaviour here and the sad thing is, you don't even realize it or care to."
I'm as deep as the ocean.
"They didn't call me Inglis¬Æ for nothing, motherfucker. Refrigerate that."
"Keep it classy, motherfucker."
"Politics aside, I liked Reagan. I do not like Trump. The difference? In a word: humility."
Ice cold hearts with flaming fire inside.
My name is Femme and it's been six minutes since my last tweet.
The reason my relationships never last is because of me not them. I'm the fuck up. I know this. I swear I do it on purpose sometimes.
"Well, aren't you just all man now. Yum."
Everything looks so beautiful from a bird's-eye view.
Big man on the internet = pencil dick irl.
"You may think whatever you wish to think. That's your perception. However, it's relation to truth may have no bearing."
"The very thing that attracted him in the beginning is what repulses him now. Typical human behaviour. If they can't change you, they don't want you. Walk on, motherfucker. I have no time for your weakness."
In you I trust. All others are suspect.
... and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday and Sunday.
I feel you.
I know you're watching.
That shade of melancholy looks good on you.
"Kiss kiss bang bang, lover."
Quit taking this so seriously. Make me laugh and I'll return the favour.
I belong to the darkness.
There should be an option to delete @'s directed at you that you dislike. That would get the message across fast enough.
Be careful. Your words are giving you away.
I love the way the 20 somethings all grab the seats where zero eye contact can occur with the boss during the monthly meetings. I sit front and centre and stare the fucker down for the little maggot he is. Good times.
"You're no good, heartbreaker."
"When he's not here, I feel so alone. When he's here, even if he isn't interacting with me specifically, I am comforted somehow. It makes no sense. I've never even met the man."
Bad things linger in the dark. I am one of those bad things.
Nothing sexier than watching a man shave his face.
You people are too sweet. We need more salt. That's where I come in.
Barbecue some meat for me baby and I'll watch those arm muscles flex as you work that grill.
"Of all the qualities that draw me to a man, truthfulness is equaled only by kindness, courage and a sense of humour."
I'm bored. Play with me.
Broken glass everywhere.
You did this to yourself.
"How many women's attention do you need to make you feel like a real man, huh?"
Ward A.
"If standing up for myself makes me a bitch then you can just bow before me, the queen of all bitches."
"Never happy with what they have. Forever searching, forever flirting and I'm just not having it."
"Called you out on your shit and now 'you're' mad at 'me'? No sir, we're not playing that game."
I want to live the life of a caterpillar. Human first then morph into a bird.
Love is this. Love is that. Love is blah blah blah. Stfu.
You have absolutely got to be fucking kidding me.
Stupid little boy.
Hoegaarden. That's the beer for you. A garden of hoes.
It's really very simple. Don't treat me like an afterthought and I will let you go with your balls intact.
Shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it off.
The heat from the lava that pours out of Kƒ´lauea volcano from the cliffs of the island of Hawaii has got nothing on the fire of my rage.
Fuck off.
"Love is only temporary, darling, but murder is forever."
I'm a little deranged today.
*stains your soul*
I will wipe my dirty hands on the cleanest parts of you.
I didn't mean to rip your heart out.
I'm just here for the attention.
I know I'm horrid. Do you understand? I already know.
Don't feel ashamed if you're living your truth.
Tainted hate.
"Sometimes, don't."
"If you haven't already run away from me, don't worry, you will."
Die a little longer.
"I'm a lady, motherfucker."
Do real men even exist anymore?
I'm done being the strong one for a while. Man up or gtfo.
You act like a motherfucking woman and I'm tired of playing daddy.
Sorry I can't hang here and indulge in all of your twitter fantasies but I've got another 9 hour shift today. #therealworld
"No one owns me, fucker."
Teehee.
"I like the chase, not the capture."
"Let me guess, you like your meat well-done, right?"
You shook when you should have stirred.
The quiet ones are the most interesting. I'm loud as fuck. Move on.
"Give me love, not excuses."
I'm going to scribble all over that blank page of yours.
I forgive you for being an asshole.
"Hey you, big, tough guy on the internet. I bet your mom still does your laundry, you fucking pussy."
*sighs*
Nothing to find.
It's all empty in here.
"Commando this, motherfucker."
Sing me your song.
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la a la la.
"Fall on your knees for me, darling."
High blood pressure and no heart to speak of. I'm already dead.
"Open up those eagle eyes, mister."
Hide with me forever.
"*sprouts feathers*  Look, I'm a fucking bird now."
"Shhhhh, stop talking."
"I don't keep tabs as closely as I used to because he's too busy with the din of his harem but I'm still aware. I just like it a little less noisy, ya know?"
"If I have to listen to one more twenty something complaining about how tough life is whilst still living in their parents house, I'm gonna shank a motherfucker."
That king crab looks delicious but the rooster needs to shut the fuck up.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
"‚ô¨ I can't get enough of you baby. ‚ô¨  Can you get enough of me?"" ‚ô¨   Yes. Yes, I can. Now fuck off."
*licks you* You're mine now.
I'm furious with your mother for making such a shit kid.
"Wild thing, I think I love you."
"Working on a Sunday is an oxymoron and yet, here I fucking am again."
"If no effort is made, no effort will be given."
I bet I know what you look like irl.
"If nothing else, you have my attention."
I'm looking around and I am not impressed.
"Lovely words, poet, but romanticizing this place will be the death of your delicate soul."
"Seriously, dude. Acquire some taste and call it a fucking day already."
"Yours will be a crime of passion. I can hardly wait, my darling."
All my words stay. What you choose to do with them is up to you.
"Just for the record, if I was in a relationship currently, I wouldn't be on the Twitter."
Eye colour: Lioness
"Do onto others, motherfucker."
"I have crushes too. I don't unfollow the ladies who interact with these men because I'm a fucking grown up. Unless they've unfollowed me, then naturally, I return the favour."
Women unfollowing me because I interact with the man they have a crush on. Grow the fuck up.
"Go where everyone knows your name. In my case, the local liquor store."
Don't care. Doesn't matter.
Are the seven dwarves Swiss?.. because they are yodelling.
"He's juggling about six of you and you don't even know it,  but I see.  Hours and hours of entertainment for me."
"Everything happens for a reason and if things don't happen, there is a reason for that too."
Extend one more olive branch out to that bitch and I'm going to burn that whole motherfucking tree down.
-24 got nothing on me. I'm already a cold-hearted bitch.
Break me open and scream into the void.
"Why does it take some drivers 10 full fucking seconds to react to a green light? You are operating a two tonne vehicle, motherfucking pay attention."
It would never work out. I have far too much rage in me and you're an idiot.
You are judged by who you retweet.
Those people who profess sadness for the attention when no such sadness is actually present really chap the ass of those of us who struggle with it each and every motherfucking day.
You're in a melancholy phase? I'm in a melancholy life. Get on my level.
You're the man. I'm the lady. Play your part.
"Baby, you got me."
"She, mister, is no competition for me. Nice try though."
Look what you've done.
Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know.
"If you have a problem with me, I automatically have a problem with you."
Oprah? Fuck Oprah.
So sad when you see someone's potential but know they're not living up to it but instead settling.
"Stop the ride, I want off."
You don't get it and I'm far too tired to explain it to you.
His mother was a whore. His father was non-existent. He never stood a chance.
Let them believe me. Let them wonder if I lie.
Trump annoys me. His whole fucking family annoys me.
It's so cute when they think they've found someone better than me. So adorably cute when they come crawling back when they realize such is not the case. And even cuter still when I tell them to fuck off and stay the fuck away from me with their shitty-ass life decisions.
"I'm not petty, I'm pretty. Get it right."
When I stop checking your feed is when I know I've truly lost interest. Oh well. Have a nice life.
"I'll show you indifferent, motherfucker."
He likes you but he's keeping his options open = he doesn't like you enough.
Dreaming of you.
I like the ones who 'get' my humour the very best. ;) üíï
"What does whore#1 think about whore#2?.. and who's the real whore here, mister? Isn't it you?"
I am no longer present and accounted for.
"Careful, ladies. As soon as he has your undivided attention, he no longer wants it. That's his game."
üíï
Hear me when I tell you Daddy loves the colour pink.
"Act like a whore, I'm going to fucking treat you like one."
I have no use for a man who only sees a woman for her physicality.
You don't have big tits. You bought big tits. Good for you. Whore.
"The only body parts I'm interested in are yours, cut up and buried in my backyard."
"Landslide will bring you down, motherfucker."
"Each one he picks, uglier than the one before. Fucking insulting."
Feel the fire in me. I will burn you to the motherfucking ground.
Jesus H. Christ. Give me a fucking break. Her arms are hairier than my father's.
"He prefers the fake 'little girl, damsel in distress, I need a big strong man' type. I'm more the 'I'll slit her throat and yours too if I have to continue to watch the interaction between you two weak fucks' type. Motherfucking try me."
I'm not his type. I'm a woman.
"Do you ever just want to take someone by the shoulders and shake them until they see a situation for what it is?  shake shake shake  Not a good person.  shake shake shake  Bad person, bad person.   shake shake shake   Wake up.  SHAKE"
"Tried waking up today with a new attitude but nope, still a bitch."
(Ding ding ding.)  I think we have ourselves a winner here.
'Hates people' We're going to get along just fine.  'Hates animals' What kind of monster are you?
New Year's Resolution: To be more patient and tolerant of people.  Lasted like a minute.
"It's ok, my brain scares me too sometimes."
Don't send me smoochie faces. They lose all meaning when you send them to every cuntsack in the free world.
"There really is no accounting for taste. He likes his women cheap and stupid. Maybe his mother was a dumb whore, we don't know."
Never mind. You've just clarified. I knew you were a clever one. ;)
"I don't care who likes and retweets that little whore, harlot Scarlett because I don't give a fuck about any of those people, but when I see her on your feed, I must say, disappointment isn't the word."
Vertigo again last night. Scary shit.
"Can you even answer any of these questions? Well, no you can't. An exchange of words and pictures while lovely, does not a love story make and I'll just bet that if you passed that same person on your street in real life, in real time, you wouldn't even give them a second glance."
Their sincerity?  Do they look you in the eye when communicating with you?
Their attitude? Can you feel their character radiating from their being?
Their strength?  Can you see the way they move with passion and confidence?
Their actions?  Are they silly or serious?
The way they carry themselves?  Is it with authority or humility?
Their laughter?  Is it gentle or booming?
Is it the way they speak? Is it quiet or loud?
"So, you have found love on the internet, yes? Tell me, what exactly is it that you love about them?"
The best compliment I can give is thinking that you are an original.
She likes to tell the little twitter boys what to do. I prefer they man up and make decisions for themselves.
I'm into wreaking havoc.
Dreamt I stole your TC right out from under you and you cried and cried and cried and cried.  Lololololololol!!!
Bitch needs to know I'm still around and not going anywhere anytime soon. Happy New Year! ;)
"Haha! The more truth I speak, the more followers I lose. Keep going, fuckers."
"Of course she wants you to cum inside her, big daddy. It's the only way she's going to get pregnant with your child and own your motherfucking ass (and wallet) for the next 18 years. Sexy, huh?"
Nothing will ever be enough for her.
"Yes, I have a healthy ego. You need one in order to survive all the motherfucking shitdicks around here."
I'm not bitter. I'm better. Get it right.
"I'm standing on your head, hoping it hurts."
Anything beneath me is above you. See?
Thanks for throwing a little attention my way. Would you like a cookie?
"Um, I'm not sure but I think it's supposed to be one soulmate per person. A twin flame, if you will. Not the six deep, raging inferno you've got going on over there, daddio."
"The person who asks nothing of you wants nothing from you, ya dig?"
It's never enough for me because I'm way too fucking greedy.
A small handful of the pathetic and naive. Falling all over themselves to like and retweet every utterance. Believing those words to be written solely with them in mind. Laughable.
"I see you, little man hiding behind the internet."
You think you're strong? She thinks you're strong? You are not strong.
"Go peddle your wares to the young, plain girls with the daddy issues. Whisper sweet nothings into their ears as they are the only ones who will believe all the nonsensical sputter coming out of your mouth."
I have a great father which is why I can spot a piece of shit man miles away.
Honourable men never speak of being honourable men. Ever.
Honour? What the fuck do you know about honour?
The only thing deep about you is the grave I'm going to bury you in.
Hitchcock marathon tonight. All night.   Good Evening.
"The monster is always there,  waiting, attempting to beat it's way to the surface from the inside. I just might let it win this time."
"Bye bye, baby."
You will never win with me as I'm not coming from a place of rational thought. I make shit up as I go along and it entertains the fuck out of me.
"He was 'speaking' with someone else but made the mistake of letting me sneak in and we all know, once I'm in, I'm in."
It starts with the physical. Continues with the mental. Lasts with the emotional. Ends with the pyscho.
Qu'est-ce que fuck?
"I'm sure that if someone examined my innermost thoughts, I would not appear to be normal. I've certainly not lived a normal life."
Nobody really accepts me for who I am. How could they? I'm a monster.
"Has the internet created monsters? No, but it has facilitated these monsters in how they operate and the ease in which they can find their victims.   Beware the internet stranger."
"Don't threaten me with your absence. If you go, then go. Just make sure you stay gone."
Exactly this. #mefuckingtoo
I could kill. I will kill.
"I think that people who openly admit intolerance are far braver and far less dangerous than people like myself, who hide it and let it fester."
My heart is an asshole.
Tattoo my name across your fucking heart so I know it's real.
"You hateful, intolerant bastard. Seat next to me is free."
"MAKE CANADA GREAT AGAIN. Oh wait, we're already fucking awesome."
At the movies tonight. LadyBird. Caught my reflection at the concession stand mirror and I'm pretty motherfucking cute.
"Do not trust me. I repeat, do not fucking trust me."
I let it slide. I let them believe it is safe to speak to me that way.   Wait.
Don't look back.  Don't ever look back.
You break my fucking heart.
They and we.  I'm more I and me.
I like people who make me think.
"""You are the most cynical person I have ever met.""  Thank you."
Running around buying gifts for people I don't like with money I don't have.   Merry fucking Christmas.
"I have hate, but it's like cute little girl, ""I'm going to murder you in your sleep"" kind of hate. You have hate but it's like, ""I think I'm better than others because of the colour of my skin"" kind of you're an asshole kind of hate."
Boil an innocent bunny? Fuck that for noise. I'd castrate you and boil your motherfucking balls instead.
"If you're in your twenties, you're a fucking fetus."
There is a mental disorder called delusional parasitosis. Apparently the sufferer can eventually convince others that they are suffering from it too.   This whole 'we met for a reason' nonsense?  Same.
People's continual failure to live up to my unrealistic expectations is where I find my peace.
All words and no feelings for me lately.
My preference.
"Actually, not really my mood currently but this cat was so fucking adorable, I was compelled to retweet his likeness."
Mood.
"Show me something you've had published and then I'll call you a writer, friend."
"Gods and Goddesses don't have day jobs. That's why you find so many of them here, on the Twitter. Self-proclaimed albeit, but whatevs."
Warning: I'm poison and hazardous for your health.
My brain is fucked up but wonderful.
I think I should be locked up.
Everyone says that they'd kill for their own. I'd actually do it.
Mmmmmmm...
I need some sugar cured bacon. Like now.
"Do you retweet every stupid thing she says because you have no taste, sir?"
"Did you pick such a plain one, sir because you didn't want the competition of any other man ever wanting her?"
"Does she make you feel like a man, sir?.. because you're so big and strong and she is so young and meek?"
"Mid-life crisis much, sir?"
"Nah, I'm way cuter."
I won't.
Do yourself a favour and don't ever tell me to calm down.
My reaction to when yet another person professes to have found their soul-mate here on the Twitter without having actually met face-to-face.  Stop it.
"Hmm, not sure but I think I liked it better when you shut the fuck upped."
He's just using me for my adorableness.
A stranger is watching me.
"*waits, patiently*"
"People suck.  Suck back, harder."
"I once retweeted someone quite a bit because I loved her tweets. Meanwhile, she dmed a male friend of mine, asking why I was ""all over her shit"". Um, because that's how twitter works, you dumbfuck, you like it, you retweet it. I've since blocked the cunt. You're welcome, Scarlett"
I hope something heavy falls on you and you are no longer able to tweet or breathe.
I'm trying to move forward here. Don't drag me back.
"I'm not lonely, I'm lovely. Get it right."
"I just looked at your timeline. In a word, ew."
"Grow a pair  of ovaries, madam."
Breathe in. Breathe out.
"It's a crazy world out there. Ever since Elvis and Priscilla split up, things haven't been the same."
"'Trouble Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble been doggin' my soul since the day I was born Worry Worry, worry, worry, worry Worry just will not seem to leave my mind alone'"
"'Only my books anoint me, and a few friends, those who reach into my veins.'"
Bullying can kill.  ie: Bully my kid and I will kill you.
"You see, I will move on without you. It's called survival. But she might not and only then will you realize, you can't save her. You can only save yourself."
Believe every word I say but don't.
I think you're going to die soon. I think I'm ok with that.
"Well, I certainly didn't make myself this way."
I've learned it's whatever.
"If you could see the expression on my face as I scroll down your feed, you would no longer interact with me. But hey, fake it 'til you make it, right?"
"Karma, I fucking love you."
You're muted. She's blocked. I refuse to listen to anymore of your drivel.
Kissing in the rain?
I'm horrible. I admit it.
You could fuck off or you could fuck off. The choice is yours.
"Please stop with all of your tales of twitter love and you, the other, stop perpetuating that crap by retweeting the shit. You met a stranger on the internet. Boom boom, good for you. Get a room or gtfo."
You're one of my kind.
I was born to catch a killer.
You can clean up your crime scene to the best of your ability but luminol will out you each and every time.
"I just realized something about myself. I'm not a bitch unless provoked and if provoked, I am the bitchiest bitch of all the bitches. I'll slice your throat and kill your young and think nothing fucking of it. Zero control. So stay the fuck away from me."
Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. Pick one.
My heart breaks for him.
"Those of you who believe that genocide is the way to go, let's start with you and your entire living lineage."
"Some people just don't appreciate my random acts of kindness. I mean, I would want someone to tell ME if MY make-up looked whorey."
I believe in communication not condemnation.
I think I'm dangerous now.
What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done?
I told you. I'm not real. I'm a fucking cartoon now.
Colour me insane.
"You're starting to remind me of the workmen who are all, ""Baby, yo baby!"" and when given no response, ""Bitch, yo bitch!"""
I will not put up with bullying of any kind. Especially the passive-aggressive twitter variety.
"I retweet based on material I like, not what someone feels I owe them in the name of friendship."
"Consider your situation and then reconsider your expectations of me, friend."
Thought he could handle me.  Thought he wanted to. Wrong on both counts.
"You can have your perfect life. My life is messy. My relationships are complex. My outcomes are uncertain and I wouldn't have it any other way. Perfection to me, is boredom. I am perfectly imperfect."
I'm waiting on a rainy day.
"'wild moon woman you were not made to be tame. you are an earthquake  shaking loose everything that is not soul.'  shake, woman, shake."
She will mesh and meld with whatever it is you say. I will fight you every step of the way. The choice is simple. Pick her.
Never lose who you are   for anyone.
'Hast du etwas Zeit f√ºr mich? Dann singe ich ein Lied f√ºr dich.'
Go play in your puddles. I'll be swimming in the ocean
"You do what you gotta do, boy."
Harder times. Simpler times.
"&lt;-------- Publicly outgoing, fiercely private person."
There are times I forget how to breathe.
Kiss me where it hurts.
You talk like you have all the time in the world. You don't you know.
"Fall in love with me, so one day we too can sit at the dining table staring at our phones and ignoring each other."
*shadow-boxes with a psychopath*  *rummages around the brain of a killer*  *jabs at it from different directions*  Self reflection.
"Hide within the delicate folds of a single rose, then scream bloody murder when the secret of your location is compromised."
Sickeningly sweet makes me want to vomit.
"I don't think I'm a nice person. Like, I say nice things but I don't think them."
Selfishness is exceedingly rude and unattractive.
I'm going out to buy vodka because you're an asshole.
My words are sharper than your knives.
"Just shhhh, stop talking."
Cartoon face for a fucked up place.
Signs you're in a great relationship...  You're single.
Life is a hallucination.
I know relationships need work but I'm looking for one that doesn't feel like a constant fucking chore.
"I've lost over 100 followers in the last day and a half. Clearly, I'm doing something right."
*fucking up relationships with people one person at a time*
Give it. Take it away. Fuck off. Die. Whatever.

You intrigue him. He tries to tame you. You acquiesce. He's no longer interested.  Moral of the story:  Be yourself always and let no one ever fuck with the fundamental core and essence that is you.
*bewitches you*
Do I look insane?
*shows you my crazy*
I'm already at death's door. I just haven't knocked yet.
"All true probably but fuck, that man could write."
Rage with me. Rage with me. More. More. More.
"I like people.  I don't like people.  I'm an extrovert.  I'm an introvert.  I'm loud.  I'm introspective.  I'm friendly.  I'm distant.  I'm an optimist.  I'm a pessimist.  I'm empathetic.  I don't give a shit.   These are all true statements.  Shrink that, motherfucker."
"'I'm a mirror. If you're cool with me, I'm cool with you, and the exchange starts. What you see is what you reflect. If you don't like what you see, then you've done something. If I'm standoffish, that's because you are.' jz"
"I support what is fair and right and just. You have made a mistake here. I'm no fucking minion and I don't erroneously pick fights with people that have higher follower counts than me in the hopes that some of that attention will float my way. Sound familiar, @poetic_gun?"
The only place that perfect person you are looking for exists is in your head.
Drugged.
"Everything hurts and I'm dying but hey, you have yourself a great night."
How beautiful. Let's destroy it.
*shits on Hollywood and all that it stands for right now*
You're playing with fire here and you don't even fucking know it.
"No, no, no!  That one is mine. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!   All mine!  *stomps feet* *sulks* *full on temper tantrum ensues*  ps: I blame the sickness for this tweet."
"My natural inclination leans towards wanting to be the protector of the ones I love. So, I'll be the spooner and you can be the spoonee."
Dying a little bit more each and every day.

November is my stained month. Every year. Every fucking year.
"I don't give a flying fuck about your 'baby on board' sign. If anything, it's a motherfucking target. I'm heading into work in sub zero temperatures and racing high fever because I can't afford not to, so you and your baby can kindly get the fuck out of my way."
"This particular strain of flu virus is one sadistic motherfucking bitch. If I don't make it back, I have succumbed to her diabolical charms."
Idealism was wrenched out of me at a very young age by way of a broken heart.
"I've always been a strong believer of, 'if it's meant to be, it will be.'"
I'm just a lonely girl with a phone reaching out to strangers. Don't romanticize it.
"People become more or less attractive to me based on their character. Initially, attractiveness is based on what my eyes are seeing. Eventually, that person's character becomes the true indicator of how attractive I will find them."

"Usually, I ignore cunty replies to my tweets, but I'm sick with flu so fucking come at me."
"Yes, you are."
You are all the same. One after the fucking other. All the same.
Go. Live your life. Spread joy.
"You and your TC are going to meet in RL, get married and have babies? Cool. One question, why the fuck you still hitting up my DMs, bruh?"
"You'll have to kill me to cure me, darling."
"Water, my consummate healer. The ocean to revive, the rain to reflect, hot showers to relax, cold drinks to replenish and tears to release."
You lost all of your charm when you turned into one of them.
"I dance alone but in my mind, he's right there beside me."
"If you want that simple life, by all means go for that sure thing because that certainly wouldn't be me by any stretch of the imagination."
I do. I do. I do.
Wake up lonely.
I dream away.
My cw got me hooked on Stranger Things and now I'm obsessed. #ElevenandEggos
"DM room? No, thank you. I prefer one on one communication."
Appreciate each person for who they are and quit trying to fucking change them.
And then I woke up..
*hugs phone*
Shady ass motherfucking piece of shit.
Does your t.c. know about your s.o.?
Grow the fuck up.
"Sitting here in my oversized, plaid flannel shirt and knee high socks, chewing on some chicken wings and reading your tweets."
I've somehow stumbled into porn twitter again but he made me chuckle so he deserved a follow.
You're looking so lovely in that shade of stupid.
"If you can't handle my truth, fuck off."
This 'seeking of the fairytale' is going to get you into trouble because it doesn't exist. Do you hear me? It does not exist.
"I'm not a writer, I'm a venter."
I'm savage. Deal.
"For a minute there, I thought they were referring to Trump."
Mind in the past. Heart in the past. Soul nowhere to be found.
"If you can walk away and forget all about me, then do it. Speaks volumes, doesn't it?"
"To all the fuckers from my past, thanks for making me stronger."
I don't know where the fuck to find you.
"Pull the trigger, baby."
I love all animals. I love them more than people. That's it. That's the tweet.
Those who care will show you. Those who don't won't.
I am free.
Let her munch on your feeble offerings. I need a much more robust feed.
You put up with all of his shit? That's lovely. Exactly what brand of doormat are you?
"Everything in life is temporary and if you don't believe that, you haven't been paying attention."
Du wirst mich nicht vergessen.
Come to me.
You think you know someone. You don't.
"Trying to make someone feel bad on purpose? Not fucking cool and notice I said 'trying'. That shit doesn't work on me, fucker."
Asylum.
I loved a boy once and he disappointed me.                      The End.
"Hum with me, little bird."
"This isn‚Äôt Happiness: The heartbreak, depression and empty sex of Modern Love."
You and I will get along if you just die.
You're a fucking train wreck. Come here.
You don't think I know you're watching? I know you're watching.
You're out of control? You don't know out of control. I'll show you out of control.
Get on my fucking level or fuck off.
"That's right, fucker. You leave. I'm staying. Weak fuck."
"What if all the men breaking all the ladies' hearts on here was just one fucking guy? One piece of shit, poor excuse for a human being guy?"

You're dead. You're dead. You're dead                         to me.
They're worried about me and they have every reason to be.
"When you feel like the vultures are always hovering, waiting, greedy to gobble up the next words you write. Starve them with your silence."
That moment just before sleep takes me. That is where you live.
'The truth doesn't give a fuck what your opinion is.'
Decimate me.
I wonder what you taste like.
"If I kill you, do I still have to think about you?"
I am fascinated with the thought of murder. Yours.
You're only as fast as the slowest motherfucking car in front of you.
"Get over me? No, that doesn't happen."
"Oh look, he's coveting another and another and yet another and I don't care because repetition bores the fuck out of me."
"He has decided that she is good enough to respond to and for whatever reason, I am not. Ok then."
"I'm fine, on the outside."
In losing someone you find yourself.
"I'm a crime snob, I guess. I prefer true crime shows that #BillKurtis narrates."
"Blame it on the rain, bitch."
"Eventually, they all show their true colours."
You've got to dig deep to find those gems.
"Your perception of me is all that you see. Nothing more, nothing less."
"'I don't believe in man, god nor devil. I hate the whole damn human race, including myself.'"
When the minutes drag..
"Yes, he's a pig but what did you do about it?"
Casting couches have been around for eons. Women use them to get ahead. Men use them to keep their dicks wet.
"Not excusing his behaviour but to all those who settled out of court with Weinstein, receiving lots of $$$$$, you are a part of the problem."
Beautiful butterflies chase me everywhere.
"If you don't start something, it never has to end."
I don't do duck face. Duck face does me.
I'm about to wander right off a cliff.
I don't know. Just some crazy bitch named Michele.
"Words to live by, and I do. üíï  Madea's tree friendship ""Words of Wisdom"" (OG) Seasons or Lifetime"

Tired tired tired.
Can't get me out of your head? There's a machete for that.
"He doesn't know it quite yet, but he belongs to me."
You'll see.
Never judge a book by it's cover. Judge it by it's spine or the lack thereof.
"Pure as the driven snow, yet what lies beneath are the dirt filled trenches with the frozen piss and defecation of a thousand animals."
Main bitch out of your league. Side bitch out of your league too.  A twitter love story.
Very good.  Very true.  I refuse.  I rage.
and I fall like the rain down down down
"Maybe, now that you're gone, I have nothing left to say."
"Listen, if the bank is empty, who gives a fuck about love?"
"Wow, you're so fucking full of hate.  Glad I'm not the only one."
What can one say when one has nothing to say?
"I've always been alone. My entire life. Even when I was with someone, still alone."
"Bitch at the liquor store says,  ""Enjoy your weekend."" Like I'm not going to be there another three times before the weekend is out."
Asylum.
Asylum.
Asylum.
To not have to think. To not have to feel. That.
You did more damage than good.
Kind of waiting for death. Kind of don't give a fuck.
I am one tired human being. Nothing keeps me awake anymore.
You don't get it. You don't get me. It's cool. Very few do.
The words are all wrong.
Fuck!
Take me with you.
Good. Fuck 'em.

"I'm in your head now. I'm a part of you. The harder you try and forget about me, the more deeply ingrained I become within your psyche."
"Oh my God, he's such a piece of shit I can't even."
"I prefer tweeting without having a sense of obligation towards any one person or group of people. iow, my thoughts, my feelings, my opinions"
Do not bother living up to someone else's expectations because they sure as hell are not living up to yours.
"You are full of deceit. Go charm your next victim, player."
Wow. My coldhearted capacity to cut people out that I perceive to have wronged me in some fashion never ceases to amaze me. Am I even human?
"In Canada, Satan is very polite."
I'm an angry little spitfire.
GET IT? YOU AND YOUR ATTITUDE ARE THE MOTHERFUCKING PROBLEM.

You listen to me and you listen very carefully.. I give respect when I get respect and not one fucking moment before.
Add two more of those sixes and you've got his number alright.
"I need to add 'bullshitter extraordinaire' on to my resume since that's all we really do at work, isn't it? Blow smoke up people's asses."
"You're dead to me, darling."
"Attractive, handsome, charming.. classic sociopath."
The only thing I would ever demand of someone would be peace. This is a drama free zone.
I'm just like a cat. Motherfucking rebel and always landing on my feet  and..  I will scratch you.
I've just been called devious and I think I like it.
Glad I'm behind these eyes of mine because I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of them.
"We trudge on, don't we? Through all the disappointment, heartbreak and loss, we trudge on."
*listened.  Again.
When they disappear and you come to the realization that you meant absolutely nothing to them. Zero.   That.
You could have said good-bye.
One perfect tear for the wonderful that was you.
and just like that.. poof.
Just killed a huge spider in the shower with my bare hands. I'm not fucking around anymore.
Crush so hard it breaks you into a million pieces.
In vino veritas.
It is night. I am here.
Where in fuck did I leave my purse?
You're resisting me. I can feel it. Just let it happen. ;)

When you know you're no good.
I simply do not deserve all of this attention.
Quit following your dick around and trying using the other head the good lord gave you.
Neutralize. Stabilize. Lobotomize.
I become the storm.

I don't think I'm headed in the right direction.
"If I smile at you and you don't smile back, then you're just a jackass because I'm lovely."
"Whatever you say, player. Whatever you say."
Interesting. He seeks out their attention by giving them all of his. Changing up his tweeting style to mimic theirs. Ain't nothing but a

"Free to roam, the disturbed mind discovers a comfortable home. The subculture of the misfits."
"Some people are highly susceptible to being influenced by others because they lack a basic, solid core of their own personality."
The words aren't registering tonight. I'd better sleep instead.
Do you think about me while you're sweet talking her?
"It doesn't matter who the words are for. If I like them, they belong to me."
"So sweet. They're in 'twitter love'. If you don't want attention from anyone else, then get the fuck off of twitter. This is a public forum."
What you allow is what will continue. Empower yourself.

The allure of skin.
I used to dream.
"I will kill you by accident, on purpose."
Try that shit with me and I will defenestrate you.
"His 'She's easy on the eyes.' is my 'No, she isn't.'"
My fault. I expressed an interest in your life. My apologies.

Are you guys fucked in the head? Paul clearly played the better game and Cody is a pansy-assed piece of shit.  #motherfuckingrobbed
Three doesn't go into two. One had to be eliminated. That one was me. It's math.

"'Our lives may not have              fit together,         but ohhh, did our                  souls      know how to dance.'"
I'm so very tired of this.
No one measures up. No one ever will.
"Dammit, you boys really set me up to be one cold-hearted bitch."
"I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but I am not 'that' girl."
Never thought I'd actually be capable of murder and then I met you and all that changed.
"Goodnight, adorable."

"Guess what, player? We compared notes. Asshole."
I'm already nothing. Let me be enough.
What you think of me is not my concern because it's not based on reality but rather your perception of it.
Do I often mix alcohol with benzodiazepines? Yes. Do I care? Not especially.

Every single day a repeat of the one before it. It's enough to drive one mad.
It takes years of experience to attain this level of bitch. Please don't embarrass yourself.
Who are you calling 'you people'? You people are 'you people'.
Can you guess which one I am?
You're a star in the sky. I can't reach you either.
"If you recognize yourself in these words, then your metamorphosis into a brainwashed member of society is complete, ticky tack."

The darkness surrounds and permeates all in it's path.
The abyss is calling my name again.
"'Snap out of it, just be happy, don't let it get you down' are comments said by people who might mean well but haven't got a fucking clue."
Lot of people fake mental illness for the attention and sympathy of others. I am not one of those people.
Don't play with fire then complain when you get burned.
This actually has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the fucked up mess I call myself. You were simply collateral damage.
"You know how when animals are sick and about to die they stop eating? So, ya, I have zero appetite."
"For me, the storm is the beauty."
"Legend says that each time you rev your motorcycle engine, your cock size reduces by an inch."
How about being yourself? How about trying that?

Fake rage. Lol.
"And all of a sudden, she has rage too. *chuckles* That's not quite how it works, sweetheart."
Leave you like they left me.
Leave me alone.
I don't need you insulting me. I already know what I am.
All day.
"Now, quit alluding to me on your feed to get sympathy votes and raise your follower count. You asked me to leave and I obliged. End of."

There's a hole in the sky where the sun doesn't shine and that's the hole where I reside.
"My temper, it's a thing."
That's it. I'm done. Goodnight.
Zero loyalty turns me off.
"I'm all over the place. Happy,  sad,  laughing,  crying.  Run away from this catastrophe."
Show me your 'clever'.
I can't deal with all of this foreboding sadness. I need something real and good and true.
"If you're sharing everything with everyone, then what exactly makes our relationship special? I'll tell you what, nothing."
I am not your mother. I am not your whore. I am your equal.

"The most important word in most people's lives is 'love'. For me, it's 'real'."

I just want to sit here and do nothing.
He likes me therefore his taste in women is questionable.

My father thinks Donald Trump is an asshole and I am a chip off the old block.

Men deciding on whether or not abortion should be legalized is a fucking joke. You do nothing in the making of a child other than orgasm.

I've been on this planet long enough to know that karma makes her rounds.

My broken heart can't break again.
Cross my heart. I hope you die.
Always the storm -never the chaser
That's you. That's me. You're dead. I'm free.
My baggage is not emotional. It doesn't give a shit either.
This heart has been battle-tested.
I'm only dangerous if you cross me.
Make a grown man blush? Not a problem.

It's all in my head.
"You can call me Gypsy, motherfucker."
"The distance saves you, fucker. If I saw you, I'd kill you and you know it would be justified, player."
"I am fully capable of committing murder.  Temper, temper."
Tales from the Morgue but with you in it.
*shoots horseradish up the nose*
He got the tiniest taste of who I was as a person and   ran away with his tail between his legs.    That's not a man.
[screams internally forever]
xx
Snakes and pussies the world aplenty.
The younger men are looking around for a place to put their  testosterone.
The black dog and I have been dancing together for years now.
Kindle and Kobo stand for crap. Do yourself a favour and read a real book. There is no substitute.
"I'm kidding actually. If they can't see the brilliance that is you, fuck 'em."
Substandard.
It's cute when you have a crush on someone and they shit all over you because they like someone else. Good times.
"You can choose to be whoever you wish here. Poet, comedian, writer. I opt for 'real'."
Music does it for me.
Pourquoi are all the youtube ads in fucking Fran√ßais? I speak English.
"I felt everything single word you said, you meant it.. and now, nothing."
Bastard. You.
"Darling, come here."
*sits on your face*
"Hey whore, you don't have to be whore anymore. Jesus is here."
"Just read 'Terror in Virginia' as 'Terror in Vagina' and thought to myself, interesting news day."
"Real women want a man, not a whipping boy. But hey, whatever works for you."
Twitter is clever (wo)man's territory.
"You, take your stupid, naive self back to Instagram where everyone posts all those bogus selfies."
"You, take your fake ass back to Facebook where everything is pretend perfect."
Jesus Christ is your Lord and Saviour? What the fuck has he done for you lately?
I feel like motherfucking Goldilocks. That one is too needy. That one is too cold. I'm looking for the one that's just right.
I dream.
I'm messed up. That's the real me.
You should have listened.
"If you can't offer me a real emotion, then you're going to have to just go away."
I had a 20 something tell me I should change my attitude.   lololololololololololololololol  His funeral is Monday
Watch out for those silver-tongued devils.
You and I would be the perfect disaster.
The words are there but nothing is said.
"Left, right. Do something."
"If honesty bothers you, then move the fuck along."
Close your eyes. Dream.
Did you know that little birdies lived in orchids?
You're delusional. I like that.
"I see you, Twitter bullies. Ganging up on one person with your pansy-assed clique. Tell me, could you stand up on your own two feet?"
Disturbing dreams and other bedtime stories.
I can turn it on or off. It's called survival.
"That, I am."
He's very clever. I like clever.
"Sure, she's lovely but she's not me now, is she?"
It's smelling like campfire outside and I'm hearing sirens. Good.
'Vision  Lost  Out of control  Lost'
It doesn't matter what anyone 'says'. Do you 'feel' it?
I'm not making any promises.
The connection is either there or it's not.
Forever afters and other nightmares.
It's my nightmare.
"You're blind, you're blind, you're blind."
I couldn't wait for change.
I tried to understand.
'all the worlds insanity is hidden behind her  wildcat eyes.'
"Ya, no thanks, she can have you."
Describe yourself in one word:  doesntputupwithshit
Revolving doors with no exit signs.
Another mind's crime.
"You feel what you feel, mate. What can I do?"
"To all of you squawking about the summer weather, stfu. I love the rain and hate the heat so it's perfect just the way it is."
You make me sound like such a bitch and you'd be right.
I wish to be as free as the birds.
"You don't like my tweets, then fuck off with you."
"One by one, Twitter 'couples' are all, ""We're in love."", and one by one, I sit here, eating my popcorn, watching the next trainwreck unfold."
Words alone do not a relationship make.
People disappoint. Vodka is eternal.
"I just want to find someone to go off the grid with, swim in the ocean with and laugh at the world with."
"That whole 'saving someone from themselves', might actually apply in my case."
"I can lie to myself and I do, often."
I didn't throw anything away. It was never mine to begin with.
"Sometimes, I feel like I'm the only one putting in any effort with people. It's lonely and it's sad and I'm not doing it anymore."
I've revisited the pertinent correspondence and have again come to the conclusion that you are a jackass of monumental proportions.
Most people are afraid of the dark and that is why I don't get along with most people.
I've got multiple personalities and yet all of them like you.
The storm has arrived.
Torrential skies in your eyes.
Why are you so far away?
"I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine."
I dig it. It stays.
"Those light diminishers. The ones who try and snuff out the light emanating from within you. Shine brighter in spite of them, the fuckers."
Forgive me for being real.
Hurt me better.
Peaks and valleys. Ebb and flow. Ups and downs. Come and go.
You know I won't let you slip through my hands.
You know who I am.
"Seriously dude, I'm about to call National Geographic and tell them that the Dodo bird is not extinct but alive and well on the Twitter."
&lt;-------- That one is pure trouble.
"I can count on one hand how many times I've received an unsolicited dm here. They read my tweets, they don't fucking dare."
Story of my life.
"Hello, it's me."
Passive-aggression and other parlour games.
The insistent and perpetual dance of trying to latch on to another human being and claim ownership over them is a sad and tired one.
"Alone by choice, motherfucker. I don't need your love."
"If attention here is what you seek, then find yourself some plain, pansy assed little twit who dotes on your every word. That's just not me."
Self-portrait.
Death of self.
"If you say theatre 'theeee-ate-er', then I believe you're from the south."
"I am the storm clouds with the sunshine peeking through, motherfucker."
Both.
"Surround yourself with good people in real life and try not to pin all of your hopes and dreams on the people of Twitter. K, good chat."
"I love it when people answer a question with a question. It really turns my crank. Yes, this is sarcasm."
"Pass. No seriously, I pass. Move along to the next person."
Emotional blackmail and other card tricks.
Who in the fuck do you think you are? I am not some latchkey bitch you can push around. Adjust your behaviour. Now.
I don't care if it hurts.
&lt;------- Afraid of love and what it did to me.
One by one I let go of all those who bring no meaning to my life.
"See, even Shirley's fucking annoyed with you."
"It all ends with beginnings, darling."
From pain comes something beautiful.
"Working, tweeting. Resting, tweeting. Playing, tweeting.  It's a lifestyle."
"He preaches the dangers of ingesting sugar, but smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. Sure, dude, whatever you say."
"My eyes,                  are haunted."
"What the fuck are you going to do about it? Nothing, you'll do nothing."
"You want me to find God when religion is the number one reason for war, for terrorism, for hatred?"
"He loves me, he loves me not."
A shot in the dark that hits it's mark.
My favourite time is the middle of the night.
"I guess you can't help being a motherfucking pig, but could you at least snort in the other direction?"
My drug of choice is you.
He's in over his head and he knows it.
This girl has.
I always have dreams that I can't find my car. It drives me nuts.
"Dear Sara Newton,  You do yourself a great disservice by believing in fairytale frou frou and princes and such. Empower yourself.  VF"
"So, I 'respond quoted' to this tweet and received a block for my efforts.   Laugh. Out. Loud."
"Kiss me, heart, before you go."
Enough with the passive-aggressive motherfucking bullshit already.
What would you do if I was looking at you?
The night is my freedom.
"They come, they go. They come, they go. They come, they go. They come, they go. They come, they go.  I'm waiting for the one who stays."
"If any of those garbage tweets you're tweeting lately have me in mind, I have just two words for you, Fuck Off. You can take that literally."
"""You mean the cyber world to me.""   Twitter love."
Maybe we'll have a conversation again when you've changed out of your stupid pants.
"I never have a problem with unwanted attention because if it's unwanted, it doesn't get my attention."
"They come, they go, they never stay."
"That's my homeland, motherfucker. You're the empty waste."
"It is people like @lilmsnerdvana that make my time on this planet tolerable, even enjoyable. I thank you for the kind words, lovely girl. üíïüíï"
Now I finally see that you are not the man for me.
You're gonna be got and I'm gonna be doing the getting.
Tell me something I don't know.
"Don't burn flags, motherfucker. That's disrespectful. Burn yourself instead. That's productive."
"One who seeks out your attention by offering all of theirs, then disappear as soon as it's reciprocated is not a person I have time for."
"brown eyes, black heart, no soul"
I mark my territory by taking up residence inside their heads.
"If you have to explain a tweet, don't."
"I am the waves that crash into the shore, pulverizing anything in my way, grinding it into fragments of shell,  sand. you are that sand."
"Then again, some whores are into role play and what man wouldn't want to fuck some bitch half his age, daddy?"
"Calling your man 'daddy' is reflective of a stunted relationship, or lack thereof, between father and daughter during the formative years."
Doesn't matter. Don't care.
Run and fetch your balls out of her purse and be a fucking man for once in your life.
"If you have someone else's twitter handle in your bio, kill yourself because no one cares who you're fucking."
"I'm only just a little bit crazy but shhhh, we don't have to tell anyone."
"Whenever you hear the word violent, I want you to think of me."
People getting ahead of themselves by having a sense of entitlement or ownership over a fellow human being. Makes me chuckle every time.
"Don't throw ultimatums at me, motherfucker. That shit never works for any self-respecting individual. Nice try though."
"My dream, when I was younger, was to become an actress. Little did I know that my dream came true, as I play one every goddamn day in life."
"Maybe I won't wake up this time. Maybe, maybe."
"If they can't make a decision, you make it for them."
Move on. He's not noticing you but rather missing the attention he once received from you.
Don't be a bitch towards me or you will end up being just another unsolved murder in your city.
They'll deny. You will see it with your own eyes but they will still deny which is the most colossal insult to one's intelligence out there.
He couldn't because he wouldn't. So now I can't because I won't.
&lt;-------- A storm is here.
"Feed me, fucker."
"That's right, baby. Keep on coming back to me."
Thinks he knows me. He doesn't know motherfucking shit.
"It's not you, it's me. I held you accountable for your actions."
"Suicide is an act of desperation not selfishness. But, by all means, keep perpetuating that stigma, you know-nothing piece of shit."
"Open your mind.  Watch, listen, learn."
"If a song is good, I don't give a fuck which genre it is or which generation it came from."
"In the end, it doesn't even matter."
You have stardust in your eyes and I'm in the mood for a little magic.
"No matter how many people you choose to surround yourself with, you are born alone and you will die alone."
What does your heart have to say about me?
I don't have to study psychology. I am psychology and I know more about it than your little piece of paper because I'm living it every day.
Cause and effect. That's all this is.
Never apologize for being yourself. Ever.
I rely on me and I have never let myself down.
No one has power over you unless you give it to them.
"Wait one goddamned minute, you believe in the bible?   It all makes fucking sense now."
"Aw, that's so sweet. You're her hero. You wanna know who my hero is, motherfucker? Me."
Do I need a man? Sure I do. Someone needs to take out the garbage.
*serenades self to sleep*
"Game player, skirt chaser, life faker. Stay away from me."
Can one drown in sadness?
"My block list is more reactive than proactive but hey, whatever makes me happy, right?"
"When someone unfollows you and you think, 'Thank you for taking yourself out, trash'."
"Emotional, sensitive, loud, demanding looking for reserved, strong, serene, giving. In other words, my polar opposite."
"You snooze you lose, fucker."
"Easy targets, as far as the eye can see."
I am me. You are you. The End
"They eat your words up like kids eating candy. Greedily, hungrily, always wanting more."
"You love like me, with your whole goddamed heart."
"Can I have a honeymoon without getting married and can it last forever, please?"
Who the fuck names their kid Bubba?
"What does she have that you don't?  His attention, in other words, nothing. The answer is nothing."
"Excuse my french but could you fuck off, please?"
"For me, a true story but in colours so beautiful I can't even begin to describe them."
Different people all end up turning into the same person.
I don't have a heart to give.  I don't give a fuck to care.
"The camera may not lie, but the filters sure fucking do."
"Seriously though, what the fuck's wrong with you?"
"Hate, love, scorn, malice, intrigue. Doesn't matter what you're feeling towards me as long as I'm getting you to feel."
I'd much rather do both.
"I'm not forgiving. I'm not forgetting. I'm not being the bigger person. If you're an asshole to me, you're getting that shit back tenfold."
It's raining inside my head.
"Landslide will bring you down, motherfucker."
"If letting go of me is easy, then do it."
"I am the moon seen in the light of day, out of place but a reminder of the darkness to come."
"I'm all cynic and cyanide, darling."
I will not settle for an ordinary love.
"If I wanted your attention, I'd motherfucking have it."
Relax. It's just Twitter.
Forget being honest with me and try being honest with yourself.
"Um, his name is Han Solo, not Hans Olo.  Christ."
I'm not real.
I only exist in your head.
Does she know that I'm the one you dream about?
Did you tell her all about me?  #breach
Go away but stay.
"Jealousy, disguised as curiosity, can be a very sexy thing."
The stars will align and you will be mine.
You know there is something more to it when you can't get it out of your head.
He must have laced his words with something because I'm hooked.
I don't owe you a thing. Remember that.
"I'm the loveliest person I know, motherfucker."
&lt;-------- Social pessimist.
"Music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music, please."
I will tell you whatever the fuck you want to hear if it will shut you the fuck up.
I am the storm.
Che.
"What gives, cue ball? I'm looking at you, I'm thinking 14 in the side pocket."
I'm drinking a bottle of delusion.
There's magic here. Can you feel it?
"Every 'slow down', 'calm down' or 'pipe down' gets the same response out of me, a resounding 'fuck you'."
"While your words are lovely, eventually you're going to need something more to back them up."
"Plants are living things too, vegan."
"Partner in crime, get your shit together and let me make you mine."
"My father has about 30 books on Hitler, yet he questions my interest in Manson. Um, apple, tree?"
Free as a bird catching the wind.
'I am the eye in the sky looking at you. I can read your mind.'
I don't want to be pretty. I want to be ugly. The ugliest thing you have ever seen.
I'm not going to dumb down my vocabulary just because you're a fucking idiot.
"Apparently, the dominant emotion running  my brain is 'disgust', so no surprise there.  Aren't quizzes fun?"
Do you ever see people who have had plastic surgery on their face and realize that they all have the same 'look' to them. New species alert.
I don't want to deal with stupid anymore.
"""So, I'm trying to detox a little."" she says while eating her spicy noodles with melted cheese, hot cheetos and a diet coke.  Stupid twit."
I'm not here to save anyone. I can't even save myself.
There is something wrong with me.
"Oh, Twitter. Why hast thou forsaken me?"
"All this needless, nonsensical drivel that I have to plow through in order to find the words that move me proper."
"What you hate reveals a lot about you and others can pick up on those negative projections so clearly, idgaf what other people think."
I've had a shit day. People. Get at me and I'll cut you a new one.
"Piss me off, I'm in your face like"
For you.
"It's you and me, baby. All I did was silence the background noise."
It's my fault. I saw something in you that wasn't there. Illusion. Delusion. That's me.
"You're dead, like me."
Her pain is my own and I am sad. Sad for her and sad for me.
You don't even deserve to view my likeness.
"You still sniffing around my page, loser?"
"Every slight, perceived or otherwise, will receive the appropriate punishment."
You will know my hell.
"But this time, she grabbed your ankle and brought you down to the fiery depths with her and now you will feel her pain."
Let it out. Let it go. Release it.
"Nightmare in motion, drowning in treacle.  Darkness enveloping, slowly, slowly."
Echoing emotions.
Treat me like I don't exist and YOU will become invisible to ME.
A good illustration of the inside of my head.
Psst. You are.
Most people are better in the abstract.
I don't do hot and cold. I do consistency.
People who blow hot and cold thrive on control and equate feeling out of control with desire. They value what they don't have and 'newness'.
I work with *fetuses.  *millennials
Don't let the avi fool you. I really am that lovely.
I am his. He is mine.
I'll hide in you.
Tried to buy your pretty heart.
Run.
"What you have found here is not love. It's adulation. Recognize the difference. But hey, whatever gets you through the day, right?"
"Lovely. Never, never change. Keep that breathless charm."
"That's right, eat the apple, you weak fuck."
We consider too much the good luck of the early bird and not enough the bad luck of the early worm.  ps: I sleep until noon.
It's not my fault he likes me. I'm fucking fabulous.
Go and chase your sunshine and rainbows. I'm a rainy day with torrential downpours.
"I'm perfect just the way I am, motherfucker."
‚ñà ‚ô• ‚ñà
*spellbound*
Hold me tight. Let me go.
Today's word is 'shit' because it reminds me of you.
Someone tweets about being madly in love with their life and I just want to shit into their fan.
"I shit faerie dust, motherfucker."
I'm not afraid of monsters. I am one.
I like my thorns and jagged edges. They keep the weak ones away.
"You be the beauty, I'll be the beast."
The 'normals' bore the fuck out of me.
"Aw, you're so sweet and delicate and fragile. I'd like to snap you in two like a fucking pretzel."
Don't be afraid. I'm just going to eat you up and spit you out.
I'd like to grab testosterone by the balls and cut it's fucking dick off.
My brain's a bit fucked up.
I'm not sorry for shit.
We can't have a meeting of the minds if you don't have one.
"My kid just kissed my forehead and said, ""Nope, you're still here."""
"Maturity is recognizing the nonsense when it is thrust upon you, and learning how to just walk away from it."
"I'm sorry, but perhaps you misunderstood. Please don't correspond with me unless you have a functioning brain to do so. Thank you."
Conspiracy theories are nothing more than people with far too much time on their hands and not enough brain capacity to do much with it.
"Sure, Sandy Hooks was a hoax, 9/11 was a hoax, the holocaust was a hoax in fact, your whole fucking life is a hoax so kill yourself now."
I'm his dirty little secret. Shhhh.
"Don't call me crazy, motherfucker or I'm gonna show you crazy."
What can I say? I was born in a great fucking city.   #PrideTO
I am a wear sexy lingerie underneath a trenchcoat will flash you type of girl.
Quiet down and listen to the leaves in the wind.
I remember when I lost my mind.
Fuck off.
I can see your thoughts.
You don't know me.
"I love the way you hurt me, baby."
I'll take the pain.
Give me the truth.
I was born sick.
"Sharpen your knife, motherfucker. I'm immune."
"'You are not alone. I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay.'"
"Slowly, slowly.."
"I have this condition. If you act like an asshole towards me, I pretend that you no longer exist. It's called self-respect."
You should be happy that I'm not yours. I'm very jealous and territorial when it comes to my man.
Old fashioned. Introspective. Chivalrous. Intelligent. Charming. Reserved. Classy. Loving. Clever. Funny. Smart. Witty. Loyal. Mine. Yes.
"I'm a creature, baby."
"No, he does not. He is a narcissistic piece of shit and what he needs is a bracing reality check."
There is nothing I dislike about this man.  #mcm
I think the word you are looking for is ordinary.  She is ordinary. He is ordinary. They are ordinary.
Killing you in my mind.
"All in favour of bombing all tyrannical regimes worldwide, say Aye."
"It annoys me that I had to mute you because of the company you choose to keep, but it is a price I'm willing to pay to avoid the irritation."
"My AVI is now a square within a circle because fuck you Twitter, you don't get to choose for me."
"I look at my Blocked list everyday. It's the little things, ya know?"
He did. They have.
Maybe the crazy people are the normal ones and the conformists are the crazies. Who's to say?
My favourite colour is ocean.
"Again, I gaze upon my field of fucks. Still, it is barren."
"I can behave for a little while, then I can't."
"I hold on to things. I hold on to people. When I finally let go, I'm done."
You're muted. :)
"Oh my god, I'm blocking again. Feels fucking good!"
Tornado followed me up to the lake!
Tornado in Toronto!!
You stay on your side of the planet and I'll stay on mine.
Mute the idiocy and it ceases to exist.
"'They have turned their backs but I am still here. I am still, here.'"
I feel. I cry. I laugh. I rage. I love.
"You keep writing, I'll keep laughing."
Have you ever noticed that anyone who is 'real' is not filled with joy 24/7?
"If you were truly happy, you would be out in the world 'being happy', not writing on twitter about it."
I am the violentest of all the femmes.
Fuck you Twitter for turning my AVI into a goddamned circle.
Don't you mind li'l ol' me.
I found a liquor store and drank it.
"When you're in pain, that's all there is."
Aw. Let them have their little twitter love story. It will be over soon enough if and when they ever meet in the real world.
Don't fuck with me and I won't mop the floor with your face. Simple really.
"Hey, tough guy. Yes, you, spewing all the misogynistic shit. Your mom called. She wants you to pick up some milk on your way home."
I dream of you in red. Running down your head. Pooling on the floor. As I'm heading out the door.
"Yes, I hear you. You're full of shit."
"There's nothing like you and I, baby."
"I'll see you in hell, motherfucker."
"I'm tired of wishy-washy, pansy-assed people with no fucking gumption in life."
Idealists deserve the eventual disappointment they will receive in life.
Praying does not do anyone any good. Get off your fucking ass and DO something about it.
*haunts you until the end of time*
"Don't tear people down, tear them up instead."
Fucking people with their egos and shit.
"Go and be the hero for some weak bitch, I'm all full of power over here, daddy."
"If someone speaks ill of me and that information gets back to me, consider me on the warpath because who the fuck are you?"
"Every man believes that he needs a dirty fucking whore in his life. That's where you come in, Scarlett."
"Always searching, never finding. Never staying, always leaving."
Thanks Planet Earth - it was fun while it lasted.
Pretty much.
"If you like hot, sticky, humid weather, then I guess you're just a fucking idiot, aren't you?"
Apparently he would.. and she's disgusting.
Go away and stay there.
"Those people that just hover incessantly, reading your words. Eating them up like greedy fucks."
"If you could read my mind, you would unfollow."
"You don't have to cut yourself, little flower. I'll do it for you."
I don't give a (non) flying fuck that the Penguins took the Cup.
You don't have to like my tweets but you'd better fucking like my tweets.
Send me the ring from your CrackerJack's box so I know it's real.
"If I'm truly happy for you, it means I don't want to make you mine."
"Let's go for a walk deep in the woods, my love.  *purchases shovel*"
Ignorance is a disease. Get well soon.
He chose to save someone else so I continue to drown.
Don't mess with the lioness.
Don't rattle my cage.
Don't make me take off my heels.
"Listen up you little bitch, you'd better hide yourself or I will cut you."
It's gorgeous in here.  *points to self*
"No sugar tonight, motherfucker."
"Simply put, you are not worth the aggravation."
"That's right, you fuck off. This is my place."
They retweet you because you're safe. I'm not.
"He's all yours, sweetheart. I don't want him."
Nope. No longer give a fuck.
I stuffed my heart into a bottle and threw that bottle out into the sea. Hence why the waves have been so tumultuous lately.
"If you were standing right in front of me, I'd smash your skull in with a cement block and watch you bleed out."
You could have been a little more genuine with me. Not complaining. Just saying.
A storm is brewing  in my head.
"Always the secret, never the revealed."
"Something ringing true? You think I'm talking about you? Rest assured, I'm not."
I can make you feel like a man.  'Take out the trash.'
They don't want a strong woman who speaks her mind. They want a weak little twit who agrees with every word they say.
Just in case there was any doubt.
Chip away at yourself. I prefer my layers intact.
I want to be a bird. There are people I'd like to shit on.
Having to wait for money that's owed to me is fucking preposterous.
Idiot.
Does it make you feel good when someone likes every single one of your tweets even when they suck shit? You can do better than that.
Shred and tear.
"Set the pace, feel the rage."
The answer is insane.
"Plain and simple vs difficult and complex. I'll take the challenge, every time."
You fickle fuck.
"Keep your delusions to yourself, fucker."
"She can be your sun, I'll be your moon."
"I might be a bitch now, but I didn't start out that way, motherfucker."
I don't have time for stupid.
Anyone can take a picture and call themselves a photographer just like anyone can write a few words and call themselves a poet. Nope.
Pain 'stains the inner workings of the brain.'
Do you know the cruelest thing you can do to someone you've locked in a room? Press their face to the window.
I'm going to put you in a people zoo.
You traded in your feelings for stability.
I could never deal with someone like me.
C'est tellement path√©tique.
"'If you act single, why be in a relationship? Because they know these females are going to stay with them regardless of what they do.'"
All the joie has gone out of my vivre.
He leaves a trail of broken hearts in his wake. Good thing I don't have one to break.
Fuck DM's. I want a handwritten letter. Who's down?
I just love the strong silent type.
I only have a violent streak where you're concerned.
"I don't water down shit. You don't like it, get the fuck off my page."
"'We live in a generation of emotionally weak people. Everything has to be watered down because it's offensive, including the truth.'"
How do you know me so well when I don't even know myself?
The man is an idiot. End of.
All you need to know about me is that my eyes tilt up and my mouth tilts down.
Be yourself. Everyone else is #covfefe.
You'd look amazing in *red.  *blood
"Steal my man, I'll steal your soul."
Feel my love.
What a beautiful avi. Too bad it's not you.
Where'd you go?
Mood.
"Here is what I'll do to all of your wishes, motherfucker."
Don't make me go all bad seed on you.
"For a moment in time, you caught my eye. Moments pass."

"If they want to stay, they will. If they don't, they won't."
You're dangerous and I like it.

"Somewhere along the way something insidious sucked all of the colour out of my life, so I continue to live it in black and white."
Take your poetry and shove it up your ass. I've got fucking bills to pay.

"Stay in your lane, fucker."
I will stomp a mudhole in you. You don't know who I am.
"You wanna play? I've got your game right here, motherfucker."
Don't you fucking dare come out of your corner and expect me to stay in mine.
"Truth is speaking, but you're not listening."
Some people come into this world less equipped for life than others.
You stopped talking to me and it was like the garbage took itself out.
You.
The young twitter whores begging for your credit card # and the old desperate men who oblige make me laugh and laugh. You deserve eachother.
I'd make somebody a great murder victim.
It's a curse to be darling.

Of course he's a bird lover. Look at the beak on his girl.
"If I irritate you in any way, good."
Deep down inside you know you're just wasting time waiting for shit to happen.
You are living in a dream world and my purpose is to snap you the fuck out of it.
"Twitterlove be all, 'He/she is the one. We are soulmates.'  and I be all, 'Haven't met eachother in person yet, have you?'"
Quiet down now. I've heard enough out of you.

My work was on the news this evening. I have got to stop killing people.
"If someone tries to convince you that they are not a certain way, then they have just ensured you that they are precisely that way."
Keep fucking off until you can't fuck off anymore and then fuck off one more time.
Your lies are mesmerizing. What's your truth like?
Time will have it's way with you.
"Twenty-something and think you know anything? Let me tell you something, you don't know shit."
You're a fool if you believe in love stories.
"Blah, blah fucking blah."
Your truth is a lie.
I am well aware of your type.
"I hope that I, too, make your list of unfollowees. It's only a matter of time."
.. and I have to sit around reading all your garbage? Nope.
"I already know that your twitter love is bullshit because if it was based on anything real, you never would have initiated contact with me."
I'm too tired to sleep.
"Who knows why people you've never corresponded with have you blocked on here. Moreover, who cares."
"Me: (on one hour's sleep) That sounds just like lightning. Wait, lightning doesn't make a sound."
I don't care enough to hate myself.
I lock people up for a living.
"Pretty little lovebirds, sing to me."

"I just realized, it's all the same. You are all the same."
I will fix you a delicious meal  with glass in it.

The rage is strong in this one.
"One little match. So tiny and unassuming but oh, the damage it can do.  *strikes*"
The 1950's called. They want their system of beliefs back. I pointed them in your direction.
Do you think about what you say or does the verbiage just spew forth much like vomit with an upset stomach.
Everything turns into nothing.
Follow me into the darkness.
"Is my soul too dark for you, baby?"
"Darling, just fucking own it."
Take the mask off when you speak to me.
Am I feral? Quite.
Bad kitty cat.
Wasting my breath on *the living.
You can forget all about me but that won't make me disappear.  I'm still here.

So divided we all are. It's fucking glorious.
Ending you would be delicious.
There is no room for cowardice here with me. You can go wherever you want and be with whomever you wish by simply letting me be.

Mediocre destiny is written into our petty lives.
All of us are marked by years.

"Guys, I like the thrill of the chase too. Don't be so fucking available."
"I remember a man who took great pleasure in ignoring me. Unfortunately, he is no longer with us."

I knew I was fucked from the moment I felt the universe cock it's gun at me.
Do you even care how it's going with me?
"I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not."
I don't have a lot of interest in being a good person or a bad person. From what I can tell either way you're screwed.

Fuck you.
I do not like people who play with the emotions of others and may God help you if the emotions I speak of are mine.
I make no apologies for what I may or may not do. You came to me. Remember that.
There will be carnage.. for two.
I'm just biding my time. Waiting for the perfect moment to knock down that house of cards you have so carefully built.
There is poison here. Me.

Plot twist: You've always been an idiot. I just didn't see it before now.
Relationship status: Not you.
My twitter experience is greatly enhanced with your absence.
Oh well. Not my problem.
This pretty much sums up my behaviour with the felines.
Far too many buttons begging to be pressed with that one.
I have watched you flourish from an idiot to an imbecile.
Just pass the fucking vodka.
The thoughts I'm thinking aren't safe.
Let me tell you something. Survival in this world is a motherfucking talent.

She is beautiful but her heart is not.
There is rage in me the likes of which you have never seen.
I would describe myself as tired. Tired of crap people. Tired of long working hours for shit pay. Tired of existing in a very selfish world.
"'If not me, who? If not now, when?'"
I hear you're looking for love.  No thank you.

Stand up for yourself. No one else is going to do that shit for you.

"I don't know why you.  But, you."
The amount I care is directly proportional to the amount you do.
"Don't keep things all bottled up inside.  Think. Vent. Release,  and it's gone."

I don't need an alarm clock. I have a cat.

I feel like a marionette who has just had all of her strings cut.
"Dear Human Race,  You're going to regret all of this technological advancement. It will not end well."
"I'm not too sure, but I think I died yesterday."
Underestimating me is undermining yourself.

Would you rather know
You have two choices. You can love me or you can fuck off.
"There is an out. If she goes, so do I."
Goddamn it. My child is sad like me. What the fuck have I done?
I'm not like the others and that's not necessarily a good thing but it is a true thing.
I'll get over it but will I survive?
Sad. Sadder. Saddest.
I remember what the butterflies felt like. I just wish they hadn't all flown away.

Paint me in colours that don't exist.
I'm wounded but powerful.
The restless and impulsive.
All things dark and intriguing.
He loves me  not.
The walls and windows are as thin as bones. A person could walk right through them.
My brain screams. Loud.
"You blasphemous creature, you.  Seat next to me is free."
I played the fucking villain. Just like you wanted.
Have you ever confused a dream with life?
I am wearing nothing but blood.
To go back and forth.  Letting out and then gathering back in again  again again again again again again again again again again again again
You gave me the ammo. All I did was shoot the gun.
A man will select a woman solely based on her capacity to put up with his bullshit. All the rest of us are labelled 'crazy' for not.

Write anything about me yet?
Just listen to the music.
You make me want to die.

"Let's see how you like being hunted, motherfucker."
He is nothing but a predator.
"He goes after the sweet ones, the innocents, which is why I was blocked straight away."
You are a human affront to all women and I am a woman.
There will be accountability for your actions.
"You, hiding behind your computer, engaging with multiple, vulnerable women on the internet, does not make you a man, it makes you a coward."
Change your behaviour or I'm going to do it for you.
Let's see just how dangerous I can be.
"Volatile, combative, unstable? You've come to the right place."
Am I sane or am I crazy?
I know what it's like to want to die.
You think you're free?
Fuck your opinion.
What I'm thinking is not safe.
You call this a life?
"Sometimes, it's really hard to stay strong."
One of the worst things is watching someone you like liking someone else.
It's like I'm screaming but no one can hear.
What the fuck's going on inside my head?
Your face makes me feel all murdery inside.
I would never be happy with a mere mortal.

Exactly what time yesterday do you think I was born?
"Weekend drivers are out in full force, the dears."

I can see you and you can see me. Let the ignoring commence.

Did I mention that I died again?
My funeral is on Sunday.
Hurt.
The blood was everywhere. It was just that no one else could see it but me.
I had a vision of love but that's all it ever was.
There's beauty in the breakdown.
Touch my darkness. Feel my pain.
Lost another one yesterday. Death is all around me.

My heart is cold  and dark.
That's right. Give up on me just like every other motherfucker on the planet. It no longer affects me.
One.
I remember when I died.

You bring out the sadist in me.

I was here before you and I'll be here after you.
Who are you? Who were you? Do you even know?
"Oh, little flower, soon you will realize your mistakes. I can't save the whole fucking world from themselves now, can I?"
Go away now. I've had enough of you.
*dances with your demons in the pale moonlight*
"Live and learn. That's my story, fucker."
Your tweets have turned from clever and intriguing to cunt chasing and vomit inducing. Were you ever even who I thought you were?
"Sing me a goddamned lullaby, motherfucker."
What difference does it make?
I could kill  you  now.
"Thanks for the chuckle, fucker. Can I call you Chucklefucker?"
Shout out to the ex so the gigolo stops giving my daughter siblings.

Death is not the worst thing.

"Sieg Heil, motherfuckers."
Quietly and no one gets hurt.
What can I say? You bring out the bludgeoning bitch in me.
"I know all of your secrets, darling."
You say you're not a player yet your behaviour determines that that is a lie.

He stole my heart then walked away.
Sleeping is my only refuge which is probably why I do it so much.

I have felt for a hundred lifetimes.
"I don't 'miss' anymore, I just.. nothing."
You think you can love me then leave me to die?
I've got two words for you. Fuck and Off. That is it. That is all.

"As soon as you come to the realization that not everyone makes it to the future, you will start planning for the present."
My tweets will reach their intended audience because I know who reads them.
You can teach me nothing. Fuck off.
Everybody knows that silver is where it's at.
Beware. Patheticism is all around us.
The adulation you seek is actually a sign of weakness.
"When you are feeling, you use your heart not your head, darling."
"Easy tiger, your ignorance is showing."

"'Baby, I could never steal you from another. It's such a shame our friendship had to end.'"
'I never wanted to be your weekend lover. I only wanted to be some kind of friend.'
Could you warn a bitch before spinning those tales of everlasting love? I didn't have my fucking bucket ready.
You wanted to dance so I asked you to dance. That's all it was.
Hold those rising floods that fill your skin. You will be okay.
This is murder weather and I'm aching for a kill.
The night is in my sight.
"I would love to love you, lover."
The city is restless. It's ready to pounce.
Can I mix in with your affairs?
"Don't shoot that thing at me, motherfucker."
"My love is loud, sloppy, demanding yet pure. Ain't nothing safe about it."
"He could shit in her mouth and she would call it pudding. That's not love, that's adulation. There's a difference."
"Whenever someone is talking with me, I'm screaming at them from the inside to stfu."

"One friend despises Trump, another friend adores him. I'd like to put them both in a boxing ring and have them fight it out. To the death."
Is that your chick?  *laughs forever*
You enhance my Twitter experience considerably.
"Fasten your seatbelts, folks, it's going to be a motherfucking bumpy ride."
Hahaha! Die.
Kiss me with your words.
"The truest of loves, the mating of souls and other lies we tell ourselves in order to survive this cesspool of mundanity we call life."
Sometimes I bleed.
A very lonely world indeed.
I have them all fooled thinking that I care.
"Oh, fuck off. Do it now."
"Strong silent type. Loyal to a fault. Keep promises. Exceedingly attentive and supportive. Witty. When I find you, I'm never letting you go."
Sweet yet strong. That's what I'm looking for.
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Hate me because I'm smart too.
Why do men always require alternates?
You're not a thinker. You're a judger.

"I don't treat people badly, I treat them accordingly."
"Have a good life, or die. Doesn't matter."
"If nothing else, Twitter is an excellent source of comic relief."
A good representation of who I am as a person.
People will dislike you simply for being who they think you are. Fuck those people.
"I blame you, Scarlett."
Until we meet again.
Imagine all the mischief we'd get up to.
I didn't know I was lost.
What about the angels?
Humility is a beautiful thing.
I like making special people smile.
Don't you dare love me.
I don't care if I'm here tomorrow.

*hands you scissors*  *tells you to run with them*
"Strange, strange mind has got me caged from time to time."
"Tell me something, do you actually believe the shit that comes out of your mouth?"
Fuck you. I tweet what I want.
You think you are getting away with bad behaviour but you have to live with the person you are and you know precisely who that is.
A sense of humour or gtfo.
Forgive and forget? Nah. I'm more of a seek and destroy.
"The more I read you, the more I realize we have absolutely nothing in common."
Turn everything in life to a raven and do nothing to apologize for it.
I don't want fiction and fairytales.
(f)O(re)VER:  Nothing lasts forever.
"In other words, you are 'loving' in a dream world. Good luck with that."
"Twitter love exists, but in a suspended 'honeymoon' phase that has yet to be battle-tested with the day to day mundanity of the real world."
The best cure for Twitter love is the face to face meet up.

"Shut your political yap, you fucking moron."
It's cute the way you keep locking up your account. Like anyone gives a shit about what you have to say.

Go away but stay.

"If I escape this ward, I'm coming after you."
Truth? What truth? You're a fucking liar.
You are the fuel to my fire.
My rage keeps me warm at night.

Visions of swastikas in my head.
"Bye bye, baby."

Do you see the crazy in my eyes? You should. It's there.
"Seriously though, fuck off."
"Are you soulless and heartless? No. You're just plain, Jane."
Cunt.
Let's go on vacation down south so I can drown you in the fucking sea.
You have questionable taste in females and by questionable I mean she's a whore and you're an asshole.
Go away and take your little whore with you.
Does it matter? Nope.

"My eyes are dark, but light, ya know?"
Needy people chap my ass.
"I don't need you, I want you. There's a difference."

Is it still considered murder if it was provoked?

Someone prove me wrong. Anyone.
I'm bored. Play with me.
Nope. I'm staying in your head.
The first Full Moon of the year falls in the watery and intuitive sign of Cancer. Double whammy. Wish me luck.
"Much like irl, no one here truly gives a shit unless they are getting something in return. Sad world."
I still have to read this fucker because all of his little chickadees keep retweeting him onto my feed.
"So much heartache here.   ""I remember you as you forget about me.""  You forget about me, I'll return the favour, asshole."
"Have an apple, fucker."
The planets are whispering secrets to each other again.
It's you. It's always been you. It will never be anyone else but you.
I love being up when nobody else is.
The reason I stay away from people is because I don't like any of them.
Do not disrespect me with your stories of love. You know what you did. I know what you did. You know who you are. I know who you are.
I can't wait until they meet and he realizes what he's done.
"The only thing birdlike about you is your beak, er, nose."
But what about Jane? What about plain Jane?
You need us pessimists to appreciate those optimists.
Stabilized. (at least where you're concerned)
It's all good. Have a nice life.
I plead temporary insanity.
"I do; however, like the feeling of the emotions within me changing  from the earlier pangs of jealousy to the retrieval of my brain cells."
"I don't think she's clever, smart, or anything particularly special to look at. He disagrees so now I feel the exact same way about him."
No future for you.
The greatest trick Donald Trump pulled was convincing voters he‚Äôd be ‚Äúanti-establishment.‚Äù

Fuck off. I was here first.
Ode to you.

Disdain rules my brain.
"You know what would be really cool? If you had a fucking clue, that's what."
"If you're thinking of reaching out, don't."
Truthful Tuesday  You're an idiot.
"It‚Äôs a lot more complicated and involved than that, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre picking up what I‚Äôm putting down."
"You‚Äôre not as cool as you think you are, fucker."

You are my oasis of nature's green in the very centre of this grey concrete jungle.
Please fuck off in a timely fashion.
Pet peeves:  People who think they are better than everybody else.  Crap fuck drivers.  People who blow hot and cold.
"My wall has a drawbridge, so no need to climb.  I invite in and when you disappoint, drawbridge open, out you are thrust. Zero damage to me."

I met someone.  He was an asshole.

It's actually quite simple. Don't fuck with me and I won't fuck back.
"I just saw your TC in their car, picking their nose. But hey, every happiness to you."
"I can be a little scary, pet."
*scares everybody away then wonders where everybody went*
Another fucking creature dizzy with love.
You should have done better by me.
"It is not mandatory that you like me. In fact, it's probably preferable that you don't."
Inhale the sadness. Exhale the rage.
Where's the bastard that's going to dry my tears? I've got a river flowing here.
"Can't stay away, can you?"
I believe the account you're looking for is over yonder way. Quit stalking mine.
Is you lost?
Grab me by the pussy and I'll cut your dick off.
"I would like to read a politically subversive novel veiled in absurdism. Oh wait, we are living one."
Locked account. Hide your face. Hide your words. I'll hide your fucking body.
Very curious behaviour. I don't quite know what to make of it.
I am in need of some salt water and by salt water I mean drowning in the sea.

Keep your complaints at home in the garbage where they belong.
Don't lose what is real chasing what only appears to be.

He needs a fawner to make him feel like a man so I'm of no use to him because my self respect is fucking intact.

Hurry up 2016. The year is almost over and Fuckface von Clownstick is still alive and well.
Am I the only one that eventually bores of everyone?
"Cleverness and chivalrous. Yes, please."
"Promise me that you'll never speak to me again, no matter what."
I just wish they wouldn't come back once they realize their mistake.
"Oh well, life goes on regardless."
"Sad though, that I don't have the capacity to love romantically."
You made the right choice. I fear I would have destroyed you and taken myself along for the ride.
I'd like to crawl into your words and fall asleep there.
I know why I'm angry. Do you know why you're an asshole?
"I wish that you had died instead, fucker."
"If I had a gun right now, I'd shoot that motherfucker's head clean off his shoulders."

Be careful how you treat people. It will come back to haunt you.
"If we lived in the same place, you would just become that strange smell coming from my basement."
Hate is not the opposite of love. Indifference is.
You say you're in love with your TC?  Your blatant disregard while you were engaging and flirting with others here determines that is a lie.

My Christmas gift to you is never talking to you again.
"Being of European descent, my Christmas happens on the Eve and now it's over, and I couldn't be happier."
"Merry Xmas, fuckers."
"He felt needed, like he could impress her, like he could give her things that she had never seen before. It made him seem bigger.   Wrong."
"That guy?, he's smoother than a new born baby's butt and that TC of his?, she's so perky I'd like to drive a nail through her head."

Such a colossal disappointment you were. You have no idea.
I always make the extra effort and I'm so disappointed in people for not reciprocating.
Why did you have to turn out to be just like the rest?
This holiday crap is literally beating the shit out of me. I think I need help.
"These tweets aren't about you, darling. I muted you months ago."
Please. Don't bore me with your talk of love. I've heard it all before.
"I thank you for all the tweeting material, you dumb fuck."
The level of fervency in which you tweet about your TC will be matched only by the level of your embarrassment when TC fucks someone local.
I tried to warn him. Stupid ass wouldn't listen.
Saw your tweets today. Not impressed.
"I didn't have you pegged for an idiot, but my god, are you ever proving me wrong."

I feel it in my bones.

Coldest place on Earth: Antarctica  Colder still: Your heart.
"I thought honourable, loyal, deep-hearted kindness. Fuck, was I ever wrong."
All I see is you.
Your heart is a reflection of mine.
"Hide your eyes, darling. I can see your truth through them."
You're still inside my dark head.
"Maybe, there's hope for you yet. We'll see."
I thought that we were 'meant to be'.  I was wrong.  Again.
I want to be 'so happy to see' someone.
"His lips, softer than the rain."
"Sad little story, he blamed me for letting go when all along he knew that he, himself had done it."
"You, no."
I don't have the time to wade through all the clowns and candy wrappers you've got going on inside your head.
That fucker flew right under my radar.
"I call bullshit when the married man tells everyone how happy he is with wifey when, secretly, he is trying to pursue you behind her back."
People only let you see what they want you to see here. There is no point of reference except time and trust.
"Watch out! He will befriend you, be very sweet and complimentary and the very second you start to let your guard down, he will turn on you."
Guess it was a test and I didn't pass.
"Listen, it's been a slice of heaven but you need to fuck off now."
"What goes around comes around, darling."

"Excuse me, I'm just over in the corner giggling here."
"I won't say, 'I told you so.', but I'll be thinking it."
Remember me when the shit goes down.
I hope you have a good life. I hope you have a daughter and that some guy treats her the exact way you treated me. Only then will you see.
Get out of my life.

"Table for one please, outside, in the rain."
"'Tick Tock, soul mate.  I've got shit to do.'"
'I didn't respond because I was busy.'   is a direct translation of:  'I didnt respond because I don't give a shit.'
Sing me a smile.
Age is the best killer of idealism.
"Am I cynical? Fuck yes, I live on this planet with shitloads of other people, don't I?"
All you can do is keep breathing.
"They are drawn to you because of your light. What they don't understand is that when they let you go, that light goes with you."
"I am not your doormat, motherfucker. You do not speak to me like that. Ever."
You are not a monster. You are a sad little man that let a red headed cunt govern your behaviour here. Sad fuck.
"Oh, he's your TC? I don't give a fuck, princess."
"No, sweetheart. I'm a dominant. You need to go and find yourself a sub or a switch. A subswitch. A sandwich. Something."
You could possibly be more fucked up than me and that's saying something.
I now understand why the younger ladies like you. You speak their language. Stupid.
Sexual prowess in the bedroom has nothing to do with age but rather a willingness to understand and implement.
I can't help who I am and neither can you.
I need a badass man to go and see horror movies with.
"A scythe, a barn, you and a promise I made.  ps: It was an accident."
He courts the girl. He gets the girl. He fucks the girl. He gets bored with the girl. He dumps the girl. He comes sniffing after me again.
Let's go on a killing spree. Teeheehee.
"I bore exceedingly easily with people, but never myself."
"The rage in me needs an outlet, otherwise I'm just another murderer in the streets."
"Leaving here would:  A) take away my venting outlet B) make life much too easy for you  In either case, not gonna happen."
He's smart and I'm smitten.
"When wires get together, they just want to get entangled."
"'I'd like to meet the president. He moves me like a hurricane. Why you see him as a murderer, well that depends on the colour of your skin."
"Got to have devotion, to meet the man in the sasquatch suit. Pure white face, white, white skin, these are the keys to freedom."

"Laugh it out the other side of your tombstone, motherfucker."
You. Get off of my fucking planet.
Priorities. Perspective. Possibilities.
"Scram, fink."
"Go crawl into the corner, back under your rock and die."
"Me? Oh, nothing. Just drinking some vodka, watching my murder shows and thinking of you."
That little voice that nags you from inside. Listen to it for it is very wise.
"When angered, there are no words. Just the pits of Hell's fire reflected inside of my eyes. Infernal."
It's like watching oil and water dance.

"If you can't make me smile, you serve no purpose in my life."
"You're one of those 'special' motherfuckers, aren't you?"
Do not box retweet me with the heading 'I don't get it'. It's not my fault you're a fucking idiot.
"Bitch is the new black, motherfuckers."
Time keeps no secrets.
"I've got to watch my filthy mouth. Better yet, you watch it for me."
Always blocked by women.  Jealous cunts.
"Think about me tonight as you roll over in search of the cooler side of the pillow. I'm working until 2am, motherfuckers."
"Real life is getting in the way of my Twitter time, dammit."
I'm working with children between the ages of 20-27 and all they can fucking talk about is this motherfucking vaping shit. Somebody shoot me

"You, over there, with the fucking harem. Don't even try it."
It's adorable the way he thinks I'm too stupid to have him all figured out.
All of your bitches have either blocked or unfollowed me and I'm just sitting over here drinking my vodka.

Of course I wish you and your internet love the best of luck.  *turns head the fuck away from that train wreck*
I'm ok.  *shoots you in the face*  I'm better.
"No, no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong. ALL of your attention goes to me.  Me, me, me, me.  *stomps feet*  *pouts*"
Attention: Tweets are more volatile than they appear. Proceed with caution.

"Your anger is too tame for my blood. Come back when you seethe, like me."

"If you think that my tweets are about you, cool. If you think that they're not about you, fine. In other words, I don't give a shit."
I have a problem. It's called 'always liking the ones who don't like me and not liking the ones who do'.  Then came you.
Am I territorial with the people I care about? Fuck yes. They are few and far between and I guard them with a ferocity that is primal.
"If you're happy, go and be happy. If you're not, come and sit next to me."
How someone else feels about you has no bearing on my own.
If you're happy and you know it you seriously need to get the fuck away from me.
Truth is harsh and real but fuck is it ever a time saver.
"Doesn't matter how desperately you try and hold on to that someone for companionship, you will die alone."
*unmutes*  *blocks*
Your humour is not humorous.
There must be more.
Call my name.
"Wear your rose-coloured glasses, but only when I'm around."
You don't like what people are saying? Change the conversation.. with your eyes.
You think I'm here to revere you? Fuck that. Response or gtfo.
Whenever I see animal abuse of any kind I want to go on a killing spree and abuse some *animals myself.  *humans
A forest of fantasies in your soul.
The ebb and flow of the ocean in your eyes.
A wood burning fire in your heart.
A choreographed dance of desperation.
"'You wake up every morning to fight the same demons that left you so tired the night before, and that, my love, is bravery.'"
Feed my hate and I'll love you forever.
Oscar calibre performance for making people think I care.
Speaking of stupid fucking bitches........
Please fuck off in a timely fashion.
Forgive me for being real.
I will find you.
Sleeping at night is overrated. That's when all the fun happens.
I don't care. I love it.
Hahahaha!! Jim Jefferies - Donald Trump - Full Length Official Clip -- From Freedum...
All this talk of clowns and Trump seems to fit somehow.
"Aw, lost a few followers who were Trump supporters.  Good."
Life is full of twists and turns.  Brace yourself.
Ever get the feeling you're being watched?
"Seriously though, all joking aside, the man has a double digit IQ."
I eat alpha males for breakfast. Chew 'em up and spit 'em out.
&lt;-------- Nasty woman and proud of it.
Donald is not pro America. Donald is pro Donald.
Lies. Donald Trump. All lies.
"Donald Trump, take that silver spoon you were born with out of your mouth and stick it up your fucking ass."
Hillary Clinton for President. End of.
"Wake up, America. A vote for Donald Trump is a giant step backwards."
He's not answering any of the motherfucking questions. THE MAN IS AN IDIOT!
"I can't even watch this clown show anymore. @realDonaldTrump, you come across like a 5 year old having a tantrum with a vocabulary to match."
"There are lovely people in life. Supportive, selfless and real. You just have to dig to find them.  Deep."
"Your confusion is what led to our misunderstanding. Hopefully, you are clear in your direction now and don't waste anyone else's time."
"It's not validation, it's common fucking courtesy."
"Make sense, not war."
Go to sleep. I'm waiting for you.
"'Slowly sinking into a pit of darkness, scrambling for a hand to pull you out from it's depths. But no one listens.'"
"Until you've crawled into the darkest depths of my mind, you will never understand me."
It's scary what a smile can hide.
Where does one put all of this anger? I can no longer contain it.
When someone tells you to go to hell but it's fine because you own the place.
You can find me where the wild things are.
Left on the ashes to burn  again.
Ain't nothing but a mistake.
üíï Depeche Mode - Enjoy The Silence (best live version) Touring The Angel
"Not my monkeys, not my circus."
Debating with an idiot is a lesson in futility.
Your opinions are not as good as my facts.
"'[USA] will never be destroyed from the outside. If [they] falter and lose [their] freedoms, it will be because [they] destroyed themselves'"
That's right. Stay gone.
It would be worth the jail time to get you off my planet forever.
I don't remember your name.
The world around me disappears as the fog sets in.
"Baby, it's you."
You think you're in control. That's cute.
It all begins with endings.
There is something about him.
Black skies Silver clouds Gold moon
"Stop, please. My stomach hurts from laughing."
Do you hear that? That's the sound of nobody giving a shit.
He appeals to the ignorant because he speaks their language.
"Never explanation as to how, only accusation that it's happening."
I miss him and he doesn't even care.
Dream about me tonight.
I make my own storms as I am one.
Mother Nature's wrath.
I love stormy weather. Get out in it and feel the power.
Love me anyway.
I will always be a creature of the night.
You can grab my pussy when they pry it from my cold dead hands.
He opened the car door for me and I didn't know what to do with myself. Chivalry is not dead.
"Based upon my past experience with karma, she usually has her way."
I do not wish you anything bad in life. Only that someone treats you the exact way you treated me so that you might know what it feels like.
Dreaming of your skull  fractured.
*saws world in half*
I wake up to go back to sleep.
I am the dark and need to surround myself with the light in order to be seen.
You. Fuck off.
Are you?
"Shrink this, motherfucker."
Twit and run.
Do not reckon with this force.
Filled with hate.  What's your excuse?
"Everything for a reason. For instance, that fucker was put on this earth to make me even stronger."
"Thanks for fuelling my rage, asshole. Feels good."
It won't be pretty.
"Wait and see, motherfucker."
I'm going to be the one that fucks you up.
You are playing a very dangerous game.
Mutual attraction or gtfo.
Why the fuck would you want someone that didn't want you?
You gave me hope of something pure and then you shat on it.
I can tell what you're thinking before you even know yourself.
I don't need words to read you.
I'm fluent in kinesics so what the fuck am I doing here?
"I love you too, fucker."
"I'm an acquired taste too so acquire some taste, motherfucker."
"Yes, this. However, I've learned that the only person's acceptance I need, is my own."
"If somebody wants to walk out of your life, let them go."
"The stars got nothing on us, baby."
I seem to have an affinity for the words of people with B&amp;W or sepia toned Avis. The only exception appearing to be the colour red. Weird.
"Hey look, a shooting star!  *whacks you upside the head*"
General Tao and now my phone's all sticky.
Silence and the swastika.
I just made a grown man go down a kid's slide if you were wondering how my day is going.
Things are finally looking up and it's about fucking well time.
"I prefer to keep my edge, thanks."
Make my dreams come true. Die.
".. and for Christmas, I would like a block from you."
Allegiance to the pain.
Do you know those people who only talk to hear themselves speak? Mute them.
The moon again. We've got to stop meeting like this.
"Richness of life. Get on that, people.   via @youtube"
The fucking wine made me do it.  Red. Mmmmm.
"You know which candidate I prefer? Neither, now shut the fuck up."
I have a problem with people and the fact that they're breathing.
I will never stand behind any plan that makes the rich richer.
"'I can't show my face on Twitter. What if someone recognizes me.'  Get over yourself and stand behind your fucking words, coward."
That'll weed out the weak.
"Too much hiding, not enough disclosing."
"If you can't show your face when speaking to me, then don't fucking speak to me."
I'm no longer talking to those people who crop their pictures within an inch of their life.
You don't need to school me. I know the drill.
*articulates with a kiss*
"I'm a plothead not a pothead. Books, books and more books still."
"'Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds.'"
It's not my fault they didn't put me together right.
When every fucking word they say resonates. That.
"How's that working out for you, darling?"
He spends his days trying to convince himself that I don't exist and his nights trying to get me out of his head.
Life doesn't work like that.
Everything is not logical.
I'm going to scream.  I'm not going to stop.  Ever.
Do you know what's fucking aging me? Idiots. Idiots are fucking aging me.
Read a fucking book.
"I just can't, no.. I won't, deal with stupid."
Anyone with a functioning brain in their head knows what the deal is here.
Stop the insanity.
"Bang, bang. You're dead."
*go-go dances into your heart*
I like crushes. They sound painful.
What in the hell are you going to yack about after November 8th?
"Show me that you don't give a shit and I will show you that I'm far, far better at it."
I am the night.
"Whenever a door closes, hammer and nail that shit shut."
You have absolutely no clue who I really am.
We can only use clear garbage bags here. How in fuck am I going to get rid of the body parts now?
I only stalk one person at a time.  You're next.
A list of my own or gtfo.
You can put me on your bitch list.
Me and you and you and me.
Blood splatter and spray paint.
Red wine. There is no substitute.
I see the love in disguise.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
I see the truth in your lies.
"Mirror on the wall, here we are again."
"You're no badass. You're broken, just like me."
I have no clue how to love.
You're far from the usual.
Crooks keep crooking.
Moments that don't last forever.
"You take the sunshine, I'll take the rain."
My #mcm is you.  See what I did there?
"It's ok little lamb, I won't hurt you.  *heads to slaughter*"
"Just a little note to all the clowns out there trying to scare people. If I come across you with my car, I will run you over."
Today is World Mental Health Day.  Respect that shit.
"If you don't get my humour, then get the fuck off my page."
All of my boyfriends like to spend Thanksgiving with their wives.
The only way you're getting me out of your head is by shooting yourself in it.  *smiles*
You're trying to figure it out. I already know.
You know those people who always tweet about love and flowers and beauty? I'm the polar opposite of that because the world needs balance.
Do it.
"I don't know how you Americans do it. If I had access to a gun, shit would be going down differently."
My patience with this vile creature's idiocy is waning fast.
Look at the bright side. There's always assassination.
I want to take testosterone outside and blow it's fucking head off.
One blast from a motherfucking gun and all this goes away.
Are you sleeping?
His words reach down into the very core of who I am.
"Tell me why I put up with you again? Oh, that's right. I don't."
Be real or gtfo.
I could build a village  with all of my alcohol empties.
*bewitches you*
Screaming to get out.
Mentally elsewhere.
*shakes cobwebs off heart*
"Less talk, more do."
He's in my fucking head with the rest of the demons.
You are guilty of duplicity.
I could kill and I will.
"Show me what you got, you piece of shit."
"Slice them and dice them, the motherfuckers."
He is a personal affront to all women and I am a woman.
Release me.
It won't be long now.
Life as we know it ceases to exist.
I'm dying. You're watching.
Don't you know I'm loco?
"No, you tone down, motherfucker."
It knows my name.
The darkness is within me.
Blah blah blah. Go fuck yourself.
You don't get to pick who you're drawn to. You just are.
Would you like bludgeoning with your tea?
There is a war going on behind my eyes.
He speaks my language.
"I'm a 'heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker. Don't you mess around with me.'"
It doesn't matter which one of them wins. It's the same bullshit.
Drop the ego and just be real with me.
What's your excuse?
I'm trying to make a fucking man out of him.
"'Thieves, thieves and liars, murderers. Hypocrites and bastards."
Hey thanks for nothing.
Morals in the dust.
Two-faced bastards and syncophants.
No trust.
"Inside, outside, which side, you don't know."
"My side, your side, their side, we don't know."
Which side are they?
Which side of their mouth do you suppose that it came?
Which side of the grass is greener?
"You're like a great big fucking gun, just waiting to get squeezed."
"Breathe, forfeit erection."
Toxical injection.
Geriatric fuck-fest.
We still believe in lies.
"You're like a great big hit of acid, waiting to be taken.'  #Ministry"
I don't know my name.
"If you delete the DM conversation, did it ever really happen?"
Could you spew your optimism in the other direction please. You're making me retch.
Close your eyes.  I'm still there.
Got something to say? Shut up.
I don't play by the rules of the game.
GET OUT OF MY LIFE!!   via @youtube
"I'd say, go fuck a tree, but that poor fucking tree."
"From this point forward, the only people who will be getting my attention are those who are giving theirs to me.  Fertig. Schlu√ü."
Fountain of piss. Garden of bullshit.
You keep putting in those digs with that mouth of yours and I'll bury you my fucking self.
Poisoned tongue. Words of hurt.
The trees leaned in and whispered my name.
Tableaux vivants.
I'm trying to keep it together but there are moments when I'm completely losing my mind.
Save me from me.
I've been living a lie.
I'm so tired of being here.
Let there be wine.  Red.
I'm waiting for someone to surprise me.
"Throw some 'real', some 'truth' at them and see how fast and far they run."
People don't want to hear the truth.
He asked me how I was and I told him the truth instead of everyone's token answer of 'fine'.  I haven't heard from him since.
You are right where you need to be and so am I.
I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear. I'm going to tell you how it is.
"Dream of me in kaleidoscope, darling, for my colours are that vibrant and my soul that shattered."
I am an emotional creature. Of that there is no doubt.
There is only so much I'm willing to put up with and then it's nothing.
This must be what going mad feels like.
"I have neither the time, nor the inclination, for drama and games."
"To all of the black and white thinkers, there are a million different shades of grey."
I'm right here. Why can't you see me?
Pain is my lover. Suffering the only touch.
"If it makes you sleep easier making me the bad person, then go ahead and do it. Sweet dreams."
The pain is real. I expect it. It never disappoints.
Pain is power.
You keep your comfort. I thrive on pain.
"There is rage in me. I'm not sure exactly when it started, only that it's growing."
This is no place for cowards.  *points to self*
*sledgehammers your head*  Sadist here.
Attracted to the things that rip my heart out.  Masochist here.
When doing a crossword and the clue has your mind going in one direction and you have to change your thinking in order get the answer. That.
I do take chances as long as they're 100% sure to work out.
"Alone again, but it's ok.  That's the way I like it."
Meet me in your depths.
Close your eyes and look at me.
I hide amongst you.
No one can see me.
"Dark, angry clouds forever enshroud me."
I love weeping willows. They're so weepy  and willowy.
It takes very little to show someone you care and even less to show them you don't.
She says she's fine. But she's going insane.
She says she feels good. But she's in a lot of pain.
She says it's nothing. But it's really a lot.
She says she's okay. But really she's not.
"I unfollowed a bunch who never interact. When that number hits zero, I'm out of here."
"Life goes on, and so do we."
I am a sad little petal.
"I met someone wonderful, but he didn't think I was wonderful back."
You were a disappointment. A bitter disappointment. I don't know why I'm so surprised as most people are. I just thought you were different.
"If you need me, I'll be over here stuck in the eighties and loving it."
Revolving doors and interchangeable people.
"Do you see my pinned tweet? Heed that shit, motherfucker."
Your bitch blocked me.  Such a travesty.
And all I'll remember of you is your back as it turned on me.
"If you don't like it, close your eyes."
It is your fault.
I blame you.
"Keep your dick in your pants, Romeo."
Blocked again and always by the girls you retweet a lot. Makes me wonder what exactly it is you're playing at.
What the fuck is going on here?
"I don't care if you have a 'Baby on Board' sticker on your car, especially if you're driving in the fast lane. Fuck you and your infant."
'Cause a little trouble. It‚Äôs good for you.'
What did you just not say to me?
You are just another deserter to me.
"Don't cut yourself on my broken, darling."
You leave. The mask stays.
I could make your head explode with one sentence.
People are fools. They bloody deserve what they get.
"Piece by piece, motherfucker.  Break yourself.  You can't break me."
I like to rattle people. Wake up!
Gen X ftw.
I like your story. Tell me more.
"Porn on your feed equals immediate block, you disrespectful fuck not getting any."
I want to whisper something in your ear.
I want to play a little game called 'cut you open and see what's inside.'
Everyone I have ever known (outside of family) has turned their back on me. Why the fuck would you be any different?
"If I like you, consider yourself special because I don't like anybody."
I just don't put up with bullshit of any kind.
#mcm @PrideofGypsies
How many times do you masticate?
I sleep with a knife under my bed. Don't fuck with me.
"Go and shit your rainbows somewhere else, fucker. We're all stocked up here."
"My stomach just growled. Time to feed. Come here, baby."
It's a conspiracy to make me lose my shit.
Every light red. Every fucking one.
You've just renewed my faith in assholes.
Damage and dynamite.
Poison and proud.
"Darling, you pack a pretty punch."
"That's not intensity, sweetheart. That's honesty."
"Green means GO, motherfucker."
"I'm always right, except when I'm not."
I need to escape myself.
These walls keep me inside.
This weekend was far too short. I demand a recount.
Sad little 'ole me just keeps on truckin' along.
"I'm here for connection. Unfortunately for me, most people are here to hide."
I just want to break the rules.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
My childhood was fine. It's my adulthood that's sucking shit in a major way.
"You people are just so nice, except for you. You're a fucking bastard."
Going into sleep mode.
No challengers here.
Are you even trying?
*pops cherry into mouth*  *ties stem into a knot with tongue*  *gives you a kiss*  *does the same with your tongue so you shut the fuck up*
"We don't run in the same circles. I like to surround myself with intellectuals and you, well, you just do you, dear."
Hillary Donald Hillary Donald Hillary Donald   Can we not go one motherfucking day without hearing either of these names? One fucking day.
"Give me love, you bastard."
In my dreams you're dead.
"Don't harsh my mellow, fucker."
I'm murdering you while you sleep.
I'm taking a walk through the forest.
I'm picking wildflowers in the meadow.
I'm building sandcastles by the shore.
Vodka. There is no substitute.
Why do I @ people?  Because clearly I don't give a fuck.
Do you know how when you sleep funny and wake up with that kink in your neck? Well I have that and I've named it after you.
There is no accountability.
"""I don't owe her anything."" ""I don't owe him anything.""  seems to be the selfish mantra many are adopting lately."
Breaks your heart then disappears. Who does that?  Many. Many people do that.
I'd hit that  with a motherfucking bat.
I just want to die laughing.
Feigned possessiveness brings all the boys to my yard.
&lt;--------Territorial bitch.
Pay attention to me or you won't live to see your next birthday.
"Can't break something that's already broken, lover."
I just want to crawl into that black hole and sleep forever.
Abandonment and annihilation.
Misrepresentations and murder.
Clich√©s and catastrophes.
I wish........
It's a mess up there.  *points to head*
You don't want to know what's going on inside my head.
I want to tie a balloon to your face and pop it.
You've run out of lies.
"No one begrudges you a nice life, only that you stay out of mine while having one."
"Running, running as fast as I can. Do you think I'll make it?"
Nothing. I feel nothing. The sweet escape of nothing.
"Baby, bye bye bye."
"Sweetheart, I don't live my life by your rules."
"Uh-oh, I think she's mad I'm retweeting you.  *laughs forever*"
"If you pay attention, you can see the pair dances happening here."
"If I get comfortable with a pillow and a blanket, it doesn't matter what time of day it is, I will fall asleep."
This one is horny. That one is an idiot. This one is lovestruck. That one needs to die and I have a fucking toothache.
Your signal is coming in loud and clear. Everything else is static in my ear.
Give me all of your clever. I like clever.
You don't want to be my friend? Fine. Fuck you.
"Behind the masks, we suffer."
"Teddy bear in one hand, knife in the other."
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.
Nothing feels real anymore.
Dreaming of your face and my fist again.
'Once upon a time there was a happy little girl..  then she grew up and turned into a monster.'
Don't bring me a rose. Bring me a dandelion so that I can make a wish.
'You're probably wondering what the fuck just happened. I did. I happened.'
I have never initiated DM with anyone because I'm not a desperate whore.
I think you might be a gigolo but without the getting paid part.
You can't trust anyone in this shithole.
Can't. Laughing too fucking hard.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
Beautiful broken soul. I'm listening.
I would like to punch that smug self righteousness right off of your face.
Why let the facts get in the way of having your opinion.
The sweet ones you just want to throw your arms around. The assholes you just want to butcher.
Tell me what scent you wear so I can buy it and spritz it on my pillow.
I love stormy weather.
All that excitement and no fucking tornado.
Cartoon sky. Storm's coming.
"I was not put on this planet for your entertainment, fucker."
It's Saturday. All of the (so called) Twitter elite are out grocery shopping with their spouses.
Write me some poetry so I know it's real.
There will be blood. Yours.
Love me anyway.
I can hear my own torment echoing around my head and ricocheting out of control.
Respect the broken in others.
"The deeper you feel things, the less they start to affect you."
"It's ok, I know the drill."
Go and hold her hand while you leave me to drown again.
My heart is hungry for you.
I am dysphoria.
Too many stiff necks and starched collars in this world.
Too much heart and not enough soul.
Really feeling that gravity today.
*accepts you for who you are*  *mutes*
The world can be such a lonely place yet so many people.
He saw the monster in me and deemed I was not worth the battle.
I want to scream out loud at the top of my lungs to mirror what is happening inside of me.
I'm tired of having to tone myself down for all of those delicate souls that can't handle my truth.
I woke up with blood in my mouth and you in my head.
"If I like you, I tell you. If you run, oh well, I said what I needed to."
"He taught me to keep it light and simple here which is, unfortunately, the very *opposite of who I am.  *dark and complex"
"Oh relax. If I was stalking you, I'd make sure you knew it.  PS: I'm stalking you."
"I like the people who make me grin, smile and laugh the very best."
Fireflowers grow in the middle of hell.
Let's reset the world.
Curiosity will not kill this cat.
A bastard with bandwidth.
Lost a lot of followers recently.   Good.
and the vultures circle overhead.
See him run. Watch him run  away.
Your words are delicious.
Remove yourself from my sight.
"He's your husband, boyfriend, lover? Doesn't fucking matter. I'm going to like and RT him. This is Twitter not the fucking Love Connection."
Can't. Chasing fucking fairytales.
"If anything I say or post here offends or upsets you, please head to the nearest exit and get the fuck out of my life. Thank you."
I have to step outside.  *adjusts mask*
I live in the shadows.
I'm trying to find the light and follow it.
I'm officially off the rails.
Murder by madness.
Behave yourself or I will kill you.
You may not have your cake and eat me too.
I'm working on a headache with your name on it.
"If you can hear me, then speak now or forever hold your fucking tongue."
"Yes, I know. I feel it too."
Do not trick yourself into mediocrity.
Those who know you're going through a rough time but stick by you anyway? Gold.
Do not try to resolve inner maladies with external stimuli or you will end up disappointed.
The glistening spectacle of the so called perfect life that so many try to project does not nourish me in any real way.
Do not engage me unless you're ready to play.
"I have the best father on the planet ergo zero daddy issues, so you can take that condescending attitude of yours and stick it up your ass."
His words. It's like he reached down deep inside of me and communicated exactly what I wanted to say. His fucking words.
"Anyone can turn on you and they do, the bastards."
I'm afraid of myself.
"If you think that you're better than anyone else on the planet, then I'm here to tell you that you're not."
"No one here needs or wants your pity, you presumptuous fuck."
You make everything okayer.
Have your monster call mine.
All of my glass slippers are broken.
See the dark inside of me.
Give me some of that.
I will retweet the shit out of you. Idgaf.
I care too much and then I don't care at all.
It's cool. I didn't expect you to understand me.
I can make a man run away like his ass is on fire. Get on my level.
"Let's move on, shall we?"
That's it. That's all I have to say on the matter.
It's ok. It's going to be ok. It's always been ok.
I would have given him everything I am.
Hold my hand.
"Entertain me, fucker."
"Many years ago, we had this cool thing that was much like a computer: it was called a brain."
Never to hear everything I didn't say.
She knew it was destroying her but she did it anyway.
You will be the last dream I have.
"Who, me? I'm not flirting, I'm just being friendly.  *grins forever*"
"Driving in farm country. The air thick with the smell of manure, no AC in the car and 35 degrees out. Fuck me."
Wind moving through anything is beautiful to watch.
"While you may have warm feelings towards someone, their situation might leave you feeling cold."
"A good star-banging by @angrymemorys always perks me right up. Was it good for you, lover? ;) *lights cigarette*"
The *ride was exciting at first. Lots of twists and turns and ups and downs. Now it's over and I'm left feeling dizzy and nauseous.  *you
I'm off to dream.
Bird's-eye view of your heart.
"I'm on the stronger side of crazy, the weaker side of sane."
A is for what?
Shhh.. don't spoil it by speaking.
Bring me your dreams.
Unleash the mind and set it free.
"Would it be such a horrible thing to jump? Freedom, if only for a moment."
I'm a very tired girl.
Mental anguish mixed with physical ailments.
"Peace, yes. That's what I want."
I miss where I've been. I miss what I've seen.
It's all locked up now. Tighter than the ass of a straight man going to jail.
It would appear I have some catching up to do.
"I don't like what I become sometimes. I'd say 'who', but clearly it isn't human."
What am I going to do with me?
I need to get out of my head.
The poison is me. I am the poison.
There is still one syringing that we may notice - that of suppurating people.
That door slammed itself shut.
I had the strangest dream last night.
I protect my heart ferociously. It would appear that I am right to do so.
This place is fucked up.
He's fucking yummy.
"Movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches."
Stuck in a world of misunderstanding.
People. Why do we like the ones we do? Why do we dislike the ones we do? Who the fuck knows?
Ask me a question and I will answer as honestly as I can.
She's lovely but she's not me is she?
"The louder you are, the less you are heard. Whisper."
*stains your soul with the essence of me*
So adorable the way you think you're just going to forget about me.
"I'm not sure, but I think I scare the shit out of him."
There's reclusive and then there's just plain rude.
"If you were the last one who reached out (receiving nothing back), you can walk away (conscience clear), knowing you tried your very best."
Today is a good day. Don't ruin it by talking to me.
I make myself laugh *sometimes.  *often
"Aw. She's your biggest fan. Make sure you don't end up in some cabin in the woods with your legs all busted up, ya hear?"
I prefer everything night.
People are being so nice to me today. Who the fuck died?
Give me real or don't give me a thing.
"It's a good thing I'm Canadian. Easy access to guns, for me, would not bode well for the population."
I feel so violated. Do it again.
I need to live on a remote island somewhere. No people.
So *sorry I don't fit inside that motherfucking box of yours.  *not sorry
"I need some weather that doesn't compel me to rip all of my clothes off. Wait, what?"
See you in your dreams.
All you can do is laugh at the utter absurdity of it all.
"We don't know what the fuck we want. We get it, we don't want it. We have it, we no longer need it."
"He feeds into idealism like a man starved, insisting the whole time that he is a realist."
You have dropped all of your lies on the floor and don't have a bag big enough to pick them all up.
Your youth is showing.
*makes out with your mind*
You will find me in that place between asleep and awake.
Show me your fire.
Kaleidoscope girl in a black and white world.
Explosions and expletives.
I want to blow you  up.
Don't mess with me boys. I collect trophies   like your fucking head in a jar.
Great balls (on) fire is what yours are going to be if that last fucking tweet of yours was in reference to me.
Give me kisses and chaos.
Give me magic and mayhem.
Give me candy and catastrophe.
Give me roses and a riot.
Give me candlelight and kerosene.
"Loses heart, loses mind."
I adore pretty things and the words fuck off.
Dreaming about murder  and your face.
"Grace, Too üíï"
"Ok, fuck that last one was hard to watch."
Sometimes I shake my own head at the things I do.
It's clear to me now that I'm going straight to hell.
It would be so easy to just let go.
"Losing your mind is much harder on the people who love you than it is on you, ergo my fight and struggle is more for them than it is for me."
Sleep is my only true escape.
I'll never be well. This is always going to be with me.
You can't blame someone for picking healthy when you're the disease.
It's in these moments that I realize how truly broken I am.
Screw the algorithms.
I'm a tired petal.
She will tell you what you want to hear. I will tell you what you need to hear.
The inexplicable is the most intriguing.
I have my music to protect me.
She will take them all down.
Beautiful soul in a very ugly world.
My list has some of the best damn tweeters in the free world.
"The older I get, the less I give a fuck."
I am not for the weak-minded.
Why would I change now?
My truth can be offensive.
"You with your games, I will not reach out again."
"You give me nothing and I, in return, offer you the same."
There is a block button at your disposal.
I'm not your fucking fantasy. I'm not your fucking secret. I am a real person and you will respect and treat me as such.
"To all the people out there who think their kids are adorable, they're not."
"Aw, your ears too delicate to hear what I have to say? Unfollow now, it's only going to get worse."
I'm into truth. I'm into fair.
You remind me of the girl who cries rape when she full well knows she fucking consented.
Grow a pair. She has.
"Sick of men always running to the aid of ladies crying wolf here. That doesn't make you a man, it makes you a fucking patsy."
"Ladies, quit calling SOS and deal with your own shit, weak fucks."
Sadistic tendencies.
I like the people who make my cheeks hurt from smiling.
Dirty walls holding sacred truths.
"Clever, clever people. Where will life take you?"
"The person who ""fucked off"" me today could be the same person whose tweets I'm favouriting. Isn't that a hoot and a half?"
Some people just stand out.
I just got told to fuck off while driving and I rather enjoyed it.  ps I started it.
I thank you for putting up with this troubled soul. üíï
Highs and lows Peaks and valleys Such is life.
"Goodnight, my lovelies. xx"
"If they like someone else, let them. Know your worth. üíï"
"You must have the negative to recognize and appreciate the positive. Otherwise, we're all just lobotomized individuals living in wonderland."
I can't deal with weak. I need strong.
"You don't kill me or keep me alive, but you disappoint me. Fuck, do you ever disappoint me."
You don't follow Pat Benatar with the motherfucking Bangles. Ever.
It's not stalking if I'm fucking adorable.
"I have no problem with people @-ing me, but make it clever, make me think or at the very least, make it grammatically correct."
Stormy weather today. I'm in my element.
"Shiny, happy people can go fuck themselves."
I wasn't ready for life. I need a do over.
"I once thought I might be bipolar, but there ain't no highs in this bitch."
I think my head just fell asleep but I'm awake.
There is water falling from the sky.
*wakes up*  *goes back to sleep*
"One woman's ""He can do no wrong."" is another woman's ""Get the fuck out of my face."""
'How can I say this without breaking?
How can I say this without taking over?
How can I put it down into words?
It's almost too much for my soul alone.
I don't want them to know the secrets.
I don't want them to know the way I loved you.
I don't think they'd understand it.
I don't think they would accept me.
Dreams fight with machines.
Inside my head like adversaries.
Come wrestle me free.
Clean from the war.
Your heart fits like a key into the lock on the wall.
I can't escape.
I turn it over.
I loved and I loved and I lost you.
And it hurts like hell.' #Fleurie
"If you can't like, retweet or dm me because your TC would get angry, then give her a huge thank you from me for weeding out the weak."
"I think I need to be put down, an end to this misery."
He was 'like an amateur magician and everyone could see the trapdoor but me.'
Can I keep you?
Close your eyes.  *steals your soul*
Waiting for time to elude and disappear.
Home is yesterday.
I've created a monster. Where the fuck is my gold star?
I'm into reciprocal.
Goddamn romper room.
"Twitter is turning too much into, ""She likes him, he doesn't like her. He likes her, she doesn't like him."" Motherfucking stop it."
How a person behaves towards me is a direct reflection of how they will get treated by me.
I have a problem with people. I don't like them.
I am a street that has no name.
"'I reveal myself in layers. If I deem you worthy, I peel. Slowly. I watch your reaction. One small flinch and I seal.'"
Show me your broken wings and I'll show you mine.
He leaves but he's still here with me.
My favourite colour is wild.
Is that your chick?  *laughs forever*
I hear you.
He's a sweetheart and he doesn't even fucking know it.
"One day, I will meet my match."
I'm sad for you. I'm sad for me. I'm sad for an 'us' that will never be.
"Decision made. Dangle that carrot elsewhere, fucker."
Ridiculous behaviour and I've put up with it long enough.
I'm not up for your shenanigans and tomfoolery.
"If what they tell you is the opposite of how they treat you, run like hell in the opposite direction and don't look back."
I like things I can count on.  Example: Not you.
My soul is black and I've got a heart to match.
Never said I was a nice person.
What a horrendous name. Suits you though.
"Fuck, I'm being naughty again."
I don't pick the broken ones. The broken ones pick me.
It ends before it even begins.
"You sound like a bitter, angry fuck. The seat next to me is free."
*screams forever*
Maybe in my nightmares I'll find you.
There's a tornado inside my head.
"Rain, rain, come again."
Adventure with me.
Generation X - Kiss Me Deadly
I am not 'too' anything. You are simply not enough.
"I am rope, hanging myself through your loops."
"My child on Trump:  ""Wouldn't it be ironic if he won with all his pro gun shit and then somebody shot him?""  Makes a mother proud."
Self-righteous piece of shit.
"Vegans, how the fuck do you know a leaf does not scream when you rip it off a branch or lettuce doesn't howl as it's plucked from the earth?"
Understand? There's nothing to understand. He threw it all away because he didn't give enough of a shit about me. Period. The end.
Like them for who they are. Learn what it is they have to teach you.
"I never understood the whole ""chokefuck"" intrigue. Put your fucking hand on my throat and I will end your life."
"Annoyed? Yes, I'm annoyed. I don't have the stupidity of youth on my side."
"That one, over there, has absolutely no fucking self respect. She's perfect for you."
You could shit in that one's mouth and she'd call it pudding.
I've never had the group(ie) mentality. I prefer to stand (out) alone.
Fly me to the moon and leave me there.
"I like that wide-eyed, stunned stare of horror they give me when they realize they're dealing with crazy."
Kiss me deadly tonight.
Dont let me into your heart.
It's a good day to start again.
I like sweet men with an edge.
Here's to the black sheep and all who follow her.
"A little decorum is never wasted on me, fuckwit."
I don't want anyone else to be sad. I'm sad enough for the whole world.
Some words just resonate.
You're on my radar. Beware.
"Oh darling, go buy a heart and give it to me."
"I'm not sure but I think my credit card just went ""ouch""."
I'm sitting in my car when a huge green bug decides to join me so now I have to fucking walk home.
"What happens in DM, stays in DM."
*looks at you like a loaded weapon*
People laying ownership on others here like we come with some sort of fucking price tag.
Does your TC know that you're reading other people?
You'd be worth the destruction.
"Whatever you verbally spew out here about your prowess in the bedroom, the opposite is true."
I want your sweetness.
What about us?
I don't want your man.
People here and their games are so fucking high school.
"Well, sweetheart, if I'm not worth it then you can just unfollow and fuck off."
Flirty McFlirts A Lot is getting shit from me unless it's me he's flirting with.
I've got a crush on you.
Come to me.
You're cool.
"You, over there, fuck off."
See that you keep to your word.
Careful now. Your passive-aggressive is showing.
"I don't blame you, I would probably pick the easy too."
Definition of love?  Feeding your child before feeding yourself because there's a deadbeat in the picture and you can't afford to do both.
Look at you go with everything all figured out. I'm here to fuck up your plans.
"I am cynical, quizzical, skeptical,  territorial,  maniacal, emotional, confrontational,  Do you really need that shit in your life?"
"When someone tells you that they're not a good person, you must believe them."
I'm sitting here telling you that my motivations are not pure and you are sitting there staring at me not believing a word I say.
I could sleep forever.
No.
I'm not allowed to kill myself. My father will not let me.
&lt;-------- Beautifully out of place. Like seeing the moon during the day.
"""Yo, baby! Lookin' good, baby!"" *ignores* ""Yo, bitch!""  Ain't that just like some men? Don't get what they want so they turn septic quick."
"I'm a 'look at the sky, look at the moon, look at the sunset, stay in the car and listen to the rest of the song' type of person."
'My senses awaken
At midnight
The darkness beckons
I love the night
Whispering to me
I am of the night
We speak the same language
That of unloved creatures
In search of the light' #LW
Yes. I am absolutely the jealous type.
Why don't you try a little tenderness?
Some people will only love you as long as you fit into their box. Shove that box up their ass on your way out.
Tattoo my name across your forehead so I know it's real.
Murderer of feelings.
We've got a murderer in these streets and she looks just like me.
Wondering when the people with the cameras are going to jump out of the bushes telling me that my whole life has been a fucking joke.
The soul knows what it wants. Shhh.. quiet the mind.
"When you're the fire, they can't burn you."
Say rude things on the Twitter and then run away like the coward you are because your momma didn't teach you any better.
Always carry a knife with you just in case you meet someone who needs to be stabbed.
*steps on toes*
Your heart. My knife.
'Wait'll they get a load of me.'
Come closer. Let me get my crazy on you.
I've been a little bit too nice for a little bit too long.
Let's watch this motherfucker implode into itself.
I've seen you. I know who you are now. You hide behind your 2 fantasy accounts with your fancy words but the real life deal is drab as fuck.
Meh. That's all the answer I need. Thanks for coming out.
"You can't throw me to the wolves, bitch. Those motherfuckers come when I call."
"I get it men that go for plain janes,  easy catch, avoidance of ego clashes, no living underneath anyone's shadow, no competition.  *yawns*"
Has everyone gone off the fucking deep end tonight or what?
I just wanted a friend and you couldn't even give me that.
The Devil made me do it.
When he shows you things no one else gets to see. That.
I believe in the ocean.
Who has your vote?
"Nothing violent. You just close your eyes, fall asleep and never wake up."
Anyone else wish that their heart would stop beating or is it just me?
"In this perpetual state of melancholy, your presence comforts me."
'People are forever finding something wrong with you.'
"'Birds flying high, you know how I feel.'"
Acceptance is a small and quiet room.
Think twice before you give a fuck.
Do you know where your sanity is?
I live to see another day. Joy.
"Woof woof, motherfucker."
Few see it. Some refuse to acknowledge it. Others simply run off with their tails between their legs.
You are very wise to protect yourself around me.
I am a nocturnal beast. The sunlight hurts my eyes. Get me within 100 metres of a church and I most certainly will hiss and snarl.
The latch on the trunk of my car broke today and refuses to shut. How in fuck am I supposed to transport the bodies now?
And amongst all the fool's gold you find yourself something precious.
"No one begrudges you your one true love on the internet, only that you don't engage with others in the same capacity in the interim. Capiche"
"Sweet little dove, you don't know what the fuck you're doing either."
He tried to discard me but he'll only end up losing himself.
I know that I have issues but you're pretty fucked up too.
I don't like what I'm seeing here.
"If there is anyway you could just fuck off my planet, I'd be most indebted to you."
Some of you need a hammer to the head and I'd be most happy to oblige.
"The idiocy, the asininity, the hypocrisy, the deception, the dishonesty, the deceitfulness, the senselessness of it all."
"If you feel the need to edit your words here, then get the fuck off twitter. There's enough of that bullshit going on in real life."
Don't you ever wish that the fuckers would just block you so you didn't always have to play bad cop?
"I always get the whole story. I don't want the whole story. Sometimes I, too, would prefer to be blissfully unaware."
I've been very bad today and not in the naughty cute way either.
I could never be with a vegan. I love me a good medium rare steak way too much to be breaking bread with a grain feeder.
I am one drink away from telling you what I really fucking think.
"""A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons."" -Hillary Clinton"
"I'm Canadian but if Trump gets president, I'm moving to Timbukfuck because I can't live next to stupid."
It's raining. I fucking love the rain. Pour down on me. Make me wet. Cleanse this soul.
Twitter ladies always claiming they will 'do you better'. I'm busy over here just trying to keep my damn self afloat.
"Change is good. From caterpillar to butterfly so you, my friend can metamorphisize yourself into something beautiful."
By all means go after the young and vibrant but leave us emotionally damaged the fuck alone.
From intrigue to disgust in t-minus 10.
I think way more than I speak and I have a big fucking mouth.
'I like my lovers selfish. Do you know how sexy it is when someone only wants you?'
Tarnished.
You can call me Gandhi.
"Whenever he says, ""You are something else."", I grin devilishly, just like the Grinch."
"Look for me. Out the window tonight. I'll be there. Waist length wild, dark tresses, pale flowing white dress. Haunting your very existence."
"Nowhere Girl, that's me."
*looks you in the eye*
I take special joy unfollowing those who have unfollowed me. Bye bye fool.
"I'll drink to that.  *me, anytime."
"Cheers to the freaking weekend..  Fuck, it's only Tuesday."

Idealism is a fucking disease.
Get your motherfucking head out of the sand.
The abyss has long since swallowed me. I'm just swimming around in it's darkness.
You sound twelve. Are there no age limitations here?
"Oh flower, passion, while lovely, is not all you need to succeed in life. Hard work, people backing you, timing, $$$ and a whole lotta luck."
*dances inside your eyes*
Show me a smile.
I will kiss you when it's dangerous.
"""I want to sleep holding you.""  ??  Fuck that shit, I'll kick you off the motherfucking bed."
Almost burned the house down cooking. Get at me boys.
"I just saw a gif lady shit out two eggs and some chicken salad. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and wash my eyes out  with bleach."
I love when I scare followers off with one tweet. Weeds out the weak.
"Show me your biceps so I know it's real. Also, I have a thing for arms."
One match is all I need.
Even you. Yes you. Especially you.
"You want it, I got it. You need it, I have it."
*says it like it is*
"You take the sunshine, I'll take the rain."
I just want to be left alone.
"The nastier the weather, the calmer I become."
"If your tl is one long feed of retweets and ramblings for the one you love, you can pretty much take it to the bank that your ass is muted."
If you're happy and you know it stay the fuck away from me.
"I don't want logical, I want impossible."
STOP THE INSANITY!!!
"Let's get one fucking thing straight here, I'm the demanding one, not you."
People throwing the word 'Respect' around like they have the slightest iota of an inkling as to the true definition of the word.
It's a beautiful day to leave me the fuck alone.
*falls off chair in laughter*
The lake holds many secrets. You could become one of those secrets if you piss off the right person.
I'm at the river bottom. There are some pools of blood. Your blood because I've bashed your skull in with a stone.

"Happy ever after is a fallacy. Give me excitement, exploration and education ever after."
It is true I have never married. I never had time to fool with it.
I'm at the lake so I'm going to jump in it.
I'm all tweeted out and tuckered tonight.
Don't steal her youth.
Be real with me or gtfo.
I hope they have deep philosophical conversations because this shallow display of mutual admiration society is cavity inducing at best.
She caters to his ego and he laps it up for he is parched bones in the desert sun dying for a storm to come.
Poor little flower. Plucked for it's beauty. Put in a glass vase for display. Then left to wither and die.
You won't listen. I didn't listen either. One must go through it to understand.
"I had hopes and dreams too, but life cured me of all that nonsense."
"Then just like that, a new star emerges and you just can't help but to bask in it's glow."
You precious little flower. Life's not going to go your way. You'll see.
Come to my window and say it to me with a boombox so I know it's real.
"If you can't take a joke, get the fuck off my page."
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Hate me because I'm smart too  and humble.
By all means stick yet another stuffed animal at your car's back window. They'll look fucking adorable flying in the air when you crash.
He has a way with words and I'm in love with the dictionary.
Unsolicited dick pic in my inbox this morning. Am I forwarding to his wife or nah?
"Sadly, there were some casualties in the latest mood battle that is me, but the real troopers stayed by my side. Those brave fucking souls."
"Some people just exude class and grace and the rest of us should pay attention, maybe learn something. I'm taking notes."
You ask for some of their time and they recoil like you've just dropped down on one knee and fucking proposed to them.
The fact that I haven't yet gone on a killing spree is proof of my infinite patience with the human condition.
Let them believe me. Let them wonder if I lie.
Pizza without cheese is just fucking blasphemy.
I felt like sharing. Thank you for listening.
Everything else pales in comparison to that time and those hands.
Don't talk to me about pain.
"Broken, shattered pieces of heart everywhere."
Heart fracturing like a kaleidoscope of burning colours.
Betrothed to another the whole time those hands presented those poems to me.
Those wonderful hands then ripping my heart out.
"This man and those poems, given so lovingly with those hands."
To Me. Love Him.
"No mistakes, only lessons."
"I just read a timeline so full of truth, sadness, grace and beauty that it actually brought *a tear to my eye.   *Ok, more than one."
My computer has frozen in this heat. The irony.
The Devil called. He wants his fucking weather back.
Such a pretty mess.
The night and I are old friends.
He makes me smile.
I've been teetering on the edge so long my balance is exemplary.
I enjoy smiling at people who don't like me.
I'm a sad girl. I'm a mad girl. I'm a bad girl.
"But hey, it takes one to know one."
"You're the cutest, most delusional excuse for a fuck up I've ever met."

"Your spelling is about as atrocious as hers. Clearly, you belong together."
"Downloaded audioBoom, so you might be hearing me soon as well as reading me. Ha! Hide your kids."
*takes the high road and flies away*
"From where I'm sitting, all I see is broken beauty."
I like to use my looks to communicate and by looks I mean the stare of death.
"When your integrity is questioned, do not explain yourself."
Full moon tonight. That explains it.
The power felt when listening to some music is unparalleled.
'Some story was told but what is there to tell?

"For me, time is not a healer, it's a ruiner."
I'm only flesh and blood and a little bit of charisma.
"I'm a bit of a popinjay, a magpie. I'm attracted by sparkly things. In a minute you'll look for your watch and find it's in my pocket."
Chalky bones go crack.
"Monarchy is quite nice. I like those shiny hats they wear. Also, I enjoy elaborate furniture. Thrones and whatnot."
"And that, my friends, is all I have to say about that."
True friendship comes without judgment.
I will miss you.
I was coming from a place of truth. He didn't see it that way.
"When you have nothing nice to say, sit on your hands."
I will turn it into something beautiful. It's what I do.
I can't stand hurtful people. Especially the ones that do it on purpose.
Wow. You can't be real with some people. They just turn it into something ugly.
"Attention whore, but from the right people."
"Whatever that thing is that makes killers cross the line, I think I have that."
"If that bitch downstairs slams that motherfucking door one more time, you'll be hearing about her in the news tonight."
My lover is not alcohol.  My lover is sleep.
"Just one coffee for me, please. One pot."
This weather can go and fuck itself.
"Even friendship needs nurturing. Especially friendship, actually."
A connection with me is certainly not for the faint of heart.
"Streams of people, equally as fucked up as myself. I have found a home here."
You vitriolic fuck. It's easy to say things hiding behind the veil of the internet that you would never have the balls to say face to face.
"Hands full, I just closed the fridge door with my foot and turned off the light with my chin because I'm badass like that."
"*Sometimes, I make decisions based on my emotions. Forgive me for being human.  *At all times"
I just killed a centipede and now I'm going to have to burn the motherfucking house down.

"Don't torture yourself, dear. That's my job."
"I'd love to follow you back, French man, but you don't speak my language. Je m'excuse."
"I'm only interested in people who are consistent, respectful and loyal."
I'm magic. Ignore me long enough and I disappear.

All you can do is laugh my loves. Life (and people) are just sometimes that pathetic.
"When your soul is as dark as mine, you attempt to go where the light shines."

'Real Eyes Realize Real lies'  YES.

"""Act my age? What the fuck is that? What do I care how old I am? The Ocean is old as fuck. It will still drown your ass with vigor."""

For all that tried to be but never was.
"Tired of all the lies. Tired of all the confusion, the backstabbing and the mind games. Twitter, my love, perhaps it's time for us to part."
There is no pure in this world.

"Guy gets caught on #cheaters with the babysitter in the car. Apparently, he was just trying to help her find a contact lens  with his dick."
"Oh, how you boys do make me titter."

I detest cheap sentiment.
The worst kind of people are the ones with the sticks up their asses. You know the ones I mean.

People pleasing is soul crushing.

Le fuck de off.
They will treat you exactly the way you let them.
Married men who want to stay alive? Keep your distance.
"If your marriage is bone-less, do NOT come sniffing after me."
Loyalty is not a grey area. It's black and white. You either have someone's loyalty or you don't. She has your loyalty ergo I do not.

I am completely alone in this world.
If you do everything right and jump through all the hoops you'll eventually become a basketball.

Love and other cancers.
Every single person I am is tired.
Grow a pair.
"You are a walking, talking factual discrepancy. AKA: a motherfucking liar."
There are some sick fucks on this planet.
Beastiality is not ok. Did the animal give their consent you sick fucking piece of shit? and why am I seeing this crap on twitter?
You're looking far too comfortable over there.  *stirs the pot*
Cause of death: Sarcasm
That little voice in my head whispers truth in my ear.
We can call you Inspector Audrey Mayer.
*watching Tour de France*  Mother: I love it when they go uphill. Me: That's because you're a sadist.  Now I know where I get it from.
"Pretty is everywhere, papi.  Interesting is harder to find."
I want your head  on a platter.
You sure do have a lot of rape scenarios on your feed. Might you perchance have the tiniest dick on the planet?
I'm worried about myself.
"I'm an Agnostic with a hint of Atheist raised Roman Catholic. Figure that one out, fucker."
Where do you go after you die? The same place you were before you were born.

What we appear to have here is a glorified motherfucking romper room.
Poisonous people. Toxic treatment.
There are too many undercurrents at play here. They will drag you down and have their way with you. I just want to ride the waves.
Have you met yourself yet?
"Say one thing, do another so I know it's real."
Or someone you've blocked.
"Every time I see that annoying little twit show up on your feed, I lose a little more respect for you."
A man walked on the moon yet I can't keep my anger in check.
My temper breaks computers. Apparently.
"Once they think they have your light, they discard you. Not realizing that when you go, that light goes with you."
Do you ever feel like some people are just trying to steal your light?
Too many disappointments have me not believing in anyone.
"I've taught you all that I can, grasshopper.  Now fuck off."
I know I'm a nightmare.
Tell me about your dreams.
"Always thunder and lightning in my head, never a sunny day."
What's wrong with me?  Where the fuck do I even start.
Unless I'm stalking the shit out of you. Then you won't.

I could live in a library and never be bored.

"Another day, another murder."
"*takes off rose-coloured glasses*  Oh, would you look at that, you're an idiot!"
How much bull could a bullshitter shit if a bullshitter could shit bulls?
Ask your doctor if shutting the fuck up is right for you.
Illegitimi non carborundum
Is it still considered murder if they can't find the body?
Good night and fuck you.
I'm tired of people not living up to my expectations and fuck anyone who thinks I'm lowering them.
"You think there's connection there, even if just a friendship, and then you realize there isn't."
"Not to worry, I will tire of you eventually just like I do every other person on the planet."
"You go about your day and you see people and you think to yourself, how many of these fuckers do I actually know on the Twitter?"
Your TC is the shit driver on the road you're flipping off. Don't romanticize it. These are real people here.
"The selfies are never as cute as the avi, except for me, I'm fucking adorable."
A sure thing bores the fuck out of me. I prefer a challenge.
It's not my fault all the cool people live in my phone.

"If you aren't a fan of animals, then I seriously question your ability to 'human'."
"You know, there is such a thing as being too nice. It's called being fake."
Enough with the courtesies already. Your feed is starting to read like one long ass thank you note.
I'm a face girl. Such a shame that so many of you hide yours here.
Shine your light into the darkest part of me.
Listening for the silence.
"You over there with the words, come here."
I would never share my TC with the masses. Bitches would then be on him like flies on shit. I know how certain women operate. Not happening.
I only take so much and then I don't.
My disposition can be as sunny warm as a tropical breeze or as icy cold as an Arctic gale. Choice is yours.
If I like you I'm compelled to knock the stupid right out of you.
"Hello, man in the corner. I'm tweeting!! I'm over here! Do you see me now?"
Talk to me in twenty years. I promise I won't say I told you so.
"Oh, you young delusional idealists, life WILL have it's way with you."

You are far too nice for the likes of me.
I'm looking for something that you can't give me because you've already given it to someone else.
Revolving doors to hell and back.
"'This is life's ultimate cruelty. It offers us a taste of youth and vitality, and then it makes us witness our own decay.'"
You think you know me.  You don't know shit.
Show me real or gtfo.
I die slowly. One painstaking day after another.
'There is a light and it never goes out.'
"'And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us, to die by your side well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine.'"
"'And if a double decker bus crashes into us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die.'"
There were times when I could have murdered you.
I care about the people who care about me. The rest can go and fuck themselves sideways.
"Understand one thing about me, if you don't give a fuck, then neither do I."
I'm a mirror. However you treat me is what will be reflected back.
Block me so I know it's real.
I'm starting to think you are not such a nice person. I don't like not so nice people.
"Every time a twitter couple gets too lovey dovey, I mute that shit. I don't need that kind of positivity in my life."

Prosecco'clock.
"If you don't know Jenny's phone number, then you are too young for me."

Kindly do me the honour of fucking off.
"My apologies, I don't speak stupid."
"If you're going to @ me, could you at least make some fucking sense. K, thanks."
"Sade, dis-moi, Sade, donnes-moi"
You severely underestimate my apathy.
"I don't wish to see tits or slits running down anyone's feed.  Clearly, you aren't getting any.  Blocked."
I'm going to watch a slasher film tonight and dream of you.
I'm going to kill them with kindness when I'd much rather use a machete.
Leave no stone unturned. That's where the fuckers hide.
I'm fucking FBI when I'm searching someone out.
"Baby, it's fucking hot outside."
It's not my fault that you're a foul fuck.
Nice to know that Twitter does eventually listen when you report the shit out of someone. Deleted both of your accounts too.   *giggles*
Help a bitch out by not being an asshole your entire life.
Life is all that shit that happens in between my naps.
"A catch-22 of card houses. You build them, they will fall."
Don't let us bother you. Carry on with your foreplay.
I will burn whatever gets in my fucking way.
I am fire personified.
I wear my anger like a little black dress.
You're fucking gone.  *waves bye-bye*
I'm sick of whores. I'm sick of testosterone. I'm sick of arrogance. I'm sick of stupidity. I'm sick of ignorance. I'm fucking sick of you.
"If I was a gun owner, you'd see the likes of mass murder that you've never before encountered."
"You have to work on your mind, not just your body, whore."
See through all the bullshit and they call you crazy.
"Go ahead and block me, show me how strong you are."
I'm so petty I will take you off of my list if you're a narcissistic piece of shit. I don't care how good your tweets are.
"It's not all about you, sunshine."
"Oh? You are the player and you over there are the coach? Pleased to meet you, I invented the motherfucking game."
'There's a breath inside my throat that I can't get to move right.
"There's a feeling in my stomach that I know is my soul, curled in a fetal position, silently wishing that I could just see the end."
I can't breathe.
Some days my heart bleeds and when I speak I feel my words bleed too.
Some days only pain is soothing. Only fear is living. Only hatred is power.
"Some days I dream, some I don't."
"Some days I feel, some I don't.' #BloodIsAColour"
An over-inflated ego?  I eat that shit for breakfast.
I have multiple accounts to go with my personalities.
Eskimo kiss.
Nose to nose.
Cheek to cheek.
Eye to eye.
"Kiss me, you fuck."
You.. break.. my.. heart.. but then again you break everyone's heart.
Tell me why I put up with you again? Oh that's right. I motherfucking don't.
Fundamental bastard.
Waste of space. Waste of time. Waste of everything.
Go fuck yourself and maybe your harem will follow suit.
I'm tired of being disappointed by shady ass people.
"Sad to know that others have gone through the same pain that you've endured, yet somehow comforting at the same time."
You read and you nod and you know.
The words have meaning because you have lived them yourself.
Some people's words just resonate.
"Unfortunately, humanity is losing it's ability to be human."
There comes a time when you need to make a little fucking noise.
"If you make fun of mental illness in any way, shape or form, then I wish it upon you as that's the worst punishment I can think of."
We need to bring back tarring and feathering.
Animal abuse of any kind makes me physically ill and violently angry.
If you don't want to read me then I'm going to make that possible.
Why do we connect with the people we do? What is it about them? What is it about us?
You miss them when they're not around. That's how you know you care.
I never was any good fighting for myself. But fuck with someone I love and I will go to hell and back for them.
"I'm sorry you felt the need to unfollow me, for whatever reason, but I always return the favour by way of a block. Nothing personal."
"He tweets about whatever the fuck tickles his fancy, but that one, in the corner over there, he tweets about me."
"Oh, my little lamb, if only it were that simple."
Love me dammit.
Save yourself.
The time? Half past dead.
I feel all you judgers out there. Fuck you.
Maybe it's the imbalance of chemicals in my head.
I'm at my most fucked up when I'm dreaming.
Can you help me unravel the mess that is me?
All you positive thinkers get in my head and figure it the fuck out.
You have to push those buttons. Get a reaction. Make people think. Extract them from their fugues.
I love pushing buttons. It's what I do.
Like everything I post so I know it's real.
So many people with their beautiful words and I'm just over here cursing like a trucker.
*dreams a little dream with you*
*kisses you in the moonlight*

"'You weren't just a star to me, you were my whole damn sky.'"
"June solstice full moon on June 20, 2016. It‚Äôs the Northern Hemisphere‚Äôs first summer solstice full moon since 1967, aka the Summer of Love."
*wrapped around your finger*
Hand in hand we'll watch the walls crumble down around us.
The poetic prose are lovely but I've always had a preference for real words that were to the point.
Close your eyes and tell me who I am.
Those people who know you're fucked up but stand by you anyway. That.
Different fairy tale. Same fucking wolf.
Breaks my heart.
The distance....  in your eyes.
Both my father and his brother were pilots. Imagine having that special skill and then having to give it up later in life.
Cold beer and warm conversation.
Bonfire and summer nights.
Birds singing in the forest trees.
Wind chimes and cool breezes.
"I don't begrudge any man the right to have a doting, loving female companion.  Only that he keep me the fuck out of  the equation."
I'd tell you what I really think but who has time for that?
Does 'flooding' work as a method of phobia/anxiety control?  Asking for me.

Fucking festival on my street tonight. Where's my gun?
You need sweet. I'm not sweet.
I will not change myself to make your life easier.
Some motherfucker is parked in my spot and got car paint all over my brand new key.
I can count on one hand the number of people I trust on this planet.

From childhood‚Äôs hour  I have not been as others were I have not seen as others saw EAP
"I agree with pretty much every word this man utters. Though he speaks of Jamaica, the sentiments are worldwide. imho"

That shadow in the trees.  That chill in the air. You can't see me but you know I'm there.
C'mere boo gimme kiss.  *smacks*
"Can't gaslight me, fucker."
Difference between my dad's snoring vs a chainsaw cutting? Not much.
I'm ready for my close-up.
"If you like your steak well-done, might I suggest saving yourself the money and just chewing on a pair of old leather shoes instead?"
Three strikes and you're out.  It's a good rule.
Where the fuck have all the flowers gone?
Deadbeat calls to wish daughter happy birthday  on the wrong fucking day.
It doesn't matter what you say. People are going to twist that shit around to suit themselves.
Lights out.
*quietly observes the Twitter people from the corner of this padded room*
I can't help the sarcasm. It pours out of me like rain from the sky.
Looks like all 10 of us are glad we found you. #TwitterLove
My problem is not that I don't care. My problem is that I care too much.
Anyone know of a good sinkhole?
I don't see anything. I don't hear anything. I don't say anything.
"I'm bursting all of your balloons, Mr. Trump."
Warning: Do not take these tweets personally. They are not about you. They are about me.
My butterflies all flew away and died.
"Don't invest your time, heart or soul into something/someone until you are aware of the/their entire situation."
tired tired tired sleep sleep sleep escape escape escape
Fighting yourself everyday is exhausting work.
The darkness inside of me  is winning.
Surrounded by the abyss. Clawing my way out.
Unhappy in my own reality so I dream up another.
Helter Skelter.
It's in my brain now.
I don't give away secrets. I am secrets.
"Pretty face don't mean no pretty heart, fucker."
I'm a bubble burster.
*she
Twitter is like a spectator sport for me.
Let the bleeding hearts bleed.
Sharks are better in the water. Penguins are better on the ice.
He's in my sights and he doesn't even know it. Nor do I think he cares.
"'She was the type to fall in love with the moon, and everything that was beautifully unreachable.'"
What am I afraid of?   Myself.
I cry everyday of my life.  Every damn day.
The ones that hear you when you don't say one fucking word. That.
We see exactly what we want to see. I'm trying to open my eyes a little bit more.
"If my honesty repels you, then you don't deserve my friendship."
Those who return reflections of beauty with shards of pain.  The glass is broken.  The image remains.
We're doing a great job so far. He must be so proud.
"If there is a God, He put us here to see exactly how long it would take for us to destroy eachother and annihilate His planet."
"You want to believe that the people you care about are good, but sometimes they're just not."
If you don't like animals then I don't like you.
I'm going to love you until you fucking hate me.
If you can't be there for me when I need you then you can just fuck off right now.
"Maybe if we both lived in a different world. It would be all good and baby, I could be your girl but I can't because we don't."
"You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here but I know what you are, baby."
I see everything. It's a fucking curse.
"I just don't want to see anyone hurt, ever. I hate that shit."
"He had everyone eating out of the palm of his hand, and that's why he walked away."
It's funny how a song can also remind you of a time a man climbed onto your roof and watched you sleep with the intent of doing you harm.
I am so incredibly tired of insincerity.
One alt account + One alt account = Two very deceptive people.  Wow.
You can't make people love you.  You can't make people stay.  All you can do is share how you feel and hope for the best.
"Pssst, you are...."
"I'm not quite right, my darling."
I have found hell in my head.
My dysphoria is palpable.
It is just like a dark cloud that only rains over me.
'I don't get lost in darkness. I am where the darkness goes to get lost.'
I will not calm my heart. I will let it feel whatever it wants to feel.
'Only her eyes spoke. Big tragic eyes.'
Fuck you and your positive attitude.
Go ahead and underestimate me. I love when that shit happens.
"Acceptance is a small, quiet room."
I need to escape my mind.
Why do I feel the way I do?
"&lt;-------- Trust me, you wouldn't want to step foot on this damaged property."
"If you were meant to chime in all the time, you would have been born a motherfucking bell."
You can never hide behind an alt account. Those who pay attention to the style of your writing will recognize your words almost immediately.
"'Step one, you say, ""We need to talk."""
"He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk."""
He smiles politely back at you.
You stare politely right on through.
Some sort of window to your right.
As he goes left and you stay right.
Between the lines of fear and blame.
You begin to wonder why you came.
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend.
Somewhere along in the bitterness.
And I would have stayed up with you all night.
Had I known how to save a life.
Try to slip past his defense.
Without granting innocence.
Lay down a list of what is wrong.
The things you've told him all along.
"Pray to God, he hears you."
"And I pray to God, he hears you."
As he begins to raise his voice.
You lower yours and grant him one last choice.
Drive until you lose the road.
Or break with the ones you've followed.
He will do one of two things.
He will admit to everything.
Or he'll say he's just not the same.
And you'll begin to wonder why you came.' #thefray
Your mind is playing tricks on me.
The devil always knocks on my fucking door.
I've been known to bite.
She paints her eyes as black as her soul.
"Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear."
Hearts are not tame. They are wild.
Am I running towards or away from you?
There is moonlight in his soul.
'Even the prettiest clouds are made of rain.'
All you can do is keep breathing.
I take my friends very seriously as I only have a few true ones.
"Baby, you're my friend now."
We hide behind our mask and then search for someone who can see through it.
The Brock Turners of the world need to be strung up by the balls and left to die.
Denying my own feelings to make everyone else comfortable is pretty much where I'm at right now.
Ampersand life goes on.
"'He liked my brokenness, it's the only way he could find a way in.'"
Beautiful things can be fucked up too.
"Ladies, some guys can be high maintenance too. Steer clear. There's only room for one bitch up in this hizzy."
Why am I up? Why am I alive?
How is waking up in the morning like a pig's tail?  They're both twirly. #BaDumTss
Did you know there are actually people out and about in the morning? Happy people going about their business? I know because I saw them.
"If I could put pen to paper as eloquently as @_desert_bones does, I'd lock myself in a room and read myself all day."
"It's like you're screaming, but no one can hear."
"Can you make a grown man blush? Why yes sir, yes I can."
"Some people just get you or at least, they take the time and effort to try. I like those people."
"Hmm, perhaps you do understand me a little bit more than originally thought. Interesting."
I would never unfollow a gentleman.
I just woke up from sleep but a nap sounds really good about now.
A result of circumstance.
I'm here to escape and vent. Why are you here?
Nobody has time for that shit.
"The ex is dating someone half is age. She uses his phone, pretending to be him, to text me and dig for information. How about NO."
"""It's so hot. Why are you wearing a jacket?""  I'm wearing a jacket because mind your own fucking business, that's why."
There are a lot of us here and we're all fucking beautiful.
Twitter works best for me when I just write my tweets and mind my business.
"Sorry dude, I'm not into harems."
He will make me love.
He will make me feel.
He will make me dream.
He will make me think.
He will make me laugh.
'Madness is like gravity; all you need is a little push.'
"Ich liebe deine Worte, aber Ihre avi schreckt die Schei√üe aus mir heraus."
Spank my  mind.
When the very thing they were attracted to in the beginning is the very thing that repels them in the end.
"I don't want to be insane, I want to be outsane."
The idea that someone you thought you had connected with would just block you with no explanation as to why is a most disturbing one indeed.
"How can someone be gregarious, lively and animated yet still an introvert? I know how, I just am."
The sound of my soul is akin to a lone tin can rolling down an alleyway in the dead of night.
How can you understand me when I don't even know myself?
Conjecture reigns where communication lacks.
"Why let the facts get in the way of having an opinion, I guess."
I don't understand.
One would need to be privy to the rules before one could engage in the game.
"'Stars shining bright above you Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you"" Birds singing in the sycamore trees Dream a little dream of me'"
I need you to be real when nothing else is.
"Just saw a mukbang. Vegan pizza, no cheese. That ain't pizza, bitch."
Kinship.
Before I die I need to jump out of an airplane.  *Parachute not necessarily required.
Hi. Bye.  A Love Story
I'd do anything for me.
Pull me out of the blues.
Smells like red to me. Roses.
I'm perfectly incomplete.
"Darling, you need love."
I guess you can't. I guess you won't.
It's so cute the way you think you're in control.
Echoing emotions.
Look right through me.
Another mind's crime.
Stepping barefoot on a power plug is equal to stepping barefoot on lego. I know because I've done both.
"Concise, succinct and to the point, please."
"I will always choose the 'not sure' thing. It's way more challenging, and exciting."
The story ends. She starts a new one.
Thank you for confirming what I already knew.
I like to make people think.
We can pretend we never met.
"Finish the job, pappi."
I understand it which is why I no longer question it.
It's nothing that hasn't happened before nor will it be the last time it occurs.  It's just the nature of the beast.
Colour me wonderful.
My words bite.
Love is a suicide.
"There must have been 25 traffic lights between here and there. All RED, both ways."
"It's all lies, darling."
It's all just an illusion.
Only with you.
Free my mind and trap it in your body.
"If you listen really carefully, you can hear the sound of me not giving a shit."
The quiet can be so fucking loud.
My thoughts could kill you.
"Truth or Dare? I'll always pick Truth, then lie."
Definitely some faulty wiring in this head of mine.
My brain comes up with the most fucked up dreams ever.
'I walk a line between good and evil.'
I'm all over the place.
Even the happy ones have dark shadows.
&lt;-------- In between your shadow and your soul.
It's called emotional blackmail and you can try that shit with someone else. It won't work here.
"My words, they stand."
"Warm weather is here. All the girls wearing floral and I'm just over here wearing black, sacrificing bats and being me."
'And you can bring me to my knees again.
"All this time that I could beg you please, in vain."
All the times that I felt insecure for you.
And I leave my burdens at the door.
"But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in."
"I can see through you, see your true colors."
"Inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me."
"I can see through you, see to the real you."
"All the times that I felt like this won't end, was for you."
"And I taste what I could never have, it's from you."
All the times that I've tried.
My intentions full of pride. But I waste more time than anyone.
"All the times that I've cried. All this wasted, it's all inside."
"And I feel all this pain. Stuffed it down, it's back again."
"And I lie, here in bed. All alone, I can't mend."
But I feel tomorrow will be OK.' #staind
"Clearly, you have no idea where your heart is. Clearly, I'm looking elsewhere."
You are a supreme being to me because you cut through all the bullshit.
Disenchantment reigns supreme.
"You keep sucking on those cherries with your tongue, whore. Some of us have bills to pay."
The stupidity of some never ceases to infuriate me.
I don't begrudge you a nice life with all of your dreams and fantasies. Just that you keep me the fuck out of it.
"In order to not allow something/someone to have power over you, you have to be indifferent to it's existence in your life."
"Hell hath no fury like me, motherfucker."
"You stupid, stupid little girl. You will see."
Anger me enough and I will implode your entire Twitter experience.
You are a passive aggressive piece of shit.
"Keep me out of your drama. If you don't, I'll be spilling some motherfucking beans over here."
There's a reason the 40 somethings go after the 20 somethings. They're naive and I won't say which I mean.
You think he loves you? That's your delusion.
"Even as a child, I was never any good at sharing."
My father just said we shouldn't even have zoos anymore. Wise man he is.
*dances her way right into his heart*
Intoxicated by words not meant for you? Choose Vodka.
It's like I can't get enough of him.
That bed summons me yet again. Probably because that is where I find you every night.
Sit by the fire and tell me all of your dreams.
"Shhh, they don't know about us."
Excuse me while I kiss you on the mouth.
I'd prefer to spank your mind.
I know not what love is but instead what love is not.
I think I was designed to be alone.
Nothing could contain her.
Melancholy is a friend of mine.
Let's go wild for a while.
"Look up at the trees, through the leaves as they move in tune with the wind and the sun dances on their branches."
"'She has been through  hell. So believe me when  I say, fear her when she looks into a fire and smiles.'"
Today would be a lovely day to die.
Men can be the most endearing creatures.
"If you love yourself more than anything else on this planet, keep doing it but don't follow me."
"I am too loud, I am too quiet.  I am too cold-hearted, I am too sensitive.  Make up your mind and then you can fuck off."
"Whenever I see a male account with only pictures of the female form in their media, I think to myself, ""Great, he loves women,  too much."""
"*looks around at all the different shades of mediocrity*  Clearly, all the fabulous people are hiding out in my phone."
Weather: It's still motherfucking hot out here.
"If you're the type of man that needs constant affirmation that you are the ManGod of the World, then you're insecure and not the one for me."
*sends out a thousand hearts to followers* ·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶·É¶
Keep your distance and no one loses their life.
I will rub you the wrong way.
I am not fit for human consumption today.
"'When all the world was dark, he would crawl inside my head at midnight and make himself at home.'"
It is within the quiet times that I hear the most.
Moments of inexplicable synchronicity.
"RIP Harambe. My apologies for a very flawed human race. Regrettably, zoos can't protect against every form of stupid."
So the gorilla has to die because the stupid fucking parents don't know how to watch their fucking kid? Motherfucking bullshit.
Watch me. You might learn something. History of the World In 2 Minutes
Hear the thunder and think of me.
'It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion.'
Weather: It's fucking hot outside.
Plot twist: Damsel in distress saves Knight in shining armour.
'See the breaking glass in the underpass.
"Hear the crushing steel, feel the steering wheel."
Warm leatherette melts on your burning flesh.
You can see your reflection in the luminescent dash.
A tear of petrol is in your eye.
The hand brake penetrates your thigh.
"Quick, let's make love before you die, on warm leatherette.' #thenormal"
My mind has a mind of it's own.
I am not old enough to be this tired.
"If he makes you feel like a dime a dozen, to him, you are."
Most people want easy. I'm not easy.
You wouldn't be the first one I've chased away with my sparkling personality.
"You can  deny it,  ignore it,  negate it,  rationalize it,  dismiss it.  None of it matters.  The heart will feel what it wants to feel."
I like to dream when I'm wide awake.
Cute little colourful balloons seen on the pages of anyone who is celebrating a birthday is the exact reason why I will not be posting mine.
"A wood burning fire, a night sky full of a million stars and you."
You don't get it. There is NO fairy tale ending.
"I could tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you."
*bewitches you*
"'It seems to me, that love could be labelled poison and we'd drink it anyways.'"
"If that's your Lady, where would I ever fit in?  The Tramp?  Nope."
I'm the escape plan.
"*awakens in search of the cooler side of the pillow, wishing he was there*"
"I cry way too much for an adult person. Not the loud, hysterical sobbing. Just the slow, quiet tears running down my face."
I'm hiding.  - Do you ever get found?  Only when someone's looking.
"I'm a 'if you make eye contact with me in public and don't look away, I will stare you down until you do' type of girl."
Baring my soul to them while they're busy making googly eyes at another. Story of my fucking life.
Key jammed in the lock. Took a bottle opener to it because anger issues. Key snapped in two with one half remaining in the lock. FML
Stormy weather headed this way.  *goes outside to dance in the rain and hopefully get struck by lightning*  What a way to go.
What big eyes you have.  The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad.
Every picture posted is of her. Every tweet about how beautiful she thinks she is. Every RT a validation of that fact.  All I see is ugly.
"I'm a pistol, apparently."
"Let's take a walk on the beach, my love."
Let it all go. See what stays.
So cute when they try to hurt your feelings before realizing you don't have any.
I'm a cross between adorable and don't fuck with me.
Fly with me.
Finding your other half is a fallacy as you'd have to be whole to do so.
'The things one most tries to hide are often the things most easily seen.'
He is most slow and methodical. I think I like it.
I am shades of grey but all you see are colours.
Please understand that I am not responsible for any opinions expressed on this page that may offend on the grounds that I don't give a fuck.
"You don't seek love, you seek 'tions'  adoration  adulation affirmation confirmation  gratification infatuation  proclamation  validation"
"Grab those ruby slippers and put them on my feet, baby."
"'Connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.'"
I love when everyone is sleeping and I'm still up. #nightowl
It doesn't matter if they love you with all of their heart. You have to love them with equal fervor if it has a hope in hell of working out.
I fucking enjoy you.
"charm¬∑ingÀàCH√§rmiNG/adjective pleasant. synonyms:delightful, pleasing, agreeable, likable, endearing, lovely, appealing, attractive, adorable"
Say something charming.
"Pardon me for being real. Please, continue with your fantasies."
It's a good thing my parents had two children because one turned out defective and it ain't the brother.
I want to let it go but I don't know how.
I don't want my broken breaking you.
"Betrayal, killer of the soul."
I broke a long time ago. Everything since has been a fa√ßade. It's called survival.
You're still with me.
I held your hand.
"Truth of the matter is, I'm not sure I know how to love."
I only count the black sheep.
Embrace the glorious mess that is me.
"Never sat on a shrink's couch, but I probably should."
Off balance Suspended in time for the briefest of moments Falling Do you even feel the landing?
Do you ever just let your mind go there?
The moon is orange and pretty tonight.
Do you have a couple of hours or 10?
"Maybe if I close my eyes, it will all just go away."
You are a bigger person than I will ever be  because my anger always gets the best of me.
We don't think alike.
"If someone couldn't be arsed to listen to what it is I have to say, why in fuck would I want to listen to them?"
"Unfollow me and you can rot in hell, beautiful words or not, I would no longer be reading them."
"A lady's man, a lady's man. A la la la la la la la la lady's man."
Don't fuck with me and maybe I'll let you live.
"The only relationships I focus on, with the Twitter, are my own."
I'm sitting here transfixed. Mesmerized.
"I'm just beginning to realize that twitter has many, many, many layers to it. Like an onion. Incredible."
"If there isn't any reciprocity, there is nothing."
"The best compliment I have ever received for my eyes was not that they were beautiful, but that they were strong."
"The larger his vocabulary, the more ways he can seduce me."
"Because darling, I'm a fucking nightmare."
Beautiful tweet. Spelling error. Bummer.
Ironic that the little Asian lady at the market with the mask on her face is touching each and every goddamn tomato with her filthy hands.
The secret to enlightenment is not being an asshole.
Fool be the person who thinks they have me figured out.
People can be so heartbreakingly pathetic with their particular brand of stupid.
Forgive me for trespassing. I had no idea the man was owned.
I'm here for connection.  Not jealousy. Not pettiness. Not bickering. Not triviality. Not insecurity. Just good old fashioned connection.
To sleep and hopefully to dream.
I'm in your brain now. Good luck trying to get me out.
I'm calling de facto principle on that one.
"An account that I really admired, (dark, broody, clever) just turned itself into a vile, pornhubbing piece of shit. That's called bipolar."
"Can't help it, I'm a face girl. ·É¶·É¶·É¶"
Only the special ones show me their faces.
I wonder about too many things. There's a pill for that.
"Twitter is about words, but I can't help but wonder why so many of you don't post your pic here. They're your words, don't hide behind them."
Unnecessary casualties attract attention.
We've met before. A very long time ago.
The familiarity of coming across a recognizable soul. A bit of d√©j√†-vu.
"Just a mad, beautiful dream."
"I love my tweeps, tweeple? twerps?"
"You, over there, collecting your jar of hearts. Don't forget about mine."
I AM the highway to hell.
"Everything's crappy and nothing works like it should. Welcome to the future, everybody.  -Technology"
I'm not a fucking crossword. Quit trying to figure me out.
Baby's got blue eyes.
Mute and mute and have a nice life.
The only person you care about is yourself.
You and your wicked games.
How terribly cruel of you.
Waiting for the silence.
Most unfortunate.
For once I just wanted something to call my own.
Words had no meaning until you spoke them.
"I've got your love right here, baby."
Let the words speak for themselves.
"Words needed, not for validation but for survival."
Echoes of you forever ringing through.
You resonate within me.
"You don't change people from who they are, you just love them for it."
Take me far away tonight.
I'm lost in the light.
"Hush, baby. It's just love, that's all."
Manslaughter-Man's laughter Coincidence? I think not.
It all ends with beginnings.
"I just can't get you out of my head, and what's more? I don't want to."
"If twitter is 'real life' for you, then you have no life.  I know this because I'm here all the fucking time."
"If I wanted it, I'd go after it. Remember that, pappi."
"If you take everything I say here personally, then you would be the destruction of your own demise."
"She looks a little young for him, but I'll be better able to gauge once all her acne clears up."
"You there, with all your dreams and fantasies. Wait forever."
"No offence, but you sound very *young.  *stupid"
Life is far too short for excessive irritation of any kind.
How much longer do I have to bear witness to this pathetic exchange before I block your fucking ass for good?
How much longer do I have to sit here being adorable before you notice me?
Please control the stupid coming out of your mouth.
Are the wounds the demons or have I both?
*takes a running leap at the waiting bed*  *falls asleep before head hits the pillows*
Was that the sound of a whip I just heard?
I can't trick my brain into being happy. It's too smart for that.
"You and I, again and again."
You're my favourite you.
Every beat of my heart asks to go home again.
I crave you in dark and indecent ways.
*wishful thinks*
Did you feel that?
"Stay hungry, lover."
"Tonight, the moon howls."
I am forever wild.
You seem to want the fantasy and I am far too real for that.
"Miserability was thrust upon me, one shady fuck at a time."
Take your flowery prose and send it over to me. I could use some fertilizer in the backyard.
"I'll be the one in white, dancing in the sand."
The ocean awaits.
"Sometimes, you can still catch me dancing."
Remember me the way I was.
&lt;-------- Little girl lost.
When he likes one of my tweets.
You are a revelation.
I'm heading somewhere I've never been before.
I am alone at a crossroads.
"I don't speak of secrets, secrets speak of me."
"If I choose to jump, don't save me."
"If you don't terrify people a little bit, then what's the point?"
'Fools rush in and I've been a fool before This time I'm gonna slow it down cuz I think that this could be more The thing I'm looking for'
&lt;-------- Good girl gone bad.
Sometimes the darkness is my light.
"'At this point all the hands resemble knives, and go by the name friend.'"
Close your eyes and feel my energy.
Eye to eye.
I see the light in you.
You and I will never be apart.
Have you ever felt like you're being followed?
"Turned around to see who's behind me, but there's no one there."
Enjoy your love story for that is all it will ever be.
I keep on meeting the same fucking man over and over and over again.
"If they want to be with someone else, let them."
What's it called when the one who thinks he's stalking you is actually your stalkee.
Twitter also makes a delicious spectator sport. No words necessary because there aren't any to describe what I'm seeing.
"A road trip, no destination and you."
"The mountains, the view and you."
"The forest, the quiet and you."
"The ocean, the sand and you."
"A cabin, a fire and you."
Watch the ones that hold your stare.
Give me your apathy.
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet.
How will you know?  You'll know.
I wake up with the blood of emotional murder on my hands but I'm innocent of the crime.
"He, like a magnet.  Me, powerless to stop the pull."
Sometimes people just make you cry because of how sweet they are. Or is that just me because I'm a heap of fucking mess?
"When they're serious, I want them to be funny. When they're funny, I want them to be serious. You just can't fucking win with me."
*dying inside*  Nobody knows it but me.
"I am the predator, you are the prey."
'Psychobabble all upon your lips.
They can sell it all they want but you cannot agree.
I don't like the taste of damn morality.
You'll find your bread and your butter where you fake it.
Put your face in the gutter of a snake pit.
But our communication is telepathy.
What you give is what you get out of us naturally.
We can wait until the shadow grows long.
Turn the page of the story that has long since found a home.' #Tigerlily
Sleep calls out to me. It's been my only ever real escape.
Screamed. Felt good.
Run and save yourself. There's no hope for me.
"By all means, follow your heart. Just don't waste my fucking time in the interim."
Destructive thoughts forever entering my headspace. I really don't trust a fucking soul.
"If you're one of those people who blow hot and cold, then you can just typhoon yourself right the fuck out of my life."
*puts a spell on you*
"I just uploaded all photos from phone to computer, then deleted all photos off of phone. Two fucking hours. Who has time for that shit?"
The truth always whispers in my ear.
"Whenever a man speaks of their prowess in the bedroom, an angel loses their wings."
I have raised the best damn liar in the free world. Don't embarrass yourself.
The struggle is real yet you still live at home with your parents? Give me a fucking break.
"You could kick me to the curb, run off with another or never speak to me again and my heart would still feel what it feels for you."
What everyone else feels about you is not my concern. What I feel about you is.
"Blinding, but I close my eyes and bask in his warm embrace."
"A million stars in the sky, but one stands out, aflame with his radiant light."
So terribly busy inside my head.
I talk too much. I think too much. I feel too much.
Disappearing into you.
Call of the wild.
Listen for me. You'll hear my roar.
Into the wild dark I run.
"Don't look for the prince, look for the wolf."
I want someone whose broken pieces fit with my own.
"If you think you can fix me, you would be wrong."
"If your life is perfect, then get the fuck away from me."
*cheshire grins*
You know it's all love with me.
I have this war inside me.
I'll take those dimples and I'll eat you alive.
You want fire? I'm your girl.
"Get out of your head, you selfish fuck. Look around you."
"Then again, what the fuck do I know? I live in my head. We all do."
"The moment it comes true, the reality of it will set in and you will be left having to find another dream to dream."
The dream itself is the exciting part.
Why have dreams when you're already living in a dream world?
"They have their dreams, their fantasies and that is really the only thing that keeps them going."
"They wander through life, clueless, complacent and bored as fuck."
People too afraid to question their own mortality.
How can you plan a life when you have no clue how much time you have left?
Nothing lasts.
Dreams coming true is about the saddest thing I can think of.
I'm in the mood to go and fuck with a happy person.
*swan dives into a perfectly unmade king sized bed*
"Just because something is deemed illegal, doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong."
You're the one I see.
"Your words are for many, mine are only for you."
I've known you for a thousand years.
*kiss*
I feel you.
"Are your eyes on me, baby?"
"I prefer the look, smell and feel of a real book in my hands to all of the nonsensical electronic reading devices present these days."
'I like beautiful melodies telling me terrible things.'
"More feeling, less thinking."
"'I think too much. I think ahead. I think behind. I think sideways. I think it all. If it exists, I've fucking thought of it.'"
"Don't claim people, claim your feelings."
"If you're going to take everything I say personally, then you've come to the right place."
My perceptions are on the qui vive.
Never allow others to control who you are and what you do.
Someone repeatedly sneezing without covering their mouth is about to get introduced to my fist in their face.
"I just used the word unthaw in a sentence and now I have to rip my tongue out of my head because, clearly, I don't deserve to use it."
"I'm sure it's 'all about that bass'. Doesn't mean I want to hear yours clocking in at 180 decibels as you pass my house in your car, asshat."
The tapestry of his words as they wind their way down to the deepest part of me.
"When the ball gets bounced in my corner, I throw that motherfucker back."
*lays all my cards on your table*
"I don't do TC's. I do bona fide connections, motherfuckers."
It's the way it was. It's the way it is. It's the way it will always be.
"Another time, another life. Yet he finds me again."
One soul recognizes another.
&lt;-------- Siren of the sea. Will lure you to your death with my enchanting melody.
Stars above.
Think of me so hard I can't help but feel you.
Come to me in my dreams.
"You pick the island, I'll meet you there."
When their entire TL is nothing but a bunch of thankyous for ToTD's. Might the rest of us peasants see some of the words that got you there?
*watches his every move*
"If the words you seek out are my own, then you and I are on the same page."
The connections you experience without one word spoken.
Fighting it only makes it stronger.
"It matters not who the words are for. If I like the way they look and sound, I will acknowledge them."
Dreams so real and vivid haunt the awakened soul.
*holds his hand and strokes his head as he drifts back into slumber*
"Shhh, it's just a dream. Go back to sleep.  *gives him a kiss on the cheek*"
I love a man who pays attention  to me.
"He awakens, before it is time, in search of his phone. Scrolls, likes and then rolls back over in search of the cooler side of the pillow."
I quite enjoy the limited amount of time I spend in reality.
Cloud kingdom of lies and hullabaloo.
Citadel of nonsense.
"Driving, radio blaring, windows down, not noticing the funeral procession to my right.   Song playing on my radio? Knockin' on Heaven's Door"
"'You may be right. I may be crazy, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.'"
"I'm just over here, minding my own business, tweeting. It's not my fault if you find me fucking adorable."
Do not follow the *masses for the *m is silent.
"There are no guarantees, only possibilities."
The special ones can take you to places that no one else can.
"'Soul on soul. Now, that's my kind of porn.'"
I'm going to have to start charging you rent for all the space you're taking up in my head.
"I'm past wanting the fairytale, just give me the laughter and plenty of it."
The darkness hunts me even when the sun is shining brightly in the sky.
I've finally come to a point where I just try and enjoy the people who enter my life for however long they choose to remain in my life.
"He's not an asshole, he just plays one on Twitter."
Twitter Advice:  Enjoy the words without reading too much into them.
"You, with the sparkling blues eyes, chivalrous nature and contagious laughter. It's you."
Kiss me goodnight.
"All for you, baby."
Help me get away from myself.
"'The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts, our cages.'"
I don't so much see him as feel him when he's around.
"I'm once, twice, three times a [crazy] lady...."
"Very sweet list add, thank you. ·É¶·É¶·É¶"
"Comes in like a hurricane, destroying everything in her wake."
"Shut up, I'm thinking."
It's just peaceful enough for a murder.
"Shhh, my demons are sleeping."
The madness suits me.
One look and you're mesmerized.
There's a whole lotta devil in those angel eyes.
I'm the one for me.
"I think I've been doing pretty well at keeping a respectable distance. However, with some people, it's impossible to ignore the pull."
"If I 'like' or 'retweet' you, it doesn't mean that I want to bed you so simmer down there, skippy."
Poetry is lovely but not in day to day verbal communication.  -Bestow upon me the silken orbs of juniper beads. Huh? -Pass the fucking peas.
"Who knows what the future holds, but you just don't turn your back on the beautiful souls."
"Baby, it's you."
Let the sky fall.
I have a big fucking mouth so a lot of my time is spent on damage control.
What's in your head?
There are no mistakes.
*dances in the rain*  Cleansed
The harder it is the faster you fucking fall.
*whispers sweet nothings into your ear*
Theories catching fire.
A story I've never told.
Your beautiful words deserve to be heard and I'm listening.
I don't instigate the rudeness. I merely respond to it in kind.
Who's next?
"I want an incisive, inquisitive, insightful, irreverent mind to fuck."
I want someone for whom philosophical discussion is foreplay.
I want someone who sometimes makes me go 'ouch' due to their wit and evil sense of humour.
I want someone that I can reach out and touch randomly.
I want someone I can cuddle with.
&lt;-------- Sapiosexual.
My chakra needs balancing.
I think that people who don't use social media are the real heroes.
It's unfortunate that the thing keeping you together is the same thing that keeps you apart.  Distance.
I prefer a gentleman to a gentle man.
I prefer to be the saver rather than the savee. It's what I do.
Her: My knight in shining armour is coming to sweep me off my feet.  Me: I'm bleeding out from all the wounds those fuckers have inflicted.
"I prefer to be lost, not found."
I can pinpoint the exact moment in time when I lost my mind. I've been looking for it ever since.
"Don't be bitter, it's just Twitter."
"I don't rock the boat, I tip that motherfucker over."
Ye olde shit happeneth.
Save yourself a lot of time and effort by not falling in love with me.  *hopes he does the opposite*
"Accidentally hit the classical music station while driving.. and left it there. It's official, I've turned into my father."
"The next time I'm frantically searching for my sunglasses, the very first place I'm looking is the top of my fucking head."
"But somehow, it's all ok."
Can't we all just get along? You people keep me sane.
Thunderstorm! I love it!
I am one of a kind and so are you.
Die a thousand deaths so I know it's real.
He sounds so familiar. Eerily so.
Wouldn't it be hilarious if that mysterious stranger you were 'dm'ing was actually an ex and you didn't know it?  Absolutely fucking not.
"When children sing, you listen."
'Something in the wind has learned my name.'
The world will be your playground again.
To a destination unknown.
Beautiful eyes are poisoned.
I see the beauty in you.
I don't want to be the reason why.
I've never been so wrong.
Always caught in the middle.
*blows raspberries at you*
Where's my teddy bear?
A lady never kisses and tells.
"I'm not concerned with the what ifs, I care about the what is."
My ears are ringing. Which one of you fuckers is talking about me?
Is death here too?
"Get that wooden box ready for me, I'm coming home."
*laughs forever*
"You don't get to choose who you like, but you absolutely get to choose what to do about it, if anything."
I'll go anywhere without you.
"I'm a motherfucking lady, don't treat me like your whore."
I'm making up words and shit.
"We're all fucked up here, but I think I take the prize for the most fucked uppedest."
Hey thanks for nothing! Morals in the dust Two-faced bastards and syncophants No trust
"Thieves, thieves and liars, murderers Hypocrites and bastards"
Ministry - Thieves
Ministry - N.W.O.
I'll go anywhere with you.
"Baby, come closer."
My favourite weapon is the look in your eyes.
Get out of my life.
You've run out of lies.
Ministry - Stigmata (Video Version)
Sing me to sleep.
I think I'm in need of a spank or twelve.
I've been the titchiest bit naughty.
I bet you dollars to donuts he didn't even give me his real name.
Goosebump music is where it's at.
I need saving from myself.
'I've learned to live half alive.'
*steals your heart and then runs the fuck away with it*
Why do people have to be so ew?
*paints a gunpowder portrait of you*
My TC is unaware that he's my TC. I'm sneaky like that.
I can't let you in without letting my monsters out.
A blissful madness.
My only rival is the moon.
*gets lost in your devil eyes*
I will dance in the flames that burn you to the ground.
Are monsters born or made?
Corona and lime with my old man because we're fucking classy like that.
"I love you.  *me, to myself*"
"If you enjoy the comedic talent of Dane Cook, then we are already fast friends."
"I'm the only narcissist allowed on this page, fucker."
Mother: There are a lot of crazy people out there. Me: You're looking at one of them.
Another star fizzles then fades.
I am far too loud to be anyone's secret.
Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
Everything that happens to me just brings me back to you.
Screenshot everything so motherfucker knows I'm real.
Thought you were different.  Thought wrong.
"If I had a nickel for every time a man wrote what you just wrote me, I'd be a very rich woman indeed."
"You win. Although, I'm not sure I would call it much of a prize."
My mother is an empath. Some of that shit must have whittled it's way down to me.
"Dream Analysis  'Maggots generally signify incorrect feeling or emotions regarding someone or something.'  Called it again, brain."
I often dream prophetically.
I dreamt of maggots last night. Must have been an omen.
You sound like a raging cunt.
It will come back to haunt you.
I must have done something pretty fucking horrible in my childhood.
I know you're out there somewhere.
"To the left, to the left."
"When in doubt, pull out."
My heart is extra heavy today.
"It's the little things, like attention to detail, that matter."
"I really didn't think my name was that hard to spell, but they keep on getting it wrong."
That motherfucker don't know how to act.
I'll take a rainy day to a sunny one.
My mirror is staring back at me.
"My darling, you."
"Fucking relax, it's just the meds talking. That and the alcohol."
"If I knew I could get away with it,  there are currently about 50 on my hit list."
Forever is going to start right fucking now.
That look in your eyes.
Where does it go from here?
The true 'stars' here have very few followers and the jackasses have an overabundance. Just like life.
"If someone pays you a compliment here, you best me thanking them, you thankless, narcissistic, motherfucking piece of shit."
"Oh dear, I think I scared him away."
I'm talking now. You're fucking listening.
Round and around and around and around we go.
You can't escape me.
"It's written in the stars, baby."
Il y aura des jours meilleurs.
"If you can be nothing else, at least be real."
Show yourself to me.
I have no clue who anyone is.
"Feel my sunshine, motherfucker."
Don't you feel my sunshine?
It must be time for sleep.
I'm so confused right now.
"Be wary if, when they speak of you, it's in the past tense."
I fight for me.
Nobody steals the light from my eyes. Motherfuckers have tried though.
*holds his hand forever*
*teleports self to where you are at*
His words calm the tornado that lives in my mind.
I want you close.
"Sing it, baby."
I'm the cool breeze on a hot day.
&lt;-------- Woman of constant sorrow.
Tell me your secrets.
*wishes on a shooting star*
"When the music is so pretty, you just have to close your eyes. That."
"'While you're out looking for sugar, somebody's gonna take your honey and be gone.'"
They keep trying to cut you open but I have no more blood left to give.
Thought you were the one.  Thought wrong.
I just want to sleep forever.
"If I'm not first on your list, I advise you to remove me from the list altogether."
"Give me some ocean, some beer and some Marley and I'm good."
"Yes, Miss Von Teese, correct. You could be the most luscious, beautiful peach on the planet and that motherfucker will still want an apple."
"If you walk away I will follow, but in the opposite direction."
"If I were a tree, I'd be a weeping willow."
Kiss me goodnight.
"I like your style, baby."
Act like a lady and maybe he'll act like a gentleman. Act like a whore and you only have yourself to blame.
I believe in chivalry.
'I prefer movies.
I prefer myself liking people to myself loving mankind.
I prefer the color green.
I prefer not to maintain that reason is to blame for everything.
I prefer exceptions.
I prefer to leave early.
I prefer the old fine-lined illustrations.
I prefer the absurdity of writing poems to the absurdity of not writing poems.
"I prefer, where love's concerned, nonspecific anniversaries that can be celebrated every day."
I prefer moralists who promise me nothing.
I prefer cunning kindness to the over-trustful kind.
I prefer the hell of chaos to the hell of order.
I prefer Grimms' fairy tales to the newspapers' front pages.
"I prefer light eyes, since mine are dark."
I prefer zeroes on the loose to those lined up behind a cipher.
I prefer to knock on wood.
I prefer not to ask how much longer and when.
I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility that existence has its own reason for being.' #PossibilitiesWS
99 dreams I've had........
"If I can make just one heart beat a little bit faster, I'm happy."
The reason your kid walks all over you is because you fucking let them.
"If you're not happy in your relationship, then get the fuck out of your relationship."
Would love to take you out for a test drive.
*baits hook* *casts line* *whistles quietly* *waits for him to bite* *reels him in*
"I don't call it egomaniacal, I call it knowing your worth."
"You could have 10 000 lady followers who all like and retweet everything that comes out of your fucking mouth, but they're not me, are they?"
"Don't burn bridges, just loosen the bolts and watch those motherfuckers fall painstakingly slow."
Move along with your chatter.
No one takes the fucking time to understand where it is I am coming from.
Your time is the most important thing you can give someone.
My lady-bits are all a-flutter.
Sexy is not a look. Sexy is a vibe.
Thinks about what his face would look like with my legs wrapped around it.
Quicksmart.
Therein lies the crux of it. I need a strong motherfucker to deal with me.
"If I wanted to be ignored, I'd get married."
"Bang, bang, bang."
You know I want it.
"I missed you, boy."
Day to day existence is an exercise in futility.
I keep to myself because I don't trust people.
"Your behaviour is synonymous with the boys on the street yelling out, 'Hey, baby, baby, baby', which, when ignored, turns into, 'Yo, bitch'."
I thoroughly detest when people lose their fucking manners around me.
"Pull up your balls, your jealous is showing."
"I'm pretty benign if you're sniffing after my sloppy seconds, but quickly turn malignant if you're chasing after the one I currently covet."
I close my eyes and drift away with thoughts of you.
I know who you are.
You never were and never will be.
You can't hurt me.
You don't scare me.
You're not real.
"Well, that was fun. Now back to our regularly scheduled program."
"I'm not broken, I'm damaged. There's a difference."
I like to keep a man on his toes.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
"Coming from a long familial line of angst and depression, I feel the biggest gift you can bestow upon someone is laughter. You're welcome."
"My good Christ, he rearranges and deletes tweets faster than I can say wtf."
I've already claimed you as mine.
"As soon as I feel they are sketchy, I hand them an easel and get the fuck out of there."
"Take a fucking bow, motherfucker."
The thing about his tweets is that he writes them in a way that makes every female think they are directed at her. Very clever.
"*leaves a trail of broken hearts in her wake*  Tell them, daddy."
I'd prefer to embed myself so deeply within your psyche that you'd have to shoot yourself in the head to get me out.
"Holy Fuck, those eyes, though."
"'I cheated myself, Like I knew I would, I told you I was trouble, You know that I'm no good.'"
I'm invisible.
You don't see me.
So far away yet so near.
I keep dancing on my own.
Is anybody out there?
My token answer to everything from now on is going to be Fuck Off.
I think it's time I walk away and let you play with some of the other children in the sandbox. I'll be over here with the grown-ups.
"My heart gets broken 1000 times a day, but it's okay, I don't feel it anymore."
Just walk away now motherfucker and no one gets killed.
"For your own protection, I would stay the fuck away from me."
*puts the world on hold for you*
I want that one.  *points at you*
It's disheartening when someone you respected morphs into the equivalent of a snotty brat nosed two year old in dire need of their baba.
Ignoring will just have me running in the opposite direction of you.
"I try not to get involved in 'he said, she said.'"
*puts the final nail in your coffin*  *pounds that fucker in*
FYI: He's married.
"I've gone from never muting a single soul, to locking down the din on three accounts in the span of 30 seconds. Life is good and quieter."
"Dude, I'm embarrassed for you."
"Oh, sweetheart, you have no idea what you're in for."
You can actually smell desperation on an individual. The scent is reminiscent of moonshine and oppression.
"Sometimes, you're better off dead."
&lt;-------- Girl with the fractured heart is chasing you.
*free falls into the unknown*
"The war between head and heart:  Heart,  I warned you but you didn't fucking listen, did you?  Brain"
*slips under his spell*
"I like the way you think, but only if it's about me."
Chill out. I'm a pussycat. Unless provoked.
Do you feel like you're being stalked.. er.. watched? Because you are.
"If you blow hot and cold, you're a fucking asshole."
*circles the area*  *cues the theme song from Jaws*
"Anyone come to hurt me or mine, fuckers not leaving with their eyes."
Be careful. You might be the next one to get my attention.
You can't tell me anything I haven't heard before.
Epiphanic moments are one of life's wonderful little treasures.
Salted caramel ice-cream? Hello.
You become more or less attractive to me depending on who you are as a person. Physicality plays a supporting role and ony at the start.
"Attraction, for me, is directly related to a person's spirit."
They're just words. They don't control me.
I may as well install a revolving door for all the temporary people in my life.
I need me someone who reads in bed.  *snuggles up and watches him*
I can't do a goddamn thing with sports.
"I'd make you so late for work, lover."
"e-curiosity  e-connection e-regard e-jealousy e-envy e-lust e-interest e-want e-stalk e-etc  Sure, but e-love?  Good luck with that."
There is no such thing as e-love.
You'd give a lemon a run for it's money.
True colours. Those fuckers will always rear their ugly little heads.
Don't be shady and maybe the sun will shine for you.
"Just because you sit, hidden, behind your computer, doesn't mean people won't be able to see you for who you really are."
Pull me closer to you.
Can't. Too busy dying.
Can't. Too busy screaming.
via @youtube
"Shhhh.. sleep, baby, sleep."
Keep your mouth shut and your stupid to yourself.
"I love it when someone insults my intelligence by saying they were only being friendly, not flirty. I know the difference, motherfucker"
Can't. Too busy ending my life.
Can't. Too busy plotting your demise.
Can't. Too busy cracking my bones.
*flirts with disaster*
I've met your kind before and I'm not interested.
Anyone can say anything about anybody.
"All I'm saying, is if you want to know something about me, ask me. Don't rely on the words of others."
Wondering when my soul actually left my body.
Get your motherfucking feelings away from me or I will shank you.
Silence can be more of a poem than an actual poem.
There is just the loveliness that is you.
There are no coincidences.
"To all of you self-appointed twitter police, go fuck yourselves."
"If you don't like the way someone tweets, then don't fucking read them."
"I don't want to live longer, I want to live wider."
Hold my hand you bastard.
&lt;-------- Head full of elsewhere.
Thanks for the flowers. I think I'll save the thorns instead.
"Die, my darling."
I'm always disappointed in people yet flatly refuse to lower my standards.
"Go dangle that carrot someplace else, motherfucker."
I do not fight for attention.
Knee high to a grasshopper when I rode my first elephant.
Being awake is highly overrated.
Pocket full of posies
Ring around the rosy
"If he's not feeling you, move on to someone who is."
Whisper something sweet into my ear as I fade off into sleep.
I will pan sear your flesh to a perfect medium rare.
"Pretty face don't make no pretty heart, fucker."
I'll give you my heat if you give me yours.
Don't be a dumbass.
You only see what you want to see.
Scared now? Don't fuck with your loved ones. Strangers can reak havoc on your duplicity.
The relative people have the relative information.
"I'm single, I'm free and I'm looking at you."
I see what you are doing and I am sad for you.
"Sad people, sad situations."
"If you have a relationship irl, that should be your focus. Not mindlessly flinging your shit here to see what you may catch."
"Respect yourself more, do better."
sad sad sad sad sad  sad sad sad sad sad  sad sad sad sad sad  sad sad sad sad sad  sad sad sad sad sad at the whole thing the lot of it.
"I am a mirror, what you give me is what I reflect back."
I don't like jealousy but I am the jealous type.
I love that shade of melancholy on you.
"Quick to temper, quicker to forgive, never to forget."
"I'm older than I look, younger than I say."
I see all sides to an argument.
"&lt;-------- Spiritual, not religious."
I don't believe in organized religion.
"If that was you then, who are you now?"
I like to take the Band-Aid off slowly. It's more painful that way.
"No rhyme or reason to it, but it's there nonetheless."
Only feeling one.
Thousands of people around you but only seeing one.
I wonder....
Magnetic forces unseen to the naked eye.
"Whether it's wrong or right, you won't be able to resist the pull."
"Who in the hell do I think I am walking around the planet, dead inside, amongst the living?"
It is what it is. I don't care what the fuck it is. I'm just glad that it is.
I believe in mind control. Yours.
It's our minds that make us unique.
I am the storm that rages within.
You can't make people love you.
Look skyward. Find peace. Carry on.
You don't want to be like me.
Dance for me.  Dance with me. Dance within me.
"I'm sorry and I really did enjoy your tweets, beautiful soul. But I don't play that follow/unfollow/follow back game. ·É¶·É¶·É¶"
Just live your life.
I'm better sleeping on my own.
The most beautiful green eyes I have ever seen.
"You break my heart. Then again, you break everyone's heart."
"I speak nothing but truth. If you don't believe it, that's your problem, not mine."
"I'm so fucking tired, all the time."
Weeds out the ones who have an understanding in a real hurry.
"If I knew me, I'd walk away too."
I am fucking rotten to the core. I shake my head at myself.
"Too many whores 'groupie'ing that one. No thanks, I'll pass."
A raging cesspool of corruption.
I walk amongst you filled with hate.
"&lt;-------- If you had any idea the level of rage and loathing this person contained, you would steer clear."
Show me what I'm capable of.
"That lock on my door is for your protection, motherfucker."
"Go love yourself, fucker."
"Your tits are out and you have 14 000+ followers. Good for you, whore."
You can take that sexy beard of yours and ..................................... all over me.
"Sure, I'm the bad one for wanting someone of my own. Just wait until he falls for you and then tells you all about his spouse. You'll see."
I have enough problems pissing people off one by one. What the fuck do I need a group chat for?
"Filet, burgers, meatballs.. BEEF, BEEF, BEEF.. and vegans, stop eating all the motherfucking plants. My cows need to feed on something."
Give me a beef burger or let me starve.
I will never be a vegan. Ever.
I had corn-on-the-cob for dinner because some bonehead tried to convince me that a turkey burger is an actual burger. Nope.
You ever want to hear someone's whole story at 'hello'?
It's official. I hate people.
Every man has the same fucking spiel. I'm waiting on different.
You have bored me for the last time.
Stop staring at me like you know who I am.
"May the thorns of a thousand roses pierce your cold, uncaring heart."
Threatening me with murder? You'd be doing me a favour.
Answer my fucking questions.
What's your sign?
"Hey tough guy, does your mommy still do your laundry?"
What colour are your eyes?
Current mood.
Ew. People.
"Let's go to the sea, my darling."
"'We kill all the caterpillars, thencomplain there are no butterflies.'"
Wild is my favourite colour.
'Do you mean to insinuate that I have to tolerate such diabolical insolence from an inferior like you?
The commonality of your vulgarity shocks the sensitivity of my morality.
"Furthermore, if you pursue in such nonsensical vocality I'll have the painful necessity of horizontalizing your perpendicularity.'"
Meet me in Paris.
Let's play a game.
You forgot compelling. That word often makes an appearance in my life. *sighs*
My preference is interacting with unattached individuals. You can unfollow if you don't fit this criteria.  *loses ALL followers*
I've been alone all along.
&lt;-------- Haunted.
Sadness and I hold hands.
"Sometimes, I cry in the shower. Ok, a lot of the times."
Your secret is safe with me.
Now tweet something just for me so I know it's real.
You. In my bed. Now.
Trying to hide the 'fuck you' in my eyes.
You look just like my next.
"If nothing lasts forever, will you be my nothing?"
I seem to have lost my phone number. Can I have yours?
Do you come here often?
I need to buy more compost bags for all the shit you're spewing.
Go sell it to someone else. We're not buying here.
I am too old and too tired to put up with your bullshit.
"I'm not here to yield to anything, fucker."
It's never quiet here.
"Noise is all around me, especially in my head."
Nothing is perfect.
No need to come any closer. I can smell the arrogance from all the way over here.
"You know, you come across as a know-it-all but,   'any man who knows a thing, knows he knows not a damn, damn thing at all.'"
"Fuck twitter, you guys need a show of your own. ;)  @LittleFuckFace @KrispyKreep"
I'm just a kiss away.
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
"Broken. Move along, I am not what you seek."
Let go.
You and I collide.
Two of a kind.
It will rain a sunny day.
Pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain pain is all I feel. Where is my pleasure?
"Think you can't sink any deeper? I'm here to tell you, you can."
I am far too old for insincere. Move along.
My heart tells me that your chasing someone else. My heart never lies. Goodbye to you.
I'm ready for something more.
I want to go quickly and peacefully and now.
"I eat your words. Feed me, I'm starving."
My heart is so fucking out of tune.
I would be happy watching Sensing Murder and eating Kiwi on a remote island somewhere.
Born: Canada Heritage: Switzerland
I need someone to love.
It's been a long road.
You can tell me nothing.
*turns swag on*
I could use a friend.
"Well, aren't you a luscious specimen."
Where does one go to see all the skanky whores?   Your feed.
Guilty as charged.
Why don't you go ahead and make that double another double.  -Standards
'Can't you feel the music pumping hard like I wish you would.'
Why are you still breathing?
"If I report something, no need to ask if I wish to block/mute that individual. I will stalk like a hawk until their ass is off my internet."
The ocean has nothing on my tears.
My brain is in a perpetual state of mayday.
"I'm driving in the car wearing the same thing I wore to bed last night, in case you wanted to know how classy this dame is."
You're already there.
"I mourn for my former self, the unbroken version."
Strings were made for cutting.
Toxic people have no power if ignored.
I'm waiting for something wonderful to happen.
You have to experience sadness to appreciate happiness.
&lt;-------- Wounds with her eyes.
"I didn't make your cut? Well guess what, motherfucker, you didn't make mine either."
"I am such a petty bitch. If an account unfollows me, even if it's an account I like, I will return the favour."
I can't hear you. It's too dark in here.
"She is the single perfect red rose and I am the wildflower enveloped in the weeds. If it is perfection you seek, the choice is obvious."
We are judged by the company we retweet.
You play all sides but think l'm to dense to notice? Colossal insult.
Twittering is fun but eventually I want to see the real faces behind the accounts.
Screenshots of lies.
Let me show you how it's done.
Me: I lost my job today. Poet: Behold the sadness of the weeping willow. Listen to the sweet sussurro as it weeps. Me: I'll see myself out.
"I agree poetry is a beautiful thing but then, what else you got?"
Who's in control here?  I am.
I couldn't care less.
I write tweets and they go off to some DM room to discuss them.
My heart is a rebel.
I like impossible.
Who in the world am I?
What you think of me is none of my business.
I prefer tweets that have not been touched by soiled hands.
How can you possibly expect the truth from someone who lies to himself?
Try and get me out of that head of yours now.
I put a spell on you.
"She's not me, lover and she never will be."
I dream of the simple things in life.
Take me back to a time gone by.
"If your focus is sex, my focus will not be you."
Don't fucking tell me what to do.
"I don't escape my demons, I become them."
Coughing up blood twice in a week just means I'm headed in the direction I wish to go.
"Ladies, it doesn't matter how smart you are, how pretty you are, how special you are, their eyes will always wander. Shame that."
I embrace my sadness.
I don't have a middle name. A first and a last was all that was given to me.
"I want to sell everything, leave this city and explore a remote island."
My favourite colour is the blue-green of the ocean.
My favourite number is 13.
Tell me a story that is decidedly you.
&lt;-------- Moonchild.
"Almost imperceptible, except for the distinguishing eye. Very good."
I need a hand.
I'm reaching out.
Look at me.
Does anybody know what we are living for?
My words are my disguise.
How many more times can I possibly die before it sticks?
The important ones never unfollow.
"Change your avi, lose 10 followers. Fuck, I need to do that more often."
You know I'm no good.
I'm going to be the last one standing.
*throws dice out the window*  I don't want to play this game anymore.
Can I put my arms around you?
Circles. They bring us right back to the start again.
Delicious sound of rain hitting the roof as I attempt to slumber.
I feel you.
Now you change your avi so I know it's real.
Black.
"Territorial, jealous, demanding.. is me. Surely you don't want that in your life."
"Remember, walking in the sand?..  Life was so exciting..  Smile was so inviting..  Then he kissed my cheek..  softly.."
I dig a man who pays attention.
There are some psychic motherfuckers here. Freaky!
Don't fuck with me. I watch true crime. I know what to do with a body.
"Sweetheart, you are about to drop your balls."
"Honey, honey, you're juggling a bevy of beauties. Simmer the fuck down."
"I'm crazy, but not 'boil your pet bunny' crazy. Why would I harm an innocent animal because of your lying, cheating ass?"
It's always dark inside my head.
"If you take me for an idiot, you're going to end up feeling like one yourself."
"You don't even hear me. Sad, sad world."
I no longer know where the pain ends and I start.
"If you must breathe, could you go and do it over there please."
*screams for the rest of my natural born life*
"It is a little bit of bullshit, isn't it?"
She kissed him softly on the cheek.
&lt;--------  Doesn't kill but wounds for life.
Make me believe.
"You are a thousand, million miles away."
The sun explodes into the night.
"So cold, we burned."
"I get lost inside my mind. One day, I won't find my way out."
Is there a brick wall I can bash my head against?
"Sweet baby Jesus, make it stop."
"I don't really have book smarts, but my people smarts are on point. I read them like a book."
"He says, she says, he says but most importantly, I say."
"Excuse the mess, but I live in here. Come inside, stay a while.  -The inside of my head."
Life is lost inside you.
I think the 'block' button stops you from seeing the blocked person's words anywhere on here. What a positively delicious feature.
The dangerous games people play.
*laughs forever*
&lt;-------- Shit disturber.
I like stirring the pot.
*nips this shit in the bud*
We need to compare notes.
"Wow girl, is he telling me the same things he's telling you?"
You haven't seen crazy until you've met me.
The fucking wine made me do it.
"You are the reason I can't walk outside at night alone and feel comfortable doing so, you selfish twat. Blocked."
How to lead a happy existence on the Twitter.  Tweet whatever the hell you want and never check your notifications.
Thesis: Girls Who Pose With Bananas and the Boys Who Retweet Them
Kindly fuck off and crawl back from whence you came.
"I'm sure all the men here love you, pet. Why don't you pull out the other tittie?"
Respect yourself and others will too.
It's such a sad thing to me when a woman feels the need to pose with a banana in her mouth.
"So you think you're beautiful? Let me tell you something, sweetheart. Beauty comes from within."
This world is in need of some motherfucking guidance.
In my heart is where I keep you.
Thinking of the day.
Always watching. Always learning.
&lt;-------- Greedy bitch.
Your attention. Give it all to me.
You're having a love affair with yourself.
"You hear sirens approaching, but they're coming for you because you're already dead."
Nothing kills my vibe.
"Here kitty, kitty."
"I don't step on toes, I stomp on them."
Shady people just strengthen my resolve.
"Can you feel me scrolling your feed, baby?"
Your words speak to me.
Poetry is a language of it's own.
"If you bring drama to my door, I will slam that motherfucker right in your face."
The only drama I enjoy is in my eyes.
"You, with the stars in your eyes. Tone that shit down."
"I come here to escape life, not deal with the same motherfucking bullshit."
Sleep is the only escape.
Singe ich ein Lied f√ºr dich?
Hast Du etwas Zeit f√ºr mich?
"Own your dreams, they are lonely but they are yours."
"Hiding the sadness, at times, is an exercise in futility."
"Sometimes, all you can do is hope you've made an impact. The rest is out of your control."
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind.
"I've mastered the art of bouncing back, fucker."
&lt;-------- Restless soul syndrome.
It will rain a sunny day if you're me.
Can I not just murder these loud fucks walking down my street? I'd be doing the world a favour. #NoisePollution
"It's not my problem who you 'like' here in Twitterland. I like and retweet who I like, when I like and how I like. Always."
We are going in opposite directions. Him and I.
"No one can stop what is meant to be. Not the jealous girl, not the angry man. Keep going."
I've decided I don't like you. You're a sneaky cunt. Stay off of my radar or there is going to be trouble. Think I'm joking? Try me.
"'Worry Worry, worry, worry, worry Worry just will not seem to leave My mind alone.'"
"'Trouble Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble been doggin' my soul Since the day I was born.'"
There are some toxic motherfucking females up in this hizzy.
"I honestly try to steer clear of any drama here. However, it appears to be following me around regardless."
"If I can give you any advice on here, I would say, don't twitter crush, just appreciate the words and tweet."
"Don't mind me, I'm just over here plotting your demise."
Get off your high horse so I can beat you with this whip.
The first step is admitting that you're my fucking problem.
I think I need anger management.
Go ahead and kill me.
Getting enraged for me can be out of body experience.
I'll eat your ego for breakfast with some motherfucking bacon.
You can't stop me.
*goes for the jugular*
I could kill.
"If they can let you go so easily, then they were never really there to stay in the first place."
Don't you dare harangue me with your 140 characters or less.
What are you looking at?
"My best wasn't good enough, motherfucker. How do you think that makes me feel?"
I'm handing out dunce caps but my supplier can't keep up with the ever growing numbers.
"You @er, are completely out to lunch. Go to the corner and think about what you just said."
"You could be speaking of/to any or many here. But that's okay, the words soothe me nonetheless."
"Eat dirt and die, trash."
You go through a tough time and someone else is selfishly wondering about the affect it is having on them first.
This is not about you.
I've fallen down the well and he asks if I can still give him a ride later.
One little struck match is all it would take.
*sharpens machete*
"Snakes and Ladders. That's what life is, a series of snakes and ladders."
"I can feel each door as it slams, shutting me deeper into myself."
It's not you. Everyone ends up disappointing me eventually.
I think I'll watch a true crime show and fantasize about murdering you.
It's okay not to like me. Sometimes I don't even like myself.
You should never have to change yourself to suit another.
It's just my moon friends come to fetch me.
Know your worth and add some motherfucking taxes to that shit.
You can't stand me and I love it.
I stalk his feed like a starving animal.
'Dig if you will the picture. Of you and I engaged in a kiss.'
Finals? How the fuck old are you?  *ponders putting 25+ on home page*
'I like to have space to spread my mind out in.'
"Being alone is dangerous. Once you see how peaceful it is, you don't want to deal with people."
Alone with the music.
I like to be alone.
I'm having some time with me and I'm rather fucking enjoying it.
Thank you for subjecting yourself to the tomfoolery that is me.
'This is what it sounds like when doves cry.'
Party up in heaven like it's 1999. #RIPPrince
My mind is working against me.
You are the bear playing with the pink balloon.
Let the bleeding hearts bleed.
"You, over there, poet. Get over yourself."
Uncross your heart and live.
Kissed with words.
Everyone's sleeping. Let's sneak away together.
Hi. I'm a panda.
"But darling, monsters are real. They're living inside of us."
I pray for the release of the silent screams within me.
Me against myself.
A victim of my own mind.
A slave to the idea of me.
I am my own enemy.
A self saboteur. A provocateur.
I am a destroyer of all things.
Save yourself.
Run the fuck away from me as fast as you can.
&lt;-------- Motherfucking issues.
There is something seriously wrong with me.
Don't waste my time.
I'm looking for one.
Heartbreaking to realize you are one of many.
Young love. Bless your little hearts.
Keep me in mind as you walk to your hanging.
Mashed potatoes are like a hug from the inside.
"It's like I'm to be kept for the night. Like some dirty little secret. Like some wretched, vile thing."
This is it.
It's in my brain now.
Helter Skelter.
"'Back, I couldn't go back"
"There's something there I died for, death"
"Maybe he knows what I'm here for, again and again"
"Confrontation, information"
All it takes is money
"Stand up, step back, fall down and hit the ground"
Time and time again
Now I find I'm on my own again
I thought it would be better
It's blowing my mind
You see it doesn't really matter if you care or even understand the time of your life is to be happy
What for?
"God, I've got one more chance left"
Four hundred thousand million days to go
"But there's no answer, no answer to my questions"
I'm left feeling cold no matter what you're going to tell me
"In a state and mind of ultraviolence, east meets west"
Then one day it hits you
And on that day I realise
You can't see the wood for the trees
"Look, look at me now"
I'm kneeling on the floor
Did you ever have the feeling you can take no more?
And people look at you as if you're kneeling on the floor
"Now look at me, look at me"
I can take no more
A dog-like position is a manmade condition of life.' #DogStarMan
Blood on my hands.
I try to understand.
Watch me now.
"You're blind, you're blind, you're blind."
It's like a nightmare.
I have white twinkle lights on the headboard of my bed all year long.
I was not given a middle name so my initials are simply M.E.
"When I was a kid going to visit the zoo, the polar bears were always my favourite to see."
The ocean calls out to me.
I like to get lost in the music.
I'm a lover not a fighter but will give you a run for your money if provoked.
I collect beautiful experiences not beautiful things.
I love anything melted cheese.
I prefer coffee to tea.
The moon is my ruling planet. That explains the moods.
I am the jealous type.
I am a night owl not an early bird.
"If you piss me off, I get very loud. If you hurt me, I get very quiet."
"I am a walking, talking contradiction."
I write with my right hand but do everything else with my left.
I come across as an extrovert but I'm really an introvert.
Quiet irl? Hell no.
All good. This is a drama-free zone.
Words can be lovely when people stand behind their own.
Cuddling under a blanket of stars with you.
√Ä la folie... pas du tout.
*looks into your eyes*
You. Come here.
*whispers in your ear*
I know your secrets.
Don't speak.
"Hush, my darling."
Shhh.. let it be.
Can you hear the quiet?
I'll eat your instincts for my motherfucker dinner.
This is the very reason I lock people out of my heart and mind. You can't get in. No one can. I hold the only key. #GamesPeoplePlay
'When he pushed me away he didn't think I would actually like it there.'
My head is a jungle and you are a wild animal running through it.
This is all happening in your mind.
I am my team.
I'm just an illusion.
Silly girl. He doesn't give a fuck.
*lights match*  *burns it all to the ground*
You have insulted me for the last fucking time.
A motherfucking romper room is what it is.
Someone thinks I'm making a fool out of them because someone else put my name on a list. It would be funny if it wasn't so damn sad.
How they fucking turn on you with any and every perceived injustice.
I refuse to take responsibility for your issues. I have my own to deal with.
This is your jealousy and your insecurity. It has nothing to do with me and everything to do with you.
When the one who claims to care about you is the first to think the worst about you.  Time and time again.
It's ok. I get it. I get tired of me too.
There can be only one.
1 in 4. I'm not liking the odds on that one.
I'm on a mission. You.
We're all flawed. That's where we find the beauty.
Take off the rose-coloured glasses and see me for who I really am.
"Whenever I show interest in a man, every two-bit whore within pecking distance flocks on over to hone in on my target."
"Don't mind me, I'm just over here drowning in the money pit."
üíã
That's a mighty fine looking list you have there. ·É¶·É¶·É¶
Put your thumb and forefinger together so that they are almost touching. That is how close I am to financial ruin.
Put me on a list of my own so I know it's real.
I will not be herded with the masses.
I'm 'let's light a match and burn this motherfucker to the ground' kind of crazy.
The first step is admitting you have a problem. I have many.
I need to get my ass off the computer and back into the real world.
So sad when people you respect are liking and retweeting those you don't.
Nothing phases me anymore.
I believe you have much more in common with her anyway.  Off you go while I find someone for me.
"Hello, I'm over here.  *seeks your attention*"
"He kept staring at me, mumbling Bastet over and over again."
I've got your crazy right here. Come and get it.
Some of you I watch like a fucking hawk. Hunting.
.. I just don't want to know anymore.
"'Tread lightly, for the ground is hungry for bones.'"
"He's mine and he's mine and that one over there, he's mine too."
Shootin' those yellow bellied varmints down one by one. The no good bush whackin' barracudas.
Save a life. Your own. Put that muffler back on your motorcycle.
I was only ever a figment of your imagination.
"Dance to the record, love."
So twitter does listen. Good to know.
"This is where hearts and minds meet. Your misogynistic porn tweets won't serve you here. Try PornHub or FetLife, you stupid motherfucker."
"Mess with me, see what happens. I won't stop."
"Aw, did twitter give you a warning you foul fuck? Had to lock up all your accounts? That won't stop me from making you disappear for good."
"You don't have to post your likeness here. In fact sometimes, it's better if you don't. That's when one mind truly speaks to another."
"If they can give you a trophy, they are paying for twitter. Think about that for a moment."
I think I have a good heart but this fucking attitude though.
You should see the shit I don't post.
People here don't give a shit about you. They just retweet to gain followers. Then you have your smart ones that know what the fuck is up.
Why? Why not? Because. Because why?
Do you even know I'm here?
Can you hear me? Do you know that all my words are for you?
I like when a person loses themselves in me for a while.
"Sext: Why you retweeting the cunt that unfollowed me, lover?"
I miss my smile.
&lt;-------- Danger in the shape of a female.
I like your words.
My mind has a mind of it's own.
Surrey with a fringe on top. Don't ask.
I'm about to wash this hunk of brie down with a vat of red wine because im a fucking lady like that. Moo.
I can tell by some of your @'s that you don't get me which makes me hold on even tighter to the ones that do.
I am far too old to be playing the follow/unfollow game. Have a nice life.
Your 'full of yourself' is showing. Not an attractive look.
Stop the ride. This is where I get off.
I'm cold  hearted.
&lt;-------- Allergic to love.
Are you up for the challenge that is me?
My brain refuses to allow me to relinquish control.
I think I'm in love with my bed.
Watch what I can do (to you).
You were easy to find and you'll be easier to destroy.
Laughing all the way to your grave.
I want you to know it was me that did it to you.
I know you're still reading me you bastard. Wait for it. It's about to come crashing down around you.
You're making this far too easy for me.
"Hell hath no fury like me, motherfucker."
You're not gonna know what hit you.
"Wait for it, papi."
Blocking is not enough for me. I need certain people to 'disappear'.
It won't be long now.
Just a little twitter banter as I munch on my cheese and crackers. No biggie.
Little boy with the multiple accounts wants to see what I've got. I think I'll take his eyes first.
"I'm not the killer type but for you, I'd make the exception."
Post another snuff video and I will find you and film yours.
I'm in the mood for death. Yours.
I'd bait a bitch.
Don't mind me. Just watching your mouth as you speak. Seeing those lips move.
I suspect unfinished business.
It's funny how someone can completely leave your headspace and then one day.. poof.. they're there again.
One more #ff with my name attached and there will be blood.
I like your face.
This.
"It's all about you, baby and you know it."
Get and IQ and maybe we'll talk.
I want to buy a stun gun but I live in Canada. Somebody fucking hit me up.
"You and your words and what they provoke are the reason I don't feel comfortable walking alone outside at night, you stupid cunt."
"Some men will retweet whatever a pretty face is writing, no matter what the level of bullshit and nonsensicality they are uttering. Shame."
"""Drag me by my hair"" ??  Hopefully we've evolved a little more than that, little girl."
"If I'm not enough for you on my own, then move the fuck along and gather your harem, fucker."
"I don't want to talk about me, too fucking depressing. Tell me about you."
"I don't want to be your love slave, your princess, your baby girl. I just want you to be real with me."
This wine tastes like what the fuck was your name again?
Sometimes I worry he might be chatting up other women. The rest of the time I could fucking care less if he did.
"Somebody, anybody, everybody scream."
Sometimes they think they know you.  Little do they know.
&lt;-------- Property of no one.
I think I'm ready for the loon wagon.
"If I dream it and my brain experiences it, then why do I have to get up and do it?"
Why is waking up necessary in life?
An alarm clock that puts you to sleep.
"Once I'm in that head of yours, you'll have to blow your brains out to get rid of me."
Show me what you got.
There's nothing I can do for you if you don't let me in.
Climb aboard those motherfucking demons and ride.
My father calls me trouble and he knows me.
Melted cheese is one of the best things on the planet.
Take my hand.
Captivate me so I know it's real.
Tell me we belong together.
Sound of the rain falling on a tin roof.
Let's waste time.
"Together, we will forget the world."
Playing hard to get only works for so long.
I think you might be trouble. I like trouble.
You can sit next to me.
Come a little closer.
"In the midnight hour, she cried, let me fucking sleep, motherfucker."
I detest cheap sentiment.
Spill your poetry deep inside of me.
*crawls into your soul like a forbidden love*
"You say potato, I say vodka."
*swan dives into the abyss*
I am one with the darkness.
The shadows come to eat me alive.
Bidding it a fond farewell.
Letting it all go.
Absolutely fucking nothing.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?
Look at you playing your dangerous little game over there. So cute.
Cold as ice got nothing on me if you piss me off.
Cartoon avi cautioning all people here to be real with them. Um.
I will not be silenced.
Leave no room for doubt or I'm out.
A little fucking class please.
"Imagine for a moment, if every naked picture of a female you like, retweet or post is your own child. How would that make you feel, asshole?"
Passive aggressive motherfucking bullshit.
*sees her prey*  *closes in*
&lt;-------- The personification of kiss my fucking ass.
Turning down one married man after another because I'm nobody's fucking number two.
"I just threw my ipad across the room, in case anyone was wondering how my day was going."
There was never any truth there. Just a brazen disregard for all involved.
"No offence, but fuck off."
I'll hammer this square peg into that round hole.
Beautifully out of place.
I'm not your goddamned puppet.
*cuts strings*  *falls to the ground*
I refuse to jump through your hoops.
"'I felt like sleeping for five years, but they wouldn't let me.'"
The battle is real.
Your attention is what gets me off.
If I'm not a priority in your life then fuck off.
I can dream about you if I can't hold you tonight.
I fear I am nearing the end of my tether.
I destroy everything I touch.
"Every time I think this must be rock bottom, some motherfucker hands me a shovel."
"You have no fucking clue how it looks from where I sit. Futhermore, you don't fucking care."
Don't toy with me if you have no intention of playing.
Swearing is unattractive in a female?  Go and fuck your face.
Can you feel me in that heart of yours?
Let's go somewhere and never come back.
I used to sleep at night.
Your mind will be my playground.
"Reason not to engage with someone already in a relationship, they always have a fallback plan and you are not it."
*digs you (like) a grave*
You don't know what it is about that one person. It just is.
It doesn't matter if the words aren't for me. They are beautiful nonetheless.
Once upon a time there was a happy little girl. Then she grew up.
Feel it in your fucking bones.
Look at me like we're about to kiss.
Share a little of you today.
&lt;-------- Laughs and cries at the same time.
I stay up most nights.
You can thank music and alcohol that I'm not the world's next serial killer.
I'm wearing my favourite shade of indestructible.
Simon and Garfunkel calms my hateful heart.
I will murder you with a look.
A pretty fucking mess.
&lt;-------- Sunshine mixed with a hurricane.
"The story isn't over yet, fucker."
Let me rock your fucking world.
This red wine tastes like I don't want to go to work in the morning.
"If I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you."
He tries to play it like a football game but I am not a motherfucking ball.
Spring cleaning but people.
Playing with me is like playing with matches.
One: You lock the target. Two: You bait the line. Three: You slowly spread the net. Four: You catch the man.
"I don't like pimp daddies, pimp daddy."
"If you have to convince them, don't."
I'm standing on the precipice. Whether I jump or not remains to be seen.
Funny thing about 'later'. It never comes.
Fuck thinking are you good enough for them. Are they good enough for you?
"Having to explain how you feel when you don't even know yourself is an exercise in futility or fatality, yours."
I'm all wrong.
I'm not alright.
"I like my neighbours quiet, friendly and leaving me the fuck alone."
Young and stupid. She's perfect for you.
When the fuck did choke play become the norm?
Put your fingers around my throat and I will fucking end you.
Let's build a bed fort and stay in it all day long. No poopyheads allowed.
"The wider I open my eyes, the darker things get."
'Show me your soul and I'll show you your mate.'
Somewhere you'll never go.
Shock Block
Be real or die trying.
Some people are just here for the shock factor. I banish thee to the blocked folder.
You are a sorry state of affairs.
"You, Flirt. Don't start something you can't finish."
I put a spell on you.
You don't like me then I don't like you. Very simple really.
I like to push those fucking boundaries.
Pain so real it's palpable.
"The older I get, the less I care."
"I speak truth, nothing else."
You know you're not special to him when he retweets every pretty face he comes across.
"I've said it once, I'll say it again. The most important relationship you will have in life is with yourself."
My music is for me. I don't give a fuck if you like it or not.
"I'm ""ever drive in the car and think, what if I just veer into oncoming traffic?"" kind of fucked up."
Come and get lost with me.
&lt;-------- Born a little broken.
Gravity is working against me.
I might not make it this time.
You can't figure me out because I can't figure me out.
I'm one of a fucking kind. So are you.
I want to be the most confusing thing you've ever laid your eyes on.
Give me everything you have so I know it's real.
I've seen everything.
&lt;-------- Rules her life like a bird in flight.
Don't tell me I'm the prettiest you've ever seen. Tell me I'm the strongest.
I am the wolf. You are my prey.
"'Come on, dance with me. The earth is spinning. We can't just stand on it.'"
"Under the sheets with you, hiding from the world, together."
It's only a matter of time.
Nobody. Knows. Me.
I wonder if I look as empty as I feel.
I get lost in my head a little too much.
*falls asleep forever*
Waiting for my mind to snap. Surely that must make a sound.
A pill to forget everything and everyone.
Screams so loud that you can't even hear it.
"I'd like to scream, but fear if I do I'd never stop."
"A little class goes a long way, gentlemen."
Bring me a handful of dandelions. We can blow on the seeds and make our wishes.
'I am not like other people. I am burning in hell. The hell of myself.'
You can't hide in the light.
&lt;-------- Bird in flight.
Groupie hashtags = sheep
I feel your eyes on me.
"Be kind and accepting towards your fellow man. Be kind and accepting towards your fellow man.   Nope, not working because you're an idiot."
Reality--------&gt;Perception&lt;--------Truth
&lt;--------- In need of nepenthe.
Relationship status: Made dinner for two. Ate it all.
"You keep the sunshine, I'll take the rain."
Take the mask off when speaking to me.
Lay next to me so I can put my cold feet on your warm back.
"I know my worth, no discounts."
It doesn't affect me if I don't want it to.
I'm the kitty.
"Liking everything I say, liking everything she says. You men do like your sports, don't you?"
Don't fuck with me and nobody gets hurt. Very simple really.
"I love the way when a person tweets, everyone who can relate thinks it's about them. It's lovely, it's sweet, it's a fallacy."
"Pretty face doesn't mean pretty heart, motherfucker."
You could be my it boy.
"If you need a helping hand, look to your own."
Someday my prince will come and then I'm going to fucking kill him for taking so long.
Lady like with a side of fuck you.
"I don't need to be saved, I need to be found."
"I have no clue where I'm going, but I'm bloody well on my way."
You make my pupils dilate.
I am a fucking lady.
Come and rest your bones with mine.
You don't know demanding until you've met me.
How the fuck hard is it to give me your every waking moment?
"I'm not the girl your mother warned you about. I'm much, much worse."
Wolves? Growl back at them.
Don't be the girl who stayed down. Be the girl who got the fuck back up.
Don't fucking tell me what to feel.
"You stop doing that thing you did to win that girl, you lose that girl."
I love the smell of don't fuck with me.
I have been fighting myself since juvenility.
My bed doesn't want me to leave.
"*sounds the alarm*  If I have to get up for work on Saturday morning, then you will be getting up too."
*puts the lid back on top of an explosion*
"A river flows,  The bed, it sleeps The water has nightmares.  How's that? Can I be a fucking poet too?"
Come and get it.
"I've got your bitter right here, baby."
Sits back and watches as all of these professed Twitter poets take turns patting each other on the back.
"If it's games you want, I'm not your girl."
I am my own poison.
I am a weapon of mass destruction.
Undress my mind with your words.
I am that girl.
Loving me isn't easy.
"I'm a nice person until I feel I'm being taken advantage of, then I'm ruthless."
I am a ball of motherfucking sunshine.
Question mark.
&lt;-------- Shipwrecked girl searching for a survivor.
Depression is a soul killer.
I'm on the outside looking in. You're on the inside looking out.
The numbers don't matter. The words do.
Who are you calling a streettalker?
The older I get the more convinced I become that what I want does not exist.
I'm beginning to think you might be a little too 'nice' for me.
"My time zone is stop posting these fucking inane, idiotic music time zone tweets."
"The sooner you understand that I do whatever the fuck I want, the better you and I will get along."
"If I hear ""just snap out of it"" one more time, I will shank a motherfucker."
"An on and off switch, but for my head."
A tunnel of hell.
No one saving you because no one understands.
Walking on a tightrope of nightmares.
I'm edging on the cusp of reason.
That drowning feeling yet no water around.
"10 and 2? I drive at 6, with my knee."
My heart is no place for a coward.
I gave you love. You gave me hell.
Let's go down to the water's edge.
I really am a highway to hell. Caution: the bridge is out.
&lt;--------- All wild eyes and dreams.
You look exactly like an idiot.
This boat is sinking.
Can I touch you to see if you're real?
I'll take both.
"He once told me he would never retweet the 'dark stuff' I do, but that dark stuff is where I'm to be found."
The sound of the rain will put me to sleep and I love it.
"My father often tells me that had I been born in earlier times, they would have come for me and put me in a rubber room. I concur."
I never claimed sanity.
Some people just put a big old stupid smile on your face. I like those people.
"You poor unfortunate soul, in pain, in need, like me."
Ridiculous females. I compete with no one.
Show your face so we all know you're real.
"You've got questions, I've got answers."
Give me a real man and I'll show you a real woman.
Why does any of it matter?  It doesn't.
Don't dream it's over.
"'I love myself today, not like yesterday.'"
You there. Put the chocolate down and step away from the table.
I like words and yours are poetic.
We're all mad here. We're all sad here. We're all glad here. We're all rad here.
Open the fucking door and let me in already.
"We all have scars. Physical, emotional, lineal, subliminal."
"I'm sorry, but I can no longer engage in conversation with you because I don't speak motherfucking idiot."
I lay claim to what is mine.
"Stop retweeting bathroom selfies, fucker."
ISFP. What the fuck were you again?
Let's take on the world together and make our own rules.
The little red riding hood was doomed to fall in love with the big bad wolf.
You said you liked storms. Turns out you can only handle a little rain and I am a hurricane.
"Look at you, fucking up in monumental proportions."
"I have that affect on people. Don't worry, you'll get over it."
"Yes, you little whoresack, tweet about sex in the hopes that it gets yourself followers. Some of us don't have to do that."
"Don't fuck with me, sweetheart. I assure you I will fuck back in the most inappropriate manner."
Twitter is what connects me to real humanity.
Baby detonates for me.
"Between my love of the ocean and my over abundance of ever flowing tears, I'm extremely high sodium and bad for your health."
Washes the grave with silvery tears.
Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground.
On the side of the hill in the deep forest green.
His words speak to me.
You need a sprinkling of me.
Such are promises.
Resting in my arms again.
There is a monster that lives in me.
Emotional pain turns palpably physical when suppressed.
Soul mates in hate.
I like you. You get me.
I probably need some anger management but I'm too fucking pissed off to go.
Cut my fucking hours again and I'll cut your fucking throat.
Rape me with your words and show me no mercy.
Trouble waits for no man.
I play better because I don't follow the rules.
It's Saturday night and I'm here. That tells you pretty much all you need to know.
"For entertainment purposes, I like to write backwards on a piece of paper and then read it back in the mirror. I know. I'm fucked."
"If I see one more selfie, of one more person in their bathroom, in front of their mirror, holding their phone, I'm going to fucking launch."
We all live in cages. They're called our minds.
How many times is a person supposed to get knocked down before they consider shooting a motherfucker?
"Life is like a boxing match. Just as I think I'm okay, I get hit with a blow. The process repeats. It remains to be seen if I win the fight."
"I like you, strangeling. Tell me you like me too."
"Sing, sweet nightingale."
I recognize the behaviour.
I've gone from angry to wise. To what do I owe this honour?
You sound really married.
"In astrology, the moon is my ruling planet. That explains a lot."
"Get in there deep, baby. Show me what you're made of."
Being heart-banged never felt so good.
"Goddamn, I am one territorial piece of work."
Stop being so sweet. I might have to slap you.
"Attention. If I'm not getting it, neither are you."
"Cute avi, tweets like a dumb fuck.  *moves on*"
"Smart, dark and a poet too? I'm so confused."
"I'm such a fucking narcissist. Someone likes all my tweets and I think,  ""He's a smart one."""
I'm like a mirror. What you give me is what I reflect back on to you.
"Stupid fuck. - All around, easy to find. Someone special. - Dig a little."
What do you believe?  What don't you believe?  Who do you believe?  Who don't you believe?  *Always consider the source.
*weeds out the assholes*  It's cool.
"Pretty little girl, she cries."
"Pretty little girl, she tries."
"Pretty little girl, she lies."
Lush for love.
'I'm not going down on my knees begging you to adore me.'
I see the special in you.
Understand me.
Wasted love.
Your soul or mine?
I like you but I want to kill you.
I feel you.
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
I don't mean no harm.
Did I mention I was a sarcastic bitch?
The answer is blowing in the wind.
That feeling when you don't even know what the fuck you're feeling.
"Oh people, how you do make me titter."
All this fucking twitter drama and I'm just sitting here eating my popcorn.
And that's why I don't either.
They don't fucking care.
It doesn't matter who it is.
To see who bites.
They're just slinging their shit to see what sticks.
"When you think they're reaching out to you, but they're not."
Shitty people teach you not to put up with bullshit in life.
"""Well, you don't 'look' depressed.""  My apologies. I forgot my dark cloud at home today."
*dies of laughter*
Am I drinking this drink or is it drinking me?
I use the word fuck as punctuation.
"Your soul may be as pitch as black, but it is still fucking beautiful."
"Hahaha, you and me."
I eat passive-aggression for dinner.
"What we have here, my friend, is a fuck, shit stack."
Hurt me again. It feels so good when it stops.
A sesquipedalian writer does not an intellect make.
Care to take a stroll across this burning bridge?
What's the matter with me? Nothing. What the fuck's the matter with you?
"Cut down fresh flowers and watch them rot and die in a glass vase. People will do that to you as well, if you let them."
"Screaming so loud, but no one can hear because it's all going on inside your head."
I'm not trying to be the difference. I am the difference.
A simpler life. A little more empathy. A little more loyalty. That.
My cousin shot himself in the head due to heartbreak. I vowed that day that I would never allow anyone to turn me into that deep of a mess.
We're all broken. The question is to what degree?
&lt;-------- Sapiosexual.
A beautiful darkness.
You need to surround yourself with people who get you and know your worth. The rest can go and fuck themselves.
The beach and you. I'm there.
I can count more on Barnes&amp;Noble's nightly 2:00am advertising email than I can on any person in my life. Fuck.
Don't think inside the box. Don't think outside the box. Throw that motherfucking box away.
Forever in my grasp.
You won't escape me.
My mind is a maze. Get lost in it.
His dark mind will be my playground.
He is the shadows.
&lt;-------- Broken doll dreaming of a boy with glue.
One sliver of ice to stab you in the heart and make it as cold as mine.
You don't like me? It doesn't matter. You like her? It doesn't matter.
It's hard to remember to live before you die.
A lovely smile doesn't indicate a happy heart
"Enjoy that shine, little one. It doesn't last."
It has nothing to with anyone's inadequacies and everything to do with my own.
I don't think what I'm looking for even exists.
Love did not save a wretch like me.
Last chances usually don't come with warnings.
Sweet man.
What the fuck does a negative plus a negative equal again?
"Hey, cuckold, take your fucking mukbang and stick it up your bukkake."
"Aggressive is the only way I know how to be, unless it's you."
"No, thank you. I can't be fixed."
I think I've stopped existing.
They call it depression. I call it motherfucking war.
My lonely is looking for your lonely.
The thing I miss most about my ex is nothing.
The only person you will be carrying a torch for is me as you try and escape my darkest depths.
I'm still me and you're still an idiot.
I will eat you up and still have room for dessert.
Show me something new. Show me you.
"Oh stop it. You don't hear me spewing how perfect I am, do you? I'm not. No one is."
"People always so concerned about losing others. If they want to leave, escort them out."
I think that watching true crime is the only thing that stops me from committing one.
Feel that rage burn a hole right through you.
Keeps on burning in your mind.
I am rotten to the core.
"Some things you just can't avoid in life, like people."
That's all I'm going to say about that.
You will thank me one day when you come to the realization that what I did was for the best for all involved.
"Contrary to popular belief, I'm not angry, I'm just done."
There are beginnings in endings.
Infinitely deep and forever shining.
"""What big eyes you have.""  The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad."
They call us 'hard women' as if survival could ever be fucking delicate.
"There's something more in you, but not everyone is going to see it."
&lt;-------- Heart like a thunderstorm.
Run to me.
Colours you have never seen before.
A rainbow with teeth.
'In restless walks she'll prowl the night.'
What a dream I had.
Toss me one of your smiles.
An island never cries.
A rock feels no pain.
Simon and Garfunkel ftw.
Time it was and what a time it was.
Take my hand. Let's run away.
"Buckle up, baby. You're in for a bumpy ride."
"FYI, I am the jealous type. Territorial to a fault."
He thinks he's got a bevy of bitches hanging off his every word. Fucking nope.
"If someone else has the ability to steal your heart away, they can have it."
All I see is you.
You are an anti-climax.
"If you're looking for sex, might I suggest 1-800-BANG-A-BABE."
You feel me?
*straddles your mind*
You think you know me. You don't fucking know me.
Be on your best behaviour.
"This is a drama free zone. Except for my own, of course."
I knew it was only a matter of time.
Shut up and love me.
*defies laws of gravity*
Everyone has a story to tell. Listen.
Ignite my wanderlust.
I only exist in your mind.
I can't mend.
I leave my burdens at your door.
I can see through you. See to the real you.
I'm looking for more.
You made me this way.
I don't think there is any saving me.
I have died a hundred times.
I go back to black. It's where I fucking belong.
"Got to lock 'er up for a while, lovers. These hills are full of gaslighters."
Mind games. Games of the mind.
It's all just bullshit. It's all just a big fucking festering pile of stinking bullshit.
I can't remember when I've last been this furious with someone.
"You just don't fuck with a fucked up person, fucker."
Calm the fuck down. Did I ask for your hand?
I'm a handful. Don't think I don't fucking know it.
When music gives you goosebumps. That.
I can't help myself.
"You'll be, like in a movie."
I could be wrong. I could be right.
"Once I'm in that head of yours, good luck getting me out."
*awakens your sleeping heart*
'That was her edge. Her secret weapon. She didn't give a shit.'
*travels in and out of your mind*
This is not a love song.
Good for you. I keep on repeating the same old ones.
I've got something that you might like.
Cool beans. Guess I'm a psychopath then.
There is enough fire in me to put hell to shame.
I am too old to be tamed. This lioness is not biting.
You don't like me. I don't like you. Let's get married.
Always remember you only see what I choose to show you. You have been warned.
Get over yourself. This is real man's territory you're in.
Thank you for your participation. This has been a social experiment. Please put your seats in the upright position and exit to the rear.
Humans. Intriguing little monsters.
"He thinks I don't see your tricks, but I fucking do."
"You wanna fucking play do you? Come out, come out wherever you are."
"Never fucking tell me what to do. I promise you, it will have the opposite effect."
I will make room in my backyard for you.
You can't get burned when you're the fire.
I watch true crime. I know what to do with your body.
"I don't believe in organized religion. No, I'm not going to hell because I'm already there."
"Something I can sink my teeth into, please."
I should have stayed asleep today.
"I have a lot of rough edges. Careful not to cut yourself, dear."
"To the dude retweeting all the spandex butt shots, if I wanted to see that much ass, I'd go and visit my ex."
"Every girl I see wearing florals today and I'm just over here wearing black, sacrificing bats and being me."
"You can tell a lot about people by their wedding rings. Like, if they don't have one, they are exceedingly smart."
"Meet me under the blanket of stars, my love."
Trying to untangle the knots in my life.
Unleashing of an anger so pure and raw.
The very next person that revs their motorcycle engine will be walking home without their motorcycle engine.
Straight into the open mouth of hell.
"""You look like hell.""  Yes, I just got back."
&lt;------- Nothing but a dreamer.
Can I put my arms around you?
Two worlds colliding.
"I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere."
Try and cut this rose in full bloom and see what happens.
Send me an angel right now.
&lt;------- Ripped to shreds from the inside out.
Tell me a love story.
When someone stands out to you and you have no fucking clue why. That.
"Screams so loud, but inside my head."
"There is nothing to fear except children's laughter, in the middle of the night."
It is whatever you make it.
Twitter folk. My kind of people.
I see what you did there.
"How could you possibly know what I want, when I don't even know myself?"
Fear me. Love me.
Word play is all the rage.
Is there such a thing as a knight in shining armour? I say yes.
You poor unfortunate soul. Let me help you shine. It's what I do.
People are not beautiful because of the way that they look. People are beautiful because of the way that they are.
I am the embodiment of all the people I have ever encountered.
Etymological intoxication.
*disappears into the night*
How many licks does it take to get to the centre of loneliness?
Did I crawl inside of it or did it crawl inside of me?
Illicitly provocative provocation.
Tryst in the dead of night.
We are all wanderers.
What are you hiding?
What makes you tick?
I'm attracted to extremes.
The moon and the stars are the only light I see.
I was born sick.
Fresh poison each day.
No one knows who I really am.
"If you don't get me, that's ok, you don't have to."
Someone bring me a spinning wheel. I want to prick my finger on a spindle and sleep for 100 years.
"I'm here, you're there, let's just leave it at that."
"Go to sleep you sweet, sweet man."
C'est la vie.
'Boring damned people. All over the earth. Propagating more boring damned people. What a horror show. The earth swarmed with them.'
That's it. I'm done. Go away.
"You disappoint me, but then again, everyone does."
You simply don't get it and you never fucking will.
"I will not be classified, motherfucker."
'What a flammable heart I've been given.'
Once in a while we will find.
"I'm not a gold digger, I'm a soul digger."
Can you hear my heart beating for you?
Let's run away.
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear.
*reigns*
I can smell the manipulation from all the way over here.
"If I were you, I wouldn't test me. I'll fail every fucking time."
I like carwashes. A few sweet minutes of escape from the real world.
Everyone has a secret world inside of them.
Never dilute yourself for the sake of others.
Burn with my touch.
Life is bullshit. Accept it and move on.
This is who I am. If you don't like it you can kindly fuck off.
I am attracting all the wrong men so there must be something I am doing wrong.
"You keep on looking for that beautifully ripened peach, yet you keep on coming across the bitterest of lemons."
"If one more taken man hits up my DM, I will commit Murder One."
"Oh my fucking ever loving God in heaven, make your presence known before I lose my ever fucking shit completely."
"What a sad, sad, sad, sad world we live in."
It's the broken ones I relate to the best.
Go and sit in the corner and think about what you just did.
"That's right, off you go. Go back to simple, it's what you're good at."
*sighs forever*
I'm looking for different.
You think you have me all figured out by what I tweet? You're adorable.
"Ok, here's what I want.. I want off the grid, I want the beach, I want laughter and I want you."
"If we were face to face, I would annihilate you. As it stands here, I will just ask that you kindly shut the fuck up."
"You just can't get away from the @ers, can you? The @ers that know motherfucking everything."
Life is a gift? I'm going to need to see a receipt. I might want to exchange it.
I always tell the truth because I enjoy being a bitch.
A good place to put an inspirational tweet is up your ass.
"If you can't handle me at my worst, I'll just go and find someone who can."
"I want to meet the right person for me, but I also want to be left the fuck alone."
Kiss my politically incorrect ass.
I eat wolves for breakfast.
Unfollow for an unfollow?
"Fuck you and you and you, and you there in the back, fuck you too."
Propagation of nonsensicality.
I don't feel a damn thing anymore.
I'm a fucking disaster area.
I don't want to taste the motherfucking rainbow.
It's all just make believe and pretend.
"Are you reading me now, baby?"
I think there are far more tortured souls out there than contented ones.
Time is trying to have its way with me.
The point is that there is no fucking point.
Soul numbing adventures.
Eaten alive but not in the good way.
Tears of a clown.
Fight that black hole before it consumes you.
Angels in the moonlight.
Demons on horseback.
I like my bacon crispy.
The darkness lives in me.
Who I am is not always who I show.
Raining again. Apt.
I am more than what you see.
"'I had the chance to be loved a million times, but I always ran back into the woods, into the wild.'"
I need more Bukowski in my life.
It's not my fault you're married to an idiot.
She kills with her eyes.
*free falls into the unknown*
I'm on the ledge.
I'm like the camel with all the straws on his back.
Do the hustle.
You're a bitch? That's cute. I stand before you as the Queen of all bitches.
*lapses into a coma*
Some of your views on male/female relationships are so bloody antiquated.
What kind of fucked up rabbit hole have I fallen into?
I can not respect that opinion because it's fucking dumb.
Please go away and take your stupid with you.
"You're actually kind of a classless fuck, aren't you?"
Getting up before noon on a Saturday should be against the law.
You love me and I love me too.
Where the fuck is my pot of gold?
&lt;-------- Fucked up and knows it.
I don't know if I can ever let the anger go. It's become an integral part of who I am.
"25+ year olds still living at home with mommy and daddy, I can't respect your struggle because you haven't had one yet."
That thing they do that annoys the fucking shit out of you.. like breathing.
The sweetest little idiosyncrasies I see now will probably make me want to kill him in the end.
"""I've been out on the ocean"
"Sailing alone, travelling nowhere"
And you've been running on high ground
With just you around
Your heartbeat's the only sound
"But I know, once in a while we will find"
The sound of your heart beats with mine
And when it's time
"I'll leave the ocean behind."" #differentworlds"
Mute me and I'll
I scare myself when I'm angry.
I think Vodka is addicted to me.
You just turned into every other man I've ever met.
Fucking ridiculous humans.
Show me something different because that's not going to cut it with me.
Is it really too much to ask for someone's undivided attention when conversing with them or am I reaching for the stars here? FFS.
Give yourself to me.
Yawn so wide I swallow the world whole.
I offended someone again. What ever will I do?  *takes nap*
A momentary lapse in judgment. A lifetime commitment.
An endless loop I can't escape.
I keep repeating the same fucking patterns.
*goes to sleep forever*
Are you happy?
I'll be okay.  Is that what you want me to say?
"""Where does it hurt?""  I don't understand the question."
'My heart is a thousand years old. I am not like other people.'
You understand them but they don't understand you.
We'd make better strangers.
We all die alone in our own asylums.
A forest of promises.
Find the rose under my cypress.
You can't be real with *some people.   *most
I don't want hear about how wonderful women are. I am a woman. We are not wonderful.
Like a good challenge? You'll fucking love me.
You don't need to understand me. I understand me.
I came. I saw. I got the hell out of there.
Stand by your words.
They should have sent me to the nuthouse. I love cashews.
"Don't bait the tiger, fuckers. It's feeding time at the zoo."
One more motherfucker pisses me off and I'm going on a rampage.
"I don't trust a living soul and that is a very sad, sad place to be."
And exactly what time yesterday do you think I was born?
Do it to them before they do it to you.
I've seriously had it with people.
Play dumb long enough and you turn dumb.
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a fucked up individual. You can't hold that over my head.
Pieces of me no one ever sees.
Buy me food. Make me food. Be my food.
"Hand in hand we walk away, from each other."
*wreaks havoc*
"If you take me for a fool, you are one yourself."
Lambaste. It's a good word.
Don't you fucking worry about me. I will find other ways to occupy my time.
Dreamt of you last night. You ignored me.
A dick with an attitude will get you nothing.
Control makes me dizzy with desire.
*grins wickedly*
"Come Peter Pan, I've left my window open for you."
&lt;------- reads James Joyce for the love notes.
"I don't need fists, I will tear you apart with my words."
I forgive myself.
Humaning can be tough.
"Tell me all your dirty thoughts, lover."
ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha....  I done caught me a live one.. and he's a dumb motherfucker too. Score!!!!!!!!
I would love to end your life but you are not worth the jail time.
Fuck off.
The rage builds. It has nowhere to go.
"I hold the power, not you."
No one is worth that much grief. I don't care who the fuck you are.
"You give people the power they wield over you. Your fault, not theirs."
"If my tweets offend you, then don't fucking read them."
I see the asshole that you are.
"People will suck the very life force out of you if you let them. Here's the trick, don't let them."
oh.my.god. This.
I love what you do to me.
"Oh, to be young and stupid again, like you."
I will speak my mind and you will sit there and like it.
"""Please wait until the ride has come to a complete stop before getting off.""  Fuck you, I do what I want.  *dies*"
Wait for it.
Don't hand me the gun and then get mad when I shoot it.
See this brick?  *bashes in your skull*  It was the brick that did it.
*trapped in the confines of reality*
I recognize you. You are insane.
Cherry.
Die twice so I know it's real.
The vodka made me do it.
"You are not dark, you are tinted."
You can die now.
I said it first.
Stampede your emotions to death.
Trade your life for a popsicle.
The gentleman will always win out in the end. At least with me he will.
'To be ill adjusted to a deranged world is not a breakdown.'
I was a wicked girl.
I'll swallow you whole.
It's okay not to be understood.
I try and follow happy. Unsuccessful so far.
"I'm so dry I'm spitting cotton.  Bring me a drink, fucker."
I can not allow you to lie to yourself.
I don't want to hold back.
"I'm waiting for someone to surprise me.. with their thoughts, their views, their take on life. Something different, something lovely."
The only person I trust is myself and even that's not foolproof.
The problem is you.
I fell in love now I feel nothing at all.
*rains on your parade*
No human contact.
No need to act like a dick just because you have one.
All toxic people should be shipped out to their own island somewhere.  The island would sink due to overpopulation and they would all drown.
The only thing I have to show for my troubles is this wine.   Mmmm.. red.
"You don't even realize the full extent of their sexiness, and then they show you."
"Shhh, it'll be our little secret."
*knocks the complacent out of you*
I'm fucking up your program.
Damn right I'm a maniac.
My sadness tastes like the sea.
&lt;-------- Untamed heart.
"Give, give, give, give and all they do is take, take, take, take."
People that blow hot and cold need to typhoon themselves right the fuck out of my life.
The last straw has been placed. That camel doesn't have a hope in hell now.
I think I've just been blown off and all I can do is laugh. It's come to that.
"Does it really matter?  No, it doesn't."
"Go ahead, underestimate me."
*climbs in shell*  How lovely and warm and secluded it is in here. Think I'll stay a while.
Fucking nope.
"Why don't you run along and fetch your balls out of your wife's purse, pimp daddy."
Shame about your face.
We are all haunted by something.
Wow.
Absolutely fucking not.
"J'existe, c'est tout."
"I'm not socially inept, I just like corresponding with real people. That's why I'm here."
Talk dirty to me.
Toxic soup for the soul.
"Apparently, I never learn."
For you it's a game.
Relationship status: What the fuck are you looking at?
Pro Tip: You don't need to death grip that steering wheel with both hands. It's not fucking going anywhere.

Leonardo DiCaprio!! About fucking well time!! &lt;3
Ennio Morricone! My favourite! YES!!!! &lt;3
I'm fucked up. Love me anyway.
"'As we got older, we let the monsters into our beds.'"
Threats are for the threatened.
Come and get me.
I got bad vibes.
Go to your room and think about what you've done.
You ask all the wrong questions.
Go sell your games to Mattel. You'll get top dollar.
You are easily able to excuse yourself because you were never really here.
"That's not love, baby."
Your penis don't live here anymore.
Kiss me insane.
Do it now.
Move me.
I love hard.
Murder prevention but on a budget.
My favourite cereal is wasabi.
It is most certainly not all about that bass.
"I've been dreaming about you.  - Me, to my bed."
There are no coincidences.
"Softly, softly we can meet with a little...."
"Well, he'll spin a tale.."
Then.. he kissed my cheek....
Smile was so inviting....
I was so excited.
Remember.. walking in the sand..
Idieda hundredtimes.
What can I say? You got me on a good day.
I no longer have the time or the patience to deal with rude people. That's what the block button is for. Use it in good health. I do.
This is a bullshit retweet.
I am too much. I am never enough.
Grab my hair like you grabbed my heart.
"I don't want in your bed, just in your head."
I make my appearances in the dead of night.
"If you like the writings of Bukowski, then you are already a friend of mine."
Leave them hanging and someone else will pick up the slack.
You wanna play?
"If you have my attention, you'll fucking know it."
'Suck my cockiness. Lick my persuasion.'
I'm not crazy. I'm insane.
"Hey, you."
Why can't you see me?
"There's a big, black sky over my head."
*fights conscience*
I'll keep searching.
I will run to find peace of mind.
"You can write it in a letter, baby."
It's 2:20am. Let's go for a walk.
We always crave the ones that can't or won't love us back.
A cacophony that resonates.
You are my favourite disappointment.
"You can't cage a dragon, love."
"If you have nothing to hide, then show me your face."
Please excuse my sarcasm. It's who I am.
"Some people are so sweet, and then you've got your assholes."
Run away with me.
You can be my private dancer.
"Because I'm fierce, bitch."
"With each new day, I feel like my tolerance level has been stretched to its limit and with each new day a little more bullshit comes my way."
Give me one reason.
I am all that I have.
"I am underwater or, at least, it feels like I am."
Being surrounded by the wrong people is a very lonely experience indeed.
My heart shut down that night and hasn't been open for business since.
"Placate the beast, not the love."
"One day, sweet day, our lips will meet again. Until then, I will kiss you with my words."
You will be mine.
There is only one man I see and he doesn't even know I'm on the prowl.
*screams forever*
'Try walking in my shoes. You'd stumble in my footsteps.'
"See the stars, they're shining bright."
*turns the music up*
Breathe in. Breathe out.
Don't push me because I will fuck you up.
"You @ me? You take your fucking cheap account and your blatant disrespect for women and stick it where the fucking sun don't shine, fucker."
Show me you.
"Listen, all I ask is that you don't waste my fucking time."
"'I'm not going down on my knees, begging you to adore me.'"
You do not complete me. I complete me.
"And now that I have your attention, do I really want it? #fuckinggamespeopleplay"
You are all that I see.
"' I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch.'"
It's a wagon of bands. Let's jump the fuck on.
*turns back the hands of time*
Tell me you can hear me.
Time passes like a dream.
Melodic unification.
Haunting eloquence.
Sacredness in tears.
Art of the striptease.
Atmospheric disturbance.
Erotic flower woman.
Whoopsie! That one is from Toronto. *ducks for cover*
Men on the internet are so cute when they take you for an idiot.
You can always depend on the kindness of strangers. @PowerOfP338
I have to bury a loved one and you're pining over some lost internet love? Get the fuck over yourself.
*walks quietly into empty spaces*
Life sinks its teeth into me.
&lt;------- Deer in headlights.
These walls were built for tearing down.
Move over and make some room for me.
Perhaps tomorrow I will wake up and the last 10 years of my life will just have been some bad fucking dream.
"Booyah, you're a fucking idiot."
All cages are equipped with doors.
Tell me why.
"You think you're free? Look around, you are not free."
"You bring your heart, I'll bring my knife."
We all have our crosses to bear. Some a little heavier than others.
"You are not a vampire, my dear. So take out the coloured contacts and simmer the fuck down."
The delusions of youth. So cute.
I lost my heart a very long time ago and never got it back.
Sometimes I wonder why I even fucking bother.
"You are the reason I drink, fucker."
"It doesn't matter how much of yourself you give to them, they will still turn their attention to someone else."
I don't need all that nonsensical bdsm role-playing hoopla to get off. Just give me a real man with that look in his eyes and I'm done.
Put your hands on my throat and I will end your life.
Why do people here hide their faces?
*cues the theme song from Twilight Zone*
Stop!
You wanna dance with me?
"I'm not sure but maybe if you remove all that porn off your feed, you might find the nice girl you claim to be looking for, fucker."
"'Don't threaten me with love, baby. Let's just go walking in the rain.'"
I will let you go exactly as I found you.
Maybe yes. Maybe no. Maybe fuck off.
I was bound to recognize you.
I am hundreds and hundreds of years old.
All caught up in the hoax.
Nothing affects me unless I let it.
Love me to unconsciousness.
Intoxicate me.
I'll be your drug of choice.
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet.
Touch me.
Come here. Kiss me. Now.
You.
You took my life with you.
You took my dreams with you.
You took my hopes with you.
Tell me another lie.
I've been known to bite.
My soul is stained.
A graveyard full of unmet dreams.
Death is when the story ends.
Without night there is no day.
Embrace the darkness.
It's important not to hide the madness.
"You can't break me, darling. You don't own that kind of power."
I have nothing left to say to you and that is saying a lot.
Valentine's Day  Massacre
Read me. Get it. Fuck off.
"If you can't be loyal to me, then we have nothing further to discuss."
Sloppy seconds ain't my style.
"Don't embarrass yourself, dear. I'll do that for you."
You must think I'm stupid and I am anything but.
Circles and triangles. I need to break out of these patterns and set myself free.
"Fuck all the single ladies, where are all the single men at?"
I am way too old to be treated like a child.
"Not in the mood for your jack-assery today, thanks."
"Your move mate. Keep in mind, I'm the queen."
"That's right, baby. Take off those rose-coloured glasses and see me for who I really am."
"Good fuck, I've fallen into someone's retweeting loop."
Do you ever wonder why you do the fucking things you do?
"Nothing is that dirty, except maybe, my thoughts."
Take your time. I'll just be sitting over here while you play catch up.
"Nice one, gopher."
I make me wonder.
"Maybe there is no such thing as Twitter and maybe, just maybe, you're in the psyche ward having made us all up inside your head."
"A bit of self-created drama, methinks."
"I'm so disappointed in so many people. That's not on them, it's on me. Clearly, I expected too much."
I love my dad. Only man who ever had my back.
I am a collection of paradoxes.
People as umbrellas. Shady as fuck.
"Trust your instincts. If something feels off, it is."
"So if I block someone, I can no longer see their tweets but they can still see (and steal) mine? What kind of fucked up logic is that?"
You can only lose so many pieces before there's nothing left.
"Save the bullshit for the farmers, fucker."
Books are all pages and chapters. So is life.
"You make the block button look so good, baby."
"I am a fucking flower, asshole."
You're going to need a bigger shovel.
"Peut-√™tre , je vais commencer √† √©crire en fran√ßais."
"All love is conditional. Until I find otherwise, you can keep yours."
"If T&amp;A and cutesy BS is what you seek, move the fuck along. We are fresh out here."
This whole 'think positive' is an insult to those of us who can't readily achieve it. Fuck you and your optimism.
There is a reason behind everything.
Murderers just don't happen.
I have always been the odd (wo)man out.
So far away but still so near.
I keep dancing on my own.
She can kill with her smile.
"Stay in my arms, if you dare."
There are a handful of days in my life that beat the shit out of me. Today was one of them.
I'm here but I'm really gone.
So many fuckers on my sacroiliac.
Whose motherfucking toes am I stepping on now?
Give it to me right or don't give it to me at all.
I'm going nowhere.
Sleep is my only escape.
Could someone please explain to me why I persist in carrying on?
A cold shower but with words instead of water.
*swings from the chandelier*
"One, two, three drink"
Some men have a tendency to tweet predominately about sex and/or sports. It's the ones that don't who pique my interest.
I will respect your love of all things sports the same way you will respect my capacity not to give a fuck.
Spending Sunday in bed.
"Let's get it on, lover."
I will stare you down for a song.
"People who mistreat/abuse animals should be shot on site. No trial, just dead."
"Everyone all, ""Don't talk to my tc, he's my tc"".... and I'm just over here eating my banana."
"I would tar and feather you, but you'd probably fucking enjoy it."
Writing up stories in my head.
All behaviour is suspicious to me.
Might I suggest the Hemlock Salad?
I will personally horizontalize your perpendicularity.
I see your holier than thou attitude and raise you a finger.
"Pseudo twitter police, AKA people with far too much time on their hands, on the prowl today poo-pooing how and what we choose to tweet. FO"
People talk............. a lot.
Careful. Your passive-aggressive is showing.
I exist intuitively.
I'll be my own fucking fairy godmother.
Melancholy. It's a good word.
"Grunting, growling, groaning. I'm down for all three."
A sledgehammer but for emotions.
You will search for me in another.
I owe so much yet I have so little.
Maybe the dragon needs saving.
&lt;------- Daydream believer.
*falls into the night*
Love is a state of mind.
Don't take the Twitter too seriously and you will make it out relatively unscathed.
It's official. I hate people.
Madness is a gift.
The world isn't pitiful.  People are.
I'm ready to kill.
"I'm on the outside, looking in."
It's like living a death.
"If you're a quiet lover, I have absolutely no use for you."
"Who's blushing now, lover?"
Those lips though.
This will not end well.
You two are well matched. Now get the fuck off my feed.
Is holy water supposed to sizzle when it hits your skin?
"I'm not one of your groupies, fucker."
Pleased to meet you. I'm dead inside.
Go ahead and feed the bad wolf.
An interesting specimen you are.
"Men who speak of their prowess in the bedroom. If you're saying it, you aren't doing it."
"Judging from all the 'in the ass' tweets I'm seeing, I'd say do yourself a favour and don't follow me, boy. I don't have time for that shit."
"Sweet, genuine people with no ulterior motives are a reminder of just how fucked up and tainted my mind is."
You have my attention atm.
Shitty people make excellent fertilizer.
&lt;----------- In a complicated relationship with alcohol.
Why the hell would I want you in my life if you didn't want me in yours?
I swear too much and you breathe too much.
These porn tweets are getting old. Why don't you post a picture of your face getting blown off instead? That would excite me more.
I'm in a love/hate relationship with myself.
Bam! Pow! Smash!
It's ok not to like my beloved true crime shows. It just means you won't see it coming when I off you.
"""Here are some accounts we suggest you follow.""  Fuck you, Twitter. I do what I want."
Creationists can kiss my coccyx.
Shhh... just let it happen.
"'Terrible things happen to good people every day. Consequentially, I am not one of the good people. I am one of the terrible things.'"
Hide your face so I know you're ugly.
"Guys always talking about wanting to put it in a girl's ass, who defiled you as a kid?"
Tell me something I haven't already heard again and again and again.
Your shock tactics bore me.
There is no such thing as Twitter Elite. Just people with no jobs who still manage to buy followers.
I just cringed. Is that a thing? Do people still do that?
My phone is posting shit twice today. Must be OCD like me.
I like all things cheese.
"If I can't keep this anger in check, some poor motherfucker is gonna go down."
"You give and you give and you give until one day, you're all out of give and it's time to starting getting."
"Not tonight dear, I've got a heartache."
I make no promises.
I have a strong dislike for you.
"If I don't keep this anger in check, some poor motherfucker is gonna get shanked."
I love everything cheese.
Tell the Devil I'm home.
"'The fuckers.  There, I feel better.  God-damned human race.  There, I feel better.'"
Fucking with me? Perhaps not your smartest move.
You change your header more often than a whore changes johns.
*wishes self away*
I could sleep forever.
"Broken bits of fragmented pieces that, when viewed whole, become something beautiful? You can just call me kaleidoscope."
"'If I could, I would run away and find myself. I've been lost for far too long.'"
*bats eyes in your general direction*
I'm coming up only to hold you under.
"Happiness is a choice? So is murder, fuck you."
"In the blink of an eye, everything changes."
There was something in the air that night.
Never have I dealt with anyone more difficult than myself.
*sells seashells by the seashore*
I need me an intellectual.
Sports bore the fuck out of me.
"Oh God, he's watching sports again, or should I say still."
"Calm your whore-mones, bitch. You're getting slut on me."
"You respond to one of my tweets with 'so'?  Well, 'sew' a needle pulling thread to stitch up that stupid mother fucking mouth of yours."
I use bad words.
I can't sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!!!!!!!! Motherfucker.
Beauty sleep &gt; Ugly awake
Perhaps we are all exactly where we are supposed to be.
*takes it to the limit one more time*
With or without you.
Tomorrow is going to be a fantastic day because I am going to make it so.
"Petulance, at your age? Tsk."
You can't break my heart. I never had one to begin with.
You can take that snotty little attitude of yours and stick it where the sun don't shine.
Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
"Chew me up and spit yourself out, fucker."
Ginger tastes like soap.
I'm always in love with the idea of impossible.
There is a distinct calm coming over me. That's never a good thing.
"You're a dead man walking, fucker."
You've got your good people and then you've got your assholes.
Padded cell with a view.
"Get my room ready, papi."
Notify the loon ward that I'll be around.
One day I'm just going to start screaming and I'm not going to stop.
I am guilty of being imperfect.
Sounds like me.
Creative souls are all around me.
Being serenaded is highly underrated.
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues.
I notice everything. I just don't say anything.
I've been added to a list with sports. Kill me.
*bathes in all the crazy*
A murderous desire.
"A twitter app that unfollows an account automatically, right after it unfollows you. Get on that shit."
Lost in the fire or built from it?
I finally have a moment.
My father was told by my mother that he needed to wear slippers in my house when visiting because apparently he left his balls in her purse.
*lights self on fire*  Trailblazer
I will tell it like it is every single time. idgaf
I don't know what I feel anymore.
I wonder....  a lot.
He has me completely confused.
Something must be getting lost in the translation.
Beautifully out of place.
Don't tell me what to do and I won't tell you where to go.
I know your secrets.
Get on my level.
Homicidal rage activated.
"Sober me is much worse than drunk me. Much, much, much worse."
I like to think of myself as unfuckwithable.
People that try to make you feel bad on purpose? Nope.
A shooting star across the sky.
Don't look back.
"If you're wondering how an outsider knows your business, check your insider."
I had the craziest dream last night.
The forest is very dangerous. Stick to the path.
These are the stories of the days of our lives.
'I was your cure and you were my disease. I was saving you but you were killing me.'
Tell me you love me but kiss her goodnight.
"If he'll do it with you, he'll do it to you."
"You're filled with love? Great, I'm filled with hatred."
Mess with me. See what happens.
"Circles and triangles, bitch."
"By all means, continue adoring me while you're busy fucking your wife."
It never would have worked out between us. I'm a Cancer and he's an idiot.
The sarcasm is wasted on that one.
Do you feel me now?
"Always watching, never stopping."
"Don't mind me, I'm just talking to myself."
Sign your name across my heart.
Wasabi makes me happy. Don't ask.
"*flies off the radar, free as a bird*"
"I need to buy a secluded island somewhere and live off the land.  Vodka is made out of potatoes, yes?"
My social media usage is on a downward spiral.
Round and round we fucking go.
Extrication is imminent.
*dances the seven veils*
"""That was a really nice thing you did.""  *never fucking does that again*"
*raises a little hell*
Great balls of fire. What the fuck is this shit?
Am I that easy to forget?
I'm waiting for impossible to happen.
He recognizes himself in me.
Push me into the fire and hear my screams.
"If he likes your 'crazy', he's a keeper."
I am under no obligation to make sense to you.
He likes high-heels. I prefer flip-flops.
You don't love me. Big fucking deal.
You can not destroy me. I destroy me.
"Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to kill I go."
Where my twits at?
Wow. I'm so fucking damaged someone wrote a poem about me.
"""how far have you walked for men who‚Äôve never held your feet in their laps?"
"how often have you bartered with bone, only to sell yourself short?"
why do you find the unavailable so alluring?
where did it begin? what went wrong? and who made you feel so worthless?
"if they wanted you, wouldn‚Äôt they have chosen you?"
"all this time, you were begging for love silently, thinking they couldn‚Äôt hear you,"
"but they smelt it on you, you must have known that they could taste the desperate on your skin?"
"and what about the others that would do anything for you, why did you make them love you until you could not stand it?"
"how are you both of these women, both flighty and needful?"
"where did you learn this, to want what does not want you?"
"where did you learn this, to leave those that want to stay?""  -Warsan Shire."
Come and throw yourself into the abyss that is me.
'I will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible..'
'I am the keeper of fragile things..'
A male co-worker shrieked like a little girl when he saw a centipede in the sink today. I think he left his balls at home.
"Organ donation because even in death, people still want a piece of you."
"I wear a bullet-proof vest, fucker."
Doing the right thing is fucking exhausting.
Don't piss me off. I'm packing heat.
Join a motherfucking love train.
Someone got in trouble for conversing with me on the Twitter. *laughs forever*
"I get it, Lorena Bobbitt. I get it."
Now run along and go and play with the whores.
".. and over in this corner, we have the classless fuck."
He really is such a gentleman.
Sweet AND single? I'm so confused.
A little decorum from you would be much appreciated.
*finger twitches over account deactivation*
Release of any kind is good.
Over and fucking out.
Do you now see what you create when you act like a selfish prick?
"If you think about sex, good. If all you think about is sex, bad."
You should just go ahead and die now.
"Careful how you tread now, my dear."
Do I look like I'm fucking around?
Huh? Speak English or fuck off.
You have to burn before you can shine this fucking bright.
I'm done ranting. Was it good for you? *lights cigarette*
"Stand up for yourself, no one else is going to."
My attitude is not a problem.
Wow. You've got boobs and a vagina. Just like every other female on the planet. Thanks for sharing.
Don't fucking disrespect me.
"If you have any or all of the following:  wife significant other life partner girlfriend fuck buddy   For your own protection, do not DM me."
I will never settle for less than I deserve.
"I know my worth, motherfucker."
I don't fear evil. I am evil.
Play me a memory.
New Year's Resolution:   Try and be more tolerant and accepting of others.   Lasted like a minute.
Narcissism oozes out of you much like the pus oozes out of a festering wound.
What the fuck? Follows you then denies your request to follow back? Nope.
Just checked my schedule and your bullshit is not on my agenda.
"Not sure if I'm dead inside or just a heartless bitch. Either way, I'm good."
"If your girl doesn't drive you batshit crazy, you are with the wrong one."
I hope your New Year's Resolution is to fuck off.
"*runs my fingers across your face and asks, Is this seat taken?*"
I talk a lot of shit and I mean every word.
You can not have your cake and eat me too.
Sex outside? I'm in.
You could be a little nicer I tell myself.
Don't make it ugly. I do ugly very well.
I will kiss you when it's dangerous.
In the blink of an eye.
I can't be fixed and I don't want to be saved.
Story of my life.
I fucking miss you already.
Self-protective to a fault.
"Do what you have to do. If this means ripping down all remnants of me, then so be it."
You will see in time that this is right.
Remains.
Fragments.
Wreckage.
Debris.
"A decision I didn't want to come to, but did anyway."
"I'm trying something new this year, like trying to be a decent person."
*tells it like it is*
&lt;---------- Hardened because people.
Protecting my heart at all costs. Even if I'm one of it's casualties.
It is either black or it is white. There is no grey.
"'And if I show you my dark side, will you still hold me tonight?'"
Phooning Poll  Do you know what phooning is?
It's very unhealthy to pay attention to what other people say.
"I've turned off your retweets, you fucking freakshow."
I like clever. I like it a lot.
I have a problem for every solution.
Mood today: Murderous
&lt;--------- Misanthropist
I love the sound you make when you shut the fuck up.
There were times when I could have murdered.
A murderous desire for love.
I feel you. I always have.
You. The one that watches quietly from the sidelines as a I bare my soul raw. What do you think?
"Eventually, you come to the realization that, realistically, it can go nowhere which forces you to move along."
You. With the locked account. I'm not that interested.
"You are cracked perfection, love."
I see a lot of sad eyes on happy faces.
I am looking for you.
I haunt myself from within.
I am relationship challenged.
Please give your brain a courtesy flush before continuing.
Tweet goddammit. I'm here to read you.
It appears to have disappeared.
Zero tolerance for bullshit.
"If their focus is not you, then move the fuck along."
I'm never safe. I'm never secure.
Scream so fucking loud but in my head.
Why am I here? Why the fuck are you here?
Is there any fucking originality left on this mother fucking planet?
Why don't you go crawl into a hole and die?
Wow. He likes tits and ass. How fucking original. *yawns*
All life has taught me is to never give anyone the benefit of the doubt.
I didn't even see it coming.
This day attacked me with a vengeance.
I abuse myself.
I've had a shit day. Thank you for adding to it.
May I strongly encourage you to shut the fuck up.
*sets feelings to shuffle*
"If you steal my last olive, you're a whore."
"You fail, fucker."
People can suck so fucking completely in life.
"If I haven't said it yet today, Fuck You."
*detonates a nuclear explosion throughout twitter* *watches all the little tweeter birds die* *giggles*
No one is worth that amount of headache.
Knowing better has never stopped me before.
All I lose when dieting is my will to live.
"If you don't have anything nice to say, you're me."
Mace can turn any date into a blind one.
My favourite form of gratification is instant.
Can you feel me?
This account will self destruct.
"Love is not the answer, love is the question."
It took years of disappointment to get this way.
You will not withstand the storm in me.
Let's delve a little deeper.
brah brah brah
"You have unmistakenly, indisputably, undeniably, incontestably got to be fucking kidding me."
Ignore is short for Ignorance.
*takes off rose-coloured glasses*  *blinks*  *looks around*  *puts them the fuck back on*
"Everyone says 'I don't give a fuck', I actually mean it."
I don't just want to see a shitload of retweets. Speak your mind.
"I got your number, Casanova. Move the fuck along."
I was not built to break.
So far away and yet so near.
I'm spinning around in circles.
You are the only one who's close enough to drive me crazy.
I want to see it in your eyes.
The things that you say make me want to stay.
I'm on the other side of crazy.
Come and find me.
I am lost.
*chews you up then spits you out*
Stop here and adore me for a while.
There are no small accounts. Just twitter 'elite' who think their shit doesn't stink.
I might say I understand when I really don't.
"If you like your meat well done, we can't be friends."
".. and just when you think you may have figured it out, your life explodes fantastically into a million little pieces .."
Welcome to the dark side. I'll be your downfall.
Let's raise a little hell tonight.
It being Christmas does not give you free reign to drive like a fucking idiot.
"Choke me in the bedroom and I will end you. Bitch gotta breathe, motherfucker."
"'Peel back my layers until you reach the rotten core, and tell me if you think I'm just as beautiful as before.'"
"You take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit, you got a fuckshit stack."
I could do it all for you but I don't want to.
I won't be tamed.
I might like you better if we slept together.
"Have a nice life, motherfucker."
He's so sexy you just want to wrap your legs around his face.
I have no more room for new scars.
Fate only whispers to the lucky ones.
I am madly in love with strange humans.
You are real. I am the shadow.
I'll do my crying in the rain.
I am the storm.
"Don't be eye candy, be soul food. Better yet, be both."
There are screams that are never externalized.
My lady-bits are all a flutter.
"Many different mouths, same bullshit coming out."
You offer someone a piece of your soul and they prefer to chomp down on someone else's superficial nonsensicality.
People are going to be people.
"Oh Mandy, you came and you gave without taking, but I sent you away."
Am I too much? Good.
"I'm a lady, motherfucker."
It's never too late to shut the fuck up.
I'd like to actually meet someone I don't fucking hate.
The one thing I really want to get for Christmas is drunk.
"I will not be ignored, fucker."
I'd say by now I'm pretty much indestructible.
"I'll help you with your butt chugging, fuckwit. Pass the fucking bleach."
I'm shutting my eyes tight so everything goes black.
"You don't know it, but we are dancing."
"Maybe now, maybe tomorrow, maybe never."
Perhaps I will beat you to it.
Look at things from a different perspective.  *closes eyes*
I don't deal well with people who have sticks up their asses.
I'm the fucking villain in my life story.
Stop before you do something I'll regret.
I had a life once.
"I remember everything, unless I forget."
"Inside jokes are lovely until you realize, they weren't so inside and people suck."
How do you talk with all that shit in your mouth?
"If you didn't know that Sheena was a punk rocker, then we can't be friends."
"I bet you paid a lot for those fucking teeth, horse man."
Would it creep you out if I told you that I knew what you were doing this very second?
"If you piss me off in my dreams, I will take it out on you when I wake up."
"My role in life is to make you feel empowered, not to make you feel like shit."
"'Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone.'"
"I have to fight with myself to do the right thing. For most people, this just comes naturally."
Trials and tribulations. Such is life.
Do you like you?
I'll bite the fucking hand that feeds me bullshit.
Nobody breaks my heart and survives.
In restless walks I'll prowl the night.
Tell me why the fuck I follow you again?
"To all the married men out there. If you're going to let a woman control you, that's your fucking problem. Don't blame her for that shit."
Tell me what I want to hear.
Either come closer or stay away.
A beautiful lie.
Turns out it was mostly a lie.
Trouble is a friend of mine.
"Run and hide, fucker."
I'm done for today. You could've been around more.
Rage is a very powerful thing.
"""We had a lovely day we are about to serve tea.""  Get the fuck off of twitter. We are real people here."
"Come at me if you want to lose your sight, bitch."
I am in full rebellion of my own mind.
The cold hard truth is a fucking sucker punch.
"If you keep reaching out and get nothing back. Eventually, you stop reaching out."
"You're the whore, fucker."
Maybe I'm just hard to love.
Kiss kiss.
"Hush baby, hush."
It's scary what a smile can hide.
"Death by intoxication, of words."
Some stories are worth waiting for.
I have left too many fucking glass slippers on the stairs.
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear.
&lt;-------- Damaged goods.
What must one have gone through to trust no one in life. Think about that.
I watch true crime. I know how to hide a body. Watch yourself.
You can't touch my roses.
I've got a pocket full of poses.
Roses bloom with my touch.
I don't know what I'm looking for. Perhaps that's why I never find it.
I am that cold shiver running down your spine.
There is a darkness in me.
Maybe I wasn't made for anyone.
I really don't know life.
Your words don't translate.
I don't have a sweet tooth. I have a wine tooth.
I carry the seeds of my own destruction.
The stars think you need to run.
'Love me like a wrong turn on a bad road late at night.'
I can hear the names of the stars.
This is a love song.
"Keep breathing me in, lover."
"Do your worst ladies. If you can take him away from me, you can have him."
Maybe I was born to run wild.
That feeling when you don't know what the fuck you're feeling.
I bet the stars don't feel lonely.
You will not forget me because I am made out of unforgettable.
"You sir, are a gentleman."
I think I might be a little complicated after all.
I have got to get out of my head.
I can deal with anything but stupid.
"Well, it's official, you're a fucking idiot."
"You, the so called intelligent one with all the porn on your wall, I don't think so."
I'm cooking bacon. I win.
A tortured soul ain't got nothing on me.
My existence is fueled by vodka.
My happily ever after is anything but.
It's all in your head.
'I think hell is something you carry around with you. Not somewhere you go.'
"'When you take things for granted, the things you are granted, get taken.'"
I am a walking contradiction.
I am a collection of paradoxes.
Conventionality has no place here.
"You look real gangsta in your pic with your momma's doilies hanging in the background, pimp daddy."
Little birds should stay away from big bad kittycats.
"Lambaste you, so you know I care."
He's a legend in his own mind.
I can make you feel like a man. Take out the trash.
*pulls trigger*
I see your duck face and raise you a shot to the head.
"Nice shirt, fucker. Does your mother shop for you?"
Living inside of your head.
"Once I infiltrate your brain, I take up residency."
Get a tattoo of my name so I know it's real.
Did you say scroll or troll?
"If words are all you have, make damn sure they are fucking truthful."
Death by words.
Word poisoning.
Catching someone I care about in a lie has the exact same effect on me as food poisoning.
Ghosts of TC's past.
"Fuck your dick pic, send me your credit card number."
"I have an attitude, apparently."
Shit never stays fucked.
I never quite know me.
&lt;---------- The Devil lives here.
I am not too much. You are too little.
"Respect yourself, woman."
You might feel like princess but you look like a whore.
I look fantastic in 'bad'.
I do all my real living between sunset and sunrise.
Tell it to someone that gives a flying fuck.
I have no heart to give you.
"I love when people think they have me all figured out and then realize, they fucking don't."
I will never lose my edge.
"You breathe, you learn."
Suit of armour but for my feelings.
I'm very protective of myself.
Show me love.
Can we be strangers again?
I'm writing love letters to myself.
'It's amazing that the heart makes no noise when it cracks.'
Stay under my skin.
I am alone. We all are.
What have you done for me lately?
"I don't deal well with authority. I'm the authority, bitch."
You can see yourself out.
Why should I care about your situation if you don't?
Sloppy seconds ain't my style.
I am no one's consolation prize.
We all have our limits.
There is only so much I'm willing to put up with here.
You tweet real tough but you're probably as soft as my pillow.
You smell arrogant.
"Hell hath no fury like mine, motherfucker."
Who the fuck are you talking to?
He's an 'ass' man which seems fitting considering he behaves like one.
"Just like irl, bad behaviour gets more attention here too. Tsk."
You're a freaky fuck. I like you.
Not that I'm an expert or anything but I think that a night owl needs another night owl to hang with.
"I'm all eyes, bitch."
You're like a permanent stain on my heart.
"It's not all about looks, little flower. Speak."
You think any other pretty girl will replace me? You're fucked.
Remember my words.
"What's twitter code for ""leave me the fuck alone""?"
Stop being so adorable when I'm mad at you.
"You and me, babe.  All the rest is just background noise."
"Wow! @DodgersGibson23, was it good for you? *lights cigarette*"
*whispers words of wisdom*
I love tugging at heartstrings.
Push my buttons so I know it's real.
"Ignore me so hard, I start to doubt my own existence."
I prefer a gentleman to a gentle man.
"He, has a heart of gold. I, have a heart of stone."
You should run away while you have the chance.
I think that I think too much.
How do you run away from the things that are in your head?
Off you can fuck.
"If you stop doing that thing you do, I'm going to stop being wonderful."
You are years beyond your wise.
You thrill me.
Venom.
"Go and tell it to the wind, fucker."
I could kill.
"Take a smoke break, Life. You're fucking me a little too hard."
"Baby, I'm right here."
Hand in hand.
He sleeps.
Just call me Jezebel.
I am not a good person.
I dreamt about you last night.   I committed murder.
"Crashed and burned, my love."
"You don't like my Dog Star Man, I don't like your Dallas Stars. We're even! :)"
"Tweet about them, sure, but don't pin the tweet to the top of the page!  Go @starsboy63!"
People push their grocery carts the exact same way they drive their cars.
Sing me a lullabye.
I am not a fucking morning person.
I have just been followed by Popeye. My work here is done.
Who me? I'm no flirt.   *flirts like a motherfucking rock star*
You can be messy with a creampuff.
That's me.
"Simmer down there, Casanova. There can be only one."
Give it time. It will eventually fuck itself up.
Don't make me come over there.
"I'm not going insane, I have already arrived."
How long do you want to be loved?
Rub rose oil on your bruises.
It is only that.
I am the storm.
Kiss me when it's dangerous.
You don't know me.
My soul needs a rest.
I'm at a whole new level of fuck everything.
Don't expect a goddamn thing from anyone.
"I, myself, am strange and unusual."
Seek and you shall find.
Music makes the world go around.
Watch out. You might get what you're after.
Stay wild.
And so ends another love story.
Someone stole my smile away.
Give me loyalty and I'll give you more.
I don't even like the fucking people I like.
"I'm totally flexible, as long as everything is exactly the way I fucking want it."
Kiss my politically incorrect ass.
Suck my kiss.
I'm sailing away.
"Trust is like a mirror. You can fix it if it's broken, but you can still see the crack in that motherfucker's reflection."
"Finding out that, in truth, you are not special to him as you see the evidence of his pattern behaviour? Priceless."
"If you think I'm abusive, then get the fuck off of my feed."
How about one iota of self-respect. How about that?
I want to smack every giggling female I come across.
"If I hear one more 'Santa, I've been naughty' tweet, I will vomit on your shoes."
He says he hasn't really tweeted much before meeting me. I think he's been writing love songs all of his life.
My dinner looks like a train wreck but tastes delicious.
Turn me on with your words.
Things That Men Do That Annoy Women 1) Breathe
"Vodka, don't fail me now."
You can crush on someone's looks or someone's mind. I prefer the mindkind.
"Love is never a waste of time, even when I am the only one who's feeling it."
When he tweets about positivity not realizing how negative I actually am.
I know I'm broken but I don't want to be fixed.
'There's so much noise inside of my head. If it ever goes quiet will it mean I'm sane or dead?'
"As soon as they think they have you, they stop doing what it took to get you."
Here kitty kitty.
No one is me and that is my power.
You are right but I want to keep being wrong.
You're playing a dangerous game.
"'We love our parents. We hate our parents. It's like a game of pong and then they die, and we miss the game.'"
"Don't play dumb, play dead."
I think I've created a monster.
Standards so high no one will fucking reach them.
You border on the ridiculous.
"Fuck you, Hulu."
"I get it, Peter Pan. I fucking get it."
"If you want to be at my level. Climb, motherfucker."
Screenshots don't scare me. I know what the fuck I said.
Proof that God has a sense of humour? My life.
"If I wanted your opinion, I'd beat it out of you."
Kiss my derri√®re.
"Circles and triangles, bitch."
"If I wanted to see a vagina smoking a cigarette, I'd go to a fucking porn site you vile piece of shit. Reported."
You are an unfortunate turn of events.
Block with me in tandem so I know it's real.
"Do I make you nervous, love?"
Debauchery and Orgy are synonymous.
"I didn't say 'are', I said 'appear to be'. There's a difference."
A mind is a terrible thing to taste.
His preferences appear to be cheap women and sports.
Hauntingly beautiful..
Don't waste my time.
Stand up like a man.
NHL. NFL. FML.
"Keep it classy, fuckers."
"You can write it in a letter, babe."
He was like a tall glass of where the fuck have you been all my life.
Chivalry is not fucking dead.
All my emotions are various tones of 'fuck'.
"I said she entertains me, not you entertain her."
"'Tonight I said I would drink until my blood turned to alcohol, and I would forget your name. I ended up forgetting mine first.'"
There are no fairy tale endings. @starsboy63
Why is it when it rains it pours men?
M-A-N-I-P-U late.
You blink when you breathe and you breathe when you lie.
Look me in the eye.
Never mind what people say.
I wear black all the time so I'm ready for your funeral.
Debauchery seems to be the word of the hour. I think I missed that meeting.
"In order for you to break my heart, I'd have to have one."
"Don't torture yourself, dear. That's my job."
Whispering sweet nothings.
"If I wanted to be ignored, I'd get married."
Everyone's a fucking critic.
You can come out now. I've had my coffee.
This place is madness personified.
One step beyond.
He never even saw it coming.
"Could I tempt you, darling?"
"No, you may not have my creampuff. It's mine and I'm gonna eat it all."
"I'm not white, motherfucker. I'm ecru with a hint of rose."
"Let sleeping whores lie, my love."
Get off of my fucking cloud.
I am very generous with other people's things.
Bitch is the new black and I wear it well.
Even hell knows better than to fuck with me.
Foul fuck.
Just saw a married man tweet that 'pussy juice' was his favourite.  Like he ever fucking gets any.
"Mom: You didn't invite anybody? Daughter: Oh, you know me Mom, all of my boyfriends like to spend Thanksgiving with their wives."
I've got a block list 40 long. I have no fucking problem making you 41.
Vodka is my answer to everything today.
"I don't know where you got that attitude from, but I hope you kept the fucking receipt."
My mother didn't raise a fucking fool.
"Showing all your wares is simply sex, not sexy."
"English is your second language, yes? Perhaps even your third."
"If you can stop being a fucking asshole, an angel can get their wings."
"If you can steal a TC away, you can have them."
Time stands still.
I am never not waiting for you.
Don't get your fucking knickers in a twist.
So sweet he gives you a cavity.
"I stalk, like celery. @starsboy63"
All this turkey talk. Must be Thanksgiving for the 'merica.
When you really don't give a fuck anymore. That.
You'd follow anything that threw a tit your way.
"An asshole. As in, you are."
I close my eyes and the world disappears.
Death by stare.
People treat you exactly the way you let them.
YOU are the reason you get no respect.
I am a mirror. I give back exactly what I fucking get.
"Just in case you were wondering, I am the jealous type."
I'm on the outside looking in.
&lt;----- Sapiosexual.
You. Keep your hoochie coochie ass off of my feed.
"""Twitter is not responding"" Story of my fucking life."
To all women posting slutty pictures and then getting offended when a man responds in kind. You started that shit.
Drive by tweeting.
I'm all about the quality.
Man-whore alert.   *steps way the fuck back*
Wasted love.
Try testing me and you will be the one that fails abysmally.
The freaks come out at night.
Fuck you I won't do what you tell me.
Music is power.
Put your fucking phone down and talk to someone.
"Fool me once, I'll fucking cut you."
I've got soul but I'm not a soldier.
I'm an obsessive-compulsive addictive mess.
"A voice so beautiful, you have to close your eyes to listen to it."
"Ain't no sunshine when I'm gone, fucker."
I go back and forth between watching wedding shows and murder shows.
The struggle is real.
"The beauty of twitter is that when someone pisses you off, all you have to do is push a button. How can we incorporate that into real life?"
"Don't break the ice, melt it."
I'm already asleep.
I'm fading fast.
"If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be 'fierce'."
I wanna be sedated.
Schmoozing is exhausting.
You can leave your ego with me. I'll stroke it for you.
It was only wishful thinking and he was just a dream.
"I like attention. If you're not giving it, you're not getting it."
Where the fuck have you been all my life?
You're the only one I see.
Elephant shoe.
I never fucking promised you a rose garden.
I notice everything.
"A shower so hot, the devil himself is jealous."
Some people are so fucking nice and others are just shit.
I don't follow eggs. I eat eggs.
I've asked you to fuck off nicely. The repercussions of not doing so will be devastating.
Annoying the shit out of people amuses me so.
Don't fuck with crazy people.
Is this fucking day over yet?
"When the crap hits the fan, duck."
My cup of give a shit is empty.
Alcohol is never the answer but it's a fucking good guess.
Come back with a warrant.
Make people wonder what the fuck you're up to.
Stalking you is my new hobby.
Give me something I can sink my teeth into.
Sometimes an individual just renews your faith in human existence.
You thought you had me in the palm of your hand.
Je suis fabulous.
I let the fools speak for themselves.
Just say no to toxic people.
"Stand by what you say. Don't post and delete, that's weak."
You could be a beautiful mistake.
My head can be a very dark place.
Bring your own light to the darkness.
Intoxicated with madness.
My soul will not be defined by my shell.
Sarcastic or Sweet. There is no in between.
Hi Stranger.
"Always keep a bottle of red wine handy for special occasions, like Wednesdays."
"I don't walk on eggshells, I stomp on them."
Everyone has a fucking opinion.
Go ahead and tell me what else is wrong with me you judgmental twat.
"You don't like my honesty, I don't like your lies."
Under the moonlight.
You tickle my fancy.
You thrill me.
I'm watching you.
You're on my radar.
People. What a bunch of fuckers.
My one wish is for it to rain Vodka.
My bologna doesn't have a first name.
Life is a hodgepodge of madness.
Show me love.
I'm here but I'm gone.
You helped me find the sun.
"To all the people who already have difficulty with visibility when driving, why don't you put a few more stuffed animals in your fucking car"
You look like I need another shot of Vodka.
Another potentially fine day ruined by fucking work.
A great place for you to put your opinion is up your ass.
"It's not you, it's me. I hate everyone."
I take my breath away.
"If you like cheeky, then you'll love me."
The truth doesn't care about your lies.
I give enough of a fuck to keep me out of jail.
"If you're thinking what I'm thinking, get some fucking help."
I'm offensive as fuck.
I'm sorry that you're stupid.
"If you can't say anything nice about anyone, then come and sit next to me."
"I don't want to see your dick, I want to read your mind."
"I'm classy, motherfucker."
ISIS - Insane Senseless Idiotic Shitbags
There are times when I could have murdered.
Fuck with me and I'll take your firstborn.
Vodka is my weapon of choice.
If you can't stand the hate then get the fuck off of my feed.
I get it serial killers. I get it.
The fact that I haven't yet shanked anyone is proof of my infinite patience with the human condition.
Send me a dick pic and I'll burn your motherfucking house down.
It is what it is. Fuck what it was.
Walking down the Socio Path.
The party's over.
Intelligent people swear more than stupid fucks.
What do I do for a living? Bitch. I'm a bitch.
Get your slutty ass off my feed.
What you know is what I choose to show.
"To be honest with you, I'm a fucking liar."
You think you know me. Think again.
Normal is the new Boring.
No habla you.
Seven trillion nerves in my body and your getting on every damn one.
Beauty on the inside doesn't get you shit.
I need a restraining order on everyone who pisses me off.
Soup of the Day: Vodka
I slapped the stupid right out of him and now there is nothing left.
I'm a constant fucking delight.
Let's just get fucking weird.
"Sometimes I miss childhood, but then I remember.... Vodka."
Fun fact: You ain't fucking shit to me.
Try some sunlight you shady fuck.
I have to actively try not to be a bitch each day.
Whether you think you can or can't doesn't matter because nobody gives a shit.
"Unless your vodka the answer is yes, I can fucking live without you."
Blah blah blah.
Pain makes you strong.
I'm a danger to society.
Don't mistake my lust for love.
My favourite colour is wild.
Don't like me? Well that's your misfortune.
"Hello, I love you. Won't you fuck off again."
Can I start my life over again? I wasn't ready.
Ask your doctor if shutting the fuck up is right for you.
TGI don't give a fuck.
My emergency contact is vodka.
I see humans but no humanity.
"You've come a long way, baby."
"Back to Twitter, where I belong."
Time to burn some bridges.
Catharsis.
"Nothing has changed, except my perception, which changes everything."
You are not who I thought you were.
I cast you back out to the masses from where you came. You are no longer anything to me.
"You tried to kill me, you didn't succeed."
I'm swallowing the pain.
"People are trying to kill me, emotionally, but I only get stronger."
All my butterflies flew away.
"My eyes. Oh, how they roll."
"If I hear one more Brit utter the word 'fab', I will spew chunks."
I don't smoke pot. It dulls my hatred.
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe."
"I love you, myself."
I'll stop being a bitch when you stop being ugly.
There is no punchline. You ARE the fucking joke.
"People who meet on twitter,  ""Let's delete our accounts and to hell with the people who've had our backs all these years.""   You'll be back."
"Let's kiss in the moonlight, baby."
I'm sweary.
"Good Morning, Sweetheart. Who untied you?"
"Wow. So you're a fucking idiot, right?"
"You don't owe me a damn thing, but a little common courtesy wouldn't go amiss."
"That's right you fucking loser, think of me so you can get it up for your wife."
Do I look like a whore you son of a bitch? Go fuck your wife.
"The one that sticks around, that's the keeper."
You're not gonna tell me who I am. I'm gonna tell you who I am.
I am somewhere else.
It's dark in here.
My mind is a sick place where normal thoughts go to die.
"Apparently, I have an attitude."
"My needs are really quite simple. If I'm not getting your attention, I'm turned off."
Look what you did.
"You don't have to like me. In fact, I'd rather you didn't."
A Geiger counter but for stupidity.
I will never be broken (again).
"You are sticks and stones, love."
"If vodka isn't the answer, then your question is wrong."
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.
"Houston, I think we have a problem."
You are an irritation at the best of times.
Have a fantastic rest of your life.
You stream in and out of my consciousness.
"I think you're awesome but jesus fuck, your spelling."
"The louder the music, the fewer the problems."
I want to shock your complacency.
Killing you in my mind.
"What do you mean they're just words? Who the fuck are you if you can't stand by what you say, think and feel?"
I lost a piece of myself that night. #broken
"""Knock him out."" - Mama"
Jesus Christ. She could shit in your mouth and you'd call it pudding.
"""Rebellion happens in the mind. You can't create it, you just are that way."""
'You are unbelievable. Does your penis have an off switch?'
Wasn't looking for trouble but it came looking for me.
"The words, they keep repeating."
A scream so loud but in my head.
You're falling back to me.
I'd kill a bitch.
"He said I drank too much, so I stabbed him."
"$0.00 to keep it real, fuckers."
When they're hungry for it. That.
You. Get out of my head.
Ignore me so I know it's real.
Handsome and smart. How confusing.
"You, with the healthy ego, I'll squash you like a motherfuckin' bug."
"I won't say it, but you know I'm thinking it."
Right words. Wrong person.
Suck my kiss.
Biding my time.
I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm in your head.
Wake the fuck up.
Go the fuck to sleep.
"Fuck you, you fucking fuck."
I wanna live 'til I die.
Roger. Copy.
Give it to them.
Helter Skelter
This is it.
A godlike position is a man-made condition of life.
It's in my brain now.
"He doesn't think you're beautiful, sweetheart. He thinks you're easy."
Rose garden filled with thorns.
I am a positive fucking person.
Elite is a state of mind.
It's not love if it's not torture.
Shame about your face.
I wanna new drug.
Cut those ties....       and release.
I'd hit that....         with a bat.
Shut up. You're so whipped I should buy you a saddle.
You smell like hidden motives.
I won't lose a wink of sleep over you.
"Don't worry, I hate you too."
"Karma, Asshole."
Behold the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is barren.
Some of us were born to take risks.
"Yes, but....  ""Buts"" are for ashtrays."
I have mixed drinking about thoughts.
Perfect Life Perfect Wife Perfect Knife
You don't listen to a word I haven't said.
"The older I get, the less I care."
"You, strange as angels."
"You think you got it, oh you think you got it, but got it just don't get it."
You'll remember me.
You monsters are people.
I'm impossible to love.
"I'm not bossy, I'm the boss."
"No, YOU fuck off."
It's this 'rainbows and sunshine' view of the world that chaps my ass.
"When the attention goes, so do I."
I know your secret.
My drug of choice is vodka.
I love you vodka. You understand me.
I like to smile at people who don't like me because I'm a bitch.
I'm demanding. I'm bitchy. I'm moody. You want easy. That ain't me.
You're making my phone dirty.
I'm a bloody mess.
I get it. You're deliriously happy. Now fuck off.
"Hello, Gorgeous."
Fake fuck.
Just because I grow old doesn't mean I have to grow up.
"""Pea rattles loud in empty head."""
"""Tell your boyfriend if he says he's got beef, that I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him."""
Follow one more whore and I'm blocking your ass.
The secret to talking is listening.
I me wed.
You're so busy trying to hide things that you've lost yourself in the process.
Scram fink.
You've lost your moxie.
You are not badass. You just play one on twitter.
I pack an attitude.
I will keep you in line.
I'm tired of working so hard at life and getting nothing for it. I quit.
If people only knew how unhealthy it is to pay attention to what other people say.
"Nice beard, sir. Now grow some balls."
My life is so much more interesting inside my head.
Please do not feed the liars.
"I see you.   Not the 'you' you project, but the real you."
Drink. Drank. Drunk.
Fuck your face so I don't have to.
I have few favourites. They're my fucking elite.
I drink to kill. Myself.
I'm going to swing from the chandelier.
"Sometimes, you just have to trust your own madness."
"Die, my darling."
I've got a boo and he ain't you.
You think you're better than me. I know you are not.
"So many people showing off their guns. I don't own a gun. If I kill, it's going to be slow.... and messy."
You had a choice and now you no longer do because I've taken that choice away from you.
Hello. I love you. Won't you tell me your name.
I have run out of words.
Keep your friends close and your vodka closer.
I don't cut you unless you cut me. Then I cut deep.
"If you could fuck off real quick, I'd appreciate it."
You're full of yourself with no reason to be.
I care way too much about myself for you not to.
Solitary Confinement.
You can't escape yourself.
I tweet from the prison of my mind.
I tweet from prison.
"It just gives me strength, motherfucker."
It no longer matters.
"If I wanted to be ignored, I'd get married."
"Well, that's about the rudest thing I've ever experienced."
I'm just the mirror.
"Go home, little boy. You can not handle me."
"Be a thunderstorm. Be dangerous and unpredictable, and make a lot of noise."
..-. ..- -.-. -.-   -.-- --- ..- #morsecode
I could never love anyone like you because you could never love anyone but yourself.
"I now know you weren't the one for me. If you were, you would have stuck around. #cestlavie"
You have been warned.
Don't associate with me again.
My thoughts are not pure.
I am not good.
"It's not frig, frack, fook or fack. I believe the word you're looking for is 'fuck'."
"My nail polish is black, like my soul."
The anger dissipates when you no longer give a shit.
It's not special if you call everyone else the same damn thing.
"You don't have to believe my lies, but you will listen to them."
Your opinion is irrelevant because you are a cunt.
I ain't buyin' what you're sellin'.
There are people in this world that will try and feed on your soul. Eat them first.
"Sylvia Plath, but will kill you before I kill myself."
Fucking up my life one asshole at a time.
"""I'm coming up only to hold you under."""
I am willing to sacrifice you for what I feel is best for me.
"In my opinion, fuck your opinion."
Set yourself on fire so I can toast my fucking marshmallows.
"Run along now, ya fuck."
If your life is so perfect then shut the fuck up and go fucking live it.
"I thought we were, and then we weren't. Which made me wonder, were we ever?"
"As far away as you go, as far away as you are, I'm still in your head."
Is there no way out of the mind?  -Sylvia Plath
I too want to be important. By being different. And these girls are all the same. -Sylvia Plath
I desire the things that will destroy me in the end. -Sylvia Plath
"I like people too much, or not at all.  -Sylvia Plath"
Tell someone how you feel and they reward you with their silence.
You want him? You have him.
It's not my battle anymore.
The moon made me do it.
Good bye to you.
I don't need or want to be saved from who I am.
There is happiness in sadness.
"For those of you who think you have it all figured out, you don't."
"There is the brink of insanity and then there is the abyss, which clearly I have fallen into."
"Now all your love is wasted, then who the hell was I?"
It's funny how we have nothing in common anymore. Makes me wonder if we ever did.
Whatever doesn't kill me just makes me more of a bitch.
"If you've got a tattoo that says ""Bad Boy"", you ain't no fucking bad boy."
I honestly don't know what the fuck it is you're talking about.
Do you even recognize yourself anymore?
You keep trying to convince yourself of that and maybe one day you'll actually believe it.
You've turned into everything you thought you would never be.
I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye.
What's the point investing time in people when they just end up treating you like a stranger in the end?
"The more delicate your soul, the shittier they treat you."
"Trust me, I'm not your type."
Chase the ugliness away.
I will not compete with your fantasies.
Cute only takes you so far. Then you need to back that shit up. At least to any people of substance in life.
"If you react to anything I say here, you're stupider than I thought."
I am by no means the smartest. But there sure is a lot of 'stupid' out there.
Don't zig my zag.
Goodnight my lovely twitterfucks.
How people perceive you reveals more about them than it does about you.
It‚Äôs not about whether others approve of you but if you approve of you.
Seeking approval is a waste of your time and energy.
What other people think of you is none of your business.
Tweet whatever you like and fuck what people think.
People are tiresome.
Normal people just aren't on the same frequency as me.
No worries. You're already forgotten.
Why do people talk shit when they have absolutely no idea what the fuck they're talking about?
I disappear when ever you come near.
I don't like people.
Too delicate for my potty mouth? You know where the unfollow button is.
Call me when you're not a fuckwit anymore.
Don't like me? Fuck off. Problem solved.
Is a fuck supposed to be given here or...
Don't make me kill you.
"Excuse me but, fuck you."
I followed you because you 'get' me.
"People baring their souls and nothing. Some bitch posts a pic of her tongue licking an ice cream cone and boom, 100 likes. What a world."
I'm drowning in the cesspool of normality.
"You can't be that stupid, it's not possible."
"Have a nice life, ya fuck."
Why the fuck am I following you?
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
"Don't talk of love,"
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
"I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain."
That none may penetrate.
"A fortress deep and mighty,"
"I've built walls,"
"I am a rock,"
I am an island.
"And a rock feels no pain,"
A pocket full of mumbles.
"You don't like my kid, I don't fucking like you. Get it?"
"You put up with so much and finally, you put up with nothing."
Never talk to me again.
"Time it was  And what a time it was, it was  A time of innocence  A time of confidences"

The greatest trick the Devil ever played was convincing the world He didn't exist.
Why you exist in my world is beyond me.

Let me make this real simple for you. I don't follow you if you don't follow me. Period. #MutualRespect
"Boop-Oop-a-Doop, Fucker."
Go fuck your face.
You follow 300 and 5000 follow you. I guess you're just too good to even consider following me because you are such a fucking superstar. #BS
You're already an idiot. Now you just need a village.

Being in love is like being insane.
No whoremongers allowed.
Unfollowed. I suggest you do the same fucker.
"Oh FFS, yet another loser posting naked chick pics. I'm guessing single and staying that way."
You can't sit with us.
"You broke into my house. Congratulations, you're a dead man."
What the fuck have you done for me lately?
You don't deserve my attention.
The voices in my head get along with the monsters under my bed.
I won't be there anymore.
I don't care anymore.
"It's not you, it's me. I don't like you."
You are as pretty as a picture........ of a whore.
"As far as I know, I'm fucking delightful."
Must have vodka.
You bitches know I can't tolerate you without liquor.
Facebook? With your fucking face?

Tired of the game.
It won't do you any good.
Beg for mercy.
People get shot for less than you've done.
Unfollow for an unfollow. Every fucking time. I'm on it.
I'm a mirror. What you give is what I reflect.
Sometimes I daydream about how fabulous I'm going to look at your funeral.
Excessive amounts of vodka help me deal with excessive amounts of bullshit.

"Enough with these whore pics down my feed, fuckers."
The voices are back.
You're messing with my head.
You'd look better with me by your side.
You haven't even seen my bad side yet.
I'm not who I was before.
I don't need a twitter crush. I've got enough on my plate dealing with the RL crush.
Can't lie to yourself. Yourself knows.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

I just can't help thinking what you've done to me. You built a wall of love and tore it right down in front of me.
"The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain."
It's never enough until your heart stops beating.
Don't point that gun at me.

You look like a prostitute.
I will make better mistakes tomorrow.

"Love, honour and obey me."
"One twitter crush? That's cute. I've got about 20, today."
Don't you get it? We all have the capacity to act like raging whores. Some of us are just looking for something more.
I can see every part of your body but your face. You know what the means? You're fucking ugly.
Must be another slow news day. They're still talking about Miley's twerking. #LetsMoveOnShallWe
"No. You make me a sandwich, motherfucker."
Bang! Bang! Bang! That's the sound of me shooting you in the face.

"Unfollow for an unfollow is my motto because if you don't want to hear what I have to say, then why the fuck would I want to listen to you?"
I hope karma is wearing spike studded steel toed boots when she kicks you in the ass.
Go to hell. Leave me the handbasket.
"Storming, but inside."
Tweet with some fucking degree of truth.
Shoot me in the face so I know it's real.
There's got to be somebody out there with some fucking depth.
Typical.
"So you like the big-titted girl. Yep, you're a keeper."
Congratulations. You suck.
The wheels on the bus go fuck yourself.
I am the danger.
I'm gonna need you to go ahead and turn down your asshole for just a bit.
I worship the ground that awaits your corpse.
It's never too late to shut the fuck up and mind your own business.
Do I 'look' nice?  I'm not.
You're not a prick. You're a fucking cactus.

"If I RT, ‚òÜ or @ you, it's not because I want to fuck you. It's because I can relate to what it is you're saying. #gutterball"
"I'm not drinking any more, but I'm not drinking any less."
You know how you can smack something to make it work? I wish you could do that with people.
You'd better hope karma slaps you in the face before I do.
There's a good chance that most people don't like me. There's an even better chance that I don't give a fuck.
You're a sorry mistake of a human being.
Instagram your food and receive a free concussion.
"Use her and leave her?  Use me, I'll set you on fire, you bastard."

Karma is not half the bitch I am.
"That's how I roll, ladylike with a wad of bitch in my back pocket."
You meet the most delicious people on twitter.
Fuck inner peace. I'm going to fuck this whole place up.
"Looky, looky now, who's all pissy about someone treating them the same way they treat everyone else on the planet."
My suggestion to you would be to take your sorry ass out of my face before I show you what disrespect truly is.
If Christ is your saviour then we can't be friends.
"If I lived every day like it was my last, there would be a lot of dead motherfuckers."
I've thought about it and killing you might be worth the prison time.
"One, just one fucking day without some stupid motherfucker messing it up."
&lt;---- will not fucking tolerate disrespect on this page.
Forgive and forget doesn't work for me. Does fuck off and die work for you?
"If your friends are appalled when you swear, you've got the wrong fucking friends."
"I actually gave a shit earlier, but you missed it."
My 'happy' face and 'fuck you' face are one and the same.
There's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.
Holy Fuck. I let you do twitter your way and you will fucking let me do it mine.
"Sometimes, I wish I was a nicer person. No, I don't."
Sometimes you need crazy.
Bad is the new good.
"Revenge is not how I do things, but accidents happen."
Are you leaving or are you just trying to brighten my fucking day?
You're the right kind of wrong.
"Sweet angel of death, please take me now."
You're the fucking reason aliens fly straight past us.
Give me a reason not to kill you.
Giving myself to you would be like giving myself to a chainsaw.
And... wait for it... now the true fucking colours come out.
"Buddy, just pick up your dignity and walk away quietly please."
Soup of the Day: Vodka
"Oh, my profanity is offensive? So is your fucking stupidity, so we're even."
Complaints about my tweets? Please take a number and stick it up your ass.
"Sometimes, the best thing you can say is Fuck Off."
I'm sure whatever the fuck you have to say can wait until you're smarter.
Up shut you the fuck must. #yoda
Auto-correct has become my worst enema.
"I pretend I don't care but deep down, I still really don't care."
I'm getting real good at spotting the assfucks.
I didn't mean for you to fuck off. I meant for you to fuck off and die.
"It's not an attitude problem. It's my reaction to you being a rude, mannerless, motherfucking asshole."
The early bird can have the worm. I just want my fucking vodka.
You are not invited to the other side of sanity.
"I wanna say I'm sorry, but I'm really not."
"If I weren't such an alcoholic, I would throw my drink in your face."
Being a mess is exhausting.
"I'm like you, only much better."
Here's an idea.... fuck off.
"If you were on fire, I'd fucking roast marshmallows."
Nobody appreciates how hard I try not to be a homicidal maniac.
So much rage. So little time.
Could you do me a huge favour and just shut the fuck up? Thanks.
I keep starring tweets only to find those tweets have not been starred by me. Get your shit together twitter.
"Of course I do get called 'Bitch' quite often. What I do NOT get called is 'pushover', 'stupid', 'whore' or 'doormat'."
You hate me but you don't know me. How cute.
I googled 'Who gives a shit?' but my name wasn't there.
"If you're happy and you know it, I don't care."
I thought I couldn't be more disappointed. You proved me wrong.
The worst part of my Monday is hearing you complain about yours.
My head is a very dark place.
"I'll drink to that, or anything else you've got to say."
Why? Because shitty people do shitty things.
Being an adult is the dumbest thing I've ever done.
I learned a lot of great lessons from a few fucked up people.
I don't drink. I cleanse internal damages.
I'm too sober for this shit.
It's not my job to blow smoke up your ass.
I'm not really a bitch. Yes I am.
I am one fucking idiot away from bludgeoning someone to death.
"Ok, which one of you assfucks complained about my motherfucking swearing?"
"Hey you. Yes you there, posing with the gun in your hand and the banana in your mouth. Is that supposed to be fucking sexy?"
"If ignorance is bliss, then you should be ecstatic."
They say money can't buy you happiness but it buys me vodka and that makes me happy.
There'd better be a fucking light at the end of this shit filled tunnel.
"You know, when I take my spine to the shop, I always get a loaner. #coward"
Using your signal two seconds before you turn means that you're an asshole.
Gun control is being able to hit your target.
The only thing worse than the 'one who got away' is the 'one who won't go away'.
"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, I'll burn your motherfucking house down."
Fuck off you fake fuck with your game of follow/unfollow. Are you that hard up for attention?
I never said that I would die if I didn't have vodka. I said other people would.
I don't brake for whores.
When will the karma train run this bitch over?
I'm tired of these whores breathing my oxygen.
"Life isn't a garden, so stop being a fucking hoe."
"Control your whoremones, slut."
Let's play a game of Fuck Off. You go first.
Vodka. It maintains my sunny disposition.
"It's not that you're ugly, you're just difficult to look at."
Has anyone ever told you that you're beautiful?  I didn't think so.
"Not every flower can say love, but a rose can."
"Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can."
"Not every retard can read, but look at you go, fucker."
It's never too late to shut the fuck up and mind your own business.
Keep your friends close and your drinks closer.
"I once had a love, but not anymore. Now I have a life, and he has a whore."
I ignored a chain letter and I'm still alive drinking vodka.
How to deal with an asshole. 1) Spot an asshole. (See No Evil) 2) Laugh at asshole. (Hear No Evil) 3) Avoid asshole. (Speak No Evil)
Three things I regret about my past are 1) I didn't kill you. 2) I met you. 3) I didn't kill you.
Stupid fuck.
Do it now. I won't tell.
Kill. Your. Self.
I'm like a motherfucking mirror. What you give to me is what you get.
This guy needs to off himself.
Just take those old records off the shelf.  I'll sit and listen to them by myself.

Some people think that cursing isn't attractive. Good thing I don't give a fuck what people think.
"Whatever I did to make you hate me, please tell me so I can do it to other people."
"I'm trying to be nice, but sometimes my mouth gets in the way."
"When in doubt, just add vodka."
Drive me crazier.
"Remember the day I put a gun to your head and demand you follow me on twitter? Me neither, so shut the fuck up if you don't like what I say."
Trust people? I don't do that anymore.
Respect me or get the fuck out.
"Fuck yeah, I've got issues, but at least I'm not a whore."
You say Fucked Up Bitch like it's a bad thing.
"Yes, I'm a bitch and bitch trumps stupid every time, motherfucker."
"Recently, someone accused me of being insensitive. And I thought, who let this fat fuck into my house?"
Do not follow where the path leads. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail of fucking destruction.
"I can't help but stare at you. I've never seen a walking, talking pile of shit before."
The first step is admitting that everybody else has a problem.
My blood type is vodka positive.
It's an open door policy. Show up with vodka and I'll open the door.

Hook-up? The only thing I'd hook up to you is a fucking rope around your neck to hang you from a motherfucking tree.
"Do you know what I get when I get my hopes up?  Fucking disappointment, that's what I get."
Spot the bullshit. Dismiss it. Move on.
You are cordially invited to go and fuck yourself.

I sit around and wonder what your place would look like on fire.
A fresh blanket of snow! So pretty outside!

TURTLE HEAD!!!!
What time is it Mr. Wolf? BEER TIME!!!!
You know that feeling when you've had too much vodka. Me neither.
Apologies to my daughter for keeping her up with my renditions of The Lion Sleeps Tonight and Harry Belafonte's Day-O/Banana Boat #cantsleep
What can you do when you live in a shoe?
Oh no! You unfollowed me? I shall cry myself to sleep every night.
My next headache has your name written all over it.
I wish someone would tear you down and put up a human being.
I want to reach your mind ‚Äì where is it currently located?
You should do some soul-searching. Maybe you‚Äôll find one.
You have a speech impediment.... your foot.
I will defend to your death my right to my opinion.
You're like a bad habit i'd like to kick.... with both feet.
Go fart peas at the moon.
Of all the people I‚Äôve met you‚Äôre certainly one of them.
What colour is the sky in your world?
Diarrhea of the mouth; constipation of the ideas.
Some days it's best just to fill the sink with vodka and dunk your head in.
"She's got her daddy's tongue and temper, sometimes she could use a filter, God shook his head when he built her, oh but I bet he smiled."
Never fucking apologize for being yourself.
"Instead of being born again, why don‚Äôt you just grow up?"
I‚Äôd like to give you a going-away present  but you have to do your part.
"I like your approach, now let‚Äôs see your departure."
Hi. I‚Äôm a human being. What the fuck are you?
I've got my eyes open.
I came to party. Your boy was looking at me.
"I'm going to say this one more time. If you follow me and then unfollow as soon as i follow back, i will hunt you down and eat your young."
Don't fuck with me. I fuck back.
I can't be good all the time.
"I wrote a song for you. It's called ""Fuck Off"". Enjoy."
"If you call me a bitch, then you're paying attention."
"I don't like to edit people by turning of their retweets but jesus fucking christ, enough with the whore pics already, please."
Be careful who you fucking trust.
Don't call the world dirty because you forgot to clean your glasses.
Your eyes betray you.
Run along big boy before they miss you at the zoo.
Nice legs. Shame about the face.
What do you do when your man's staggering? Shoot him again.
Do you know how to save a drowning man? Take your foot off his head.
"You stare at frozen juice cans because they say, ""concentrate""."
"Are you always an idiot, or just when I'm around?"
Fifteen past #pumpkins. Trouble out.
"that, and you're mighty cute."
You are my exception to the rule.
"Don't try so hard, I couldn't like you any less."
I notice that you never let an idea interrupt the flow of your conversation.
"Don't say things like that; it just makes you sound stupid. In fact, don't talk at all. It just makes you sound stupid."
I'm really easy to get along with once you learn to worship me.
Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view.
I should remove your appendix with a melon baller right now #joeschmo
A horse in the living room. Now i have seen it all.
"If you don't have anything nice to say, come sit by me."
I don't know what i would do without vodka. Probably 25 to life.
Tweet #6000!! Champagne for Everyone!! *throws handfuls of twitter stars into the air*
I gotta be me.
Does it count as saving someone's life if you just refrain from killing them?
I'm sure whatever you have to say can wait until you're smarter.
"I'm not anti-social, i'm anti-stupid."
I'm condescending? Do you even know what that means?
I see a pole and body glitter in your future.
Just how closely related were your parents?
My heart has a sad.
You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.
At least I have a positive attitude about my destructive habits.
I don't believe in busy.
dime a dozen dime a dozen dime a dozen  dime a dozen dime a dozen dime a dozen dime a dozen dime a dozen dime a dozen  dime a dozen dime
A slow and painful death to all those 'holier than thouers' out there.
People who don't respond to texts should have their phones confiscated immediately and beaten about the head with them.
She's got nothing on me. Nice try though.
I see no good reason to act my age.
I'm getting tired of your man-period.
How irritatingly charming.
Pour some sugar on me.
How can you be so wrong about someone you felt was so right. #bafflesthemind
Stick Up Arse. Book your operation.
"Watch the predators, they live among us."
I'm done trying to figure you out because you're just rude.
I will always cherish the initial misconception I had about you.
How about never? Is never good for you?
May I have the pleasure of your absence?
Let's go some place were we can each be alone.
You're someone who would make a perfect stranger.
"Is your family happy, or do you go home at night?"
"I wish I had a lower I.Q., so that I could enjoy your company."
"Someday you'll go far, and I hope you stay there."
"I know you have to be somebody, but why do you have to be you?"
Not very nice.
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu.
Keep ignoring me and i'll not talk to you anymore.. oh.. wait..
"Um to be jealous, i'd first have to give a shit."
So you've changed your mind? Does this one work any better?
"Shut up, you'll never be the man your mother is."
"I love the sound of laughter, even when i can't hear it."
I'd like to help you out. Which way did you come in?
I look into your eyes and get the feeling someone else is driving.
OOps!!

That's my kind of wonderful.
Give in to me.
I choose the road less travelled. Now where the fuck am i?
I wish my eyes could take photos.
Does it even matter?
Don't kick up a fucking fuss. Just unfollow.
You're simply not yourself today. i noticed the improvement.

I am damaged goods.
I usually follow back when followed. Everyone has a story to tell. People who unfollow after i follow? Their story is that they're an arse.

You are one fickle pickle.
Might i suggest unfollowing instead of subtweeting if something is bothering you? Thanks. Good talk.
I'm not grumpy. i'm cheer-challenged.

Feisty Fucking Friday.
Enough with the Mayan crap now. Those with the sense of a goat knew it was bogus from the beginning. Now let's cease revisiting.
There is a reason i don't own a gun.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
People piss me off.
I simply do not have the time for your bullshit.
They say you are what you eat. Is that why you're so cocky?
"I would tell you to go to hell, but I live there and I don't want to see you everyday."
"If they're taking your love for a joke, then leave them like it's funny."

Getting people riled is a hobby of mine.
The creative mind that is @Experiment_B is unsurpassed.
Aw. Think i lost a couple of followers with my latest rants. Good.
You hate Mondays? i hate everything.
"Yet, despite the look on my face, you are still talking."
You have exactly three seconds to explain why you woke me.
Those candy canes are making you fatter.
You're an imbecile.
You have my permission to die.
Forgive and forget doesn't work for me. Does fuck off and die work for you?

Who let you in?
If i write something you don't like and you'd like to share that opinion with me. Don't.
That's a very nice opinion you have there. Too bad it's wrong.
"I'm never wrong. One time, i thought i was wrong but i was mistaken."
Raising a sexy beast is hard. My parents would know.
Now go away. I have some degree of respect for you so I will not allow this to get ugly.
"Twitter is a fickle bastard. Even those you deemed your favourites, will turn on you at the  drop of a hat. So much for freedom of speech."
Allow me to hold the door open for you as I see you out.
"Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, it's off to kill.. er.. work i go."
Oh you guys.. so fucking cute!.. Too fucking cute for a Monday morning.
Today has been cancelled. Go back to sleep.
The morning always has a way of creeping up on me and peeking in my bedroom windows. The sunrise is such a pervert. #kintz
The only thing preventing me from smashing my alarm clock this morning is the fact that it's my cellphone.
Anyone who smiles on a Monday morning cannot be trusted.
On Monday mornings I am dedicated to the proposition that all men are created jerks.

Keep trying to convince yourself though. Whatever gets you through the day.
You can't fool me.
I'm talking to you.
I feel your loneliness.
"Actually, you're not. But you put on a brave face and that's to be commended."
We're all fucked up and we know it.
Caution: I fuck things up.
Santa just called. You ain't gettin' squat.

Sweet and twisted. That makes me a candy cane.

Have a nice day? Don't tell me what to do.
If you're happy and you know it go to hell.
You're a mean one Mr. Grinch. Keep up the good work.
Let's get lost.
My sexual preference is often.
Sorry i'm not sorry.
I'm a fucking lady.
Just pull the trigger.
Steal my tweets i'll steal your firstborn.
Zero tolerance. Go climb back under your rock.
You smell as bad as your tweets.
"Disrespect women, disrespect me, you dumb fuck."
"You, sir, are a fucking imposter."
I love you people.
I want you.

I read the rules before I broke them.
You can be my private dancer.

I cannot formulate an expression using tangible words from any language that would even begin to express just how much you piss me off.
Want to escalate an argument? Smile.

Never tell me to calm down.

You have the right to your opinion and i have the right to tell you how stupid it is.
Good Morning? There is no such thing.
Anonymity is dead.

Goodnight my Tweeps. It was good for me. Was it good for you?

Sleeping is nice. You forget about everything for a little while.
You're giving me the silent treatment? Finally.

You look naughty. i like that.
"I tried to make you a batch of rum balls, but now they're just balls and i'm drunk. Merry Christmas!"
Did i hear someone say 'trouble'?

"It's not that i don't give a fuck. Oh wait, yes it is."
What doesn't kill me might make me kill you.
Don't change. I want to forget you just the way you are.
I think i might have to delete my twitter account. I don't want to sound paranoid but i think people are following me.
Being an asshole is easy. Being a bitch takes style.

"If you are breaking into my house, we are fighting to the death. That's how it's gonna go. Just so you know."
"Begging for followers, or getting others to do it for you is the same as buying them. Why don't you try earning them like the rest of us?"
Anticlimactic.

"I don't like disrespect towards women. if i see it, i'm stepping in. booyah! Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Fucker."
Poor little confused stupid fuck.
Tell me again why you get up in the morning?
"There's only one thing that keeps me from breaking you in half, I don't want two of you around."
"You think you're a wit, and you're probably half right."
"If you said what you thought, you'd be speechless."
Don't you ever get tired of having you around?
Don't get lost in thought; you'll be a total stranger there.
Don't change I want to forget you just the way you are.

Legend in your own mind. That's what you are.
Go away. You bother me.
One must not always allow people to get away with bad behaviour as that would warrant being called an enabler. I'm no fucking enabler.
Bedtime.
Sighs.
Some people disappoint me so.
"I'm actually not funny, i'm just mean and people think i'm joking."
Hold for a moment while i get a translator. i don't speak dumbfuck.
"The short answer is ""no"". The long answer is"" Fuck no""."
What's more annoying than hearing you breathe.... nothing.
Love is a blind whore with mental disease and no sense of humour.
It's hard to be a positive person when i'm surrounded by dumb motherfuckers.
"Once i stop giving a fuck about you, good luck getting that back."
I'm not a morning person. Most days i'm not even an afternoon person.
Who the fuck works on a Sunday afternoon? This girl does.
"I do what i want, when i want, how i want."
"If i wanted to be a caged animal, i would've gotten married."
"If you don't adore me, please move on."
"Fuck you, i'm delightful."
"Rather than us agreeing to disagree, why don't you just shut the fuck up?"
Make me laugh. i dare you.

My superpowers are drinking vodka and judging people.
"My door is always open. Hopefully, you'll leave."
"Row, row, row your boat gently off a cliff."
Santa has been reading your tweets. He's going to send you a dictionary for Christmas.
Dashing through the No.
i like like like you #goodnight
It's beginning to look a lot like fuck this.
I need some knee high rubber boots to wade through it all.
Go sell your crap some place else. No one is buying your bullshit over here.
I find you ridiculous.
Wow. I can't wait to never see you again.
Constipated people don't give a shit.
You look like i need another drink.
"Well, aren't you an annoying little fuck."
I confess.
"People that follow, just to get a follow back and then promptly unfollow to make it look like they have big numbers make me sick #shameonyou"
People like you are the reason people like me kill people.
Simon Says Go fuck yourself.
Sometimes i question my sanity. Occasionally it replies.
"I don't have a problem with alcohol. In fact, we get along just fine."
Let me put you on hold. Until you're dead.
"Yes, i heard you calling me. Did you hear me ignoring you?"
If stupid was a disease people would be dropping dead all over the place.
#pumpkins
Why kill them with kindness when you can use a hammer.
Come back with a warrant.
No one knows your business like other people.
"When i want your opinion, i'll remove the gag."
I'm the best thing to ever happen to me.
Tomorrow's weather is cloudy with a chance of vodka.
"Twitter man, we love you but, suspend the people who actually deserve to be suspended please."
I'm sure whatever you have to say can wait until you're smarter.
"Maybe if we wait a little longer, a fuck will fall in my hand and i can give it to you."
Hating people takes too much energy. i just pretend they're dead.
Reality is the leading cause of stress among those in touch with it.
You're giving me the silent treatment? Finally.
I'm not bossy. i just know what you should be doing.
#pumpkins
"If talk is cheap, then how much can i pay you to just shut the fuck up?"
If you ignore one more of my texts consider that a reason to go and fuck yourself.
There are so many crap accounts on here and twitter goes and suspends someone as brilliant as @MsAnnaMossity?? i don't get it.
where is my  @MsAnnaMossity??!!
Don't care.
No competition. Step up your game.
What's your secret?
"Seriously, i would like to know how someone that stupid gets by."
How do you function in life?
That is the dumbest shit i've ever heard.
"You think you're bad? You think you're tough? I've got news for you, you're not."
"Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time."
"The more you disapprove, the more fun it is for me."
"Alcohol doesn't solve any problems but then again, neither does milk."
No. It's not water. You seem to be retaining food.
I recommend you cut down on your breathing.
Good Evening my lovely. Who untied you?
"It was all a dream and now, i'm awake."
"Time it was, and what a time it was, it was"
"A time of innocence, a time of confidences"
"Long ago, it must be, I have a photograph"
"Preserve your memories, they're all that's left you #simonandgarfunkel"
I disturb the peace.
Don't underestimate the seductive power of a decent vocabulary.
"People hate the truth. Luckily, the truth doesn't care."
"If you stay really, really quiet and listen very, very closely, then you can hear the sound of you shutting the fuck up."
I don't go crazy. I am crazy. I just go normal from time to time.
"I tried to contain myself, but i escaped."
I am not needy. i am wanty.
Well hello there. You look like a bad decision. Come over here.
You have nice feet. That's the best i can do.
I'm tired of this day. i need a new one.
I will always be here when i need you.
"A perfect person doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, doesn't cry, doesn't fail and doesn't exist."
We've been through a lot together and most of it was your fault.
"It's bad manners to say ""i love you"" with a mouth full of lies."
Today is just not my day. #fenderbender
I think i might be evil.
Shit happens. i mean.. look at your face.
"and yet despite the look on my face, you're still talking."
"The closer you get, the slower i'll drive."
'easily' you moronic fuck.
oh no!!!!!!!!!!!! i've been blocked by an egg. An egg with bad grammar!! and they messaged to tell me so. Isn't that the cutest thing ever??
I love it when someone posts a tweet and it gets retweeted again and again and again and again and again and again and by love i mean hate.
"Why would i follow you if you won't follow me? oh that's right, i wouldn't."
Not impressed.
I've got a PhD in Bitch.
You are a creation of God. We all have our off days.
Jesus loves you but i think you're an idiot.
Velletri because.. why not?
Sometimes people want to have full conversations really early in the morning. It's okay to kill those people.
Watch yourself.
100th Grey Cup! Argoooooooooooooooooooooooooooos!!
Want.
I'm making a list of regrets. How do you spell your name again?
Vodka lip gloss. You're welcome.
Oh wow! You know what that sounds like? Not my fucking problem.
Shhhhhhhhh. Do you hear that? That's the sound of me not giving a fuck.
Stop acting like a bitch and i'll stop slapping you like one.
We serve vegetarians. Just tell us how you'd like them prepared. #meatlovers
"When you talk, i can actually feel my brain choking itself into unconsciousness."
"I didn't text you, vodka did."
"I take it, from your lack of response, that you either agree, or i've had my hand on your throat too long."
Happy Fucking Everything! Now leave me alone until next year.
We're all here because we're not all there.
"Do you have this in a size for people who actually eat? - me, clothes shopping."
It's 10:45AM. Too early for vodka?
#pumpkins
Why can't I be you?
Where the fuck is everyone today? It's like you all have lives or something.
All i ever wanted is in your eyes. #lambchop
I seem to have been included in a spam cycle here.
Let's make better mistakes tomorrow.
"I wouldn't say you're stupid. You are, but i wouldn't say it."
Is your ass jealous of all the shit that comes out of your mouth?
My Techie: What kind of computer do you have? Me: A black one.
I would call you a whore but i think you and i both know nobody's ever going to pay for that shit.
I'm sorry if what i said offended you and by sorry i mean fuck you.
Go away.
"Maybe if you stopped whoring yourself out, you'd find some fulfillment in life."
Beaten to the punch again. i don't like that.
Fun times. Fun times.
"Listen up, i have raised the best fucking liar in the free world. Don't embarrass yourself."
That's a crock of crap.
Here we fucking go again.
Suck my kiss.
Dare to be who you are.
Moving right along....
That is all i have to say about that.
How original are you if your actions are controlled by another?
Shame that.
I suspect i'm correct.
That's lame.
"One, two, three"
"Slow down, you move too fast"
You got to make the morning last

Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
"Life, I love you all is groovy #simonandgarfunkel"
Which wine goes best with more wine?
You can agree with me or you can be wrong.
They should put more vodka in the bottle so there is enough for two people.
I didn't get your text because i'm lying.
I put a spell on you.
"Are we going to have a fucking problem here, or what?"
"Just because i'm interested, doesn't mean i care."
Never let the facts get in the way of having an opinion #sarcasm101
"Support mental health, or i will kill you."
I see no good reason to act my age.
"Thank you for your opinion, now kindly fuck off."
Fake fuck.
I still miss that piece of my heart you ripped out of my chest all those years ago.
Who are you?
Who does that?
See no shit. Hear no shit. Take no shit.
Smile: The way to solve many problems.
Silence: The way to avoid many problems.
Be careful or i will include you in my plans.
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning.

"Wow. Your lady friend is exceedingly insecure with her 'my man, don't flirt' gibberish. Good catch. Enjoy that."
Shoot me.
"I should be working, but i'm here instead."

Black Friday. Why?
"If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room."

"Fact: If your walking around the streets with Bluetooth Hands-Free on your ear, you look like a fucking asshole."

"I really don't have a problem with him as long as he doesn't talk to me, look at me or is anywhere near me and i don't see or hear his name."

"My ""I hate you"" face must be very similar to my ""Tell me more"" face."
Me: Sorry about the tragedy. Her: What tragedy? Me: Your face.
I got a pocket full of sunshine.
Stress is caused by giving a fuck.
"Two reasons why i curse: because i fucking want to, because i fucking can."

It's all fun and games and jokes until you fucking piss me off.
"If you don't like it, you can see your way to the door. Go boy, you're the man."
I do what I want.
Control. I'm here.
Your flirting is a turn off. Unless you're flirting with me.
Everyone matters. Unless you're being a fucking asshole. Then you don't matter at all.
Do your thing and don't care if they like it.
"Darling, you're fucked up."
I've got 'bullshit' antenna. You're coming in loud and clear.

Put on your big boy briefs and deal with it.
I just called to say i don't love you.
Just because you have one doesn't mean you have to be one.
"Just because i'm listening, doesn't mean i care."

Vodka doesn't ask silly questions. Vodka understands.
You haven't seen my bad side yet.

My favourite coffee in the morning is the one where you shut the fuck up while i drink it.
