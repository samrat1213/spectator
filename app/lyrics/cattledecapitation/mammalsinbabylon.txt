We had it all
The whole of Eden in our hands
The privilege of existence
The ubiquitous lay of the land
We suffocate ourselves
We defecate on the product line
Fell under our own spell
Carelessly crafted hell
You can’t escape your own rape when you’re not the only rapist
Too Many people in this world to simply forgive, to only forget
Obsessive procreators
Destined for failure
Mine eyes caught staring through these mercenaries
Ashamed that I am of the same class
Carnivora, Primates, Rodentia = Mammalia
No reason to suffer… suffer anymore
Not today… in this day and age
The stench of sulphur, brimstone-lined shores
Lake of flames… is this day and age
As a human, slave unto my acumen
Request to defect, reject this sect imperfect
Too Many people in this world
to simply forgive, to only forget
Obsessed with ideas of saviors
Destined for failure
Perturbing vertebrates
Articulated subordinates
Scatter
Sociopathic pervasive demographic
The messiah, the humans, these ingrates, goddamn them all
Contaminate, infested, adulteration - Hominoidea
