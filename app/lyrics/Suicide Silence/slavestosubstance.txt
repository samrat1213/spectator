You're all slaves.

So sit back bitch, what the fuck's it gonna be?
Are you listening to me?
It's your dependence robbing innocence,
Is this really who you wanted to be?

Rock bottom is your wake-up call. 
Oh my god you're pitiful, your dependence robbing innocence.
That makes you a slave to substance, eeah!
Slaves, you're fucking worthless.

You see that you've hit the bottom, you see everything is wrong.
You see that you've hit the bottom (slaves in shackles).
You see that you've hit the bottom, right now your mind is gone
You see that you've hit the bottom (slaves in shackles).

Slaves! To substance, eeah! That makes you a slave!
You're fucking worthless!
I'm gonna sit back with my shades on
Watching you make all the same mistakes we all went through.

Everything that I've been through that I regret,
I'm watching you do now ever since we met.


It's your dependence robbing innocence,
Is this really who you wanted to be?
Slaves in shackles! Never to be set free,
That makes you a slave!
That makes you a slave! to substance, eeah!
That makes you a slave! You're fucking worthless!

(And now you see that you've hit the bottom,
And now you see everything is wrong.
And now you see that you've hit the bottom,
And now you see that your mind is gone.
And now you see that you've hit the bottom,
And now you see that everything is wrong.
And now you see that you've hit the bottom,
That's why I wrote this song!)
