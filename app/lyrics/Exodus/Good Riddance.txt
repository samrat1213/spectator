Cesspool in orbit
Our end has begun
We live on the third lump of shit from the sun
Planet in peril
But why give a fuck?
Soon the earth will run out of luck
Wreck it all
Until the land is stripped
Rejoice in the coming apocalypse
Sing loud the world's last lullaby
But my reply's

Good riddance
Goodbye
So long to this fucking world
Sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance
Goodnight
Adios planet earth
Now die

Parasitic infestation
Never ending procreation
Our shit stained constellation
Headed for its cancellation
Eternity of desecration
Another misread calculation
Give the earth one last ovation
Before it starts the final
Crash and burn
Solo Lee Altus
Solo Gary Holt

Get down to business
Cut to the chase
It's time for mankind's fall from grace
The end's coming sooner than you'll ever know
So sit back, relax and enjoy the show
No time to cry
I won't shed a tear
This is, after all the event of the year
"We can save the world"
You testift, but my reply's

Good riddance
Goodbye
So long to this fucking world
Sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance
Goodnight
Adios planet earth
Now die

Good riddance
Goodbye
So long to this fucking world
Sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance
Goodnight
Adios planet earth
Now dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
