Love Me Lyrics
You don't see me in the hood
That's 'cause I'm doin' this, man

Niggas, I'm still grindin' (Yeah), I still hearin' those sirens
I'm still gettin' chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writin' more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (For sure)
And I can't let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back (Going nowhere, man)
We got them craps goin' on and that 'ac goin' on
Soon as a nigga touch down, back from tourin'
It's whatever (Whatever, man), put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time (Show 'em)
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out (Show 'em)
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
And show me love, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (Ha-ha)
Hold you through the night (Ha-ha, right)
I just wanna love ya (We wanna love alcohol)
For the rest of my life (We wanna love guns)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (We wanna love money, ha)
Hold you through the night (We don't wanna love no bitches, though)
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice, that's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me, it's cockamanie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero uno
Assume it, there's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (And all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain (Yeah!)
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
911 Porsche same color as cranberry sauce (Woo!)
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit (Huh-uh)
Let me find out he fuckin' 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape
I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose (God-damn!)
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats (Huh-uh)
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah)

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I love the burners, the money)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (The bunnies, I just wanna hold you, ha-ha-ha)
Hold you through the night
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (I just wanna love you)
Hold you through the night (Yeah!)41Embed
