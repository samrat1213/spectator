Our mother earth is in peril
Our mother earth
They've come to rape her 'til it bleeds
Our dead planet's resources are useless

Descending with malicious purpose
Beating all species into submission
To drive this planet to its knees

To wipe this slate clean
Demolish and redevelop the biosphere
In the image of their own

Cower!
Cower before their death machine!

An imposing display of power
Destructive forms of technology
Plowing a path of debris and lifelessness

Tremors resonate through the earth
Every person, every home, trampled in its wrath
Terraformed and changed forever
The world is terrified

This is no longer your home
But a host to forces unimagineable
