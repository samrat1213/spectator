A creamy white, waxy substance
Accumulates on your body
The cheeks, breasts, abdomen and buttocks
Are full of this stinking crap
Your fat reacts with water and hydrogen
In the presence of bacterial enzymes
Breaking down into fatty
Acid and soap
Your adipocere
Is resistant to bacteria
And can protect your corpse
Slowing further decomposition
But the sight of your abdomen
The color of your cheeks
Indicate that your grave wax
Will take overEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
