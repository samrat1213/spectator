To the caldarium we retreat from these days of rape
Wielding bounty of the harvest that starves this world of the essence that makes it worth living in...
Famished from the killing, the work that we've done and the blood we've been spilling
Violence takes a lot out of a man
Raping the rapists that molest the land

I require total immersion in human waste

Into the public bath
Reservoir of human excretions
The sweat and urine of a thousand men
A goddamned bacteria trap
Microbes making love to amoebas
Spawning secondary human byproducts
Dead skin cells, ejaculate and flora
Disgusting cocktail for the gargling...

Soaking in bathwater rich with contaminates
Gargling the residuals squeezed off by humans
Drinking from the waters these people have voided in
Molesting myself in the drink and exploiting the public

We are what you call disturbed.

Into the tepidarium we retire to baths that inspire
An invigorating relief of the nightmare -- the life where man destroys everything that's right there
Tarnished and stinking, a days work is done and now closed with the drinking of the essence of humanity
The juice of the populace, the taste of profanity

Into the public bath
Aquatic hotbed of human diseases
Crabs with tentacles, stabbing your testicles
A goddamned bacteria trap
Planaria digest and excrete the protists
Spawning nitrogen, vital precipitation
Fecal particles and the foam of ejaculate - enrichment
A taste for the waste

We walk through shallows of shit
We're wading in it
Urea, mucus and human jit
We love the taste of it...

We walk through shallows of shit
We're wading in it
Urea, mucus and human jit
We're basted with it

We walk through shallows of shit
We're wading in it
Sweat, sperm, diarrhea and spit
We love the taste of it...
