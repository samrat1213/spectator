D.E.A.D. LyricsShards of broken machinery
Gears dislodged and flailing
Flesh gives steel no challenge
Bones cannot withstand
Blades will smash resistance
Chains will drive the hunting of the flesh
Slick through the skin straight to the soul
Leaving no breathing man alive
Kill them all
Knock down their walls, flatten their homes
Leaving no place for the humans to hide
Kill them all
Burn every bridge
Scorch every crop in case one survives
Kill them all
Burn every one
Grind their bones to dust
Mere flesh cannot withstand us
We have come to wipe this planet clean
To end your consumption
Mere flesh cannot withstand me
I've come to wipe this planet clean
To clean to burn to grind
Blades will smash resistance
Chains will drive the hunting of the fleshEmbed
