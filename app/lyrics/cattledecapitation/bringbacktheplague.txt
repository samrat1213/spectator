Yersinia Pestis

The recurring pandemic
Not often enough it seems
For these mammalian hosts
A systematic invasion is a must

These scattering rats
Their diseased existence
Earth's megalopoli, a plague focus
Eradicated with Death's persistence

The density of the populace intensifies and modernized
The wrath of God bleeds from their eyes
And like the raven, this contagion keeps repeating, ever eating
Humanity to nevermore

Every body, a host
Every body, infected
Corpses white as a ghost
Naturally selected

Every body, a host
Every body, infected
Corpses white as a ghost
Naturally selected

Black Death, you've found us
Your cloak surrounds us
Boundlessly drown us
In bacillus countless

Bring back the plague
Delete those that threaten a new world
Start today
Dig their graves

They'll find a way
To rid the world of finding new tomorrows
End of days
Dig those graves

Bring back the plague
Even if it means your own survival
Is at stake
Dig your grave

We'll find a way
To rid the world of everyone tomorrow
End of days
Dig our grave
