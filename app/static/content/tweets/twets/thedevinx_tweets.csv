Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Racing around to come up behind you again.
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
"No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun."

She often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
You'll lose your mind and play Free games for may
There is no other day  Let's try it another way
We roll and roll   Help me roll away the stone
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry ev'ry time
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore
Shade my eyes and I can see you
Green is the colour of her kind Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
And if I live on the shelf like the rest And if love bleeds like a sad song
"She is calling from the deep, Summoning my soul to endless sleep."
