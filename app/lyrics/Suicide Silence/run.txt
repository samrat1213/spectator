Run

I'm sorry is something that I'll never say
And I don't expect it from you
I want you to know how I'm doing and where I've been
Even though I already know
You know

I've been so cold
I've been so cold

I hope you know how it feels to get away
I bet you know, I bet you know
Don't run away from me
I bet you know how it feels to get away
I bet you know, I bet you know
Don't run away from me

Cause I'll run right towards you and I will embrace you
In that you'll be there for me too
You were my friend even in my imagination
You were my friend invisibly
A father's grip

I've been so cold
I've been so cold

I hope you know how it feels to get away
I bet you know, I bet you know
Don't run away from me
I bet you know how it feels to get away
I bet you know, I bet you know
Don't run away from me

Don't run
Don't run
Run

Don't run
Run
Run
Don't fucking run

I bet you know how it feels to get away
I hope you know, I hope you know
Don't run away from me
I bet you know how it feels to get away
I bet you know, I bet you know
Don't run away from me
