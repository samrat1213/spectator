Life is the door to doom, dark angels awaiting
Blood was shed, the red moon arises
In lust I live, in hate I trust
Lead the way to the gates of hell

My name is Blasphemy and my name is Pain
My name is Vengeance and my name is Insane
My name bears relevance as my name is Fear
My name is Bringer of Harlotry, Bloodshed and Tears

Serve the masses, serve the sheep
Serve the darkness and the demons within

Demons, my skin is scarred by the hands of God
Demons, I will bow to no one, I am my own faith

With no fear in heart, with passion for suffering
I re-create Armageddon and all of the sins

Life is the door to doom
Alive

See me feed the new revelation
See me bleed rivers of wrath
See me bleed eternal damnation
See me feed of the flesh of your Christ
You are of proud looks and lying tongues
You're born of hands that shed innocent blood
You are a witness that uttereth lies
You soweth discord among your brethren

Bind them furiously upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck
Scorch the Earth with burning fear and turn it into ash
Dawn of retribution, day of mourning, Lucifer and the feast
Reap the seed that we have sown, purgatory unleashed

Hear me call for hell and its legions, unleash hate, vengeance and pride
See me burn the pillars of heaven, see me crush your book of lies
Watch me burn heavenly creatures, unleash hate, vengeance and pride
See me light the candles of darkness, I am the destroyer of lies

My skin is scarred by the hands of God
I will bow to no one, I am my own faith

[Solo: Mike Wead]

With passion for suffering, with no fear in heart
I re-create Armageddon and all of the sins

Life is the door to doom
Alive
I am pride, I am envy
I am gluttony, I am sloth
I am lust, I am greed
I am wrath perfectedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
