Estranged outcast
Condemned to trash and leftover
Slid off the plate into a vat
Churned with milk and animal fat
Nose, ears, lips, and eyelids
Fuzzy strips of pigskin and cow-clits
Made into the finest cheeses-throbbing
And lined with diseases
A sight worse than human jerky
Poultry products turned to meat and pus compund
Jellified pig parts smothered in succulent lard
Rotten hors d'ourves for the gorging
