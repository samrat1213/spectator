Rotting corpse lie in the ditch
Pus start to gush from every scurf
Curdled glands excrete stench
Unbearable a wild stench
Smell the corpse, stinking corpse
Still you like rotten flesh
Bloody gore flows down the soil
Yellow phlegm leaks from the throat
This poor corpse what lie in the ditch
Is eaten by the maggots, I'm sorry for him
Red eyesockets on this man
Gush enzymes from core of brain
Soggy insides are full of remains
Strangulation, mutilation
Smell the corpse, stinking corpse
Still you like rotten flesh
Bloody gore flows down the soil
Yellow phlegm leaks from the throat
Stenching gash, swollen heart
Eaten alive by putrid mass
Flaking tissue, dirty kidneys
Crushing heart it's vermins country
Beautiful view of swollen limbs
All your phlegm changes into pus
Splattered limbs by juicy vomit
You can throw your defecation to the garbageEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
