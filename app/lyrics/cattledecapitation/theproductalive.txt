Violently passive consumer -- vital statistic
A gear in a machine spinning out of control and ever ready to explode
The cemetery will carry on -- with carrion, turned to ashes
The species will die the harder they try to control the masses

Itemized flesh -- scanned inventory
A New Testament in greed
Taking count -- humanity is the product
Ever expanding the marketplace, dissolving the commonwealth
Pandemic -- the damnation, epic

If this is the answer, then count me out.
Humanity is the cancer, and I want out.

Dead monolith -- towering cesspool of Babel
Dreams of tyrants -- the product alive

Excessive commodity -- dominant ideology
Self-destructive machine spinning out of control and ever ready to implode
The cemetery will carry on -- with carrion, turned to ashes
The species will die the harder they try to control the masses

I walked inside the monolith
In plastic I was reborn

If this is the answer, then count me out.
Humanity is the cancer, and I want out.

Dead monolith -- towering cesspool of babel!
Dreams of tyrants -- the product alive
