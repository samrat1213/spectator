I cannot wait any longer for the end: apocalypse!
I detest all life. As a destroyer. As a human.

We need to die.
We need to die.

Self-imposed extinction
Extermination inevitable
Stop wasting our time
Do us in now.
NOW.
NOW.

Depress the lever
Cast us into the never
Release this world
Destroy us.

We cannot wait any longer... Destroy us.
