Twisting limbs untill they break
Contortions wrenching pain

Joints are hyperextended
Opposite
Fibrous tendons snap
Bent
Backwards and broken

Hateful physical control
Opposite ways
Elbows bend and pop
Fingers cracking
Connective tissue torn

Unrelenting warping strain
Knees are shattered
Sinew ripped from bone
Ankles give way

Back is arching
Spinal pressure builds
Total collapse

Predacious entanglement, form is distorted
Grotesque rearrangement, body contorted

Splintering bones causing internal bleeding
Abundance of injuries, pain is exceeding

Every joint in the body is turned the wrong way
A debt to the nemesis forcibly paid

Arching the back
Vertebrae crack
Fracture the spine
Can't realign

<i>[Solo Jack Owen]</i>

Torque on the neck
Structure is wrecked
Amorphous blob
An end to macabre

A torturous lesson in physical terms
The only way some people learn
Stretching the body in every direction
Forcing the joints unnatural flexion

<i>[Solo Pat O'Brien]</i>

Twisting limbs until they break
Contortions wrenching pain
Bent
Bent
Bent
Backwards and broken
