MeTroS Finest LyricsI don't want to die alone
I don't want to die alone
I keep it too low-key
I'm in the whooptie by my lonely
I just went to Mc Wilson's and and got a scoopy in a Coney
Imma ride around a minute till I seek out a spot
And Imma roll up a doobie so clean at it get ya Mama hot
Welcome to a new day
Whatcha wanna do wit it
Traveled to you through outer space to figure out a new way to improve the quality of what you see and who be who eh, ( he's new wit it
Boy you mess with me you gonna rock the noble knock cuz wit my zippys on you touch me and my crease goone get it poppin
Duun you not gon see me sliding less you pull up at the light beside me
Rollin up to PAC n say something stupid like Biggie shot him
I'd put on Come On rap Eminem's part in Dead Wrong, Vontes on it
I been Gettin it going and the trap they got it poppin
They say boy you got a girlfriend
I said hell no I don't want one
I don't talk about my job in traffic
Bitch I'm gonna haunt you
I don't talk about my job at practice either I'm a MONSTER
You're drinking
JKwon didn't know me cuz
I'm all about responsible
Jennifer honey how badly do you want me in your rabbit hole?
When I fuck I fuck it up right it ain't funny
Shiiiit nigga hook me up wit a bowl
I'm a go getter
No hoe hitter
Bad Beau wit a belt and buckle that's gold
You gon need the Mafia to fuck wit what we got
Believe me I have been waiting to eat some sketti with the BOSS
Said you heard about me once you better share before I cock and block ya
Pablo didn't tell me you were coooooming amigo I got ya
By the time this done you probably gone rewind it
I put up a plaid plaque on the wall n I called it Metros Finest
She said im Daddy when we sober
When we smoke she say Your Highness
We got it bad
All of Nova Scotia to Sackville
New Brunswick behind us
Riders
We won't need the lies /you talmbout
We find peace at times/ya mama house
We stone freaks of neon dreams
Speaking on me and mines the party fouls
Lay my words to rest be dead the other side is mine I died
Grandma said I'm blessed ain't no dimming when my light be shinin
Shooter at high speeds they ain't no missing when I'm right beside ya
Boy you don't know me you snuck and dissed on uncommitted crimes
I'll pull up to your house and lay your head to rest a final time
Figure out yaself before you speak on me and wind up dying
Llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
I'm with the shits I flex on all the platinum syndacote trickslllllllllllllllllll
I'm in the clicc and I ball about and I'm counting my richeslllllllllllllllllllll
I chew it up and spit it out, I keep it wet for the bitchesllllllllllllllllllllllllll
The stickllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
I got it bout that longlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
And it said bitch mind ya businesslllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllEmbed
