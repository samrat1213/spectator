No foul deed shall go left unpunished
What goes around comes back again
Infinity fold.
Brutality in ouroboros.

Blood stained hands means
bloody karma
you'll live to regret
ever existing at all

Hand me the axe O god of destruction
Karma has a blade for all the appendages
Stabbed in the back, in the face, in the neck
In the head, in the ass
Self-fulfilled prophecy.

Cause and effect
You shall reap what you sow

This is my dharma. Unflinchingly killing.
Unbridled hate and revenge on humanity

For vengeance... Nirvana through ensanguined ecstasy...
You shall die like the pigs that you are.

Cause and effect
You shall reap what you sow

Karma bloody karma bloody karma bloody murder

Hand me the axe, O god of destruction
Karma has a blade for all of humanity
