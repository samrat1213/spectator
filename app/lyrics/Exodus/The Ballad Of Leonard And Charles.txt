[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Lecherous inhuman monsters
Piteous crimes carried out
Patriarchs to the lunatic fringe
They venerate what has been done
They turned a small town in northern California
Into the haunt of the damned
Devoid of all comprehension
The most vicious hateful part of man

[Refrain]
Dragging their victims into lunacy
And putting it all on film
Wretched dregs of society
Killers of children
Rapists of women
Sado-sexual violence

[Verse 2]
Immoral killing with indifference
Aroused as your victims cry
Unjust pain they love to inflict
Breaking their souls, then their minds
Malevolent and rancid perversions
The outcome is always death
Bodies thrown down into a hole
Maggots consuming the flesh
[Refrain]
Dragging their victims into lunacy
And putting it all on film
Wretched dregs of society
Killers of children
Rapists of women
Sado-sexual violence

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Fear - A macabre madness
Fiendish carnage with rabid butchery
Pain - Sadistically tortured
Rejoicing in their victims slavery
Rape - Forced violations
Malicious desecration of the thrall
Slave - Depraved exploitation
A sickening anguish for them all
Sado-sexual violence

[Verse 4]
Sick - Twisted rituals
Vile defiling the enslaved
Lie - decimate aspirations abused
At the hands of the deranged
Kill - And slaughter the damned
With gruesome and heinous suffering
Death - Merciless killing
With despicable and cruel agony
Sado-sexual violence
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Excoriate the legal system
Exposing all of its flaws
One kills himself with cyanide
The other makes a mockery of the law
The act of killing eroticized
Dismissive to call you insane
Committed horrific and brutal crimes
Then laughing with total disdain

[Refrain]
Dragging their victims into lunacy
And putting it all on film
Wretched dregs of society
Killers of children
Rapists of women
Sado-sexual violence
