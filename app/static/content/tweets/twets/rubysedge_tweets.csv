a rusting blade of honour still in use despite its dullness
burned his name onto my skin to remind him of what devotion is
the glowing lovers shone so bright at dusk; they will not last long in a world so vicious
fought for my truth all my life; now i die for it
acid clouds and nuclear fissions stoking the violence deep inside of me
isotopic heart of mine rapidly decaying
natural selection tears us apart and buries us
in awe of the infrared rays that saturated your eyes so prettily
ensnared in the iron chains of consciousness and paradoxes
suffering through an artificial implosion of the human mind

dreamed of a mansion with unlimited rooms
"quick witted, sly and lanky he smiles down at me"
a forbidden love affair
my goddess glides across the heavens in a silver chariot pulled by swans
the musings of my soul are heard only by the swans

there is no meaning to be found in what we have
we chase each other in the labyrinth of secrets

chemicals in my lungs make it hard to breathe
i always crawled back to him despite my bruises
serpentine princess with her crown of bones
"intense and brooding, a trail of dead men behind him"

a sacrifice of my soul to aphrodite
to be locked in oblivion with the faint memory of him
love was a drugged haze
a small forever built together with a man i never saw again
"in the palace of venus, i lounge with the other nymphs"
"in the dead of night, my heart whispers, ""is it safe yet?"""
a dance with banshees to celebrate death
i crossed the stream and looked the wendigo in the eye; in his rotten hands was everything i ever dreamed of
i wish to die in my fairytale dreams
i'll wait forever in oblivion if i have to
"tell me the story of a girl so fair, repentance followed her"
to be on your own in winter is a bitter burden to bear
to live in accordance with nature
foolishly and desperately digging in oblivion
life goal: become blood brothers with a fae
he gifted me an emerald necklace to protect me
"most of all, i prayed for catherine howard's soul"
pray to the dresden dolls
glass idols smashed against the sidewalk
curse of venus woven in my soul
fox spirited taurus man watches me at night
i can't stand to watch myself die again and again
the theory of broken promises
calypso locked in a cage
the swan taunted me with promises of love
secrets i kept in leather bound books that i never should have told him
i am merely a symbol of beauty
"one day he kissed my scars, the next day he was gone"
frivolous stage performer who swept me off my feet
hardened soldier toughened by loss
sweet lady ophelia who smelled of wildflowers; gentle and free
all this suffering was done in vain
no one ever tells young girls that love feels like getting skinned alive
my prince left me to die
dance in the dark glow of the dusk until i'm bloody
"the show begins, the actors are still asleep"
a compromised suicide
"forever she stayed there, singing by the sea"
fuck me till i'm broken
"my shining new hero, braver and softer than the dawn"
i'd kill them all if you wanted me to
i begged him to run away with me
beautiful boy from the countryside
under the golden peach tree i prayed my rotten prayers
from the bones of mycenae
circus of demons
hard to be good and kind when i feel my soul rotting
a fanciful actor who used the prettiest words
"the love letters i couldn't send to him, i carved into my thigh"
the archetypes of history
"winter gnaws at my skin, threatening to disembowel me"
fermentation of rage
vainglorious lioness
"live for love, live for drugs"
a tapestry woven from lies hangs over my bed
gentle healing with milkweeds
the swan shaped bed where he told me his secrets
"he'll come back, he always does"
dreams of oblivion to lay my soul to rest
"imprisoned by the vines, i lay still"
the forgotten goddesses of love
"lovely as the morning, fresh as the sunlight"
there will come a day when the scars no longer ache
begging and pleading her to let me have him
intertwined at the atomic level
carved his whisper into my tender flesh
burning and purifying my soul like molten gold
reckless love to burn this town
shivering in my veins
the giggle of the curse
interdimensional vacation blues
fascistic weeds choking the life out of this town
the taste of chaos burns my tongue
this raw and tender connection between us is all i need
a girl born from the ocean shouldn't die on land
"somewhere along the way, the lines between justice and bloodlust must've gotten blurred"
the glimmering trees in heaven
worship of false gods who ignore our prayers
no escape from this death cult
this idolisation of vanity will rot us inside out
chase me to the ends of this earth
a lesson of pain
tear my heart muscles with your teeth
"on the seventh day, the perfect child of satan will rise"
rebirth is so ugly
god bless the sunken cities that came before us
this sterile hospital room is all i've ever known
nobody can find me under my blanket of thorns
i loved losing my mind more than i loved her
the truth is that i feel my heart slowing down more and more with each passing day
the crimes of the gallant prince cannot be hidden
pleiades has fallen eons ago but lives on in me
the sweetest drug to lose my mind to
pray for the drugs to take my heart and soul
my drugs take me to a place where i am free and powerful
no purer love than that of a healer and a bringer of destruction
"trapped in a crystal cave, no noise escapes us"
"under the weeping willow, i lay decaying"
i love my drugs just as much as they rot me
nobody reads my scars as well as she does
on a balcony overlooking the sea in the mediterranean
my stars bleed without her near
i can't love you the way you need but i can try
find me at the edge of the broken portal
princess of the slaughterhouse
the sweetest pain i've ever tasted
"for every person saved, there was a thousand dead"
watch the stars burn in their homes
"glittery daze in a smoky room, electric melody screaming"
conqueror of the north
fever haze chokes the life from me
"in the palace of aphrodite, i heed her every command on my knees"
there is no home for me to go back to
she left ghosts behind wherever she went
love me for everything i am and everything i'm not
search for me in the evergreen forest
iridescent memories weigh heavy on me
live forever in my moss covered heart
you're something to die for
icy hands on my pale throat
a gentle smile breaks across her war torn face
"i whisper secrets to the reeds, i tell them that i love you"
my girl on the other side of the world
selkie girls dancing in the ballroom
give my blood to the shrine for aphrodite
nothing in this world is purer than knowledge and science
i cloak myself in the violence that surrounds her
a somber woman with bloodstains on her hands
"harpies circle my corpse, fighting over my flesh"
a home for broken and mismatched things
she prays for vengeance and i pray for her
cut me open and take what you need
stay with me and choose to be happy for once
the only thing worth protecting in this world is mothers
i'm not afraid of the rage inside you
"when we have defeated all our so called enemies, do we start fighting each other"
the culture calls for homogenized thinking and tells us this is liberation
why are we more concerned with feeling like we did the right thing over actually doing the right thing
take me to the lake where no one knows my name
garden of eden on mercury
she held my life in her hands and i never felt so light
read my scars like the storybooks from your childhood
"i dance in the shadows, i live in your soul"
i've watched you die before. i'm not afraid
"her taut muscles relaxes under my touch, that's how i know she loves me"
a virgo woman healed me
"my girl waits for me back in our stone cottage, far, far north"
anyone care to dip in the waters of misery with me?
sad today but still pretty
have you heard the tale of the storm who fell in love with a human
our magnetic fields intertwined so intimately that i couldn't say no to you
a lover who speaks only in riddles
blood of the sea
the romans will rise again
gallant hero in apollo's chariot is finally here to save the city
what type of bacteria is love
gave up my heart for my dream to survive
no respite for the hero's widow
do not take the goddess' name in vain
take me to the realm of pisces
the marble pillars of history stand tall and proud forever
laid on the shores of rubicon and prayed for change
"born to be sacrificed, the curse of thermopylae lives on"
competing in a beauty pageant held in oblivion
scarlet haze on a summer day bound me so enticingly
a pisces princess sweet on my tongue like sugar
the worthy man lives in a copper house
the one i love was always silent and unmoving
no sweeter intimacy than sharing ice cream
spirit of scorpio in my veins
antares smiles down on me and caresses my aching soul
sew my lips shut so i'll never sing again
mother earth weeps with anger at what her children has done to her
we are simply living on the borrowed essence of the universe
the truth is in my dreams
our atoms have danced together in each life
i am armed with a sword forged from rage
how pretty the emerald lake is at night
"in the big city, my pain will be replaced with numbness and that's all i need"
slept all day and felt my spirit wilt away
melt your bones away for rebirth
join me in the circus of tears. tonight i will put on a show for you
the stranger's blood is on my hands but i don't understand why
crown of blood and gore as she rose as the queen of hell
the world stops down here
yearn for nothing but art
"in the end, i finally have my bittersweet honeymoon"
ruby necklace hanging from her neck like blood droplets
i search for the forgotten stars and abandoned planets at night
time is an illusory prison
you can't do it alone
store my memories in a crystal box so they'll never escape me
"pleiades and atlantis, home to overlooked greatness in the modern era"
our love language transcends time and reality
midnight in my locket
carve a smile on my face with your silk knives
keep me locked in your plastic heart
weaving with a cosmic thread
cells of the great fire live on in me
she wore a dress woven from honeysuckle silk
forever wandering the salt pillars by myself
embers light me up from the inside
serve him poison cakes
i grew up on the cries of a widow
braiding dreams into her red hair
i want to dip my toes in rosewater
amber eyes look right into mine
my mother's song is all i need
hide me under your ribs
"the city glares, its gaze icy cold"
sapphires were buried beneath the bay or so she told me
"on my birthday, she got me a pure white horse"
bone dragons feast on the sins of kings
scarlet lover of mine
her hair was gold but there was no sunlight to be found
i am reborn from brimstone
the crystal chandeliers reflect my contemplation back to me
we stumbled around the endless hallways of the hotel at 3am
the shadow men who smell of smoke never tell me anything
we watched the bloodbath from our penthouse in the sky
a diamond necklace to buy my silence
drug me till all i see are flashing lights
dress me in black satin and whisper lies in my ear
drinking blood in wine glasses on the roof of the hotel
made my home in a city built from violence
july doesn't taste sweet like it used to
may the pain fester and rot inside you
the price of dreaming is too high
come with me. we'll drown together
hold onto this rage. you will need it later
the great cultural divide prophesied to unravel the seams of society
etched my name on the halls of history so little girls with untamed spirits in the future will know that they will never be alone
summer is in her eyes
"when the world came to an end, we danced"
she prays on her knees to a god who turned his back to her years ago
my poetry is where my mind and soul meet
cruel girl in a cruel world
"i love you, even if you can't love me the way i want to be loved"
you want change? accept the destruction that comes with it
singing lullabies to the violets in my backyard
the girls at the country club brush their hair and put on their diamond necklaces as they whisper to one another
she's more than i could ever dream to be
we're burning with passion that could make the sun weep
"until then, i'll wait in my tower, free from the cruel grasp of time"
strong and sinewy like a young tree
let's lie down and watch the seasons change
"every empire and kingdom in the world has crumbled to dust, forgotten"
the ocean will claim all of us again one day
soft and violent in nature
let the waves carry me away and cover my body with sea foam
in my dreams i'm barefoot and free and she is with me
she carried herself with the silent intensity of a tiger on the prowl
just because we haven't met on this plane of existence yet doesn't mean we aren't meant to be
"my silver spring, my shining autumn"
"the sun rises, and so does my spirit"
"she gave me a silver compass and told me it'll lead me back home to her, no matter how far i am"
"after the fires burn the old trees to ash, new life will emerge"
"in another life, there are two girls lying side by side in a meadow"
"ironically, we kill others to become the hero"
she lays me on a canopy of leaves and promises me the world
those tattoos on her skin don't mean anything
"step back, take a breath and consult the sun and moon before you determine the truth"
good people dont worry about being good. they just are
the honest man and woman should not have to suffer in place of those with blood on their hands
"the universe is always there for u and her help comes in many forms. in the form of a lover, a friend, a friendly stray cat and countless other forms"
mass hysteria is how they control us
the violence in my soul is at war with the vulnerability of my heart
our fairytale sings of misery
"just as the yearning of my heart keeps me alive, it kills me"
stay for a while and read me stories from your past. i'll listen.
my bones sing to me. each day they grow more and more silent
my heart aches for the woman who carried the weight of the sun on her shoulders
reality is just a state of mind
"one day, lovers from another time will remember us"
"long after we are gone, the earth will heal herself and give birth to new life, making them out of the atoms she made us out of"
nothing we do will be permanent in the tides of history
"oblivion stares at me, inviting me to take a dip"
the fact that flowers grow from this earth shows that there is good in this world
the stars are blind
i need you
the world may not be pretty but you are
praying naked in the pale moonlight
the moon tells me it'll all be okay and to let myself heal
summer lovin on my girl
"and in the silence of the night, she cried and the stars wept with her"
my heart yearns for the sea. let me go home
"no hype under our covers, it's just me and you"
weaving flowers in her hair as the wind whispers lullabies
waiting for the milky dawn to come
i leave the window open when i sleep to let the moon kiss me
"i'll find you, just like i have thousands of years ago"
the only thing left for us to do is to be happy
the line between dreams and reality blur around you
forever will never be long enough
my soul yearns for yours when we are apart
i lost myself in your embrace
"all we need is each other, the sun and the moon"
i'd rip out every star in the sky and give them to you if you asked
