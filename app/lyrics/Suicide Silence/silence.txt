Here we are,
Are we transparent?
Fall into the skies with me
Hope, is a discretion
Anger at a God!

It takes, nothing to say
Just how still you had me!

Silence, breathing in your fear
Silence, death is all I hear

Bleed! You fucker!

War, berates us
The simplest heartbeat connects us
Rivers are flowing to the ocean
I will meet you at the bottom

It takes nothing to say
Just how still you had me!

Silence, breathing in your fear
Silence, death is all I hear

Die! You fucker!
Your fucking death is complete

Hold head high
Ego must be low
To move ahead
You must let go

To hold head high
Ego must be low
To move ahead
You must let go

Silence, breathing in your fear
Silence, death is all I hear
...
