Oh say can you see
My stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says
"Come as you are"
And I will
Nighttime is almost ours

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing 'til you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost ours
