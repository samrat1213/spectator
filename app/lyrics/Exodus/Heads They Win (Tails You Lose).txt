A turn of a card may decide file or death
You better take this lesson from me
Some have it all, then a roll of the dice
Can take them for everything
Night after night you bet all you have
Hoping you won't find yourself in a ditch
More unpaid debts, snake eyes again!

The fever starts to take its toll
You fell your blood begin to boil
When the wheel starts to roll
Don't be late to pay your dues
Or you'll get your concrete shoes
Heads they win, tails you lose

So let it ride and bet it all
Given any moment you can win or fall
The money you owe, the money you spent
You're caught digging in the jar for this month's rent
They've taken the car you don't pay your debts
They're gonna foreclose on all the rest
How did you get your life in this mess?

Take a good look as you bet your last buck
It comes up tails and you're out of luck
You'd better skip town 'cause your cash has run short
You borrowed from loan sharks and didn't report
Your name's on a hit list all over town
The word on the streets is to bury this clown
Your lease on life is about to expire
The season's all over it's time to retireEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
