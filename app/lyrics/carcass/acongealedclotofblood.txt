Come decapitate the fasiq you made with the praiseworthy's blade
Come eradicate the false imam slay in the great prophet's name
Heathenist hate dar al-harb you create for the holy prophet you maim
Death's coda
Bloody dystopia
Dajjal soldier of unholy warfare

For you will discover nothing true but eternal human bloodshed
For do true prophets come armed with sword and chariot?

A dark standard raised-juxtaposing dyad
The profit of rage-the jihadist black flag
A dark standard raised-juxtaposing dyad
The scimitar blade-black flag of jihad

You true infidel the prophet you betray
With the jihadist blade
Feudal infidel, savage, the mind enslaved
Come rise the herald of a new dark age

Death's coda
You're no gods warrior
Extant dystopia

For you will discover that nothing is true but infinite human conflict
For do true prophets come armed with sword?

Rasual al malahim

A dark standard raised-juxtaposing dyad
The profit of rage-the jihadist black flag
A dark standard raise-juxtaposing dyad
Relish a new dark age-black flag of jihad
