Replacing God, human hands conceive and contort a vile creation.
A fatal form is about to be born,
A curse that's birthed with a purpose.
Fear is an infallible distraction when populations confirm.
Propaganda blinds them all while before their eyes, the blueprint to a deceptive design unfolds.

An infectious catalyst has been utilized and deployed, to initiate and spread the installment of new order.
The encroaching wave invades your home.
Silence with no trace of its presence,
This was created to destroy.

Silent, with no trace of its presence and created to destroy.

This is pain,
This is real bloodshed,
And you're surrounded by suffering.
No precaution can spare you from infection,
This was created to destroy.

This is pain,
This is real bloodshed,
And you're surrounded by suffering.

Sharing in these repulsive transformations, your family watches in horror as the symptoms take hold.
Vomit spews and internal acids burn your throat.
Blood flows from every orifice, your body's virulently overtaken.

Conditions worsen as skin cracks and begins to peel.
The fissures spread exposing flesh.
Skin cracks and begins to peel,
The fissures spread exposing flesh.

You are the first to fall victim to instant contagiousness,
Skin cracks and begins to peel.
You are the first of many to suffer from this epidemic,
The precursor to enslavement.
