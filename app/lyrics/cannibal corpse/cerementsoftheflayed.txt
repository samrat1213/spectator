Buried alive wrapped in skin
From another human
That is still alive

Why must I die this way?

Draped in a blood-soaked covering
My suffering a mystery

In the ground barely conscious
Unknown graveyard of the ancients
Is where it all will end

Sacrificial tomb of torment
Excruciating pain to covet
Obtain a new eternal home

Wearing the shroud made of membrane
Cerements of the flayed
Cloaked in the peeled epidermis
Cerements of the flayed

Unburied to live wrapped in skin
From another human
That was still alive

Why didn't I die this way?

Draped in a blood-soaked covering
My suffering a mystery

Up from the ground barely conscious
A new chapter is upon us
When will it all end?

Must endure the grisly torment
Exhilarating pain to covet
Obtain a new external hide

Wearing the shroud made of membrane
Cerements of the flayed
Cloaked in the peeled epidermis
Cerements of the flayed

Shaved of my own pelt
Replaced ceremoniously
Salvaged from oblivion
Regained life through atrocity
Repulsively existing
Perpetual form of agony
Scraped into an endless hell
Sliced meticulously

Exterior invasion
Sickening form of misery
Succumbing to the mayhem
Shocking all humanity

Wearing the shroud made of membrane
Cerements of the flayed
Cloaked in the peeled epidermis
Cerements of the flayed

Of the flayed
Of the flayed
Of the flayed
Of the flayed
