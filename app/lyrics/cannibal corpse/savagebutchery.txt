Striking out with rage I pound him, stomp him
Cocksucking bastard don't feel mercy for him
With bare hands I break his legs, break his neck
Now my jagged blade will bring him to his death

Savage killer merciless machine
Butchering victims and watching them bleed
Savage killer chopping off limbs
Butchering for revenge, heartless assassin

Now the cutting starts I stab him, slash him
Less than a minute he became a victim
Now I will sever his legs, his neck
Hatred enemy his body I dissect
Savage

Savage
Butchery
Ravage
Ruthlessly

Veins spray blood it splashes in my eyes
Impulse of my rage will dictate how he dies
Chopped up while alive or killed with the first strike
What's left of his life is dripping from my knife

Savage killer merciless machine
Butchering victims and watching him bleed
Savage killer chopping off limbs
Butchering for revenge, heartless assassin

Savage
Butchery
Ravage
Ruthlessly
