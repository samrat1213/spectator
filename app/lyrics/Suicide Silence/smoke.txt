Lifting the weight of the world

So take this lung full of pure inspiration
Inhale this lung full to make me smile
And then we'll talk up a real conversation

So take this lung full, become more interesting
Now in your head
The thoughts that you see are depicted so marvelously
So now you see that the weight has lifted
And all your thoughts start to move fluently

I want to know what it is that you see depicted so gloriously

Burn it down, Burn it down, Burn it down
Set yourself free, burn it down

So tell me what it is that you see
Please tell me, describe it's beauty
And then tell me what it is that you see

Depicted so marvelously
In your own head, haunted still by me
Still depicted so violently, so burn them down

Inhale this lung full of pure inspiration
And I promise that all your burden and worry will disappear
In a plume of smoke, in a plume of smoke

Burn it down, set yourself free
