Force-fed and bred on toxins - involuntarily introduced
Gagging on the juice - initiated regurgitation
Progressive organ failure - to the vomitorium I will cater
Leftovers fed to the gators and homovorous human-haters

Total systemic regurgitation
Vomiting complex viscera

Facial fenestral spewage - Human visceral sewage
Exploding insides - Lateral hemorrhage of contents
Excessive disgorge of organs - Within the gore someone can feel "born again"
An expulsion through laryngeal foramen

Unmitigated
Auto-erotic
Digestive disposal
Excretes anatomy

I feel alive when I expel everything inside
Stomach deflates, contents dispersed on my plate
With every orifice I defecate

Every system and organ will be heaved
This exposition must be seen to be believed

Regurgitated anatomy - An exposition of insides
This systemic regurgitant - a warm rejection of life

Knee-deep in liquified chunkage - immoral gastral spunk
Is surrounding me and splattered upon my pale complexion
Expulsive breach of acids are what I shall take a bath in
Intestine, lungs and a liver put to shame the bathtub shitter

I feel alive as I gag the gush, turning my guts into wine

Within integumentary conscience plays a role
Life in expectorate no longer takes a toll

Vomiting everything
