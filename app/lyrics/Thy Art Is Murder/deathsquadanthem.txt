If the mob wants blood
Then they'll fucking get it
You started this war
Now you'll fucking regret it
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me
Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me
If the mob wants blood
Then they'll fucking get it
Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist
Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist
Divide and conquer
While they conjure
Divisive means
For the stronger
Addicted by design
To a system in decline

Arise the scourge of man
Divide the foolish
Dilute the masses
Deprived of liberty
We'll not stand by while
Society collapses
Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me
