<i>[Tanner Womack:]</i>
I hope you forever soak in tears
I will never see you again
I hope you forever soak in tears
I will never see you again

I hope you soak in tears
The shadows, fade away
Before, they scare you
Your, whole soul, turned black

You can't run because lies follow, creeping closer everyday
You can't hide because it knows, just what you've done to me

I hope you soak in tears
I will never see you again
I hope you soak in tears
I will never see you again

Buried between alive and dead
Where have you gone
I hope you forever soak in tears

I will never see you again
I hope you forever soak in tears
I will never see you again
I hope you forever soak in tears

I look everyday, into the shadows
Remembering your face, your touch
How could you have never, done this to me
I've nothing to say for you
The misery in you, your face
