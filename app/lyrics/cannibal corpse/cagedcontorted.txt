Abducted by a psychopath with evil intent
Beaten to the point of unconsciousness
Awakened by the sound of someone screaming in pain...

Realizing now that you are trapped in a cage
Arms and legs in disarray
Bones have all been broken and your limbs are displaced
Body in a horrible state
Unbearable effluvium polluting the air
A nauseating stench of death
Maggots are all over on the walls and the floor
Patiently awaiting for - your flesh...

Numerous victims litter the room
You are not the only one
Various forms of torture
Profaned existence for you all

Strapped to tables - chained to the walls
Fingers are reaching out between floorboards
Others are floating in the air held up by hooks
Drained of their lives...

Caged...Contorted 

<i>[Solo: Barrett]</i>

Realizing now that you will die in this place
Emaciating skin awaits
For the maggots that will crawl onto your body and face
The final phase of your demise...

Paralyzing agony has left you for dead
The psychopath returns to finish the task
Dying to the sound of others creaming in pain...

Caged... Contorted
