Turn your face away from your god.
Nothing can save you from this.
Suck it up bitch, I'm going to fucking own you.
You're fucked.
Say your prayers, fall to your knees.
Look at this face.

There's no such thing as a god.
Motherfucker, open your eyes.
There's no such thing as a god.

I'm inflicting bloodshed upon bitches,
Just because I hate the female race.
There's no remorse.
There's no remorse in me.

I keep wanting to burn my name onto the gospel.
Or burn the Bible to hell.
Religion is a futile attempt to abstain from loosing your mind.
There's no remorse in my eyes.
Women were born to be fucked.

For some men,
The power to destroy a life
Becomes a quest for dominance.
I need to own this world.
I need to own this world!

Murder begins
Where your self-defense ends.

Look in my bloodshot eyes
And feel the presence of hell.

Your life amounts to nothing.
Lifeless slut, in love with God.
Do you believe there's a god in this lifetime?
Do you believe in God?
