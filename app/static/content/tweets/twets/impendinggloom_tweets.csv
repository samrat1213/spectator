"Sometimes, certain things happen in life that are beyond our control. We can’t do anything about it...they just happen. And more times than not, they turn out bad. But then what? What happens next, when it’s all said and done? 1/6"
"When something bad like that happens, we don’t usually enjoy it, but we at least expect some sort of closure. And if we’re not able to get it, it’s both frustrating and painful. It feels hollow and empty, incomplete. 2/6"
"Closure lets us know when something’s over. For better or worse, at least it’s significant in that it symbolizes the end of an event, an occurrence, a relationship or whatever. 3/6"
"If we’re unable to get any closure, it often leaves us feeling uncertain, unsure. Even if it’s agonizing, we still desperately need that closure. That’s the only way we know that something is officially finished and we can start to heal. 4/6"
"Healing, like grief, doesn’t mean we forget what’s happened. But hopefully, it means we can stop obsessing about it and that will eventually lead to us just not being as sensitive to what happened as we were before. 5/6"
"But that’s why we need that closure. Without it, there’s no stopping point for the suffering. And sometimes, sadly, no matter how badly we want it, there’s just not any closure. It may (or may not) be over, but we’re still not sure. 6/6"

"There’s an old expression I hate. It says “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.” But the fact that there are actually more ways than one to interpret that adage is exactly why I hate it so much. 1/6"
"On one hand, I understand the basic logic of it. It’s definitely defeatist, but if you’ve tried everything possible and there’s still simply no way around it, then I suppose that common sense dictates surrender. But at what cost? 2/6"
"By giving up, what else are you actually having to...give up? Are you honestly willing to turn your back on something you’ve been trying so hard to accomplish? I mean...literally give up and walk away from it? Kinda just sounds like quitting to me. 3/6"
"Also, if you’re willing to turn your back on something you (supposedly) feel so strongly about...only just to join the opposition, doesn’t that technically make you a traitor? Were you not originally opposed to that side you just switched to for a reason? 4/6"
"If that’s the case, then does that not equate to giving up on something you actually believe in, and agreeing with something you don’t, just because the odds are against you...even though you know you’re right? 5/6"
"Surrender is such a bitter pill to swallow because you typically don’t have any say-so in the terms. You simply have to accept whatever the other side says. So if you’re OK with that, then by all means, surrender. But you better make damn sure you can live with it first. 6/6"

"If someone sins against you, the universal advice is almost always to forgive them and put it behind you. Just move on, and you’ll free yourself from the pain and anguish you’re suffering. But I’m calling bullshit on that. 2/6"
"I’ve been there too many times. Clearly, there is no other option but to move on...and dwelling on said affront prevents you from doing that, but how does “forgiving” someone honestly make you feel better about what they did to you? 3/6"
"The Lord’s Prayer says we should forgive those who trespass against us, so that God will forgive us, too. But that’s taking into account God’s Divine Nature as opposed to man’s baser instincts. In other words, God forgives. I, on the other hand, am still struggling with it. 4/6"

"Being restless is not synonymous with nervousness, but it’s still an agonizing experience. It’s similar to the unsettling/unnatural calm before a storm. It starts with rumbling thunder in the distance &amp; suspense keeps creeping up until those first few drops of rain start to fall."

"Being human is barbaric at best, and injuries are unavoidable. Some wounds are more serious than others, and Band-Aids don’t fix bullet holes. So cauterize your contusion as quickly as possible and resume pursuit of your initial objective."

"Most societies view revenge in a negative light. They maintain that just because somebody did something to you, simply returning the favor is not going to resolve the problem or make you feel any better, but is that really true? I’ll allow that 2 wrongs don’t make a right, but..."
"Aside from love &amp; simple survival instincts, is there a more straight-forward motive for anything known to man than revenge? Remember: revenge is about retaliation. By definition, that’s literally all it is. But if there’s no grievance to begin with, there’s no need for revenge."
Which is better:  Doing the wrong thing for the right reason?  ...or...  Doing the right thing for the wrong reason?
“All emotion is involuntary when genuine.” - Mark Twain  How can any of us actually control what we FEEL?
#Damaged = #Dangerous
Confidence can be confused with faith. And vice versa. But should they be? Or are they actually just synonymous?
"I watched a horror movie recently. In it, the hero tried to repel a vampire with a “mighty big cross.” Before grabbing it &amp; tossing it aside, he asked the hero “do you have faith?” That was fiction, but reality’s the same. How do we expect ANYTHING to work without having faith?"
Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness. 🚫 The beast inside me is only sleeping...not dead.
#Expectations #Disappointment #Punishment
"It really pisses me off when self-righteous, condescending pricks jump to conclusions and try to act like any mistakes you make are intentional. In fact, why is it that mistakes are almost always associated with stupidity? Are stupid people the only ones that ever make them?"
Never...under any circumstances...go into business with relatives. A parent/child relationship is the only realistic possible exception to this rule (siblings tend to squabble too much and couples get divorced too frequently).
Proudly displayed battle scars.
Learn from them? Yes. Grateful for them? Not so much.
"I realize I’m just splitting hairs here, but certain things are hard for me to “accept.” So instead, I just try not to think about them anymore, so I can put them behind me (easier) and I can also...continue living."
Failing to plan is like planning to fail.
"If there’s ever any doubt, there should be no doubt at all."

"Comeback stories are always relatable, but in every instance, there has to be a disaster or some sort of calamity must first befall the main character before any comeback can be made. And it’s because of this that misery and mistakes typically tend to precede success."
"You know when people say, “it will get worse before it gets better?” Well...that actually happened to me. About a decade ago!"

Losing is inevitable. There’s always someone better. But that doesn’t mean you’re a “loser.” Especially if you learn something valuable from that experience you can apply to your next opportunity. Never let just one loss defeat you twice.
"Losing makes me mad as hell. So that, in and of itself, is my motivation for whatever comes next. Never give up and never quit. Instead, work twice as hard and make it a point to beat that smug muthafucker next time, strictly out of spite."
"When no one actually knows who said something on the internet, why is the quote almost always attributed to “unknown?” Is it because whoever quoted it doesn’t want to take credit for it? I mean...why else would you even go the extra mile to specify “unknown?”"
#Vonnegut #Everything #Nothing
They say everything happens for a reason...but does it?
"You know that feeling when you first wake up and you’re just lounging and lingering in bed...because at that very moment, nothing’s bothering you? You’re genuinely happy. You’re content, just because life is actually good.  Fuck, I wish I could remember what that feels like. 😩"
"Failure’s not fatal, and neither is making mistakes. But both of them feel like it sometimes...and that’s the whole point. Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain.  ⚠️ Never forget anything you learn the hard way ⚠️"
"Sorry, but I’m calling bullshit on this one."
"Does anybody else sit around, typing up one tweet after another, deleting each one before actually posting it, just because you wanna get some shit off your chest, but also because it makes you feel some kinda way? 😜"
"Failure (noun): invaluable, firsthand experience on how NOT to do something."
"If you fucked up, just admit it. You may catch hell for it, but that’s even more reason not to make the same mistake again. Take your medicine, learn your lesson and leave that all behind you...in the past. Only a fool trips over what’s behind them."
"Sometimes, drinking is just a diversion.  But sometimes, drunk is a destination."
Don’t try to coddle or console me by saying that “everything’s gonna be OK.” Because it’s not. It may improve (to varying degrees) or even get a little better over time...but it will never be the same again.

"Don’t blame yourself for disappointment. Only blame yourself for setting your expectations too high or expecting too much. Ultimately, disappointment doesn’t last. But the memory still lingers..."
Accidents happen. Mistakes are made. It’s usually painful. But nobody’s perfect. Just make damn sure you pay attention to the lessons you learned as a result of the accidents. And avoid future pain by not making the same mistakes twice.
"Regrets are just retroactive warnings. “Wait! You already tried that. Unless you want the exact same results, you need to do something different this time.”"
No good deed goes unpunished.
"People tend to say things like “think positive” or try to keep a positive mental attitude, but that philosophy’s difficult to embrace when all you’re ever met with is an abundance of negative results."
Dark thoughts don’t always equal evil intentions.
Logic dictates that we should learn from our mistakes and forgive ourselves for bad things that happened to us in the past. But it’s not myself that I can’t forgive. It’s this other muthafucker that somehow still seems magically unaffected by it all.
Totally relatable 😩
"People are always trying to make each other feel better by saying stuff like “the best is yet to come.” But is it? Or is that just another bullshit way of saying, “well...it can’t possibly get any worse.”"
"If you’re gonna pray for rain, you better bring an umbrella."
Be careful who you trust. Even Satan was once an angel.

Merely existing is a miserable status quo.
What’s the incentive to keep going?
When you have more hate and desperation in your heart than there is love...how do you fix that?
There is a fine line between losing your mind and acting like everything is fine.
#Nietzsche #Strength #Stronger
"If you’re a hunter on safari &amp; you fall into a tiger trap, you may be stuck there temporarily or even injured. But it was an accident. It wasn’t intentional. You were not stupid or unaware...it was just a mistake. The trick, of course, is just not to make that same mistake twice."
"Nowdays, if somebody wants something, they just #manifest it. If they aspire to something greater, they #claim it. And if they accomplish something extraordinary, they declare that it’s a #superpower But that’s all a crock of shit. There is absolutely no substitute for HARD WORK."
"Sadly, I can totally relate. I feel exactly like that hermit most of the time and every single day is a struggle because of it."

#Frost #Life
"Do not confuse failure with defeat. When you’re a child, trying to force a square peg into a round hole, do you give up when it doesn’t fit? No, you just discard it and keep trying different pegs until you find the right one. So technically, a failure...but not actually a defeat."
"What do these legends have in common? Charles Barkley Patrick Ewing Karl Malone Reggie Miller John Stockton None of them ever won an NBA championship, yet every one is in the #BasketballHallofFame So not winning a championship doesn’t mean you can’t still become a hall-of-famer."
"There’s nothing worse than waking up anxious as fuck. First thing in the morning, right out the chute, you’ve got that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach &amp; your mind is spiraling out of control. And the worst part about it is that you haven’t even made it out of bed yet."
"Regrets and mistakes are not always synonymous. Sometimes, you do everything exactly like you should (no mistakes are made) and things still just don’t go your way. In cases like that, regrets are actually positive...in that they can serve as powerful motivation to try yet again."
"So essentially...what you’re saying is that we should not only acknowledge the rampant, widespread cheating, but ultimately embrace it...and immediately begin devising strategic tactics to become the most effective opportunistic cheater we can be...right?"
Failing to plan is like planning to fail.
Depression and complaints  ...are like...  Oppression and restraints
"When we act on emotion (rather than listening to reason), we often find ourselves standing in deep shit."
Why does everyone always just assume that life is meant to be pleasant? Or easy. Or enjoyable.
#CalvinandHobbes #Caring #Disappointment
"Well, depravity it is then! Because that’s all It feels like I’m doing right now. Just merely existing, drifting aimlessly, without any sense of purpose or direction...or for that matter...any real proof that I’m actually even still alive. Depravity knows no bounds."

"Late at night is when the demons come calling. Instead of trusting what we know and believing established fact, we listen intently to the haunting blasphemy they whisper in our ears, and struggle greatly with imaginary monsters until the morning sun rises."
“Things are so hard to figure out when you live from day to day in this feverish and silly world. ” - Jack Kerouac
"I don’t understand the cause for excitement or alarm anytime a sports team or a certain politician “makes history.” Hell, I make history every day! And so do you. Because once you do something, it’s in the past. And a series of past events or occurrences is all history really is."
#Huxley Demented Sinners / Sinking Boat
"Hope is just an illusion. A mirage in the desert. A carrot that the devil dangles in front of you, just to see how long you’ll keep frantically dancing with no sign of relief in sight."
Does that stop you from worrying?
"You stated earlier that “regret is a waste of time and energy.” Technically, I accept that and agree with you...but regret is also inevitable. And anybody that says they don’t have any regrets —or that they regret nothing— is either delusional or in denial."
"This is arguably true, but without first knowing the reason for someone’s anger, how can you make this argument at all?"
"Some offenses are so heinous —so egregious— that, by their very definition, they are...unforgivable. How can one possibly be expected to forgive something they perceive as unforgivable? Especially when the person to be forgiven is not even remotely penitent."
"This is a clever, commendable statement, but to a certain extent, it’s also generic, in that...we all have our own (usually very specific) reasons for hating someone. And without knowing exactly what those reasons are, then how can one simply dismiss or excuse them?"
#Peanuts #Depression #Happiness
depression + anxiety = a living hell
"Sometimes, I get tired of being here. Sometimes, I get tired of just being."
"I’ve obsessed over this since it was posted. I understand it, but I do not agree with it. Time may not completely desensitize pain, but at least it takes the edge off &amp; lets you not remember as vividly. Some offenses are just SO unforgivable that it’s impossible to ever “let go.”"
When life gives you lemons 🍋  #Deadwood #IanMcShane @HBO
"If it’s that insignificant, then how can it possibly be “very important?”   Advice like this is hella motivational. 😜"
"I’m an optimist by nature. At least I used to be. But honestly...what’s the point? People always say “stay positive” or keep a positive mental attitude, but where are the results? Seriously. I’m starting to think it’s all just a bunch of bullshit / propaganda."
Faith in humanity? Or a lack thereof?  #Faith #Humanity 😩 nothing left 🚫
Believe whatever you want. But there’s no tangible proof of anything Iike that in the real world.
"""There is always a heavy demand for fresh mediocrity."" - Paul Gauguin"
"Dwelling on the past is completely pointless. There’s no benefit to it, and nothing positive can be accomplished by obsessing over it. But moving on from it is a MASSIVE, constant challenge and just outright ignoring it is virtually impossible. Even if you try."
#Kerouac #Confused #Confusion

"Sorry...but I’m calling bullshit on this. If it was true, my ears would stay clogged up all the time. Hell, I’d damn near be completely deaf!"
"We’ve all made mistakes and have regrets. And I understand the logic that it’s not smart from a mental health perspective to obsess over issues like that. But if something is that serious, that substantial in your life, then how can you possibly be expected to just “let it go?”"
"I love the long shots...and the left-out lost causes... Hanging out at the back of the pack, with all the dark horses 🐎  I ride the wrong road, just as fast as I can... God knows there’s no on else to blame... Sometimes, I think I “Get Off On The Pain.” - Gary Allan"

"I’m not dumb. But late at night, when I’m lying in bed, obsessing over my mistakes and re-examining my regrets (so that I remember them more vividly), how the hell am I supposed to reassure myself that... I’m not dumb."
"If you’re looking for the silver lining on something, just remember this: Coors Light has their own Frost Brewed Liner, too. If your beer’s cold, the little mountains turn blue...but so what? It’s just a gimmick. It’s completely superficial and only temporary."
#Stress #Drugs #Intoxicating
Failure is not fatal. But it’s also frustrating as fuck...and often makes you wonder “why should I even bother trying to do this shit again?”
"If you’re convinced that bad things don’t happen to good people, then how do you explain what happened to Jesus? He was completely innocent, yet still suffered and faced persecution that was unimaginable. But then rose from the grave and returned UNSTOPPABLE!"
