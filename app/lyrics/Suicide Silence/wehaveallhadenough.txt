Let it go
You act like you know
You act like progression is lost
Motivation is your tool to distort
Let me move forward with you
The truth is in your desires
We have all had enough
You unrest the balance
There’s no darkness in a day
The change is within your means

We have all had enough
We have all had enough
Don’t act like you never gave a fuck
There is no speaking with you
(No)
Don’t act like you never gave a fuck
There’s no speaking to you

You’ve dug your own grave
I see the dirt beneath your nails
You’ve always worn your filth real well

We have all had enough
We have all had enough
(No)
And now you’ve crossed the line
(No)
We have all had enough

We have all had enough
Don’t act like you never gave a fuck
There is no speaking with you
(No)
Don’t act like you never gave a fuck
There’s no speaking, speaking to you
We have all had enough
