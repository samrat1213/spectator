Fetus removed and slaughtered as she sleeps replaced by embryonic 
anomaly bred to kill when time comes 
disguised life among the civilization, isolation spawns hate, 
lashing out to begin widespread slaughter, planted alien now executes, 
unstoppable force 
helpless humans cannot defeat it, the leader of it's dominant anti 
empyrean race claiming lives with devastating vigor, putrid stench of 
death rises through the air, havoc, a massacre, 
extermination in it's purest form, 
genocide of the soon to be forgotten swine of earth, 
feeding on their carcasses to fuel our killing rampage 
fetus removed and slaughtered as she sleeps replaced by embryonic 
anomaly bred to kill when time comes
