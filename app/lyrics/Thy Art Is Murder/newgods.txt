New Gods arise
Your future is genocide

New Gods arise
Your followers are weaponized
New Gods arise
Your future is genocide

A lust for artificial heroes
Validating our vice
For moral sacrifice
This isn't culture, this is mind control
The network feeds us a life
Void of all social device

Can't look me in the eyes
When you only see
Optical illusions algorithms provide
Intentional suicide
Calculated collateral
Man is expendable

New Gods arise
Your followers are weaponized
New Gods arise
Your future is genocide

This isn't culture, this is mind control
This isn't culture, this is mind control

Cult leader, show us the light
The blind will follow the blind
Cult leader, show us the light
The blind will follow the blind

New Gods arise
Your followers are weaponized
New Gods arise
Your future is genocide

A lust for artificial heroes
Validating our vice
For moral sacrifice
Dehumanized as ones and zeroes
Cult leader, show us the light
The blind will follow the blind

This isn't culture, this is mind control
This isn't culture, this is mind control
This isn't culture, this is mind control
This isn't culture, this is mind control
