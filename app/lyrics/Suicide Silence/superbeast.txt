Shriek the lips
Across ragged tongue,
Convulsing together.
Sing violently,
Move the jaw, cry aloud.
Bound up the dead triumphantly.

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see.

Hey, yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - I'm your Superbeast
Hey, yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - I'm your Superbeast

Stir the limbs across the wrist,
Full possession of a memory.
Bury me as a ragged dog,
Icy hands surrounding me.

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see.

Hey, yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - I'm your Superbeast
Hey, yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - I'm your Superbeast

Shriek the lips
Across ragged tongue,
Convulsing together.
Sing violently,
Move the jaw, cry aloud.
Bound up the dead triumphantly.

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see.

Hey, yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - I'm your Superbeast
Hey, yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - I'm your Superbeast
