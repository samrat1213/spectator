The glorious frailty of the human mind
Leads us to deceive the mother of mankind
Nature is our master, we serve her through our deeds
She teaches us that only death is guaranteed
If there was a hell, there must I ever be
Eternal life in heaven is but a fallacy
So if death is nothing, but a path to be trod
Walk with me and let me introduce you to your God

Come see an exhibition of atrocity
An ocean of eternity
One in which the shore you'll never see
Or your God of make believe

You speak to the sky and no one answers back
And yet you wager the word of God is fact
The horrors we imagine in vivid clarity
Become a spectacle, your God's atrocities
A mirror image, reflection of your soul
Just nature's play, all her children have a role
God's an actor, the world nature's stage
Our fates are scripted like so many
Letters on a page

A composition of atrocity
The Story of Christianity
A fairy tale of tyranny
Recipe for catastrophe
[Instrumental Break]

Man's inclination
Is to bend those who oppose to our will
Does your great creator think
The good are better made by ills?
Dream after dream, time after time
He who conquers endures
The grand design of the mother
We the disease, and her the cure

[Instrumental Break]

Unsatisfied longing for the slaughter
The master often slays her sons and her daughters
Death is but and undress of skin and of bone
When you return to her, no sins to atone
The ending is the same for the vile and devout
Let all the poisons that lurk in the mind
Hatch out
She has predetermined our end
Nothing more she will portendEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
