It’s controlling you
Shut it out
Shut it out
Shut it out before it owns you

The pressure has you man
You’re lost disfigured in yourself
The voices haunt and make your thoughts into your own hell

Shut it out
Shut it out
Shut it out before it owns you
Shut it out
Shut it out
Shut it out before it owns you

So get your shit together
You’re fucked up beyond repair
It’s just a voice inside your brain

(I’m everything)
I’m everything you want to hide
I thrive off self-defeat
I need it please
I’ll give you a thousand reasons

Kneel down
Stay down
Stay down because I own you
Kneel down
Stay down
Don’t shut me out because I own you

There’s something wrong
There’s something wrong here
Something needs to be done
There’s something wrong
There’s something wrong here
So take control and send those thoughts
Into your own hell
So take those thoughts into your own hell
Take those thoughts into your own hell
(Hell)

It’s controlling you
You
It’s controlling you
You
You’re controlling you
You
You’re controlling
It’s controlling you
