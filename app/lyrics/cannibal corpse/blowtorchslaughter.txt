Scourged through searing
Incandescence
Melt together
Fire torture brings me intense pain
Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling

Blowtorch slaughter
Bodily capitulation
Blowtorch slaughter
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Conflagration through my veins
Desensitized, charring skin, burnt within,
branded soul, torrid cruelity
Dwidle away, glowing heat to mutilate
Head set ablaze, consumed in flames
I burn to the ground
Blowtorch slaughter

<i>[Solo - Owen, O'Brien]</i>

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Fire torture takes me to my end
