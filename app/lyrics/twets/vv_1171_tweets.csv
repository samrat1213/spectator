I know that this isn’t a dream but why do i keep on pleading to wake up
When heavy words settle beneath your skin
Filled with hate but only towards myself
The night tries to take all of me
Burn your most painful trace
Take me where I belong
Suddenly it’s the loudest voice in my head
We’re just a couple of lost stars
Hurting and healing in silence
And when dreams die what’s left
It’s hard to forget words that was pierced into my soul
An anxious soul that doesn’t know how to rest
Mentally somewhere else
Like a dead star wandering through the empty night sky
doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will
Time goes by But heavy memories stay
the silence of a weighted soul
Take me to the calmest place
Sometimes an understanding silence was better than a bunch of meaningless words
A constant rain of pain
A battle within yourself
The moon reflects hope
Don’t get too close  It’s dark inside
I just want to be found
It doesn’t matter anymore but still hurts
Haunted by everything I refuse to accept
This darkness that I couldn’t escape already became a part of me
a thousand voices howling in my head
Feeling nothing but everything at the same time
As if they were all just blurry dreams
I wanted nothing more than to be held one last time
Wishing these memories would fade away
Left me behind to dance with my shadows
Wondering when will it start to fade away with time
No one is what they were before
Thought too much but said too little
Places where the darkness won’t reach
In the end of it all I realized I wasnt putting myself first either
I refuse to say that name You do not deserve it
The waves are getting stronger
Can’t bear the weight of it all
Silence ringing in my head
The home i built in your arms  Now belong to someone else
All you need is an empty mind
We both drowned in a sea full of unspoken words
Colder than the darkest sea
What should i do with all these words that are suffocating me
But I just can’t make a sound
There’s a voice that’s always there
Take me to the sea and let the waves fill my head
When do we stop running away
Living with these painful memories
But if only for this night I could choose
still so cold inside
When there’s nowhere we can hide
Everything’s so loud
Would this ice melt someday
As if I’m standing on the edge
I’m here but also not here
Can’t hold on can’t let go
We’ve been waiting for that storm
Full of unspoken words
Kept looking for answers I didn’t even want to hear
Let this silence speak
Enjoy it before it becomes a memory
Eyes reveal all the hidden stories
My pieces are too heavy
An ocean of emotions
Scared of losing myself again
Let the past Just disappear
When the rain won’t stop falling
Giving up everything we built
Sometimes i wonder If I’m asking for too much
Breathing in a silent cry
I can never be that me again
Can’t help but forget  And fade over time
Glimpses of the truth
I want to be okay with remembering  I want this agony to end
Because I’ve seen enough
Filled with empty promises
No more words coming out
My faith in you was fading
the closer i got the more I lost myself
It’s just my restless mind
Only the emptiness remains now
Can see through all of your lies
Left everything broken and never came back
When i close my eyes  There’s no escape
You think you know me
The only person I wanted back was myself
There’s nothing louder than this silence
That was then and this is now
feel the ocean as it breathes
Some moments are filled with emptiness
I’m not here My heart is not here
Where nothing hurts  Where nothing breaks
I stopped looking for answers and maybe that’s what i needed
All or nothing
We do hurt ourselves  But we aren’t the only ones to be blamed
If you don’t mean it don’t fucking say it
I need to heal I need to feel
All is said in silence
Words perhaps i can never trust again
I’m Just everything everyone wants to run away from
grow at your own pace
Sometimes it isn’t easy to bear the heavy noise of silence
No answers but so many questions
Some nights nothing makes sense
holding this pain
The end of these silent battles
That voice gets clearer and clearer
Maybe time would tell  The answers you seek
I just want to leave this fear behind
From everything to nothing
It’s about who stays  Not who promised
My soul is numb
It’s exhausting to be locked in your head with all these dark thoughts
When you get to The edge of the night
I hoped it was just a painful dream
My mind is always crowded
“The darker the night  The brighter the stars”
I know I’m nothing
Somethings are better left unsaid
Silent voices
Frozen in my head
Don’t make me hate myself more than i already do
my heart has been screaming                  While my lips are shut in silence
And here i am  Nothing
Laying alone with a heart full of questions
Shadows of my past
"Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing.                                                -sylvia plath"
The sound of silence
It will be okay
The loneliness is killing me
Words can destroy so many things
Will it ever stop hurting one day
"I want to be where no possessions remind me of the past and by the sea, which is for me the great healer — Sylvia Plath"
Words in my head  Knives in my heart
When the rain falls again
Lost in an ocean of thoughts
Dreaming with empty eyes
We look at the same moon and say different things
Save me from myself
It’s hard to breathe
Completely forgotten
I breath in a silent cry
Memories make me numb sometimes
The voices around me were so loud that my silence got lost in them
Always falling into the deep unknown
My eyes are drowning once again
A road filled with thorns
Maybe it’s better to keep it all inside
Invisible
Now only traces remain
My heart feels like an hallow empty street
Drowning in this silence
Why would anyone choose me anyways
I don’t want to dim your light
Is it too late
It’s tearing me apart
One day I’ll survive
Had to lose it all to win
Silence strikes like a hurricane
Spread your wings where they will be healed
I don’t know what’s destroying me
Words are weapons
Everytime these words float in my head i feel suffocated no matter how much time passed
Feels like I’ve lost a piece of myself
Sometimes a listener needs a listener too
Laying in the silence
It’s terrifying to open my eyes
So scared of everything
I’m a stranger to my own self
Keep the one who understands your silence
I always wished you happiness                 Even if it didn’t involve me in it
Seems like I don’t belong anywhere
Drowning in my own thoughts
That heavy silence when words run out
There’s freedom in leaving the people who don’t value you
Empty promises will slowly disappear
You are your own healer
No you won’t see me fall apart
While we’re dying inside
you are your own chaos
Nothing changes if you don’t change
Not all storms come to disrupt your life some come to clear your path
The small things
Don’t start a flame if you can’t handle the fire
Slowly becoming emptier and emptier
I struggle to fly now
Sometimes thorns are softer than petals
Losing yourself is the biggest loss
Chase anything that lights a fire within you
Don’t let someone’s opinion kill your peace
Holding a storm
Acceptance will calm your soul
If you fear losing them all the time they probably already left
The clouds promise rain
Choosing to stay silent
But your everything I’ve got
Trying to find peace and silence in the middle of chaos
Break in silence  Bloom in elegance
Messy emotions are still valid
Sometimes in the wave of change we find our true path
Hide your shadow
Accepting the truth hurts but it will set you free
The words keeps on fading
Stop searching for peace in the wrong places
You’re opinion is not my reality
Another night slips away
I’m just holding on for tonight
I don’t know what’s wrong with me too
One bad choice does not define you
So many hidden words
Something I can’t describe in words
The truth disappears and gets trapped in darkness
We all have forests in our mind
Everything’s blurry and I just can’t find myself
Somewhere far away
When you feel too much yet speak so less
We look at the same moon and say different things
I need a break from my own thoughts
All i see is wild stars
They don’t know your pain
Have faith in your wings  Sky is always far
Let me fall apart
Silence ringing inside my head
I want to stop blaming myself for everything I really do
It’s okay some stories don’t have a perfect ending
Emptiness fills my chest
Still fighting for peace
"“And she gracefully danced on the fine line between a hard mind and a soft heart"""
When you just want to let the words fall out
Drowning in my own thoughts
Why is it so hard to understand myself
The calm after the chaos
Even if it doesn’t shine enough               I’ll cheer for my own dream
Sometimes it’s better to say nothing at all
Tired of being lost
She hid the storm  Behind those calm eyes
Let my mind rest
When everything inside you is lost
The moon and the moon lovers shine with scars
I prefer silence  Over the loneliness in chaos
all the feelings we kill eventually comes back to haunt us
Mind full of unsaid things
What will it take for this fear inside me to shatter
Lost in an ocean of thoughts
I regret everytime i let someone know too much
We all have forests in our mind unexplored unending
I’ve got voices in my head
Now let’s forgive ourselves
And i was only your silence
Time knows all the answers
"All i want is peace within me, a quiet place where i can gather all of my broken pieces"
Broken souls change the world
My mind is never quiet
I’m trapped inside of myself
Eyes tell what words can’t
There is no place for me
Heart made of glass Mind of stone
Silence is loud  If you’re a listener
"""Hidden wings are heavy"""
Disappearing a little every day
I want to have my own voice
Give me my mind back
It’s time to pluck flowers for yourself
Everybody gets a little bit lost inside
It’s a long road and you’re on your own
Everything fell apart and there’s nothing to do except dying silently
I don’t know if I’m strong enough to handle it
They will never understand
Fight your storms
Every silence hides a story
Winter arrives with your blur memories
Don’t you forget who you truly are
Break the silence
I never feel invisible when you’re around
This heavy emptiness
The language of silence
Even in silence my mind is the loudest place I’m living in
How the things you love don’t last
Help me find what I’m missing
Don’t want to be here but there’s no  escape
This time i just want peace
your true soul is not for everyone
Silence in my eyes  Rage in my heart
There’s nothing that I want anymore
And when dreams die Life becomes merely a bird without wings
To the darkest corners of my mind
Find someone who listens to you even in your silence
You can begin again
Free your mind
Somewhere far away
You lost yourself on empty promises
“Be the full moon in my darkest nights”
I walked away to save myself
Peace is the priority
Mind as deep as the ocean
Light never leaves
Silence says a lot more than anyone thinks
your path will be admired only by the ones who believe in you
I will be strong
Feeling helpless
I learned to live half alive
Search for soul in everything
Finding your own voice
A storm inside my head
Some souls heal you just by existing
Terrified of losing myself again
The silent ones are drowning in an endless chaos
I need to stop holding on to something that is already gone
Waiting for that day to come To finally find my peace
There are always two sides to every story
To make it back before the dark
We forgot how to give ourselves forgiveness
There is always a reason
Nothing kills you like your mind
Tired of feeling lost
You deserve someone who brings peace to your chaos
Twist my words and set them to flame
"“She craved solitude but she hated loneliness, a conundrum that she couldn’t even begin to solve"""
Inner peace will calm any storm
Take me to the sky
I want all my dreams back
We all are the sufferers of our own expectations
Listen to every silence
Some moments don’t come back so we need to enjoy them to the fullest
“A thousand dreams within me softly burn”
We’ve fallen underground
Promises of honesty  will never last
A mess of thoughts
I don’t know what i lost
Every single day it breaks me to pieces
Still wondering where I should go
Don’t get too close  It’s dark inside
She belongs to the night
Words are never enough
you need dreams  If you want to touch the sky
Can’t swallow this sorrow
I know that in darkness   I have found my light
Find peace in your battles
I keep fighting but I don’t know what I’m fighting for
There’s nothing that I want anymore and it’s terrifying
Real chaos makes no noise
A steady place to let down my defenses
I find my peace in you
Tired of pretending
Those dark clouds cannot hide the sun forever
Silence only tells the truth
Time will heal your wounds but you need to love those scars
Just like the dark tunnel we hope to find a glimpse of light in it
In my head                                                  We’re still chasing the sunset
Longing to belong
Right eyes will see your worth
A hint of chaos mixed with a heart of gold
In the early hours  dancing with my doubts
The moon listens
I know my heart is beating but my head’s in the sky
Give yourself time to bloom
When they offered empty promises while you offered your bare soul
Choose people who choose you
Waiting for these stars to guide me home
Fighting my own darkness
Alone with the stars in the sky
When you’re surrounded by nothing but shadows
Be my moon in my lost nights
Everything i hold on to starts to slowly fade away
The sky listens
The stars are fading once again and my heart goes away with them
Stop searching for light in the wrong places
Some nights I wish I could go back
Sometimes the pain that you carry becomes your strength
In the end we’re only saving ourselves from our own self
I forgive the person i used to be
an aching soul always loves more than it should
Words in my head  Knives in my heart
Seek for yourself and become the real you
I followed my heart and it lead me to the moon
So many heavy untold thoughts
Watching waves at night i fell into the blue
The only person I wanted back was myself
Listen to every silence
People don’t change  They just reveal who the fuck they are
Don’t pretend that you understand my silence
you deserve to be loved deeply even In your darkest days
May the cracks in your heart be the place of blossom
Dreaming with a damaged mind and loving with a shattered heart
There was chaos in her silence  and peace in her wild
Embrace the unknowns  Rather than fear
Mind full of unsaid things
"In the silent heart which has lost all words, the voice is heard like a memory"
We are all hurting and healing in silence
I’m clinging onto the last of my sanity that I have left within
Even the coldest nights warm me up in your presence
Right one stays  Even in your chaos
The night tries to take all of me
Maybe it’s myself that i miss
Float away like a drifting ocean
Sometimes all you need is someone to hear you’re silence in this chaotic world
Let the shadows  Fall behind you
Time only heals if you decide to heal
love your shadow as much as you love your light
The tragedy isn’t my silent lips                It’s my blank eyes and heavy heart
Wandered everywhere for you but you were only found in my memories
I just want to be found
Silence is the best answer for someone who doesn’t value your words
The sun shines brighter after the storm passes
Somedays i feel nothing  Those are the days when my heart feels the heaviest
I’m still standing here with my eyes closed lost between deserts and oceans
"still there is an ache in you, and the more you don’t know, the worse the ache -Dostoevsky"
"Everything i was afraid of happening, happened"
Let the night take me away
My mind is not a safe place to be in anymore
and some people are nightmares dressed like a daydream
This heavy soul of mine                           Takes in everything and it’s weighing me down
your midnights should be saved for someone who deserves it
We say so much more in our silence
Up all night in silence.                              With loud voices haunting my head
There is beauty in simplicity and power in consistency
Tired of being understanding but never being understood
The silent ones are the most in chaos
and sometimes i feel I’m too flawed to be loved
Flowers lose their petals but they bloom again
My soul needs an escape
Let the silence speak for you
I see nothing but an empty soul
"The moment she choses to be herself, all the stars will dance at her feet"
Swallow my words down to the bone
"“Inhale sky, exhale stars”"
We’re only haunted by the things we refuse to accept
It takes grace to remain calm in cruel situations
hold me like the night sky holds the moon
Let silence rule your anger
Between the sea and the sky you find me in depth
Silent like deep water
Thoughts are slowly destroying me
"We’ve become echoes, but echoes they fade Away"
Wild hearts get drunk on memories in moonlight
Lost in the midst of chaos
"At times i ask myself, what was I trying to gain so badly that I lost myself in the process"
A thousand silhouettes                               dancing on my chest
The worst way you can leave someone is in silence
I see the pain hidden in your pride
“It is awful to want to go away and to want to go nowhere”
Empty promises will wear
Everything feels too heavy
How many more nights can I survive myself
"Most nights, I don’t know anymore"
Show me a garden that’s bursting into life
You will find yourself                                 in all the places you’re afraid to look
I don’t want to lose myself again
realized I’ll never love everything the right way cause I don’t even love myself
How longer will it take until it consumes me entirely
"Silence. You must learn that art, it is the only way to survive – Dostoevsky"
We are the ones for now
Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head
It’s difficult for me to bear
Silence. Motionless existence
Heart made of glass                                 Mind of stone
Drifting away once again
When all of those midnight skies            Swallowed up our                                      Childish eyes
I just want to see the stars with you
It’s so dark tonight but you’ll survive certainly
Everything is too much and I don’t know where to runaway anymore
Nothing lasts forever
This is killing me silently
