Nude and violated I raped the life from her body
Lying dead the insects bite her pale skin
My marks of torture
Left on my daughter
Body badly beaten
I remember
My ropes and chains
Bruised her arms and legs
I wiped her blood on my face
Her tender body I disgraced
Slow strangulation

Her neck twisted and broken
Abdominal lacerations
Blood pouring from
Abrasions

Control of the mind
Feelings left behind
Dreaming inner hate
I create an alternate state of the grave
Scared to death
Homicidal premonitions
Horror fills you
As your soul is ripped from you
Dreaming my dream of death
I cast the spell
Intertwine your mind with mine
Dreams become reality
Enhancing the imagination
Murder is my infatuation
Killing off generations

Families torn to pieces
But the one they love
Possessed by another
My pleasure is to murder

Entering your dreams
Through my spell they will bleed
Night after night
Reoccuring killings

Sleep

Someone wake me
From this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear

Awaken to the sight
Of your hacked up family
Their spirits are trapped
Beyond the cemetary

Bodies rotting, but I'm not sleeping
Scream you're not dreaming
Someone wake me
Form this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear
Came to life
In my mind
A world of darkness
Forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming...

Forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming...

Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Eternally...

Dreaming...
