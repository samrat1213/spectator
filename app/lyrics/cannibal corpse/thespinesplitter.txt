Fragmentizing, disunite the backbone from the skeleton
Chop the bodies, specialized in customized
Dismemberment
Hatchet wielding, never ending thought of splitered vertebrae
Violent insurgency
Squalid dependancy, ivory interspersion, solace
Riving the arteries, splenetic complacency, somber
Irascible, aggressive ripping head to crotch, life relieving
Propensity, consuming of the spinal cord, dead not living
Animus from perpetual authority, contumacious
Bone displacement surgery
Stagnant, pools of entrails, permeates wretched odors, depraved
Corpses cloven spineless, ultimate pancrea ablate
Violent insurgency, pernicious way of life
Bone displacement surgery, division with an axe

<i>[solo - Owen, O'Brien, Owen, O'Brien]</i>

Fragmentizing
Chop the bodies
Hatchet wielding
The spine splitter

Stagnant, pools of entrails, permeates wretched odors, depraved
Corpses cloven spineless, ultimate pancrea ablate

Fragmentizing
Chop the bodies
Hatchet wielding
The spine splitting will never end
