The dawning of a new day
For the hundredth convulsion, so, here I'm coming
Gashes in my legs showing steel rod
Into the wound, is my solution lust
Pain and blood, the worms are feasting run
Paranoia involves me, spasmodic and scared
I drag myself in a mad rush before the lights
Scavenger away my eyes
The darker view, the sense of nothing
I exhale last breath, into the fall of death
I declare my curse
Mechanical parts, electronic components and wires
I fеll possessed, something changеs my body
What's goin'on, the mutation is taking over me
The only affection
Is the organic lust and the sense of real steel
The metal beast has come to light
With his gargantuan power drill
Bringing to himself the power of
Death and the disease
The time has come the maker appears to me
IN flash. With the evil intent to destroy
My cells brain connection
"Soon even your brain will turn to metal
Let me show something really swift"
A new is coming. Rust! Pain! Fear!
Metal creatures standing around us
The final battle for victory or certain death
In the lost building, the future is taking place
WE are now sharing the same destiny
Combining our soul. Bodies of metal in an only one
A new found power! The prophecy is done
We connect the P.U.M.A. code
A new level, biomechanic!
Thunder, brain, pain, soul and steel
The final beast is here, with the rage of hate
The world will fall at our command!
Rise! The world will fall at our commandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
