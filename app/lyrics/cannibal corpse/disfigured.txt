Repulsion of beauty drove me to hunt
A frenzy of self hate possessing me
Violated their bodies, stripped of their pride
Tortured and twisted until they have died
Hatred inside is all I would find

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
I kill them but it's myself I hate
Now I'll do myself too
A straight razor will reshape my face
First my ears then my nose
Blood is gushing continue to carve
Erase the face I hate
Now I'm hacking at my chest
A frenzy of self hate possessed me
Controls my actions, controls my thoughts
As I scrape away at my skin

I fill my tub, with alcohol
I plunge into the burning pool
The pain intense, my whole body
Is drenched in scalding liquid
Despite my pain I am able
To grab a lighter on the counter
The flint ignites, the flames erupt
I'm consumed in the inferno
Cauterize, my skin is charred
Regenerate, more loathsome than before

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
The abomination before my eyes
A reflection of me
I see an image of disfigured evil
I've skinned myself alive
Dripping with blood and blistered by fire
The face I hate erased
