I never smoked with no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me something I never had
Pulled me down with you
Pulled me up, think I'm in love
Hope you can pull me through

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Oh woman you give to me
More than I can take
But listen honey, I don't mind
You're a habit I don't want to break
Don't want none of that hard stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in love, and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you
Gee I was happy as a man could be
To far gone to escape
Power of love, don't pull me off
Just write on my grave:

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
