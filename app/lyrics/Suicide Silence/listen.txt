I will break you before I break myself
Such a waste of time, of space, of life
And I will destroy you before I destroy myself
Instinctively you'll learn to love yourself

So take me along through the torrential clouds
It's all constructed inside

So what is there to be afraid of
This place is tongue and cheek
Its all constructed inside
So learn to love me

Take me its all constructed inside

So take me along through the torrential clouds
The perfect storm will never be good enough
Show me the torment
Constructed inside

I will break you before I break myself
Such a waste of time, of space, of life
And I will destroy you before I destroy myself
Instinctively you'll learn to love yourself

So take me along
Its all constructed inside
Constructed inside

So take me along through the torrential clouds
The perfect storm will never be good enough
Show me the torment
Constructed inside
Constructed inside

I'll listen

I'll listen

I'll listen...
