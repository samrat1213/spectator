Born again harder
Than I was before
Bringing the hammer down
Is more than metaphor
I live by the steel
Die by the blade
What reason is there to be
If you're living life afraid

The hammer is my symbol
The banner that I wave
The motto of my creed
Carved upon my grave
I live for the here and now
I live for the knife
My coat of arms is the hammer and life

Fear and cowardice
Harbingers of demise
Strength and the will to fight
Will lead you to the prize
Glory to all of those
Who conquer to the end
Honor the hammer
On it you can depend
The hammer is my symbol
The banner that I wave
The motto of my creed
Carved upon my grave
I live for the here and now
I live for the knife
My coat of arms is the hammer and lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
