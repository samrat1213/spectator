You're a slave!
Gaze in the mirror, take a look at yourself.
Eyes glazed over, a lesser man.
More like a walking corpse.
Mindless and dilapidated,
Executing a mentally embedded repetition of motions.
Every waking day another moment enslaved.
Conditioned to be numb and complacent.
Vital signs are deceiving,
Every breath you take
Is not yours to keep.
The light shining at the end of the tunnel,
Advertently deceiving.
Since birth we were cursed
With the mark of the beast,
A symbolic surrender of life
And its meaning.
Since birth we were cursed
With the mark of the beast.
Vital signs are deceiving.
Every breath you take
Is not yours to keep,
The American Dream is a fallacy!
You're already dead
In compliance with normalcy.
Our captors wage war
With worthless paper
To devalue our lives;
Relinquishing mind,
Body and soul.
Servants to the machine!
A slave of corporatocracy!
Once you exit this world,
You won't be remembered,
Unless humanity transcends
This monetary monarchy.
Slave!
Open your eyes,
Get off your knees.
Slave of corporatocracy.
Slave!
Open your eyes,
Get off your knees.
Slave!
