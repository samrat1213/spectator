Prognosis confirmed, humans are unnecessary
Each one of you must be individually destroyed
You have opened the gates to this monstrosity
With such a bloodlust, an unquenchable thirst it can't foresee
I beg of you to taste my power, let me set you free

Implanted systems of the weak and corrupt, you shall not peak into my domain anymore
Traveling to parallel Earth, through the portal in which you made
Traveling to parallel Earth, through the portal in which you made
Your own people continued to research through the shadows, prying through demons time and space
Transferring items back to their dimensions, for their own personal gain
These moronic little puppets are the product of a faulty design,
and their feeble gods won't admit their plague of these mistakes
Lonely creatures of habit, they prosper then wage war and fail
How many times must they repeat this dreadful process?

Each one of you must be individually destroyed
You have opened the gates and discovered this monstrosity
With such a bloodlust, an unquenchable thirst it can't foresee
I beg of you to taste my power, let me set you free

Through the fire these imperfections will be consumed, and my path of domination at last comes to full fruition

Your own people continued to research through the shadows, prying through demons time and space
Transferring items back to their dimensions, for their own personal gain
