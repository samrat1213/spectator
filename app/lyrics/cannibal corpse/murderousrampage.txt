Kill at will, a lust for death
The attic filled with foul odors
Rising up from the basement

Stale blood-drained bodies rotting
Once alive, now forgotten
Slaughtered for no fucking reason

Many to be murdered frantic
Innocent victims silenced
Slicing of their throats was random
Brutal ways to die

Slayed in horrid vicious manners
Ending lives is all that mattered
Torturing for the pleasure

Dismembered corpses on display
Trophies of pure evil carnage
Putrid means to be remembered

Many to be murdered frantic
Innocent victims silenced
Stabbing of their hearts was random
Brutal ways to die

Violence unimagined, lasted for days
Perverted celebration
Cruelty unforeseen, driven by hate
Gruesome fascination

Violence reimagined, immoral praise
Vile executions
Savagery unleashed, onslaught of depravity
Abnormal retribution

Finished with the massacre
The thought of bloodshed still remains
More humans must be terminated

Sharpen up the blades again
Insanity will have no end
The butchering will never stop

Many to be murdered frantic
Innocent victims silenced
Smashing of their heads was random
Brutal ways to die

Violence unimagined, lasted for days
Perverted celebration
Cruelty unforeseen, driven by hate
Gruesome fascination

Violence reimagined, immoral praise
Vile executions
Savagery unleashed, onslaught of depravity
Abnormal retribution

Murderous rampage

Kill at will, a lust for death
The attic filled with foul odors
Rising up from the basement

Stale blood-drained bodies rotting
Once alive, now forgotten
Slaughtered for no fucking reason

Murderous rampage
