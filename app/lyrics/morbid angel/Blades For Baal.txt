Blades for Baal LyricsOne spills his blood for horror
Choice alone to suffer
Infernal voices calling
Catastrophe no waiting
10 more encircled wailing
It's his existence glowing
Blades for Baal
Demanding sharp and glistering slice
He can't fail
Join them is the one device
We spill and poison ground
Below the father's calling
His light will be unbound
Once fallen angel spreads his wings
Blades for Baal
Blades for Baal
Blades for Baal
Two down on grounds unhallowed
With 9 more soon to follow
With reaches all but shallow
Purest of all intent
Their candles burn both ends
Their juices wind and rain, insane
Blades for Baal
Demanding sharp and glistering slice
I won't fail
Join them is the one device
Blades for Baal
All around me shining bright
Life-trade for this
Death to bring eternal night
Blades for Baal
Blades for Baal
Blades for Baal
In the readings never found
Of ways to keep this Evil down
Time unmasks the deepest seal
For all the cursed who choose to reveal
Darkness takes another chance
Luring to the ritual dance
Collect the fallen necromance
And decidedly gathering all
Give welcome torment
Welcome blessing's fall
No crime just reason
Just an end to all
Mine is the one true Baal
Curse him no avail
He eats and drinks and burns you hail
So be the sacrifice
You really have no choice
Our lives his only vice
Give to him his drink then burn
Blades for Baal
Blades for Baal
