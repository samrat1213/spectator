Endless nights.
A feeling called lap.
I feel sleepy at the wrong times.
I need rain.
Hidden emotions.
A handmade heart.
He made me smile when all i wanted was to cry.
Give me some more of you.
🌙
Moons in my cocoon.
Time does not forgive.
"After an exhausting day, the best thing to do is get rid of everything that weighs me down."
He takes care of you.
I miss all the kisses I didn't give you.
Watching stars.
"A sigh that soothes the soul, that's what I want."
"I know I can't, I shouldn't, I know I'll have to pay a high price for this, but bread with melted cheese is irresistible."
A language that cannot be written.
Wild little thoughts.
Denk' an dich und lass' ihn fliegen🎈
There are things time cannot erase.
Be strong and brave.
A touch of blue.
"Delicate touch, voracious thirst."
"Baby, let me count the waves..."
(Sometimes I wanted to be an ant)
Kiss in the hands like adoration.
I need a double coffee.
The fine line between ember and fire.
After the lull.
Soft...
"Drops of essential oil on the skin, quiet music, hot tea, senses in harmony."
Nothing that happens on the surface of the sea can alter the calm of its depths.   Andrew Harvey
The sun arrived here.
Good morning starts with smiles.
The silence whispers your name.
Cardiac archeology.
A hot playlist for cool nights.
"""Cause I'm feeling so illogical D-d-digital"""
Words at wind...
Just five more minutes.
Mood.
Made to burn.
Bom dia 💋
The stillness I need.
"The sun is setting, the birds are saying their goodbyes."
Butterflies also die.
"Don't get out of my dreams, i like the feeling of having you around."
The ritual.

Traces of a dream.

Don't underestimate gray haired men.
Mood
"Right now a child is being born, a prayer is going to heaven, a first kiss is happening, a seed is sprouting... good things happen all the time and I like to think about it."
"""What doesn't challenge you doesn't make you grow."""
The year is 2021 and i don't know what it is OnlyFans.
"I like stories that start with ""once upon a time..."""
Don't underestimate the power of good pajamas.
I like it when sleep takes me gently by the hands.
"A crooked smile, your crooked smile."
Some songs can take me to an exact moment.
The hugs that I kept for you.
Sunset like magic.
Hold me.
Touch me.
Memories that make the soul sparkle.
Alcohol comes in and the truth comes out.
Thoughts that merge after midnight.
"🎶""Eu canto porque o instante existe E a minha vida está completa Não sou alegre nem sou triste"""
Much more than words.

Why do you have to be so (ambiguously) beautiful?
"Somewhere someone is living the happiest moment of their life, and for the days that we live it is rare.  So if you are that someone, know that I am happy for you."
I have many questions and little courage.
I learned to be alone.
"I sing alone, I dance alone, I talk alone, I watch movies alone ... I'm a good company (for myself). 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"""Sonho meu, sonho meu Vá buscar quem mora longe Sonho meu..."""
Literally a bath of coffee.
Rain tastes like peace.
Small sparkling parts.
Coffee please.
Fluency in voids.
Pants with lots of pockets.
And that sometimes I get tired of everything.
Some old songs are my portals to the past.
"""Quero a palavra que sirva na boca dos passarinhos.""  Manoel de Barros"

Hello!  #Friday
The night is a feeling.
Bom dia 🙏
Feeling sleepy is the best feeling.

The gap between your name and my breathing.
Neither happy nor sad.
The poison and the antidote.
Pornography...
"Sweating, but I preferred it another way."
The instant I get lost.
🌙
"Pedaling, getting nowhere."
And there are flexible people.
Bom dia!
I would like a coffee in bed and you.
The premature death of a dream does not prevent me from dreaming again.
I would choose you again.
And if i could just spread my wings and fly.
What if I could just rip my chest and free all the words.
My silence is restless.
I should be quiet.
Count the stars in a winter sky.  #ThrowbackThursday
Me dealing with my problems.
Handle with care.
"Looking for stars in a cloudy sky, I know they are there."
There are people who kiss our souls.
"""I will call upon your name And keep my eyes above the waves My soul will rest in your embrace For I am yours and you are mine"""
In a cotton cocoon ❤

A little rebelliousness in homeopathic doses.
When the blood boils.

Clear as day.
Nonstop.
As deep as it should be.
"""Cada um sabe a dor e a delícia de ser o que é."" Caetano Veloso"

The first hours of the day and the last hours of the night are always the most difficult.
Where do you press to go back ?  #ThrowbackThursday
The kind of sound familiar to me.
All the time.
One day God dreamed of you.
The eternal does not belong to this world.
Coffee is my alibi.
I liked it when I knew the words were for me.
"Memória   Amar o perdido deixa confundido este coração.  Nada pode o olvido contra o sem sentido apelo do Não.  As coisas tangíveis tornam-se insensíveis à palma da mão.  Mas as coisas findas, muito mais que lindas, essas ficarão.  Carlos Drummond de Andrade"
"If you're going to hold someone, do it right."
Accepts that it hurts less.    #metalnote

One day.
Self-sufficiency needs to be questioned more often.
Sunday wishes.
May every day be like this.
"Car windows open, accelerating nowhere."
Tell me now
Digging words to bring joy to my little hidden heart.
"Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely.  Psalm 139:4"
The silence told me about you.
"Carry me in your arms, take me to bed. I want to dream."
The stars know the language of silence.
The darkness and the stars.
Little things almost lifeless.
I deserve it! ❤
"I count the days, hours, minutes, seconds without you."
And speaking of saudade...  #ThrowbackThursday
When I grow up I want to be like you.
"It's not about how you touched me, it's about what you made me feel without touching me."
"I wrote your name several times on small paper, it's in my right pocket."
My pajamas can be my safe place today.   (I understand in pajamas)
I would fit in your hands.
"Looking at the sky, best way to lose myself."
The voice of my restlessness.
Restless heart.
"The sea will always be the same, but I will never see it the same way again."

Possible dreams.

"Let me kiss your hands, feed my life."
Thunder!  (I love it)

A lap made with words.
You're the song i always like to hear.
"I need to sleep, maybe dream."
So close your eyes.
(Goodnight💋)
The feeling between the lines.
(🐺)
(whispered conversations)
I liked it when I saw myself through your eyes.
And still are.
I miss your laugh.
"Poison me, but let me know that only you have the antidote."
"""...Vinda do sal do mar, nua, os braços em cruz. A flor dos lábios entreaberta para o beijo. A pele a fulgurar todo o pólen da luz...""  Soneto Mulher ao Sol Vinicius de Moraes"
Respire.
Rest.
"Silence, coffee and cigarette.    #ritual"
"Sweat and endorphins, hard drugs."
Playful dream
All the ways you still make me laugh.
The cry stuck in my throat. One more day.
"Desert, a lifeless and sometimes unbearable place."
Liquid love.
I smell the rain coming from far away.
"I woke up slowly, hugged the pillow like someone hugging memories."
Mood.
"Against laziness, coffee."
Level of laziness.      Wash my hair for me.
I can't contain my smile when I see you.
( Goodnight )
"Perhaps some questions are just questions, they will never be answered."
I'm going home...  I never come home.
Please and thank you.
"Eyes and hands, ways to touch."
Deep silent heart.
And playing a song that I like 🌜
Good night kiss on the forehead.
I know.
If you knew.
"Even as time passes, pain is inevitable."
Probed heart.
Silent caresses.
The cure for my insomnia.
My best secret is my best truth.

🌊☀️
Love is not a thing to hide.
LoFi.
Life was made to live.
And in the end the night is always empty.
Until the moon hides.
I like the sky and I like to think that it is the place that I will live one day.
Waiting for the first star in the sky.
Existential laziness.
Hi friday!🍸
A Collor.
The conversations I only had with you.
Se eu não te amasse tanto assim Talvez perdesse os sonhos Dentro de mim 🎶
My curiosity has its peculiarities.
"Dramatic rain, I like the rays."
My sin is to love you.
Hostage of translation.
The negation of the senses.
The moon.
Swallowing wishes.
"Sometimes pain is necessary, today's leg training will not let me forget that."
"Every time my heart became restless, every time it seemed to come out of my chest, that my hands were shaking, so I knew he would never go back to what he was."
"I look at the sky, I think of you."
Get all the words out of me.
"Heart tested at different levels, it resists."

And I wanted to go home.
Time to wake up.

I begged.
Find me among the shadows of the garden.
All ways to escape.
If the soul smiles saying Sim it is not a sin.
"If you don't use imaginary drumsticks while driving listening to this song, you're doing it wrong."
Feelings that do not remain silent.
Daydreams and cold coffee.
I love every memory of loving you.

Side symptoms.
Cold hands speak more than words.
Nothing on me will be erased.

I've always missed you.

An imaginary sunset.
I was just going to say that I love you.
Goodnight.
And then everything looks colorless.

I believe in angels...

Words that intoxicate like poisoned arrows.
"The birds talk about trees, I heard."
Coffee as a ritual.
A little more of you.    #whiskey
Dancing at the end of the world.
"Spend your day in pajamas, take off your pajamas, put on another pajama."
Children’s hair smells like happiness.
It slid on a cold surface until it disappeared.  #moon
Who are you in this photo?
Something's gotta change.
It is what it is.
This is my favorite ruin.
All is vanity.
Make a garden.
Recurring problem.
"Sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch, this is how it works.  - mental note."
Just a play of light and shadows
Returning to the margin is no longer an option.
When i close my eyes...
Nothing will be as before.
Deadline.
Love as a connection to the sacred.
"Feeling is my problem, deal with it."
I wait for soft nights.
Being alone is not always loneliness.
Everything passes.
Even the hug I never felt.
Hold me when the end comes.
And some dreams.
Dancing with headphones on.🎧
(thirst)
What do i do with the urge to kiss you?
All the dreams that won't let me sleep are about you.
Nonstop.
Some things are meant to break.
Dreaming.
A little dirt on the feet and the moon over the head.
"All things are poisons, for there is nothing without poisonous qualities. It is only the dose which makes a thing poison.  Paracelsus"
"Go into the forest, prepare the claws."
Very calm at that time.🧘‍♀️  My patience will be tested.🙄
Relax and listen.🐦
My place is not here.  That's what my heart says insistently.
A place for many conversations.
And life happens.
"The beauty of simple things, sincere words, genuine feelings, need not be perfect, just be real."
Always.
#sexwords
🔥
(Now)
My fingers just want you.
Count to three and light up.
I keep flowers inside books.
I returned to captivity.
"I will have to leave the house, wish me luck."
"wear pajamas, or part of it.  #QuarentineLife"
I hope the cure comes soon.
"One day we will tell a story to our grandchildren, The toilet paper war."
I look for you in other eyes
The stillness I want comes from the soul.
Just be light.
"What the eyes do not see, the heart feels, intuition warns, imagination creates."

"Personne ne meurt d'amour, si ce n'est celui qui ne sait pas aimer.  Le bourgeois gentilhomme Molière"
💃
Some things come out of control and for others there is no control.
I think he had no choice 😸
A Saturday night...
😉 I do!
Fennel tea improves immunity.  Smiles too ;)
"Move that body and don't get bored, just for a moment. 💃"
Few months ago a thought about what is happening would have been surreal. It's still surreal.
A playlist in quarantine times.
"I survived malaria falciparum, when covid 19 arrives i will bravely resist."
Thunder and rays playing in the darkness.
#Quarantine
I don't know if I laugh or cry.
"Abandon work clothes, wear pajamas.   #quarantine"
Bom dia.
May our distance be physical but that we can be together in prayers for each other and especially for those most in need.
(I want you.)
Hi friday.  #FridayThe13th
I'll look at Lua and think of your hand in mine.🌗
Dance as foreplay.
❤
"I needed to get rid of a headache, so I felt my old pains.  The head stopped hurting."
Bad and holy.
She dances under the moon listening to the music of the heart.
"I won't let you go, unless you want to."
Me leva amor Por onde for Quero ser seu par.🎶 #samba
Use instinct.  #mentalnote
Loving is caring.
Some memories deserve forgetfulness and attitude so they don't happen again.
Coffee and the distorted images of a dream from last night.
"He is, for sure."
I want to bite you like wolves play.
Best hairstyle.
Let's go for a walk in the forest until the wolf comes.
A poem for a long and dedicated reading.
"""Love love love, i'm a trigger hippie"""
And rest...
The future has arrived.  Where are the teleportation devices?
There are people who are art in human form.
"Get home and take your clothes off like peeling an onion but without tears, better feeling."
I need a coffee.
"""It is a real bitter pill."""
"Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems."
#danging
#befree
See from different angles.
"All wrong, but it can be the right way.   Or not."
"I have the image of a crooked smile in my memory, so I am the one who smiles."
"At some point i may get lost or get tired, but i will still know who walks with me.  #God"
💟
Hot and intense.   #coffee
When I aim at the cat and hit the mouse.
I have the ability to climb trees.    Me flirting.
Scar made by fire.
And the month ends well.
Now! #fridaymood
"When everything shines or when everything falls apart, I just want to be in one place.  #yourlap"
Everything passes.
"For bad days, hugs."
I claim your songs.
Hello #Friday
Olfactory memory.
A forgotten diary.
let's go!
Iloveyou
Naked soul.
❤🐶
Take me to bed.
A love of phases. ❤🌕
Pão de queijo e café. Bom dia!☕
I won't finish anytime soon.
"""If they know you love me then they know I love you."""
Training the mating dance.
"I take time to feel, I take time to stop feeling."
Tell me about love and other pains.
Embrace my fears.
"All ways of saying I love you will be useless if I don’t feel my body tremble, if I don’t feel tenderness and fury at the same time, if I don’t feel my heart clumsy.  If I talk about love, it is because something inside me is not what it was before you arrived."
Fury.
"""All love letters are Ridiculous. They wouldn’t be love letters if they weren’t Ridiculous...""  Fernando Pessoa"
You have me.
Only that.  #HappyValentinesDay
Words spoken in silence.
💤
Keep walking.
Where all armor falls.
Meanwhile in the gym.  #cardio
"Touch you, in the soul."
Sim.
I don't know what to do with me.
Kiss my eyes.
🎧Every second of the night I live another life. 🌕
"Watching the Moon, talking about Him."
The worst thing about distance is that I don't know what to do with my hands.
I see you.
let me be silly with you.
"The maybe, it's not a comfortable place."
Some memories come with a silly smile and a lost look.
And then life happens.☕
Lucille Ball as a compliment ;)
The coffee will not be made alone.
Place your orders and good morning.  #02022020
Nothing is by chance.
I need vacation.
Abstracting and pretending dementia.
""" Take off your earrings before going to sleep. """
I'm tired and want to cry.
"You sleep, and i dream."
"Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. Jesus.  Matthew 11:29"
"Ai, amor Será que tu divide a dor Do teu peito cansado Com alguém que não vai te sarar?"
"If a lick is a kiss, yes, I was kissed."
(I miss your whisper)
Sunday mornings and the smell of coffee.
"""Dreams they're for those who sleep..."""
Tudo vale a pena quando a alma não é pequena.  Fernando Pessoa.
Under the sun or under the moon.
"I forget you, and for a long time I won't forget."
Time does not stop.
I'm in the wrong place.
"It's not part of my childhood memory, but I already cried watching the trailer."
The best and worst thing i've ever experienced is being what i am.
"Rain and thunder, hot tea, feet in the scorching water. And magic happens.  #relax"
Mint drops.
Herbs too.
How many moons before I sit on your lap to hear you sing?
You warm my body.   The flu.
"""Quem canta,  seus males  espanta"""
I drink flowers.
"A cup of tea with cheerful flowers, and we started a warm dialogue with smell, taste and color.  The hug I need.    #jasmine"
My body has shown signs that chaos is real.
"I took a vitamin C and dreamed of you, I hope it works with the other 19 capsules."
"""In the world you will have afflictions"" and many Mondays."
"""Love is a fire that burns unseen, a wound that aches yet isn’t felt, an always discontent contentment, a pain that rages without hurting""...  Luís Vaz de Camões"
There will be no stars if there is no darkness.
We are fragile.
❤
Saturday night and the lights are low.
May a delicate mist of peace cover your body.  Close your eyes.
What is love made of?
"Sunbathing, no sun."
You awake good things asleep in me.
There are words that only the eyes know.
Sometimes I dream that I'm flying.
🌘
I just wish I could hide in your embrace.
The rough roar behind the door.
Sometimes human behavior is too scary for me :(
😉
He makes me smile.
(I fell in love with its essence)
A good time for a storm.  #sixwords
Involuntary tremors.
The enigmatic insignificance between the lines.
*sweet design*
Dance and let the soul fly.
Follow protocol.
Crunchy.
I need you to protect me from myself when I touch you.
I sunbathe thinking of being melted by the moon.
Learning about love loving you.
I want you.
"""Love is for those who have courage."""
"Coffee in bed and caresses, i need it."
My soul whispers your name.
"Sometimes the distance is a blessing, sometimes not."
You are fire.
Flowers in your hands and the smile that only you have.
Time to time.
"For a fertile soil of desire, an entire garden of realities flourishes."
I mean I love you without using words.
You know how to do that.

Being under the sun is what I have closest to pleasure and warmth.
"Don't hesitate, tie me."
*geographic problems.
"The potatoes melted, this is the tweet."
Life is raw.  Alcoholics Hilda Hilst
Breathing you.
Good dreams.
In a hateful way I have tremors.
Small spaces between light and dark. ☀️🌖
Talking about love also makes you tremble?
For each memory a soundtrack.
☕ Bom dia.
Socks and pillows.
"It still rains, a perfect day to stay in bed."
Rain noise.
Maybe I don't need my feet but my wings.
A goddamn nightmare I want to run from and my feet don't come off the floor.
A good reason to stay in bed all day.
Old movie and chocolate ❤
Secrets under the moonlight.
Make me.
What does love taste like?
Tachycardia every time i say i love you i hope it's a heart problem.
Orchids hide the nectar I wanna feel A.
Give me the keys to you.
In your little eyes is where i wanna be.  #wolf
Music as feeling.
All these things you do to me.
Always.
The magic of connection.
"I receive daily affection from six little eyes that look at me with joy and tenderness, I wonder if they really know me.  My lap is all they want, this is a happy moment, with a lot of dog hair.  #love"
I need vacation.
The things i wish are not things.
My coffe.
"XVII (I do not love you...)  I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.  Pablo Neruda"
🎧
You should see my eyes when i see you.
Reading.
Kiss me until i lose my breath.
"""Ignorance can be a blessing."""
I hear your voice in the words you write.
Dance for me wolf crazy! 💋
May our desires and hearts be aligned with the good and love that comes from God.   Happy New Year!💫
A walk in the woods is a date with myself.
"Searching the moon, I found stars."
I want to wake up with you and keep dreaming.
"""Take off the earrings before bed.""  ❤"
Tell me your stories.
Let's make a fire.
"""Meu riso é tão feliz contigo..."""
Let's count stars.
Let's camp.
Christmas morning as a feeling.
"For a child is born, I am given a son, and the government will be on his shoulders.  And he will be called  Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace  Isaiah 9; 6"
I need a quick and less painful way to get out of bed.
"I need to tell you something in silence, read my body and find the hidden words."
Distance saves me.
Touch me.
"Work until all my energy is exhausted, now bath, music and bed to recharge again."
Dress me with your skin.
Domingo com bossa.💃
"Fire or fog, don't expect me to know how to control it."
your name at my fingertips
Hands that meet under whispers in the darkness.
"Little stars among the trees, fireflies."
Seven seconds with you and I get lost.
I want to feel you in the roof of my mouth.
I wanted to wake up feeling your hands.
"Dear Santa, I was a good girl every day of this year, but I may have been a bad girl some nights.  I'm waiting for my gift.💋🎅"
Stay in bed a little longer to hear the noise of the rain.  Bed is a place of pleasure.
Moans and whispers.
Today is a good day for me to be tied.
Sing!
"""He who sings scares away his woes."" Cervantes"
Meanwhile the blood runs hot.
"I never kissed you, I always felt you."
"A cup of tea, noise of rain and sweatpants, my sense of happiness."
Images will always be just images until we can touch them.
I want to hear your laugh with my fingertips.
"""Eles passarão Eu passarinho!""  Mario Quintana"
"I envy the birds, they dance in the sky in silence."
I was born with geographic error.
"I have eyes on my fingers, I feel blind."
"Some works of art can never be touched, only felt."
I need your lap.
"Look at her, the moon."
"If you play with fire and don't get burned, something's wrong."
Always the best kind of conversation.    #nightpeople
"I don't feel old enough, maybe a little."
I'm good to find a needle in a haystack.  #aboutme
He makes me smile.
You can live without a kidney. #sixwords
(I like it when you whisper)
Find me wolf.
Let’s talk about how your mouth would fit into mine.
Find me among the stars.
You are my best secret.
