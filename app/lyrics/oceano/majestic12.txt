No disclosure in sight
Mankind's bound tight under an endless oppression
Sanctions to weaponize a deep web of misinformation
Misguided remain the masses
Deeper research brings forth misdirection
Your knowledge restricted
They hold the truth
And hide it right in front of you
False documents and hoaxes continue
Misguided the masses remain
Their esoteric agenda goes unnoticed
The black curtain must be lifted
Come together and demand disclosure
The black curtain must be lifted
