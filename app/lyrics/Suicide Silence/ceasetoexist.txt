I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist
Lights out
Go to sleep
I hope you never wake up
I want nothing more than to destroy the moment in time
That you came to life
I'm here to banish you
Now a hex on your life
Sent to your death
I'm here to punish you
Banish you

I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist
Knowing that your kind of grime
Has a place nested inside our world
I understand that your chance to live is trying to die
I will help you destroy the moment in time
That you came to life
I'm here to banish you
Now a hex on your life
Sent to your death
I'm here to punish you
Banish you

I AM HERE TO BANISH YOU
I AM HERE TO PUNISH YOU
I AM HERE TO BANISH YOU

Lights out
Go to sleep
I hope you never wake up
I want nothing more than to destroy the moment in time
That you came to life
I'm here to banish you
Now a hex on your life
Sent to your death
I'm here to punish you
Banish you

I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist
I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist

Cease to exist

I would drag myself through HELL
I would drag myself through HELL

Just to watch you cease to exist
