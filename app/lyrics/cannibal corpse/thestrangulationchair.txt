Trapped in this prison awaiting my death
Condemned to die by draconian means
An eye for an eye is the rule of this land
But the victim in question did not die by my

Hand
A mockery of justice
Inequity
The murderer will live but I will die

Strapped to a chair unable to breathe
Other condemned have died before me
Constrained in the chair I saw fear in their eyes
The executioner smiled as he took their

Lives
Crushing their windpipes
Garroted
Throttled with iron they succumb to death

The Strangulation Chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain

A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true

The Strangulation Chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release

A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now

My day has come now it's my turn to die
Hands tied they lead me away
The executioner collars my neck
In terror I wait for my strangulation
my strangulation, my strangulation

<i>[Solo: O'Brien]</i>

Death
My mind slips to darkness
Unconscious forever
The crime they committed they will not know

The Strangulation Chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain

A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true

The Strangulation Chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release

A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now
