Garden of Disdain LyricsNo God will claim this garden
Too sickening to the eyes to see this
Long ignored my words of warning
From the world I built, erased
So it shall know no peace in my time
In absence of my voice for guidance
In the absence of my hand and whip
Grew the absence of the knowing
Unknowing
Grew the absence and grew the festering
A boiling abscess that
Was sure to burst with failure
From a distance I have observed
Minding my slaves like children
Absorbing your petty struggles
Disgusted by your petty lives
I have witnessed your sleight of hand
I was betrayed by you many times
I have craved to bring forth my vengeance
I have yearned to dismantle this
World of unfathomed treasures
This garden disgraced by man
Your ways despised by beasts and gods alike
All gods agree your ways must end
They have waited long to see this
You claim to not need my guidance
Yet you reach for my hand and plead
Obsessed with your futile struggles
You are mistaken to think I feel
From a distance I have observed
Minding my slaves like children
Absorbing your petty strife
Disgusted by your petty life
All gods have left this garden
These gods have left in shame
Dismissed and long forgotten
This world of useless being
This endless festeringEmbed
