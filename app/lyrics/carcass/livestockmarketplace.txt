The procreation, the damned
Carnal union of the flesh
Base primal instincts
This murderous passion
Coitus corporeal
Into holding pens and corrals
The livestock herd
Baby, you know that you were born to lose.
Come immerse yourself in the slaughterhouse blues.
Heffers and steers are all there for you to choose.

Promiscuous sensuality for we are all whores &amp; prostitutes
Life’s a celebration at the cattle market
The frigid and recycling death disco
Bestial passion at the cattle market
On the killing floor

Baby, you know that you were born to lose.
Come blood yourself in the slaughterhouse blues.
Heffers and steers are all there for you to choose.

Fiscal sexuality for we are all whores &amp; prostitutes
Life’s a celebration at the cattle market
The frigid and recycling death disco
Bestial passion at the cattle market

Life is celebrated at their cattle market
The frigid and recycling death disco
Animal passion at the cattle market
A dance macabre on the killing…

Come, let your body fall through the sluice
The chilling arousal of the slaughterhouse blues
Choice fresh meet is processed, cured and bled
Life is a cabaret
Where your dancing partner is…
Dead

Life is celebrated at their cattle market
The frigid and recycling death disco
Bestial passion at the cattle market

Life’s a celebration at the cattle market
The frigid and recycling death disco
Animal passion at the cattle market
A dance macabre on the killing floor
