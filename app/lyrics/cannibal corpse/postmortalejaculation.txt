Suffering my only need now is to hang
the rope does swing, hanging from the darkened ceiling
Strangling, dangling from my twisted spine
I knew I would enjoy death more than life
My lids close tight, but the light blinds my eyes
My body grows cold - my cock becomes erect

Watching over my dead shell, from beyond in my own hell
Caught between life and death, even though my body's dead
I still feel the touch of flesh
Given the choice to die or live dead
Purgatory my damnation
Climaxing at the resurrection
Adipocere spurts from my erection

Manifested in my rotted body
Unpure spirit, dead among mortals
I have risen from self-murder
Only to rot and kill
to break the necks of young women
their cunts my pus will fill
Acid burning through her crotch
I baptise her face with my rot
Then venom foams from her throat
On my discharge she will choke

Pulsation, my heart begins to beat
Heaving, goiters start to secrete
caustic odor, steaming gruel
wallow in my infected drool

Swollen pusing gashes
Start to reek

Puncture wounds in the back
hacked up limbs, bones now crack
Skin fillet from your face
Breasts gounged out
I fuck with your chest
