Zengeza Lyrics
I see the sun in your eyes
And the moon and the stars when you smile
And I know that you can do better
And I'm sure that you can do better
With the sun and the moon and the stars

You're always reaching for bars like Chitown got a poor signal
You're not lyrical- just deep words with shallow impact
You might seem a star but you' only hot like half the year
Your songs hot like half the verse, that's Harvey Dent
All that accent faking to sound a lil more urban
And diss one or two rappers so you can capture attention
You never mind what you speak, so let me speak my mind
All those rappers you diss, man, they did make it in life
Coz; it's their bars that gave them the buzz
So they're way above your class and you're not coming close
You announced your retirement, not a soul gave a rat's ass
And now you're back with this bullshit, and you'll be rhyming like a rat's ass
You weaponize poverty in a bid to earn pardon
I been to Chitown before, it ain't as wack as your jargon
Y'all heard his last mixtapes? Neither did I
I ignored the projects, I am like the government sometimes
I've seen you together with Matrix, Natallie and Lynn
The four of you look fantastic, you should be a thing
Don't you get it? Your music annoys the people
I understand you get more boos than Chicago b-ball
You went from trash to Tha M.I.N.Dset and trash to Tha Macetape
You've been through more ups and downs than Asian accents
What's funny is your ego is twenty times your skill set
And Bard is a bullshit mixtape
I see the sun in your eyes
And the moon and the stars when you smile
And I know that you can do better
And I'm sure that you can do better
With the sun and the moon and the stars

Okay, but be reminded, I'm the man who made Tha M.I.N.Dset
And brought an end to the weak like I'm Friday
I put the city on my back, typical stripper's tattoo
The rest talk the walk in their Hammerman shoes
I stayed with Chitown at the cost of everything
Coz loyalty- some like it hotter than Marylin
Priceless knowledge I got from Kaepernick
Sometimes you don't need to be on your feet to stand for something
So; F the police for failing the system
I go high 'cause itâ€™s against the law, pardon my physics
They want evidence that HipHop's still intelligent
I'm the living proof, no disrespect to Eminem
Back to the topic, the greatest of my generation
Like that M-Net station, I'm all about the action
Moves sleeker than the Chinese
Watch this meandering man daring mandarin
The whole land mine, I blew up from the underground
No more harm made but I'm trynna make Allah proud
This is my conquest
The journey far so I keep a low pace
I've heard rappers say they' the shit, a minute later- we flushed
The problem with the new skool is they don't have class
Plastic surgeon- changed the face of the game: I fixed it
And BARD is a classic mixtape
I see the sun in your eyes
And the moon and the stars when you smile
And I know that you can do better
And I'm sure that you can do better
With the sun and the moon and the starsEmbed
