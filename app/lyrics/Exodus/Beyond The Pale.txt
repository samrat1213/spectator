Sinners heart can't think or feel
The sharp sting of slicing steel
Punish, kill, repeat
The death caress, so bitter sweet

I live outside the rule of law
My one decree is shock and awe
Black sheep of my kind
Progeny of hate refined

Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

Take the gun, take the knife
Take the pain, then take my life
My taste for homicide
Is rising up and amplified
Bloody deeds, my only friend
With me til the bitter end
Together we are one
And our work has just begun
Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

Plea for mercy
To no avail
Killers of my kind live
Beyond the pale
In this world of mine
They say I don't belong
Something that feels so right
Could never be so wrong

Plea for clemency
You're wasting time
My routine
Is the scene of the crime
I make the devil laugh
And angels wail
Forever I will reside
Beyond the pale

[Solo: Gary Holt]
Heartless bastard cold as ice
Victim of my own device
The strong prey on the weak
Dead men, they never speak

All part of mans condition
On this path to our perdition
We kill along the way
Death never takes a holiday

Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

Plea for mercy
To no avail
Killers of my kind live
Beyond the pale
In this world of mine
They say I don't belong
Something that feels so right
Could never be so wrong
Plea for clemency
You're wasting time
My routine
Is the scene of the crime
I make the devil laugh
And angels wail
Forever I will reside
Beyond the pale
