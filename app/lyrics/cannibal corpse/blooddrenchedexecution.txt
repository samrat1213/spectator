Blood Drenched Execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Feel the fucking pain
I rip your child from your cunt
The fetus is kept alive
To die before caring eyes

Slaves in hell for me
A tortured death will set you free
The executioner
I was meant to be
Born to kill for all eternity

The exsanguination
Savage display of murder and mayhem
Casualities of primal abduction
Red is spraying from
The hole in the baby's head
The slaughter will not subside
This day a family dies

Young blood is so pure
Unborn infant is dead premature
The executioner
Has to mutilate
A fetal pulp is all that remains

Rapid blood loss
Flooding the floor
Gore is unstoppable
Rabid blood lord
Carving the whore
Extremely contemptible
Rancid rancor
Insatiable from my proclivity
Random tirade
Eternal death inevitable

<i>[Solo - O'Brien]</i>

Blood drenched execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Felt the fucking pain
I ripped our child from your cunt
The fetus was kept alive
To die before blood soaked eyes
