The devil himself is stricken with fear. Make him my minion. The apex predator has arrived.

Hell is empty, for these demons and dimension will fucking disintegrate in the glory of my preeminent power. The one that you all call God will find himself on the brink of my abysmal new realm. Reclaim our home.

From his eyes will gush the birth of a new hierarchy. A new planet, stripped of all reason.

Unsympathetic intellect gazes upon this swarm of mortals in revulsion. Blessed are the dead who's cadavers have perished by our hand. For you will join your fictitious deity. For you will join them all

Fuck

Break their fucking limbs until their bones rip through the skin. Nobody escapes the sphere alive. No man, no god. Smother the mothers carcass in the blood of her infants. 

Earth, a malignant tumor on the face of the universe. 
Spectral beings will rise once again.

From his eyes will gush the birth of a new hierarchy. A new planet, stripped of all reason.

Unsympathetic intellect gazes upon this swarm of mortals in revulsion. Blessed are the dead who's cadavers have perished by our hand. For you will join your fictitious deity. For you will join them all.
