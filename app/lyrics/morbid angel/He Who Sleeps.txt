He Who Sleeps LyricsAwaken my brothers
Of vengeance we rise
To devulge this enemy
To enlighten the ones who sleep
Worlds have passed and so too has time
My slumber now disturbed
This place of hate, thy worlds shall burn
Humans, I shall feast upon your ignorance
You will destroy yourselves
Mortals, your slithering existence
Sickens the gods, my brothers
It awoke me, from timeless sleep
My dreams destroyed, my visions lost
And so I watch you pray
And spite your worlds
Forgive me father? I am not your god
You crawl to me, and beg to me my sheep
You have fallen, curse your empty lives
Blind, like wolves you turn on yourselvesEmbed
