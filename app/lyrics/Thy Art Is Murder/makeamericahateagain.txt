Hostility
Your leaders are now your enemies
They'll make America great again
Fuck no!
Let's make America hate again

Peace talks are off the table
It's time for violent action
Pushed to the brink
Tell me what the fuck ya think would happen
Suffered through holy wars
But now the fight is at our door
Natives are restless
We will not accept this

I dream of endless floods
Let freedom rain in buckets of blood
What will it take to be free
The only answer is hostility

Your leaders are now your enemies
They'll make America great again
Fuck no!
Let's make America hate again

I'm done with pacifism
You can't debate with demons
Burn down the house that betrays us
I want blood, I want chaos
More chaos, more chaos, more chaos

Let's make America hate again

The propaganda machine
Spills its patriotic pus in the streets
We lap it up, drunk on fantasy
You never practice what you preach
A servant's life is incomplete
What will it take to be free

I dream of endless floods
Let freedom rain in buckets of blood
I dream of endless floods
Let freedom rain in buckets of blood

Hostility
Your leaders are now your enemies
They'll make America great again
Fuck no!
Let's make America hate again

Let's make America hate again

Hostility
Your leaders are now your enemies
Hostility
Your leaders are now your enemies
