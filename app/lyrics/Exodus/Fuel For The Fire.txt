There's a terrorist, he's at the door
Says he's gonna start, the third world war
Justifies his illegal acts
The land he says that's his, he's takin' it back

Blood will spill - in desert sand
The people kill - barbaric land
A war for peace - I understand
Obtain the fuel - the master plan
Blood will spill - in desert sand
The people kill - barbaric land
A war for peace - I understand
Obtain the fuel - the master plan

All my life I've spent believin' what I'm told
I'm not a crook, I don't recall, excuse is getting old
But this time I believe that the cause is justified
So those that burn the flag should be hung until they die
I'm sorry bout the casualties you can't avoid in war
They knew what they were doin' when they signed up for the chore
And to all the people who protest aggressive act
The world's not a happy place, a sad but true fact

Now they find our allies far and wide
And now a force of one and will not be denied
When will they finally realize
Our taxes pay for war and that's no surprise
Strong survive - in desert sand
???- barbaric land
???- I understand
???- the master plan
Strong survive - in desert sand
???- barbaric land
???- I understand
???- the master plan

All my life I've spent believin' what I'm told
Those excuse, you know, the ones that're getting old
But this time I believe that the cause is justified
So all those people that burn the flag should be hung until they die
Yeah I'm sorry bout the casualties and people dying in the war
They knew what they were doin' when they signed up for the chore
And to all the people you know the ones who protested what went on
This world ain't a happy place, and this ain't a happy song
Fuel for the fire

There's a terrorist, he's at the door
Says he's gonna start, the third world war
Justifies his illegal acts
The land he says that's his, he's takin' it back

FUEL - for the fireEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
