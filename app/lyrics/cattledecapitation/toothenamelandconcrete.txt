Pain like you've never felt before
Your face instantly grated and scraped along the sidewalk
Chiseled up, filed down &amp; a concrete crown

I've got your face to the curb
With my pleathur boot you'll learn - life is cheap
Let's have a sacrifice in which we take your life
Straight through your mouth - denting your dentin
The power I uphold
Teeth and concrete now mold
Shaved and scraped
Hovering above your twitching, bloody mouth that still keeps bitching:
"Just tell me why?"
Why? Because you are human...

O, the insanity... the humanity.
Toothless gash gives new meaning to "cavities"...

Filing the enamel revealing the dentine
Gouging out pulp, separation of cementum
Disintegrating through maxillar scraping
Mandible and glottis now raw and pulsating in a jellied heap

Your incisors on the pavement
A brutal end to your enslavement - life is cheap
Let's have a sacrifice where your teeth merge with your eyes
Sinus collape - blunt facial prolapse
The power I uphold
Teeth and concrete now mold
Shaved and scraped
Hovering above your twitching, bloody mouth that still keeps bitching, begging me: "Please!"
O, death...
Such a tease...

O, the insanity... the humanity.
Toothless gash gives new meaning to "cavities"...
