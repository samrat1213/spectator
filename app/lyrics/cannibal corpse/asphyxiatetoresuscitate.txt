Always the same
Killing for years
You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be

Choking
Starling
Breathless
Asphyxiate
Lifeless
Gasping
Breathing
Resuscitate

You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light

You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be
