"I miss you, but I don't even know you."
You carry the clouds in your eyes and thunder in your heart.
My hands are full of ink stains writing lust letters that I will never send to you.
Should I feel guilt for claiming something I have craved for so long.
The sweet eroticism of fruit.
We are in the darkness but not without light.
Afraid of getting burned by the fire raging in my heart.
Introduce me to your darkest dream.
A dream that tastes like reality.
What is the male equivalent of PMS?
"Aroused, a petal blooms in the dark forest. A thought abandons reason for lust."
"I want to burst into a giant waterfall, and let my pain nourish a new rainforest."
The problem of apathy lies in its veiled hunger for sensation. Its tragedy is in finally finding it in things that destroy the very soul it inhabits.
A distant ache in the place where my heart used to be.
Dream me into existence.
I looked into the darkness and found my soul staring back at me.
"Dearest forgotten, I had a few questions to ask your memory. Your love is a blur in the mist of a myriad lost words that I cannot pronounce, from a language my heart no longer speaks."
Letters to a lost lover.
The sun is always thirsty.
Do you do grammar in your head like maths?
If I do not acknowledge you do you even exist?
How many dimensions are you?
All the ways the universe sacrifices her stars to appease her gods.
The strange new dimension of a high.
Smoking a new nebula into existence.
Possessed by a human.
What I really wanted to do was ask a simple question but it turned into a poem.
Who will absolve the storm's sins?
"Thank you, Dsylxia.❤️"
Öp beni ve nefesimi kes.
"I want to kiss your forehead, your left eye, right eye, temple, nose, left cheek right cheek, chin, and then let you chase me around the house for a taste of my lips."
I take the reins from myself and give them to my other-self. Let us share the burden of this life's journey.
The absurd dichotomy between the self and true-self.
"You are everything shy, dancing naked on a pole."
"You thought the burdens had buried you underground and the pain had stolen your pride, but I haven't seen a higher more magnificent mountain than you."
My heart is aching for an ancient desire it has never known.
"Please sir, could you spare me some darkness, I am bereft of peace and the light has blinded me."
"A comfortable lie for some semblance of peace, the mind laughs in the distance."
I feel sad and so silly.
HAHAHAHAHAhahahaha...
RSVP to my descent into madness.
You are the dream that turned into a nightmare.
The softness and heaviness of love.
Ravaged like a flower in the storm.
Devour me like the animal you are.
You are a sentient star burning everything in your wake.
It's easy to lose sight of who you are when life's made you its bitch.
"Charge your misery to my heart, I will pay the price for your sorrow and carry your tears in my eyes."
"Every day is death with you. Each day, you bring me to the brink of ruin; without breath or air, I gasp for fulfilment, burning while you wage war against my calm ocean &amp; set me on fire. Every day is death with you until you kiss me back to life."
Death is the light you find with your eyes closed.
"You are not ready for love yet, and I am ripe for the picking."
Trust fall into my abyss.
"For a moment, I forget my devotion to morality and give in to desire."
"It's in the way she paints the rainbow black and white, even the darkness stops to whisper secrets in her ear."
Tied all your lies around my neck so I could pull on the noose every time someone tried to fool me again.
"Some people will probe your core by sharing their nightmares with you, just to take a glance for a chance to laugh at your soul."
A poet garbed in self-inflicted misery.

A poet garbed in self-inflicted misery.
"What are you obsessed with, tea or coffee?"
I was promised thunder but all I got was this measly drizzle.
I want to swim in the darkest depths of you.
"He asked me what kind of laugh I was, and I wondered how long it had been since I smiled."
"I know no spells that ease sadness, let me drink this potion of remorse just to feel alive."
"If anyone can ignite your desire, then cut me out of your fantasies."
"Perfection does exist, but in the imaginings of the weak its illusion cannot be attained."
You only want my illusion because the reality would drown you.
"Paint me a picture that looks like love conquered the pain battle by battle, and then gave birth to a new horizon."
"A vicious cycle spins. Mortal sin, I confess. Forgiven! An overwhelming temptation curtails all effort for unadulterated shame. So devoted to absolution, I sin again..."
Pain is an indifferent stranger.
I don't want to get lost in the abyss. I want to jump in the crevasse of reality &amp; fight my demons head on.
I know myself which is why I don't want to know you.
The goal isn't anonymity but the horror of celebrity cannot be ignored.
"Tell me a story of love and horror or simply of a quiet evening walk where you found peace, even if it was only for a fleeting moment."
I want to know you completely.
"To tell you who I am, I would first need to know myself."
How long until this fake smile starts to rot the inside of my mouth.
"Had a chat with a bot, quite enlightening."
I wish it bothered me.
"""HARDER!"" I screamed at life."
"My desolate garden of remorse, flourishing again with new regrets."
The distinct scent of a beautiful memory.
Whisper screams in my ear. Burn for me.
"I wish for this inadequate want to slide down your mind, slither across your lap, and patiently wait for its fire to die an unsatisfied death."
Ever been so strong you didn't know you were broken?
You can get into my pants after you unbutton my mind.
An interminable craving for clarity follows all ambiguity. I must dissect every nuance.
Love doesn't just break hearts it destroys minds.
I'm a very simple person with very complex desires.
Pour in me your favourite colour and I will paint the sky with your desire.
"Somewhere in the world you're alive, breathing the same air I am is solace enough, sometimes."
"I miss feeling, anything."
*hides in your heart while you count to infinity.
Let's shoot the stars down and blind the universe.
To feel as lost and alone as the wind.
I want to make sense to myself.
Love starts like a raging fire then simmers down to an ashamed ember afraid of its own heat.
The universe is unraveling around us and I only have eyes for you.
I'm so high I can feel the earth's core.
The answer is yes but what is the question.
The surreal violence and surrender of your fingers clasped in mine.
Craving your hands on me in ancient languages.
The madness is stuck in an unending loop.
Wearing disbelief as a badge of honour.
Raucous darkness Still night Loud memories
What's keeping you awake?
Give me love or fuck off.
Softly unfurls midnight its tentacles in my dream.
Let's start in the present end.
Allow yourself to break apart.
"Rain on my parade, storm my castles, conquer my desire."
You do not have what I desperately want. Yourself.
Have you ever been jealous of yourself?
It is not about me.
Heartache is addictive.
You don't know what you want but you want me to give it to you.
There's something really carnal about hands.
Ruin me with care.
Fuck her like the sun is fueled by her moans.
I miss your indifference.
How does it feel to just be a shadow of someone's misconception?
Give me a heart that feels as deeply as seasons do.
What is your favourite feeling besides being in love?
"The wind wraps a velvet cloak &amp; lurks in the night's shadows. I am the distant star watching its every move, a secret companion to its loneliness."
"You said unrequited love tastes like sour grapes, but love has always smelled like spring &amp; fresh lemons to me."
An obscure generator sadly sputters somewhere deep in my heart.
All the little murders you commit every time you lie to me.
The primordial distance between a smile and a tear.
Who has your heart now.
Issued an apology to the wild melancholy blooming in my chest. I will never try to tame you again.
It hurts to know yourself.
"You diminished my being to cheap flesh, sold by the pound to your desire."
"How many heartbreaks have you traveled through, how many did you survive."
Your touch unsettles me and calms me at the same time.
Take me where the darkness secretly unfurls into a galaxy.
Your demons are promiscuous.
What is happiness.
"I want to touch every inch of your lust, stripped bare of pretense and full of desire."
Soulmate with the storm raging in your eyes.
Silently choking back to life.
I licked the dark it bit my tongue.
"I walked upon the myriad colours of sunset. Did you know dead leaves cry when you step on them? I broke down in the forest and mourned their demise, but a bluebird chirped and sadness smiled again."
What sound did your heart make when I walked all over it.
Do you mind explaining your sports reference.
No coward will ever get the satisfaction of having me.
What animal are you.
Rain is literally cloud cum.
The pulsing lightning and thunderous orgasm of the clouds.
The seductive abandon of your hand slipped into mine.
"Cut me everywhere, I can't stand the numbness."
Which piece do you rush to gather each time you shatter against their walls.
Life is short so settle.
Wrap your darkness all around my naked abyss.
Do you miss me in your darkness.
What are you afraid of.
The million languages of music translate into one word: Love.
I can feel you yearning.
Meet me at the horizon where the ocean consumes the eternal ball of fire.
You will bite me and I will devour you.
We're both afraid of each others hunger.
Two lions fighting over each other.
"Contaminate me. I'm ravenous for a soul fattened on lust and vulgarity. Empty me of this counterfeit purity, &amp; wash me in your fiery river."
"This is my hell, but you're welcome to stay."
Slap me when I start to rhyme.
"I have been sad before, but today the emotion feels alive. Its tentacles wrapped around my mind, pulling apart your memories. It seems like time, the ultimate poison to forgotten love."
The lost art of accepting people exactly as they are.
"Who dares to uphold the devil to standards of morality, they are beneath him. Who mocks his decadence while he spits on purity."
Flickering between need and want— my desire trembles like a candle flame trying to set a forest on fire.
*Steals your heart and sets it on fire.
"Your ersatz love is now a distant memory. I do not recognize your scent in my thoughts, nor remember loving you. I miss no more my image in your eyes. Is this closure or did you never even exist."
"Hovering between the need to touch, not touch, devouring with my hands, and then the realization that my thoughts are barren of your love strikes, leaving me desolate."
I don't know how to feel about you.
"Do you ever want to go back to the basics, touch every feeling, every emotion and just bask in its release."
"Your petals are plucked and trampled upon; your core is crushed. The bees taunt your desolation, yet your fragrance fills the air, and your heart beats steadily dreaming of love again."
PMS = crying inconsolably when there's nothing wrong.
"I danced upon the meaning a little longer than deemed respectable. I took every layer off your words; now the pain stands in a corner, naked &amp; vulnerable, and all I want to do is take it in my arms."
"My favourite dance happens on moonless nights when the wind sways with the trees, the flowers fill the night with the smell of romance, and the night chirps a dirge for the dying stars."
Take me where the words play hide-and-seek.
Change is an illusion. We're elements of our true selves waking up through time.
I love you with intervals of intense hatred.
Who are you?
"I walk on the moon and pull closer the sun, the earth moans as I set the ocean on fire."
"The inside of her mind is abandoned book shops, haunted houses and coffee shop floors laced with stale cigarette butts and ash."
Touch me as intimately as the wind does.
"Some days do not end with a sunset. Stuck on repeat, rewinding over &amp; over again in your mind. Some days last a lifetime."
I ache to slide across every thought in your mind and become your only obsession.
"Falling for you, in the way dark matter yearns for supernovas erupting billions of light-years away."
This spellbinding hemorrhage of emotion has transfixed me in a loop of stabbing pain.
Death is a glitch in the system.
"If we're all crazy, then we're all normal."
The sea is always blue with sadness or green with envy.
"Expelled from reality, disowned by my imagination, I hover somewhere near the heartbeat of nonexistence and here I find my peace."
I desire your ruin in the most delicious ways.
"I have become one with the void, the devourer of souls."
When the unbearable becomes the norm.
Not all pains trace to lost love.
Awaken in me the desire to be loved again.
The sky sympathetic to my cries wore grey and cried with me.
"A giver, who is a coward at sharing her heart."
The friendships we silently choke to death.
I don't hold the past as my hostage because the present cannot be ransomed.
As painful as a silent scream of help.
"Do you feel all the eyes staring at you in the dark, stealing your soul one ghost kiss at a time."
I hope you find someone who looks into the silent screams in your eyes and isn't afraid.
"If only gravity were a choice, I would jump off the world and meld into the darkness forever."
"I need to be mauled by your fire. A victim to your savageness, I want to dance with the flames of your insatiable desire."
Make yourself comfortable and answer this list of utterly uncomfortable questions just to amuse me.  —Me as a therapist.
Each day comes with its own bag of horrors.
"It's okay to feel incomplete sometimes, not everyone can be a complete asshole."
Revisit your frame of mind. Read something you wrote in the past for your future.
"We don't play with pain in this garden. We bury it, and nourish it until the blossoms appear then we adorn our hair with their beauty, and dance with our misery."
I am not a (open) book; you cannot skim my pages. I do not have walls that can be scaled. To know me is to drown in the Challenger Deep; there is no resurfacing from my torment.
Let me destroy you gently.
Treat me like an angel and I'll screw you over like satan.
Craving the kind of dark angel that even hell abandons.
And then in words I found the breath I never found in air.
Are you peace or chaos disguised as the calm before the storm.
Come hide inside my darkness and we'll play with each other's demons.
"Sometimes, love is moving mountains for people who bury you under them."
Let's fall in love like it won't eventually become our death.
The thousand sounds of silence.
She said she wanted to feel the stars so I set her on fire.
A déjà vu that feels like being fucked to Bogoroditse Devo.
"I have too much pride to ask for love, it must always come of its own volition."
Everything is dread now!
"The last time we kissed, all the riddles on my lips meant, I still love you but you couldn't guess them."
"Seni özledim, pislik!"
"In an hour glass, remnants of an eternity ending."
I want you all to myselves.
"I do not envy you if you have loved and been drenched in passion. If you have survived love's test, then I applaud your courage."
"Hate is the purest form of love, it consumes you."
"I'm so vain, I think your existential crisis is about me."
It's funny how much you love the people you think you hate.
Love is the difference between living and surviving.
The life span of mutual interests.
"Breathing, and all the other ways you could be addicted to life."
Answer the fucking question!
It's in the subtle way you wrap your eyes around me.
Why do they make you say your name out loud in AA?
"Grant pain sanctuary for a moment, and it creeps over like vines on old castles. This egregious lapse in judgement will only cost you your sanity; watch as the slow ebb and flow of suffering floods your being."
Hi! I am an apocalypse. I eat storms for breakfast.
"Friendship is earned, trust is gained but love is a priceless harlot, laid bare for all yet cannot be extorted."
Tell the sky to keep its woes and stop dripping on my grave.
I ache to write poetry on your skin with nothing but my lips.
There's a moan stuck in my throat with your name on it.
"Pease sir, my words, they're dying! May I whisper them in your ear?"
"Nice to meet you, I am a nuisance."
I searched everywhere for nothing.
"I paint the clouds in darkness and fire. As if the sun were setting, but the night wouldn't let go of its hand."
"Flesh, with all its rot, dares to question the majesty of the spirit."
The mind rationalises lies like one would coax a small child to go to bed.
"Sexual orientation isn't a personality trait, darling."
We measured love in cups of infinity and found there was still more love after infinity ended.
"Please let me scream at you, the words are rotting inside of me."
Don't bore me with your mediocre hatred.
"Unafraid and unrelenting, I will devour your fire. You will drown in my ocean before I burn in your inferno."
Went through old emails from my exes and fell in love with them again.
You don't want to be loved by someone like me.
Sometimes you scream into the abyss and the void hugs you back.
I wrote you an anthology of eulogies for every time you feel dead inside.
"Desire, disguised as a rhetorical question."
"Pain comes like the sea, ineluctable, in waves of surreal abandonment. Leaving, only to return. I whelve in this perpetual loop, faithfully embracing the misery."
All the spirits passing through my room sound like they're going to hell.
The art of living with a broken heart.
Can you love like the clouds. Could you give up the dream to touch the sky and fall like rain on a parched earth.
"For the feelings we cannot comprehend, we sought a name that would not need an explanation &amp; called the emotion 'art'."
"Stop screaming at the spiders, the shrieking gives them nightmares."
I have yet to die a beautiful death.
"You're quite odd, aren't you."
"I have no need to be frivolous, each breath I breathe is accounted for."
"When you go away to the place where death takes, from this ephemeral pain of existence to peace with no end. I pray, my friend, in that realm of angels you are a moon in the sky."
I hid inside the sun and it turned dark.
Ever had someone sing you to sleep? What was it like?
She is fluent in massacre.
Gofund my descent into madness.
Have you ever cum like rain?
"I built a home with words. Sometimes it is a castle with fortified towers, but today it is a measly shed dripping in the rain."
"I don't want someone to drive me crazy, I got there on my own. I need someone to take my hand and lead me back to sanity."
"Life is a 100 billion questions. I am only trying to answer one, by living."
It's all fun and games until you take off your mask and they realize they're actually afraid of the dark.
I want to swim in the madness of your feral nature. I want the wildness of your bite to poison my darkness.
Fuck her like she'll sell your soul back to you.
"Everything I could say about love has already been said and written, and yet there is no perfect definition of it in the world."
Loneliness feels like someone crushed me into powder and I am trying to find my true form again.
"I have stopped screaming and lost hope, but I cling to a tiny piece of love left in my heart. It is the only thing keeping me alive."
Hold me like I am your only connection to sanity.
post your handwriting.
"I have made a home in the quiet, you cannot enter screaming."
"I keep finding and losing myself in the quiet hour before sunrise, clinging to the darkness around me, begging it to stay the day."
Ate all the words analogous to fire to thaw my cold heart.
"Dearest, you cannot fall for a broken person then pick and choose certain pieces to love."
'Are you naked?'  'No! I am always wearing my will to live and I've learned to never take it off.'
You are dysfunction's muse.
*Shoves the daddy issues under the bed.
I don't want an orgasm! Give me whatever makes the sun burn.
Take me where the storm goes to rest after wreaking havoc.
We are given eyes to see the visible and souls to decipher the secrets of darkness.
Ever felt violated wandering through someone's mind just to find them staring back as if they were wandering through yours?
"I just gave birth to this feeling, look how wild and enchanted it is."
Sometimes I just really miss playing hopscotch.
"I'm going to hell, anything to thaw my frozen heart."
"Love reminds us we're human, but our savage desires never let us forget the feral beasts we nurture in the forsaken shadows of our minds."
"Do you even keep cupcakes in your abyss, bro?"
"I am made of the eerie silence in space, love, chaos, darkness, the ocean, the music that thunder makes, and the pursuit but never the possession of peace."
I am an anthology of nightmarish soul clichés.
Survived eternity just to watch the wind go to sleep.
*Casually slips into a coma during small talk.
We're just moments stuck in abandoned memories. Yearning for people who push us in dark corners in their minds because remembering burns like lost love.
"The tragedy is, you trust strangers more than you could ever trust yourself."
"Touch the jagged pieces of my liquid insanity, watch the madness come to life."
Engaged to my fear of commitment.
"Sometimes you build the walls around you so thick, you forget how to cross their barriers yourself."
"Do that thing where you spontaneously combust into flames, darling."
"I think, therefore I am nothing."
"You're such a slut for pain, you wouldn't know peace if it strangled you for attention."
Let's survive soul wrenching tragedies together.
Sshhh... it hurts to be this real.
"He saw my darkness hidden under veils of light. The demons I alone reveled in, and coaxed them out to play with his own."
"The air seemed drunk on love, and I preferred suffocating in the venomous silence of my broken heart."
I hope you find someone you're comfortable sharing your sadness with.
Fuck touch! I want to feel your primal thoughts creep into the crevice of my dark soul and hug it from behind.
"Like a good friend, the wind wiped away my tears."
"Come hide with me in solitude, and fall in love with the quiet heartbeat of existence."
"Trapped in an umbra, dreaming of the Aurora Borealis."
Nostalgia smells different every time. Today it smells like tears and fresh cut grass in spring.
Slice the sadness and feed me the pain in small poetic morsels.
"I crave your ruin on the altar of my desire, in the most destructive ways."
"Each day my shadow wrestles with the thought of going its own way, then quietly paints itself black and follows me without a word."
Speaking in tongues with our eyes.
"Draw the curtains, we'll start our own apocalypse."
To the whore who took my poems:
"Heard death stumble drunkenly towards me. Fattened on lush souls, it saw my unsavoury broken spirit and left me alive."
"Poetry isn't fickle love, it is not individualistic. It is the whole universe coming to life over and over again in your infinitesimal mind."
I have been around dysfunction so long that everything normal seems like a threat to my well-preserved insanity.
"We're in this silent dance, without touching or even a glance we have set each other on fire."
Too good at being bad.
Fuck flowers. Tell me your darkest secrets.
"Dearest, death is just an old friend who promises to be there when everything ends."
I have bits and pieces of nothing. Take what you need.
"In everything we say we are, our truth lies in the silence of the darkness we hide."
I will reserve my hatred for a worthy adversary. I nothing you!
Yousmiled at me and the darkness frowned.
I want to bathe in the ocean of your primal darkness.
"Your lips left indelible imprints on my skin. Maps of secrets hidden behind mahogany eyes, secrets that would make the devil blush."
This aureate waltz of timid lights chasing the shadows. Does it remind you of an innocence lost to the promise of erotic darkness?
"You are gone, and I have become sorrow's filthy mistress."
"You coaxed me into this sadness Tied a satin scarf over my mind It's midnight blue, like the tears you cried when we said goodbye.  Look, I could wear a different frame of mind for the rest of my life, but I tried on melancholy and it suits me so well.  I cannot take it off."
"I slipped into the monochromatic silence and heard you weep, but you convinced me it was a sad song so Ilet you go on..."
"You said unrequited love tasted like sour grapes, but love has always smelled like fresh lemons to me."
Gaslighting your saviour complex.
Hurting from a yesterday I remember only as a distant dream.
You make me feel all the weathers at once.
"Pick up the fucking trash She says, pointing To herself"
"Nice to meet you, I'm a nuisance."
Remember the day you tiptoed around my heart just to plant landmines.
Only the sane romanticize insanity. The truly mad are too busy chewing their hair.
I know no spells that ease sadness. I will drink this potion of remorse just to feel alive.
"My cauldron of melancholy bubbles, I add a dash of sigh."
I have fallen from heights unfathomable but it hurt more when I was expelled from my own heart.
This spellbinding hemorrhage of emotion has transfixed me in a loop of stabbing pain.
I love the way you apologise while you twist that knife in my heart.
"Don't be afraid, darling. Fear is not your enemy, it is an inconsiderate friend."
"Look, I could wear a different frame of mind for the rest of my days, but I tried on melancholy and it suits me well. I cannot take it off."
What comes after hi and hello? Let's start from there.
"Have you cried inconsolably, not due to loss of wealth or man because your soul is empty devoid of peace."
Releasing hostage tears.
Are you a good enough muse to inspire elysian sonnets and divine verses on moonless nights when I'm wrecked and drunk on passion?
Current mood: Eclipsing the sun.
"You take the mask off and show them you feel, your tears, your pain. As alien as being real seems, you like it!  And that is when they wish you were fake again."
Writing crib notes and a letter of condolence to the past.
A little of your soul dies every time you masturbate to someone you no longer love.
Go down on me like the sun goes down on darkness.
"I hoard space, oblivion, voids and abysses. Give me all your nothings."
*sighs into your mouth*
Sshhh... I'm hiding from fate.
"You have come too far, learned too much, sheltered loss when it had nowhere to go. To say you haven't changed is an insult to your journey."
Nothing breaks me quicker than kindness.
Teach me to feel again.
"Asked the wind to stay a while, it had secrets to tell me. It had been to places far and wide, and touched my lovers lips."
My ribs encompass all the people who fell out of my heart.
She is an exquisite bouquet of tragedies that never withers.
"Dearest, your abyss is tie-dyed pink."
Let's write bad poetry together until the words hold meaning.
"Sláinte, to all the times you cried alone in shadowed gloom and the music hugged your soul."
"I suppose when you said, ""send nudes"". You weren't expecting a 100 page manifesto of my bare emotional turmoil."
We were not created to be stagnant.
Mood: Bouts of euphoria and lengthened periods of melancholy.
"Dearest, you are not your fears. You are the tiny voice of courage that overcomes them."
I am full of darkness but somehow not devoid of light.
"You're not scared because you can't love again, you're scared because you have forgotten how to accept love."
We're going to write this pain out together.
Come hide with me in solitude and fall in love with the quiet heartbeat of existence.
Find someone who looks into the silent screams in your eyes and isn't afraid.
The raging thunder and pelting orgasm of the clouds.
"Ate all the words synonymous to light, and still couldn't cry the darkness out of my eyes."
"Poetry straightens the ruffles in my mind, soothes my spirit and calms my fears. It reminds me to love again."
Someone you love or the one who teaches you to love yourself?
"I despise you in so many ways, I almost love you."
The sad reality of an expiration date on forever.
Ever striptease for someone until the walls around you crashed and you were nothing but bare-naked soul?
"Some people are awkward silences, and some are shy smiles exchanged between first kisses."
"I love the way you arrive unannounced in my mind, hushing apocalypses with just the memory of your smile."
Touch me as intimately as the wind.
"She always tastes like melancholic screams in the ether, pressed chrysanthemums forgotten in his favourite book and hushed insanity."
Outlined my lips with chaos just to kiss your storm.
We're just two souls comfortable in each other's darkness.
Mood:
Hating everything lovingly.
"Touch the nothingness softly, let it dance between your fingers."
How many deaths do you carry in your heart? How many heartbreaks are you hiding behind your smile?
There is no refuge from a mind that haunts itself.
"Dearest, what is love?"
Blessed with a lifelong curse.
Dance with me while the ocean's souls sing a dirge to our dying love.
"I hoard space, oblivion, voids and abysses; give me all your nothings!"
These rotting leaves look like all the times you said I love you and didn't mean it.
"If I give you all of me, you will still have nothing."
I wrote you a poem then tore it into a hundred pieces in my mind.
In a parallel universe your moans are the sound the storms make.
"Dearest, pain is deaf."
Bite the words out of my tongue.
*Falls in love with your shitty personality*
Let's fall in love like it won't eventually become our death.
"Hi, the woods smell of lost memories and I was hoping you'd come along to reminisce."
I have embraced my insanity with love because it is the only part of me that no one has tampered with overzealous control and angst.
"Here's my crushed heart in a pepper shaker. Sprinkle me on all your wounds, love."
"God this malevolent ache from my past. This sad, sad child, living in my mind who won't stop mocking my shadowed existence."
This is my hell but you're welcome to stay.
Don't lose your sanity for blurred memories of pleasure.
Delete the incompleteness.
Sext: inhale the darkness and breathe it into my mouth.
I let him believe he corrupted me.
"Show me your quiet darkness, your silent hunger."
Fill in the void with dark matter.
All the noise resides in the light.
I don't know what love looks like so I keep falling for the wrong kind.
"*Wakes you up just to whisper, 'I'm dying inside'."
*Cheats on you with your other personality.
Reading love letters from your exes is the tenth level of hell.
A thousand deaths cocooned in the smile that doesn't reach her eyes.
She is an anthology of nightmarish soul clichés.
Nostalgia smells different every time.
Slice the sadness and feed me the pain in small poetic morsels.
What mysteries are trying to unravel you?
"Dearest, pain is the anchor between the living and the dead."
"Some people bottle up their hurt, you let it shine in your eyes with love."
"Sometimes you're the twinkle in my eye, sometimes you're the tear that rolls out of it."
"I tried on melancholy and it suits me well, I cannot take it off."
Survived eternity just to watch the wind go to sleep.
Sext: Let's watch parts of the sky drown in the ocean again.
"We fight endless wars in the shadows, trying to conquer the demons in our minds. No one ever wins."
"Transcends into your insanity, stays."
Each memory has its own emotion.
"Somewhere in the universe,  the moment our lips touched for the first time repeats itself on a loop."
Your crazy is my safe space.
An obscure generator sadly sputters somewhere deep in my heart.
Abandoned in the space between a yes and a no.
"Destroyed so beautifully, you beg the storm to ruin you again."
How long have you walked around with a black hole in your heart?
