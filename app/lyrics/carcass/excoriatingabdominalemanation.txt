Vilely I defile, chastise, humiliate
Writhing, agonised as I violate to impregnate
With lathering soaps and suds I slowly emenize
Innards gurgulate as they're sickly baptized...

Your rectum I will flood
With bleach, detergents and suds...

Rupturing your gall-blader
Liver bleached and soaked
Lungs now flooded
With bicarbonates and boiling soap
Orifices pumped and plugged
Rectal membrane split
Evaporating your bowels
Anal muscle rips...

I grope in the grime, the evaporating motions slush
Pulverising your gut, in my rubber boots and gloves
Your nates purple and raw, brillo pads scour and cleanse
Sticking plasters on abrased organs, to try and make amends...

...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase....

Your innards I corrode
This process you will loathe
Your innards I evacuate
With my crude methods of hate

Anal track acidically removed
Along with rotten entrails and stools
Disembowelling in my rage
in your colostomy you suffocate

...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase....

Sadistically sodomizing with my instruments of grime
Force-feeding it down your throat if I find the time
Vaseline and talc soothe the gored ano-obliteration
Sardonically I gloat on your rectal dislocation

Seething with carnage lust
As the plastic tubing in enthrust...

Rupturing your gall-blader
Liver bleached and soaked
Lungs now flooded
With bicarbonates and boiling soap
Orifices pumped and plugged
Rectal membrane split
Evaporating your bowels
Anal muscle rips...

The anus sucked inside out, my victim now distraught
Rectal tissue I scald, as I boil the inner core
The orifice now clean - sanitised, red and raw
Brutally impaling your rectum, this process I adore....
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase....

Your innards I corrode
This process you will loathe
Your innards I evacuate
With my crude methods of hate
Anal track acidically removed
Along with rotten entrails and stools
Disembowelling in my rage
in your colostomy you suffocate
