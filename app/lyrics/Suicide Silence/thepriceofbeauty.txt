Holding you down by your throat
Just enough to keep your
fucking mouth shut
Can't stand to hear you scream god
Because he's not fucking here bitch

And how does it feel now?

Don't worry you're not
another rape victim
It's just me destroying
your beauty 

And how does it feel now? 

That I'm ripping out
All of the fake pieces
in your face 

And what will you do now
Once all of your beautiful skin
Is in my pockets? 

What cosmetic will fix this mess 
Fix this mess 
That is now your face?

Was this all worth it?
For your fake fucking beauty 

The price of beauty was more
than you thought 
How does it feel now? 
The price 
Was more than you thought
