Torsos hang from their own intestines
Raped of all bodily extensions,
Stumps wreathing in sludge like infection
Suffering through a Rancid amputation
A pulsating artery accompanied by some veins,
Slit with no restraint
Sacs of pus develop
My muscles tighten as I feel the rush

I look at your body starting to gush
I slice through the limb, a human dissection
Portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth
Starting to chew your now bleeding stump
I will swallow your pus
Your own rectal slime I'll force you to drink
Vessels explode as needles injected

Uncontrollable, my brain tormented
Slit from head to toe, die through the torture
Disease engulfs you, internal rot
Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot
Ripping through flesh is what I do best
Tear off an arm, amputated neck
Eyes removed, cranium smashed
Decomposing remains, severed in half

Dying slowly never to rest,
Nerves are quivering as I rip

Removal of life on the blade of my knife
Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone
Feel my hell, I feed on fright
Rape the limbless cadaver
