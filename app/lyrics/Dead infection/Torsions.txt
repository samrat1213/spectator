Seized in claws of unmerciful torsions you're shocked
Look around, culture spattered by stomach's bile
Lost souls are going for a walk to a land of ugliness
God is absent, his salvation is powerless

Look at yourself, you are in vomits, it's beautiful view
Yellow mixture on your mouth embellishes you
Dignity, appearance are full of sympathy
It's a fragment of your life, and of your pride

Torsions-secret of life
Vomits-secret of pride
Your organism repeats regurgitation
Organs of digestion excrete bad smell

In the bloody mood identity dies
Torsions are increasing, the last remains of vomitsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
