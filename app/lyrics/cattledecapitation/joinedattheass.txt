Freak of unthinkable proportions
Perfect candidate for abortion
Future double-suicide from shotgun blast
Rectally twins-and joined at the ass
Some things deserve to die
Severed siblings with a surgical knife
Buildup of waste at articulation
Installed colostomy for shit irrigation
Purchased for science and mutant research
Human guinea pig
Waste not, want not
How can there be a god
That brings atrocities to its creation
Born into hell-mandatory torment
Biologically malformed, existance is futile
We bring disease
And physiological agony
Nobody ever said that life was easy
