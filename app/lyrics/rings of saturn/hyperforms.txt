Civilization now staring at the face of calamity
We will etch our presence into your bones

Ultra terrestrials flooding the sky
Inferior minds can no longer comprehend
The reality, the vision of the Hyperforms has been revealed
Perspective will never be the same

All left of life now in the presence of the Gods
This species is doomed, there is no hope for the future
This species is doomed, there is no hope for the...

Mankind has failed for the last time
Years of negligence accountable for it's demise
The chance to wake up, now is lost forever
Forever

Undeserving creatures scramble to protect their lives from us now
No way to fight all the pain, teeth grinding away
We've made our efforts to condone
The blueprint of the human body manipulated to suffer

Staring at the heavens for hope, only to see their final fate
Hysterical cries are heard as the hole of eternal darkness draws near

Ultra terrestrials flooding the sky
Inferior minds can no longer comprehend
The reality, the vision of the Hyperforms has been revealed
Perspective will never be the same

There is no escape from extinction
Our universe now a cosmic tundra
A cold wasteland remains, void of all fucking life
Void of all life
