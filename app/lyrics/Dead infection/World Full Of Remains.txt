Full moon over world full of remains
There are no people, desert everywhere

Darkness rules, life is gone
Earth full of DEAD INFECTION
Eyes of terror are burning with hate
Ripped minds, pain and suffering

The last chance of life doesn't exist
The human remains are eaten by rats

All earth is changing into dead remains
Movements and mind are ceasedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
