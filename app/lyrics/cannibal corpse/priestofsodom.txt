The blackened city calls out
Enter the temple of sin
You must enter the temple of sin
Contorted sinners beckon
Join our twisted rites
You must join our twisted rites
The priests eyes gleam
Blood on their scepters of flesh
There is blood on their scepters of flesh
The nubile virgin bows
Await the piercing thrust
She awaits the piercing thrust
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Praise the gods of sin
Her walls are burning
Grinding the staff of the priest
Sluts grinding the staff of the priests
The congregation
Revel in sins of the flesh
They revel in sins of the flesh
Whores from the temple
Serving shamanic desire
They are serving shamanic desire
Deviant bodies writhing
Slick with the fluids of lust
They are slick with the fluids of lust
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure
Statues of demons glisten with sweat
The orgy intensifies, violence begins
Flagellate sluts with serpentine whips
They raise their blades to throats of their men
Climax approaches and the blood will spill
Sexual sacrifice, mutilation and death
Murder
Priests of Sodom
Priests of Sodom
Priests of Sodom
Priests, of, Sodom!

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure
