The honeymoon's over and the love's gone sour
Her nagging has got you down
But you picked the wrong way to deal with it
You chose to slap her around
When you exchanged your wedding vows
Nobody said, "You may now fist the bride"
Now that the little woman went and got her gun
The love ain't all that died

Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Began for her when the bullets hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fist

When she took your hand in marriage
It didn't mean right across the face
Small woman, big man, it takes a lot of guts
You're just a pussy in the first place
But now that your wedding chamber's
The one the bullet's in
Brave man, look at you, not so tough
When the hammer's cockin'
Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Began for her when the bullets hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fist

The little woman had all the shit that she could take
Her intuition said, "Lock and load"
He-man, what's your plan to get out of this
She's gonna fill your ass with bullet holes
Guess who's bigger when she's squeezing the trigger
I got news, it isn't you
When they carry your body out over the threshold
You'll wish you never said, "I do"

Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Began for her when the bullets hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fistEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
