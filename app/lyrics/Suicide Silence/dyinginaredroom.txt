Cold hazel eyes
Those longing glares
A subtle change of pace
A vibrancy in the air
I'll be the breeze
That cools the heat

I'm dying through life
I'm living through death
I'm dying through life
I'm living through death
I'm dying

Don't see past the shoes I wear on my feet
To see the humility in that
I couldn't help the laughter
The porcelain shatters
I'll be the breeze
That cools your heat

I'm dying through life
I'm living through death
I'm dying through life
I'm living through death
I'm dying

I'll be your scapegoat
Scapegoat

I'm dying through life
I'm living through death
I'm dying

Dying
I'm dying
I'm dying
