What a perverse colony you all have become. Insolent scum, ungrateful of the life we have given you. We are the Alpha, we are the Omega, we are here to eviscerate all. A fucking disgrace to your maker. A celestial presence, not seen by imperfect scum.
Bare witness to the incomprehensible, skies are stained black with the ashes of billions. Landscapes are covered with the remains of charred hominids. The latest extinct precursor of man.
We have wiped the globe clean of every civilization since the dawn of time. We are virtually unstoppable.

Save the world, kill yourself, or die by our hand. 
Delusional minds believe that you have a privileged position in the universe.
