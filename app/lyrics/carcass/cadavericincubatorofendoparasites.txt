The inset of rigor mortis, ulcerous corruption and decay
Saponified fats lather as soap as you slowly eat yourself away...

Organs savaged by rotten enzymes, rennin and rancorous cysts
A festering abcess immersed in ravenous autolysis...

Breaking down of dead tissue fuels methane gases
A smouldering human compost-heap of self-digesting haemorrhage...
emulsifying carnage, your purpulent torso is mummified
A mortified, marbled feast for drooling parasites...

Your lungs consumed in gore, slime and worm encrusted
Brittle testes eroded in hot, corrosive succus
Adhering to the bone, tissue necrosis a maggot feast
A cadaveric crematorium, gaseos spumescence leaks...

Your rump sustaining hostile organisms
- Mould, eggs and larvae
Peptonized spleen, liver and kidneys
- A wasting, degenerate slime
Septicemic mutation
- Of rancid meat and writhing life
Psychedelic, pustular platter of gunge
- Come and take a bite...

Dormant fungoid growths
On the smarting human host
Come bathe, cleanse and wash
With livor mortis and dry rot...

...Lice and ticks...

Flesh matted with hatching spawn
Endo-parasites incubate in the warmth
Mortician's implements to tap and bleed
The swarming insects seed...

...Lice and ticks...expel bloody sick...

Leathery skin bubbles as blue-bottles hatch
Maggot infestation turns the rotting corpse black...

Slushy bowels move as our friends squirm
Flatulent belches-dry, festered and warm...
