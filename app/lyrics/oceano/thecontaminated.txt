As migraines become overwhelming, perception is rendered contorted.
Mentally you've grown unstable,
Devoid of human emotion.
Something has burrowed into your psyche, forcing you to lose touch with your own self.
A transformation is apparent,
You're becoming what was once unimaginable.

ALIVE BUT DECEASED,
Revived so long as life is drained completely.
Alive but deceased.

What remains is a symbiotic co-existence interdependent upon the blood and the flesh.

Recognizing the illness which threatens your body, you attempt to repress a horrid envisionment; that of your ill-fate, and the torment you'll face.

For sustenance of what dwells within, you are beckoned to satisfy its internal urge to feed,
Coerced to murder if necessary,
Possessed to consume decaying organisms that lie beneath.

Instantly vomiting upon devourment.

This appalling display of demoralization brings forth insight to your disease,
Damned forever to scavenge this land.
Further transforming into a monster that's alive but deceased,
Revived so long as life is drained completely.

As one of the infected, accept the fact that you're damned.
