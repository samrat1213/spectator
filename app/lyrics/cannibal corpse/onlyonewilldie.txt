A violent conflict between two foes
At close quarters pound and slash
The blood will flow, barbaric melee, a hateful duel
Shared abhorrence gives the conflict

Fuel
Add to the fire
Lies
Resentment built
For years
Now
It's time to end this fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

The cracking bones and shattered teeth
Wounds are swelling, lacerations running deep
Losing blood but still we fight
Both resolved to end the other's life

The only answer
Hate
Can only end with death
Now
It's time to end this fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

Both of us are killers, both are evil men
Unforgiving murderers today may kill again

Both of us will throttle strangling with rage
Both consumed by madness, revenge has us enslaved
Both are badly wounded and struggle to survive
Both are fighting to the death but only one will die

Die

Both of us will bludgeon, both of us will pound
Facial bones will splinter soon, the blood will drench the ground
Both are rending flesh, both are gouging eyes
Escalating violence, the brawl intestifies

Both of us will throttle strangling with rage
Both consumed by madness, revenge has us enslaved
Both are badly wounded and struggle to survive
Both are fighting to the death but only one will die

Die

Kill
The only answer
Hate
Can only end with death
Now
It's time to end this fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die
