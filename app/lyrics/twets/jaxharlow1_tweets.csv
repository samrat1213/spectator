a liar a thief and a bully walk into a bar
how gently i would pull the trigger
prayer as distraction
stalemate
need a get out of jail free card
i’m out of moves
i want to be at home in my own head
treat me like shit and i’m out
how blind i’ve been
"cry, nap, eat, repeat"
hiding my blood from the knife
how deep the sickness goes
bored with hating myself
cue the laugh track
word dissection
things could be worse
tuning in and out
all i need is the quiet
carpet full of broken glass
life between storms
you smell of autumn
me rn
i dreamt you were dead
decrescendo
there were no survivors
playing with pain
you were never without artifice
some small weakness
i miss your confessions
the rain is coming but the bottle is full
don’t hate me for loving the monster i made you
nothing left but a slow decay
mood
you’re not wrong
diminishing returns
white noise
a girl could get used to this
my blood is thick with you
today i am the abyss
semi-sentient
still felt good though
the knife wasn’t sharp enough
pruning the branches
please come back
here for the feelings
art is obsession with the human heart
i forgot what mania is like
can you feel me breathe
that 2 a.m. energy
"careful, i will fold your words into the shape i want"
god your turn takes forever
more dopamine please
skin me alive
the ship goes down with the captain
one more trip to oblivion
some hearts won’t be avenged
a legend or a myth
the murder in your melody
dying in my down time
be my eyes i’ll be your teeth
a wavelength all my own
edging the precipice
it’s easy to see if you back up enough
eyes like baubles in the moonlight
i found myself at the bottom of the lake
pleasure centers
"hate to love you, love to hate you"
savor the rage
reveling in your hypocrisy
just shut your eyes then
i relate to the villain far too often
i only post here when i’m broken
nothing about today is sexy
someone is partying too hard or not hard enough
only you can exonerate me
the sun warms the coldness you left
the bottle calls
the knots in my heart
my insanity knows bounds
a forgotten moon
someone else’s words
dancing the distance
let the breeze carry you away
love me on friday crush me on sunday
tomorrow i will be different
the thing about you is nothing
but i’m unarmed
the fuck’s a fleet
read my mind
more fragile than you look
attaining self-efficacy
the secrets in those tresses
how she chases the light
a liar a thief and a bully walk into a bar
how gently i would pull the trigger
prayer as distraction
stalemate
need a get out of jail free card

the thing about you is nothing
but i’m unarmed
the fuck’s a fleet
read my mind
more fragile than you look
attaining self-efficacy
the secrets in those tresses
how she chases the light
the sum of my loss
faceless
extinction method
fire dying out
all the things not meant for me
say one thing true
my howling is silent
somewhere beyond the sea
the dangers in the depths
i don’t want beauty i want the beast
the rain in your mouth
i wonder if we’d feel better if we weren’t always trying to feel better
your shadow a sunset
early morning consumerism
an empty notebook
replying to silence
*blocks self*
why haven’t you blocked me yet?
all over the place and no map
dying all of the time
"all i breathe is smoke, all i see is fire"
the solution’s become a problem
if i could only weep this feeling gone
"how elastic, these emotions"
always falling
the way it burns
desperation
show me something new
the morning breaks it all
more more
not you
born into nothing
breaking by being
the stench of it all
all that’s left is shame
the scars will always be there
swallowing the sun
so easy to fall back in
"alive and sober, even"
the rain in everything
familiar neural pathways
sleeping where my heart is
water on water
where’ve i been all my life
into the horizon
heartstrong
coming back to myself
I live in other worlds
you wind the stars round your little finger
too much too late
nostalgia is a liar
hopeless daydream
breathe me in
forehead kisses
uninspired
better habits
the clouds between us
how you know you’re alive
kill the past
twin miseries
everyone wants a miracle
if you don’t read i don’t want you
we have nothing in common but this moment
wash off the world
your heart is a lake and i’m drowning
just get up and go chase your dreams
feeling insatiable
give me the sun
a lingering ache
this moment
so long and thanks for all the trauma
the rain took your place
reciprocal effort
stop torturing yourself
garden variety woe
it’s ok not to know
respect the lesson
kill the wolf little red
the meaning of nothing
find it within you
“Don’t feel sorry for yourself. Only assholes do that.” -Haruki Murakami
at least there’s the sky
the woods will renew me
leave the corpse behind
teasing the wound
dark beneath the surface
prolonging the inevitable
writer's block
wake up and smell the trees
sing a song of silence
he shelters me through my own storms
the truth within the lie
the rhythm of you
i thought you meant i could stay
shadows of yesterday
ready to stop killing myself over you
i don’t fall i sink
all out of pretty words
a head start on tomorrow
pinky promise with my fingers crossed
just another mindfuck
denouement
so predictably human
every second you’re alive is progress
sometimes i forget who you are
feasting on famine
i know what it says about me but what does it say about you
all the actors are on strike
"dropping words in the bucket but it won’t fill it up, ever"
to escape
you hold the knife but you are the knife
i need new armor for this
paint my world by arbitrary numbers
always looking for something to cry about
just a tiny taste of oblivion
stage fright
distraction to distraction
surprised i am still here
i’m constructing my own nightmare
got my tongue back but now it’s broken
i won't hide anymore
just coincidence
i apologize for all the blood i’m spilling on your floor
within a broader context
the good thing is you’re magic
recalibrating
equal amounts of relief and agony
"a terrible affliction, love"
step outside and come undone
silence as a sign
secrets &amp; stories
my words are just air
gone in the night
sing me a lullaby
words start to lose their meaning
if i had the right tools i would fix it for you
all i know is you get me high
out of the corner of my eye
wrap yourself in the clouds
first you must come up for air
Portishead - Roads -   via @YouTube
Portishead - Glory Box (HD Version)   via @YouTube
the angst without the pain
sometimes i just need to know you’re there
always looking over my shoulder
do you visit my grave
can’t write my way out of this longing
if i could starve it all away
wish i could be your light
circling the stars
when you find your way you'll know it
crash into the sun
rerouting to happiness
lost in your forest
surprise me with your teeth
cleansing my palate for a new blood
everyday flame
how you’ll love again
nestled in the arms of your poem
no one’s over anything
ripples of existence
longing for somewhere to be
your words or mine
a sunrise so far
this thought loop is tedious
aesthetic: dead and gone
strength comes in waves
ashes ashes we all fall down
subject to change
soft into the night
let’s mingle words
thought i saw a ghost
talking to walls
dark in this cave
i got you a void
who even knows
lightning striking twice in the same spot
a patchwork of insanity
the beast i am
seeing connections where there are none
all about the red herring
poetry can be dangerous
swallowed the gasoline now where’s the match
no one can save you from yourself
your jagged breaths
painted angel
i eat the thorns off every rose bush
a love only we can understand
you gave me wings
i need you near even when you’re not
hearts that have burned black and blue
what do you say to an apocalypse
flowers in the pavement
there will always be a hollow part of me
you don’t know where my mind’s been
my mind is tired of turning you over
kaleidoscopic memories
unspoken conversation
retraining my brain
the lower i get the higher i feel
somewhere in the dreamscape
does this loss feel good
sliced myself on your smile
so it’s come to this
lost days
playing with my own feelings
not so sure anymore
chaos as love language
everything is blue
delusions are my specialty
petals under my pillow
sleepless and psychotic
night sky in your eyes
double shot of you
a field of forget me nots
sunsick
dream you back to life
read me again
flower tongue
killing me one breath at a time
but do you need to
words are a door starve me some more
I love the sun but the moon knows me better
my therapist knows your name
my head is broken
i think i like you
fold me over
wake up my dear
saw you with one eye closed
my vision of you is a lie
got me inside out
what’s the point
a graveyard of muses
theoretically
let me vandalize you
sober as fuck
oh i’m already following you
love like a bomb
forced niceties
stop chasing the pain
longing for a new dawn
away from everyone and everything
abducted heart
i need a new soul
guess the ending
just a pothole
these are the words we wear
all red lights
like you’re not obsessed
more eyeliner
you are a silhouette in the distance
butterflies in my brain
I can grin but not bear it
barbed wire heart
upbeat blues
checking for my pulse
branches drooping with the rain
first come first dead
healing is not linear
if there is a god why am i here
I wanna be an angel
savoring the dregs
healed by a dream
when you can’t think of the word
riddle with no answer
the stranger the better
soul tired
hungry for less
because i felt less alone
obsessive compulsive
destructive coping mechanisms
I’m trying
all green lights
can we up the uppers
my window to the world
sunglasses just to see your face
beauty in the wait
don’t pick the flowers
talk yourself into something good
making it rain
bitten lips
not everyone deserves your story
round and round we go
the world in your hands
this moment forever
even in the high seas
and here we are now
musing at midnight
years of you
i love you in all the languages
i’m amazed i can still feel at all
words beget words
find love in yourself
can’t wait to wake up and realize this was all a dream
he lets me be
haunting the songs
more death ideas
can i just be in the background
i want to be the first breath
maybe you’ll be the one to understand
alone in black and white
what am i looking for
to hate the words
my own enemy again
how to argue with silence
"plausible, if not probable"
a world reimagined
revision
that part of me is dead
story full of holes
through the layers
if you can see this i’m sorry
can i see through your eyes
got enough demons
who i didn’t mean to be
your savior is not mine
the song that ruined it all
let the sun be the guide
recumbent aspirations
disparity between worlds
sometimes the greatest gift is letting go
remove ego from the equation
fill yourself up first
beautiful perspective
drape my eyes in gauzy white
it hurt but now it’s gone
another day in the sun
another night another nothing
dead not gone
where is my campfire
“a truce with life” -daphne merkin
we all want something whole
can i just imagine you
keep stabbing myself with silence
it's the mystique that's all it is
shortcut to feeling
go to sleep to wake up new
a reflection not so pretty
*wounds
fuck
you wanted me to disappear but here i am
rewind but do not reset
how many lives have you touched and how gently
all these lives reborn
the wind blows but i am on fire
the past is just a story right
every day a roller coaster
a conversation through music
the mistakes of yesterday
half of life a fantasy
i hope you’re better now
replaying the whole thing and i’m done
i needed to see that
does it still hurt?
just no
remember all the cruelty
tell me not to
just because i’m looking
wanting what’s bad for me
where did all the poets go
we’ve got the rest of our lives
sometimes it’s just a song
put your heart on the line
slow dancing in the corner
michael stipe kinda fire
i used to be that kind of girl
maybe i’ll just sit here until you open
who is calling your name
when your heart’s all wrong
taking back the music
withholding judgment
i balk at the hours
what am I moving toward if not death
numb heart
writing in coffee shops
"sipping on rainbows, chewing on dreams"
"softer, softest"
a relief to disappear
i want to write something that’ll make you cry
can i start over
i might be a bot
dividing the memories
i’m sick of my bullshit
it doesn’t really matter anymore
the people you love are all there
a certain grace is necessary
the idea is always better in my head
make inertia work for you
maybe you were there somehow
the sun has marked me as her own
i can be nowhere
as long as you are under the sun somewhere
i’m sinking beneath the waves
the rain has come
like walking through hot cotton
as if cupid’s arrow got you through the brain
it’s starting to make sense
and now i will find my own library
dreams are just a little bit different now
free from my own thoughts
to put the sun to bed
saving a little today for tomorrow
it is time to dig deeper
the ache means you’re healing
he loves to watch me bloom
the mind wants to believe itself
the ghost beckons me
i’ve known the nothing intimately
i am not free
the shadows shift again
shame curls up around me like black ribbons to tie my limbs
“the raw nerve of pain that your life has become” -daphne merkin
"i fell for it, sunshine in a smile"
i need you to be a window
I miss the library
the sky has never disapproved
"don’t tune out, feel it"
the inevitable crash
good living through chemicals
the tweet that puts you on edge
god bless mania
dream me someplace new
pre-anxiety anxiety
learning to trust myself
cut the strings and dance on your own
just to get away
a place where no one knows my name
which part of you is not aligned
always on the way to somewhere else
living up to the morning’s promise
small moments that shine
I am digging the soil to make new wombs
why you never came back
rising and falling with each breath
if it’s so simple why’s it so hard?
meet you in the dreamscape
a pain i can taste
holding on for someone else
how you make the moments count
there’s no such thing as “sanity”
reimagining the future
rows of books &amp; vases of flowers
all the little acts of love
i am learning how to just be
"just you, me, and the sky"
the sweetness of your love renews me
don’t apologize for how you kept your peace
we are all storm chasers
the words won’t wait
a heart for every shadow
a dawn so fierce the darkness cowers
night and night again
i come undone for you
I belong to the morning
bittersweet words all for you
commend yourself for being real
fortified with dreams and tattoos
inhale the beauty exhale the truth
bruises from your love
forever in the fetal position
you could never douse the flame
"try to stop us, we keep on climbing"
a staircase with infinite steps
a headache from overthinking
in the dark we strive toward light
"was it a lie, when they said, things get better?"
a heat beyond hell
circles in my mind
lean into the light
dark in here again
10 positive thoughts
friends see the whole picture
how quickly it subsides
love the hurt the way you loved them
"childhood is an accumulation of scars, adulthood is being given a mirror"
like you never left
waiting to be shaken
woke up amongst the green
How many nights have I spent sleepless in this place?
I can hear every word
hometown angst
beauty in the breaking
how many poems are about the struggle of writing poems
bits of poetry floating down the river
a ransom for your smile
whisper to me &amp; i’ll put your secrets in a jar to hide under my bed and glow when it’s too dark to breathe
i couldn’t leave if i wanted to
out of proportion as always
i wonder if she still plants flowers there
close the door shut off the lights
this is not in fact the end of the world
regret beyond redemption
i eat hearts but you flew away too fast
accidental broken heart
something’s trying to crawl their way in
i’m playing a game called let’s never get out of bed.
i live in the lulls
you’ll find me where the dead men roam
if I let go of you that will be the end of me
these hours have wings
a quiet coup
just open up &amp; let me in
hardly any blood
leave you better than i found you
i’ll be a kind parasite
wanna sync my heart with your pulse
dip your toe in today &amp; see how it feels
life’s not all or nothing
thoughts that suddenly tilt
i can’t cry but i need to
waiting for the night to fall like a curtain over this day
drink up fermented love
writing you a poem with a knife between my teeth
you wanna know what’s not useful for depression—being told to walk it off
vampires round these parts
spiderwebs for eyelashes
we are all dying
just call me the dream crusher
i am tuning in to your station
be more
afraid to let today in
fallen into your mystery
sometimes i feel like i breathe wrong
the fizzle after the pop
i’ll still love you in the morning
running fast going nowhere
come to me sweet tomorrow
a gathering for the restless at heart
fallen but not defeated
"nostalgic for a lake &amp; ice cream &amp; sunburns, the long hot days never ending"
to close my eyes and be at peace
her teeth are sharp but her heart sharper
meet me by the carousel
sinking in the deep blue
stay up a bit later to love a little longer
my book has your name all over it
just think of the opportunities
it’s getting easier not to care
there’s enough sky for everyone
"always in the wings, this play, this lifetime"
back to dying
wanna build a cathedral for your heart
unravel in the sweetest of ways
apathy is just exhaustion trying to look cool
"i’ve been here before, i know how to make it back"
how do i know if i am me
i wish i were a dandelion scattered on the wind
time is beginning to stretch
the sun is inviting me home
"too melancholy to frolic, too tired to rage"
we'll make it through this apart
sunlight bouncing off the prison bars
writing is giving birth every single day--the pain and the pride
when all you've got left are playlists &amp; memories
slip into morning like a yellow sundress
wake up it’s time to dance
you haunt my dreams
The heart is a reckless organ.
do you have any happiness to spare
your brain and my heart
love will lead you out of the labyrinth
why don’t you let me write you
let the moonlight have you
maybe today was the day
rock &amp; roll at the garden party
write until it makes sense
feeling like you’re dying is totally normal &amp; healthy
"the birds are usually right, though"
even the ones who seem together are falling apart
the moon only has eyes for you
i saved some dawn for you
don’t i know you from that dream
such a sweet serenade
finding a new way of existing
there you go creating a world again
I will carry you into forever
there is only now suspended in time
close your eyes and exist with me
measuring the day by miles
nothing you thought was real exists
baby steps into the light
the story is all mine
the dream of you is gone   face lost to time
this shadow i am
all the ways i want to change
i connect the dots wrong
dig deeper to heal
when night swallows day
death by self-reflection
I want to wrap words up like roses and leave them at your front door
words stuck in my throat
between the moon and you
a trail of rose petals leading you home
Go into the world and just be.
the story you live in
the universe in all things
the birds are calling me to dance
"the morning air, alive with hope"
time to starve away tomorrow
I taught him to whisper and he taught me to scream
find me among the hours
the day slipped away &amp; so did i
the walls are coming down &amp; i am cold
"it was as if he hadn’t existed until the moment he saw her; that was when everything came into sharp focus— his imaginary life before and his real life, which was just about to begin"
drop your secrets in the river &amp; watch the current carry them away
i’m ready to fly again
let the minutes slow to seconds &amp; take your time with the night
chewing on your pen with dreamy eyes and a wild heart
i will wade in the sea of the infinite &amp; gaze into the eyes of the sky
the ratio of love to trust is 1:1
&amp; the clouds keep kissing me
&amp; you were a wild thing that i wanted to catch &amp; put in a jar &amp; take home to show mother
"just before the rush of children's songs &amp; sticky-cheek kisses &amp; mermaid drawings &amp; fistfuls of dandelions, you remember this is what you did it all for &amp; breathe &amp; breathe again"
&amp; summer comes down like a blanket
the trees whispered of lovely things like pale mist &amp; the scent of morning &amp; what it's like to be part of the sky
like a tree my heart grows layers for everyone i've ever loved
tell me your story and i'll tell you mine
overall this breakdown has been a riot
You can't help me through this. You ARE this.
it's not hard to articulate what went wrong--it was everything &amp; all at once
kerosene soaked dreams
are you wondering what's behind all this madness brain &amp; heart at war   #haikuchallenge #haiku #behind
&amp; maybe you recognize me from the birth of life or death's funeral or maybe somewhere inbetween
your absence like a crack in my heart
it may be broken but it's a crown nonetheless
&amp; there is also death in wonderland &amp; it snows on the railroad tracks &amp; no one is really sure whether life is fiction or fact
"phantom behind the screen let me feel you, bleed you, give you a new name, for all good delusions  deserve the same"
when your world turns upside down but you just keep goin
the confirmation of my madness
Not all delusions are bad.
mirroring you mirroring me
take to the wilderness &amp; the trees will be your castle &amp; the wolves your brethren; listen to the stars sing &amp; give thanks to the mud &amp; mire
"delicate disorder  child of beauty and blood silken gown at dusk  light the candle, stoke the fire  read the risk in her eyes  miracle sunrise"
my doppelganger likes to throw knives she dances on the carousel not quite dead not quite alive  my doppelganger  likes a little blood she drinks it to slake her thirst and digs a grave when she's done  #fromoneline #vss365 #doppelganger
the rain ushers me back to sleep
I need a map home
to read the cracks in the concrete &amp; wear the transparent dress &amp; one day disappear into the mess of humanity on the edge of a broken dream
a brainstorm in a bottle of the rough stuff &amp; shake me until something good comes out
been locked inside a cage my whole life only to realize words are the key to the sea the sky &amp; the world beyond
"do you see me offering my hand? trying to haul you off that ledge and onto safer land. don’t disappear again, don’t hide yourself away. stand your ground and speak my friend, say what you need to say.  #fromoneline 47"
forgive me the abandoned poems  paper &amp; ink my children  half-formed  their mother too  word-wasted to  nurse
swimming  into the deep no water wings no life jacket  only the strength  of my two arms i navigate this life and when i grow weary  i float
her thin pink ribbon she wore to the gathering dirty on the ground  #haiku #haikuchallenge #poetry #thin
i'd love to help  you but it's  n o  a c c e s s  beyond this point.   #poetryin13 #access #writingcommunity
my love is distortion a glitch in the system a rip in the seam a child who won't obey  except for you
the book invites you in &amp; makes you a hot cup of tea &amp; tells you pretty lies &amp; holds you 'til it's safe to go back into the world again
this poem has been carefully carved with a scalpel &amp; blood drips down the syllables &amp; the heart still beats for you
in the morning as we orbit the crystal sun carried by an invisible force i reflect on the question of god
coffee will save me
you are always leaving one way or another
it’s better to be empty
you are the pages torn out of my notebook
you gotta keep shuffling until you get the right hand  #10wordjournal #3lines #shuffle
absence is something i've grown used to
they were on fire children playing  like a smoking winchester sheets on the bed like ghosts escaping the grave this is to say that  death was in the air
beyond the looking glass  clouds are red and fairies’ wings are clipped they fall off cliffs  their tiny needle voices  following them down rain tastes  like blackberries and your mother is alive she spins the top  and you watch it whir until it tips over
something about lines makes me want to cross them
i sneak little sips of you  all day long
even in the shadows you still shine
blood on a saturday flowers in the basement screaming behind the couch a baby’s gleaming teeth screaming at the weeds nurse’s new shoes blooming fruit on dirty sheets smoke in the kitchen  the last book the last line   #poetry #poem #wrongcombos
she spoke a strange language    in which the gaps    meant as much as the words
keep feeding your dreams
my skin scars in places that've never been touched
oh how we're all broken
Crisis all the time I am inconsolable Only I can mend  #haikuchallenge #crisis @baffled
it's hard to be there for someone who isn't really there
i dreamed i was the past
why sleep when  there is so much  living to do
having you is losing you    over   and     over
life is a balance between caution and confidence
the puzzle is incomplete without me    but I just don’t fit       anymore
Cracked my head open on Saturday morning; my will comes spilling out.
Roulette wheel Unreality Go back to sleep  And spin again
my clock has no hands It blinks at me accusingly digital minutes evaporate with every glimpse  time disappears  leaving me breathless #poetry #poem #vss365
don’t forget curtain call
the blinding glare   of the setting sun      in my rear view mirror
a hail mary pass invitation to chaos and i accepted  #poem #poetry #haiku #haikuchallenge
"you say we need to talk. whatever about? i've left you, you're leaving me-- now we're just calling back and forth, faded voices   in the night.  #poem #poetry #poetrycommunity"
"End on an image, that's what they say. A darkened classroom.  A trampled program.   Someone's lost keys. End on an image, that's what they say.  A bittersweet smile    Hangs on your lips,     That last goodbye."
"Sitting cross legged    In the scratchy grass, I looked up the women    Singing and dancing For cues on how to shine    In this world. Those were the days     I still believed In the sun."
My history is tired of the mining.     No more inspiration glimmers there.
Caffeine crackling beneath my skin.
May the mistakes of yesterday find solutions in today.
I keep swallowing myself whole.
Rain in rivulets  Streaking cheeks  Wash away the pain Your memory the stain I need to let go To grow
All the words want to be about you.
I'm addicted to the possibility of you.
Your smile conjures worlds within me.
I just want to be in the forest again.
"There is a bird stuck in the wall, and I know how she feels."
#mustard buttercup Sundays      On their way...              #vss365
A raging of our hearts and minds.
A fire that cannot be doused.
Love beyond romance.
Our paths are #perpendicular but our hearts are aligned. #vss365
Darkness and the beating of my heart.
When you feel foolish for your shifting moods remember the sun and the rain beget rainbows.
Our love renews us again.
Skip your heart like a stone across my still waters; can you feel the ripples?
I remember the way the stars looked back at you.
We barely let the grass grow before we cut it down.
"Fight the dragon, slay the demons!"
I’ve never felt so hollow.
Dark or light  The birds chirp on Why can’t I do the same?
I’m starting today over.
"Enfold me in your arms, linger just a moment longer."
"Stuck in the present, chained to the past and future, a relentless assault of days."
Like a labyrinth but with tunnels only leading down and down and down.
Relief is sweet but momentary.
Today feels claustrophobic.
"I am not okay, but I will be."
In the end we all have wings.
You are so raw it’s beautiful.
Feeling my feelings feels like drowning.
They can’t see the panic eating through my veins as I smile and nod and nod and nod.
Here I am building worlds in the shadows of dreams.
I wish this could be every morning.
Nothing but the trees settling and the replenishing of my soul.
I’ve gotta climb off these train tracks.
Fill your thoughts with flowers.
I can feel the weather changing as I breathe.
The scent of him stirs me still.
I am a star collapsing.
Remind me I'm alive.
Today is an imposition To all those living Demanding we get up and cater To its every whim
The writing of a poem is a lonely art.
"Noisy head Brain bulging Skin shivering What to do, what not to do Those are the questions But no one here to answer"
Sunshine soaks my bones.
Some days I’m flying and I don’t know who that idiot was writing about her heavy heart and buzzing head and swollen eyes.
I threw it all away  except for what I needed.
Fun #poetry #poem prompt!
"Tonight... Hell’s raven invites— Cruelty to kindness, Blood to water, Murder to sleep. Farewell, creation. No further good is promised."
"Ripped myself from sleep to face a semi-brutal day.  Wishes become reality as I  prepare to fight my way.  My pen,  my dagger,  my cudgel, my gun  tucked boldly at my side.  Who knows the battles I will face  when I choose to no longer run."
When “I’m out of bed” feels like a major accomplishment.
"Inertia pulls me back to sleep, but what am I leaving behind?"
Nightmares beget daymares.
"Silky sweet, soft yet strong, a shoulder to lay my weary head on."
Being constantly in my own head is driving me out of my mind.
I want the sun to stay.
We’ve all got our own graves to keep.
Let’s live  all the stories  we tell ourselves.
"Falling feels like flying,                at least at first."
A poem cannot lie.
All that time in bed Looking for peace When it’s here Amongst the flowers
"Perfumed waters, wash away the stench of regret."
"I miss her hands the most. Whether fixing a casserole, Cradling a book, Threading a needle, Rubbing my back, They were always  gentle and kind.   Happy Mother’s Day, Mom."
Do what they least expect and be okay.
Grief casts a long shadow.
The end is always the trickiest.
My language is simple but the feelings are real.
The rain falls on you and me the same.
The good ones remind you to take your medicine.
"I am not the me in your head, and you are not the you in mine."
And sneak      gifts   beneath my pillow   every               night.
And wear      dresses                 for no        reason.
Forgot to take off my eye makeup last night and now I look like the dude from A Clockwork Orange.
Be still   and let       the birds           sing you                                 home.
From now on     I shall only plant   flowers   in my garden.
I know misery too well.
The sun sinks lower than my spirits                          and everyone is drunk but me     so why is the ground tilting?  I didn’t sign up for this    but then again       I didn’t sign up for anything.
I swallow panic like poison and forget the antidote is breathing and soon the world falls apart because it won’t stop spinning and gravity is a myth.
Sometimes all I can do is sigh.
My dreams sprout wings  to carry me into the day.  I ride them past the bills and lists    and wave regally to the fairies and    angels who lounge about the clouds.
Epiphanies come in all shapes and sizes. My last one was quadrilateral and the size of an envelope with her name on it. I darent open it lest my life be upended forevermore.
He knows how to put me back together just the right way.
Endless tasks     trail down the list. Cross one off;    they multiply like gremlins.  #poetry #poem #WritingCommunity
Nighttime is easy. It’s daylight that trips me up.
Every tweet is a Rorschach test.

Scribbled note on the palm of my hand. I remember when your number was there.
"Morning Should be beautiful... And it is, it is beautiful. But terrifying,  For another day Offers so many opportunities for failure. Overcome, that is the word.  Banish the shadows that say you can’t. Breathe, take flight, and soar."
Daylight paint me new.
Only the moon really knows me.
"Triple guess your thoughts, check and recheck, check again. What you thought is not true. Think again. Twist and turn yourself into knots. Think hard. Think fast. Repeat. Repeat. Re—"
Picture of loved ones standing outside a dive bar. It’s been too long since I’ve seen your smiling face in person. Is it the distance or the illness that’s kept us apart?
"Anxiety demands a stanza in the poem of my life, but if I can, I’ll limit it to a word, a diminishing syllable, a helpless cry turned triumphant. #poem #poetry"
"Trembling hands span the keyboard, A crescent-shaped scar mars the back of one, Origin unknown. We heal differently now. Mid fingers adorned with rings-- Silver for the future, gold for the past. They search, Blindly, For something to say, a word to form.  #poetry #poem"
seeking light in all the dark places
