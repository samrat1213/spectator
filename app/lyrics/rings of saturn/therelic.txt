The relic calls upon me to deliver
Yearning for the essence of ancient hands to graze its surface
Opposers cast into the depths of the darkness
Now, relinquish my life
A viewpoint from a heightened perspective
The foreshadowing of tragedies that have yet to come
Images of damaged lifeforms increasingly haunt my conscience
Bring forth the ritual sacrifice
Divine power has spawned my corrupt entity
Paradox copy must fade from all traces of my existence

Crafted from the stars, and so I shall return
Become one with space
Vanish
What mysteries lie, beyond this wasteful zone?
Cryptic visuals consume

The relic calls upon me to deliver
Yearning for the essence of ancient hands to graze its surface
Opposers cast into the depths of the darkness
Now, relinquish my life
A viewpoint from a heightened perspective
The foreshadowing of tragedies that have yet to come
Images of damaged lifeforms increasingly haunt my conscience
Bring forth the ritual sacrifice
Divine power has spawned my corrupt entity
Paradox copy must fade from all traces of my existence

Human rubble
Limbs ripped off, faces chewed
Life draining from their eyes
From their eyes
