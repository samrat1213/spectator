Dormancy
Spirits await rebirth
From their sleep
They will soon awake
Restless dead
Catching the wiff of hate
Blood they anticipate
They will soon drink
Murderers
Subconscious attraction
On their graves
Blood will now spill
Ancient bones
Reform in grounds below
Born, as the blood will flow
Killing is all they know

Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood
Coalesce

Pieces become a whole
For their strength
Blood is absorbed
Rancorous
Aeons of building rage
Death an immortal cage
Now they are freed
Livid beasts
Rising now for revenge
From the past
Hate comes alive
Tenebrous
Restruct evil ones
The demons will come
Cruelity has just begun

Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood

First one that they find
Attack the mortal
Claws tear at his face
Pull the flesh from bone
Decapitate the man
They hold his head aloft
Headless body slumps
The blood is gushing out
Screaming victims fall
Repulsive beasts attack
Gore pours from the torso
Hellish creatures stab
Organs, grisly trophies
Rewards for their rage
Blood drips from their jaws
They disembowel the corpse
Kill with speed
Victims bleed
Wretched souls
Headless on poles
Savage thirst
Vesseles burst
Torn apart
Eat the heart
Vengeance taking form
Endless hatred for the living
Plunderng the world
Paroxysm of the damned
Rapture of their rage
Euphoria from butchery
A dark world will eclipse all life
Barbaric ways forever reign

<i>[solos - Owen, O'Brien, Owen, O'Brien]</i>

Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood
