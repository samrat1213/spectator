From the bowels of the earth they will arise, I summon your dead to 
work for me 
to raise an army unlike one's ever seen, ancestral beings wipe out 
this failed race, fertile earth and water for the starved true 
creators, once extinguished but brought forth to kill another day 
oppressive rule returns to transcend the weak foundations of man, 
awakening the undead, immortal servants risen only to eliminate, 
sinking rotting teeth, screams of the frail as they get devoured 
carrion corpses running wild, there is no salvation 
grinding of internal organs creates a pleasurable sound 

From the bowels of the earth they will arise, I summon your dead, to 
work for me 
to raise an army unlike one's ever seen, ancestral beings wipe out 
this failed race, fertile earth and water for the starved true 
creators, once extinguished but brought forth to kill another day 

torn apart by the mutated deceased, ripping you apart as your stumps 
bleed eternally 
I live on even as your flesh deteriorates, spreading myself among the 
oblivious populous, infecting everything around with my viral antigene
