Like a kite my mind is soaring high.
Through the sky every day and night.
And way up high I can still see just fine,
Don't worry everything will be alright.
I know it's scary, but everything will be alright 

I can't sleep, too many voices trying to talk to me.
I can't sleep, bloodshot eyes and I still feel fine.
I think I've lost my mind and I think I still feel fine.
I can't sleep, too many voices trying to talk to me.
I can't sleep, bloodshot eyes and I still feel fine.

Let's take it back to square one,
And figure out how all this bullshit began.
Is this the end of my reality?
I'll hold my breath till I can't breathe.
(Just to get a feeling)

I feel I've fallen into self-defeat.
Is that the reason I'm losing sleep?
I've fallen into self-defeat. 

I can't sleep too many voices trying to talk to me.
I can't sleep, bloodshot eyes and I still feel fine.


Here in my head, I can't tell who I'm talking to.
It seems I can't tell what's being said,
Someone please tell me am I alive or dead.

Like I said I know it's scary,
But everything will be alright.

Let's take it back to square one,
And figure out how all this bullshit began.
This is the end of my reality.
I'll hold my breath till I can't breathe.
