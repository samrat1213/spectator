Hell Spawn LyricsYou are the one, the oldest one
You come before the legends of men
You come before the legends of gods
You are the sea, creator of all
You're all I need, for you I bleed
Plant your seed, Earth shall feed
Enlighten my soul, spirit grows
Born of the fire, I shall return
I am the Hellspawn
Curse from my eyes, your gods I defy
Fulfillment is mine, of the most high
Born of the fire, I shall return
Answer the call of the oldest one
I am the Hellspawn
Forever I am, in spirit I am
Forever I dream, continual dream
We sleep undisturbed again
Chthhulhu we dream in the peace again
I am the HellspawnEmbed
