10 More Dead LyricsOh the lines are getting longer
More are added everyday
And there seems to be no shortage
Of humans for my foul play
No understanding
And no ability to see the signs
They just keep breeding out of order
And adding to the lines more and more
Here they go
10 more dead
And the bodies piling higher, higher
10 more dead
And the stench grows stronger
With many more to go
Most see me pure evil
But they respect me just the same
When nature's done sustaining
She calls me in to play the cold game
No favors
And no quarter ever shown
For the sheer masses of the masses
Still the population's growing
More and more here they go
10 more dead
And the bodies piling higher, higher
10 more dead
And the stench grows stronger
With many more, many more to go
Oh, come ye one come you all are waiting now
Line up, face the light
Oh, and thousands more behind to follow
Clueless
Will be embers burning bright
Oh they're dying for me quickly now
The ways are always mine to choose
'Cause once it's done it doesn't matter
Between the faith or fate
I'm not confused about my purpose no
Reduce them all in shame
And the bones will pave my kingdom
They have only themselves to blame
Here they go
10 more dead
And the bodies piling higher, higher
10 more dead
And the stench grows strongerEmbed
