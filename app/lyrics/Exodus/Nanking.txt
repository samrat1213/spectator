[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sadistic soldiers of the Rising Sun
1937's when the rape had begun
The ancient city fell under imperial rule
By an engine of war and lust, savage and cruel
Assembly line efficiency of killing machines
Unbridled fury of the sick and obscene
Systematic sexual degradation
The more perverse the greater exaltation

[Pre-Chorus]
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run
They turned the waters
Of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside
And brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

[Chorus]
Bestial and violent
Six weeks of suffering
So black was the day
They marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
[Verse 2]
Tanks ran over men nailed to boards
Decapitations with an officer's sword
Gang rape of women, both the young and the old
Frozen to death in waters ice cold
Disembowelment, some are buried alive
Suicide's preferred for those who survive
The stench of corpses everywhere in the streets
Dogs feast on the rotting meat

[Pre-Chorus]
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run
They turned the waters
Of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside
And brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

[Chorus]
Bestial and violent
Six weeks of suffering
So black was the day
They marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
[Post-Chorus]
It was the rape of Nanking

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Thousands forced into prostitution
So many years and still no restitution
The carnage of Carthage so easily outdone
Add all the blood you get 1200 tons
Massacre removed from history books
No mention of men hung from iron hooks
All counter to the rules of war
They made a city an army's whore

[Pre-Chorus]
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run
They turned the waters
Of the Yangtze red with blood
Cast aside
And brutalized
Terrific horror made to terrorize

[Chorus]
Bestial and violent
Six weeks of suffering
So black was the day
They marched through the gates
Their fate was beckoning
[Post-Chorus]
It was the rape of NankingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
