Free thought is a lie
And our leaders have failed us
Our freedoms will die
With the kings who betray us

Fabricated wars
Gather the soldiers and grind their bones
Coffins collected in shipping containers
Sent back to their loved ones at home

Fabricated fear
Keep the countries sedated
The end times are near
In the hell we've created

Grand manipulation
From the parliaments to the TV screen
Waves of misinformation
Flood the gates of the corrupted media machine

Free thought is a lie
And our leaders have failed us
Our freedoms will die
With the kings who betray us

Kill the masters
Murder the kings
Bloodletting
Violent reckoning

Violent
Reckoning

The blind lead the blind
Authors of the false testaments
Imprisoning minds
The apostles of pestilence

Grand manipulation
From the parliaments to the TV screen
Waves of misinformation
Flood the gates of the corrupted media machine

Free thought is a lie
And our leaders have failed us
Our freedoms will die
With the kings who betray us

Violent reckoning

Kill the masters
Murder the kings
Violent reckoning
Our leaders have failed us
