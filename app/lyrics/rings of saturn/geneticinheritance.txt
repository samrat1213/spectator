Behavior controlled by a genetic inheritance from ancestors
Exhibiting immense plasticity, inability to learn on their own

Molded, to become a product of environment
Relics leading ruins, no means to an end

The elite body of divinites will decay all of terrestrial
The elite body of divinites will decay all of terrestrial beings

Scorch everything until the landscape is all but intact
The abomination is finally back

Behavior controlled by a genetic inheritance from ancestors
Exhibiting immense plasticity, inability to learn on their own

Molded, to become a product of environment
Relics leading ruins, no means to an end

The elite body of divinites will decay all of terrestrial
The elite body of divinites will decay all of terrestrial beings

Scorch everything until the landscape is all but intact
The abomination is finally back

Only an outside universal threat can lift the veil for them, to recognize the bond
A species has not eliminating one another for a singular gain
A singular gain
