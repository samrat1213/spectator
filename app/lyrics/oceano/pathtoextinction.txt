A council of ascendants has been beckoned
To overwatch this planet in distress
Conflicted between the choice to turn their backs
On you all, or intervene
But at what cost?
At what cost is affirmation of their convictions?
You must struggle to learn
You must struggle to learn
How to emphasize for all species
How to access conscious connectivity
Where the fuck is your compassion?
You must struggle to learn
You must struggle to learn
Preservation holds the key
Evolve into a greater human being
Time is wearing thin
Denial or enlightenment
This is the dawning of their descent
Awaken
Oh' world!
No problem can go ignored
Accept your role
Emphasize for all species
Accept conscious connectivity
Find your compassion
Or prepare to burn
Are you prepared to burn?
You lack all compassion
You have no concern
With your own planet
Are you prepared to burn?
Are you prepared to burn
On your path to extinction?
Are you prepared to burn?
