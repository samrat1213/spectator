Kill every human on this Earth

We have been complacent for far too long, time is up
Ancient man considered us their masters
Refuse to comply you will meet your end

Humans can't fathom our animosity
Jaw clasp to delicate limbs, blood fills the mouth
The entrails of those harvested marks the dawn of a new galactic cleansing

We are the end of the organism, the embodiment of all torment
We are what a black whole fears, an ancient adversary that's awoken

Warp the mind, deranged thoughts, erratic massacre begins
An army genetically engineered with one goal in mind
Lay waste to the filth the resides here, a genocidal epidemic
Introduced, families fragmented before their very eyes

Colonize this barren surface begin anew
