Delivering ward got a new guest
Preparations for a birth are under way
A wish to greet a new life
Surgeons will do their best
Embryo's head comes out Of the widen uterus
However, the real horror is yet to come
Suckling's head is severed with a crack
Being pulled by surgeon's hands
Undergrown jugular veins
Pour their mucus all around
Headless torso gets pushed out
By pressure of uterine secretion
Spattered birth
Hospital carnage
Thrown out with an immense power
Stricken the clinic walls
Torn apart
DismemberedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
