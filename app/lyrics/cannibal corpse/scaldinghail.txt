Flying chunks of hot debris rushing through the air
Vapors causing blisters, eyes blinded by the glare
Clouds that shower death, hell falling from the sky
Searing rain of molten rock, flesh begins to fry
Burning fragments, steaming stones tearing through my skin
Lodging near my organs, I'm burning from within
Parts of human bodies lay strewn on the ground
Survivors holding bleeding ears, deafened by the sound
Blackened heavens raining down a mountain's weight of rock on top of us
Churning earth has somehow come to life
Rapid combustion spewing magma cracks apart the crust
Tornadoes of caustic steam ravaging the earth
Scalding hail
Charred and battered victims crying to be saved
Falling on deaf ears, the earth is now our grave
Devastating torrents, acid drowns the land
No relief from scalding hail burning like a brand
People shrieking a they die, pounded by the hail
Splintered shards, heated rock stabbing like a nail
Millions have been slaughtered as the boiling torrents falls
Apocalyptic storm, judgment for us all
Scalding hail
