The sun never sets
The blood never dries
The selfless sacrifice
Of the butchers maligned
The sun never sets
The blood never dries
Lest we forget

The sun never sets
Teardrops never dry
This deathless bloodshed
Of the whetted knives
For your sons you never wept
The fruitless sacrifice
Of the master butchers

Never trusted in the dark
Pecuniary villeinage
A decaying realm to rapine and plunder

Like maggots colonizing
Contagious disease contaminating
Expansionist plague to pillage &amp; conquer

The union of cruciate &amp; saltire
The callous cruciate &amp; saltire
To beneficiate the graveyard of empire

In the name of his tyrannical majesty
To serve the imperialist tragedy
A cruel serving sovereignty
A subjugating murderous monarchy

Recollections of the past, revised, laundered, tainted &amp; poisoned
But I'll raise a toast to the memory of those who served in the
West African squadron
Merciful overlords

In the name of diabolical oligarchy
In the kingdom of demise rules supremacy
Solipsistic crowned nobility
Stern reigning gunboat diplomacy

Recollections of the past, revised, condemn, taint &amp; poison
But I'll raise my glass to the memory of the wretches who
Served in the preventative squadron

I salute
Those who tugged at the master butcher's apron strings

The sun never sets
The blood never dried
The fruitless sacrifice
Of the butchers benign
The sun it never sets
The blood never dries
Lest we forget
That the master butchers still whet their knives
