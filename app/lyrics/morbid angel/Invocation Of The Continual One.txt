Invocation of the Continual One LyricsSacred night on the Eve of May
We gather before the stars
Taste the Hunger of the Fire
Vastness of the Continuum
Heretics of a way unseen
Celebrate, the Greatest of Means
Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies
By Your Hand the Zamanu dies
Drink, drink, the Blood of the Ancients
Me-Zu Me Pa-Ku-Ku-De-Hul
(Your Divine Ordering Principle is a Divine Order which manifests Itself with
Most Sweetness)
Star encircled with the Power-Names
We speak in the Broken Lines
Leviathan will open the Gate
To the Great Abyssous Planes
Feel the icing winds of the Ab-Zu
Sea below all seas
Leviathan, Serpent of Truth
Share with us Most Perfect Way
Call to the Earth, fortify our will
Come Air Spirits, be our eyes this night
Primal Flames are warmth to our souls
Waters of Life, Great Blessings You pour
Calling on Leviathan
Open the gate
Link us with the Wonder of the Abyss Planes so great
Lord of the rolling thunder
Celebrate with us this night
Rip away the veil
Hear our praise
Your Slumber is our Paradise
You smite our enemies down
For we, the few enlightened
Through Your Will we break our bonds
Lord Who shatters paradigms
From the rubble the New shall rise
Your Way presents death for them
The ME-GAL-GAL do we praise
Come Centaur
Those Who Prance to the Hymns of Truth
Come join us
Come Leviathan
Make passage of the Entrance we've
Prepared for You this night

It is Thine Kiss of Divinty for which I hungerEmbed
