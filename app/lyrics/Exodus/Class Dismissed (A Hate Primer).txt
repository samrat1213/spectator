[Verse 1]
Everything around me ignites my rage
I'm burning with animosity
Everywhere I look another war to wage
Filled with purpose of singularity
Got my hollow points, got my magazines
Wrote my manifesto of decay
Commencement of the killing at the university
Antipathy, the lesson of the day

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They never should've pushed me away

[Chorus]
Student bodies lying dead in the halls
A blood-spattered treatise of hate
Class dismissed is my hypothesis
Gunfire ends the debate
All I ever wanted was a little affection
But no one ever gave it to me
My hate primer's the result of my rejection
You'll die for it, and I'll die for thee

[Verse 2]
The halls of learning now a shooting range
My final exam with a gun
Killing everyone who ever thought me strange
My bloody dissertation has begun
Pomp and circumstance replaced by bullet wounds
The smell of gun powder in the air
Murder is the nightmare of this afternoon
My malevolence, your cross to bear
[Pre-Chorus 2]
All because of my despair

[Chorus]
Student bodies lying dead in the halls
A blood-spattered treatise of hate
Class dismissed is my hypothesis
Gunfire ends the debate
All I ever wanted was a little affection
But no one ever gave it to me
My hate primer's the result of my rejection
You'll die for it, and I'll die for thee

[Post-Chorus]
Hate lives in me
Hate lives in me

[Bridge]
Hate! I need it and it needs me
Hate! I feed it and it fed me
Hate! I breed it and it bred me
Hate!
Hate! I read it and it read me
Hate! I lead it, and it led me
Hate! I bleed it, and it bled me
Hate! I breathe it in, and it breathes through me
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
While SWAT teams swarm all around the quad
The symposium of slaughter carries on
Smith and Wesson is my only god
And the line in the sand has been drawn
Valedictorian of violence
Graduation day, one bullet remains
Charles Whitman set the precedent
I pull the trigger and blow out my brains

[Pre-Chorus 3]
They never knew I was insane

[Chorus]
Student bodies lying dead in the halls
A blood-spattered treatise of hate
Class dismissed is my hypothesis
Gunfire ends the debate
All I ever wanted was a little affection
But no one ever gave it to me
My hate primer's the result of my rejection
You'll die for it, and I'll die for thee

[Post-Chorus]
Hate lives in me
Hate lives in me
[Outro] [x4]
I instruct you
And I destruct you
I deconstruct you
Until my hate has fucked youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
