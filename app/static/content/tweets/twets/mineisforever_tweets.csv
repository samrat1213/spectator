I don’t know how to do this.
Feelings? What feelings?
Withered and writhing.
Mind mutilation.
You are not handling this well at all.
Ritualistically sacrificing my soul.
"My mind is already torn to shreds,  no one can pierce the armor deeper. Every other agony is white noise, as damaging as a butterfly in a hurricane."
My reinforced walls will never tumble again. Battlements ferociously guarded arrows at the ready.
"My every last cell is exhausted, right through to the cytoplasm and into the nucleus."
"Caught up so much in my own head with the worry, the anxiety, that I feel like a figment, stepping between reality  and illusion, peering at life as though through smeared glass or blankets of fog."
A rundown gothic manor would be an ideal first date.
No one knows.
"I’ve small-talked and faked smiles, perfected a put-together girl who hides her jagged shards well, and beautifully learnt to act out social niceties.  I’m tired."
Disassociated darling.
Don’t forget to forget about me.
I’ve lost any tenuous grasp I had over everything.
"No one can ever pry the darkness from my cold, dead heart."
Ice pick chip chip chipping at my skull.
My own private descent into the maelstrom.
3am and my demons come knocking.
"Ghosts braided within my skull, icy tendrils plaiting through flesh."
I can’t trust anything anymore.
Fetid and cloying  the sweet pall of her decay a fragrant lustrate  #HaikuChallenge
"Once I was unguarded, trusting, naive but now I exist with armor and the tongue of a dagger."
"Sightless mind,  blind heart"
"Half here.  Only meaning half of what I say and being only half of who I am. Stuck between. Lost somewhere amidst reality and disassociation, no sense of a way out."
"Every breath is a battle, each heartbeat a war"
There is a coffin shaped hole in my chest where my heart used to be.
"Part girl, part butterfly aphrodisiac.  Pic ~ Dara Scully"
"Amidst the embers and ash discarded, abandoned on the hearth my heart was always destined to burn"
"Kiss me back into the darkness, the numbness. I belong here and my heart can rest a little longer."
"How invisibility robes me.  Eyes do not see,  hearts do not feel. Reflections refuse to reflect a blackened soul, half dead already."
"Never, ever surrendering myself to anyone again."
The dangerous silver tongued ones and their willing prey.
I’ve learned to read the absent words between all the prettily ccurated ones.
Dilapidated spirit.
Well that’s it.  I’m done.
Wearing this skin is exhausting.
"Vacant, absent a constellation of voids  within me They shift through time do the right things repeat"
You are still whole without their acknowledgment.
The moon flirts with her chaos.
Collecting delusions arranging them prettily as collisions of maladaption adorn my soul
I am merely ash these days.
Swallowing oblivion.
Defeated/ist.
"I just want to live within poetry,  on pages, between the prose"
A storm breaks within her chest lashing rain and cracking thunder are now her heart and soul
The vileness rots me from inside. It curdles my blood and decays organs.
I’ve lost so many pieces of myself.
Choking on butterflies.
This echo chamber hell within my skull.
Lethargy binds me a single thought takes  the energy of a warrioress
I’m always the fool having to  pick up the pieces again
Seemingly pointless at this stage.
The maelstrom of mind sorts turmoil from tragedy swirling you away   #HaikuChallenge
"Starved of hope, feasting on pain"
I will turn you into a monster to save myself.
Tainted memories.
And then they go and ruin it all.
Bloodstained feathers where her wings used to be.
3am date with my demons.
The nothingness binds me.
A dark afterthought her shadow waning  from inside your skull
The girl with desolation in her soul and decadence on her lips.
Darkness is my sole ally.
Curdled and clotted emotions writhe and surface as delusions and figments
"It dances up my spine, tendrils lapping like vines of melancholy, an icy path of destruction"
But then I became the carnage.
"The ghosts of ghosts inhabit my chest, haunting, evoking nightmares of ancient tragedies and those still to come."
Like bursts of thunder erratic heartbeats jolt and spasm holding me between realms
"Corpses line my soul, entombed. The corpses of dreams, of regret, of joy."
A forest grows within my ribcage.
Razing souls to the ground.
My 2am demons want to play.
the carnage  became  me
You just don’t get it.
"Like pebbles, the sadness sits in my stomach, my soul, dragging me down and under."
I don’t know how to do this.
Feelings? What feelings?
Withered and writhing.

the carnage  became  me
You just don’t get it.
"Like pebbles, the sadness sits in my stomach, my soul, dragging me down and under."
The words I can’t say to anyone sit heavy in my throat.
She wears chaos as her crown and grief as her cloak.
"Each wound, a confession"
"Slammed shut, my heart is ajar no more."
"Ignore it, it’ll go away."
The fangs of dread plunge into my heart draw blood and feed greedily
Oceans of fire swell within my ribcage.
Tear out my heart and the creature that lives within.
The monster in my head is me.
"Tangle up with amaranthine ghosts the ghosts of ghosts as sheer as fog and  as delicate as gossamer they pervade my bones, chill my blood whispering psalms within my skull"
The most pretty little delirium.
How many shattered hearts lay in your wake.
Rendered mute of voice and thoughts
Thorns in my throat This creature of death Will slay in silence
‘You have turned my blood cold and bitter.
I am a vacant shell.
"The more you let go,  the more adept at it you become"
"I was a wildfire, but now my blood runs dirty with ash and my bones crumble as charcoal. Soot cloaks my heart and my smoke damaged soul strains for purity."
Inside my ribcage an abyss  devouring all emotion engulfing  my splintered mind wrapping me in a gilded cocoon
Mottled shadows  slink across my soul obscuring open wounds
Proficient in sadness.
Ghosts in my heart and devils in my skull.
Slow dancing with oblivion.
What if some of us can only truly survive by dying.
Susceptible to your daggers today.
Dying  to find  my inevitables
"With daggers in her flesh and daisies in her eyes, she stumbles on."
Numbness is a pleasant distraction when you constantly feel hyper emotional.
Shadows reach for me like gnarled hands seeking a throat to return me home
Through the fog a glimmer daring to hope
Her heart waxes and wanes with every tidal pull
Your demons will always search you out. Eventually.
Just be a safe harbor in a tempest.
"She’s part catastrophe, part godsend."
Carefully curated.
If only people knew the real you.
Nestled in sinew ensconced in marrow demons whisper
"Cloud contemplation  eyes up, heartbeat down such simple pleasure"
The girl with ghosts in her ribcage and demons on her tongue.
Elsewhere  as thunder introducing a storm  or a moth lusting after a flame Elsewhere as a current in the sea searching shipwrecks or a wildflower waltzing with the breeze Elsewhere rambling in a forgotten ruined abbey  or sitting serenely with forests Nowhere
Abundant mood of abject wounds and aches within every neuron
Why not me?
"Rolling in, like monstrously beautiful storm clouds of every shade of bruise. Billowing and looming, amassing an army to go into battle and face most certain defeat.  The sadness always returns."
Entire forests bow in reverence as she passes.
"Summoning oceans, conducting wild waves into a perfect symphony of divinity and destruction."
Composed of waning faith and shipwrecks.
The girl with ghost stories on the tip of her tongue.
A balm to soothe this raw and ravaged  soul of mine
"Eulogies wailed,  incanted,  a bloodcurdling crescendo of life"
Flowers pressed to skin.
The ichor of ancient priestesses runs through my veins.
Oubliettes and obituaries.
"The exhaustion lines my bones, it insulates my skull. Burrowing deeper and deeper and draping me fully in this tiresome lethargy."
Wounds in my throat and peonies in my eyes.
The dead hours.
Removing heartstrings with surgical precision anesthetized joy
"Unstitch the emotion. Pull it out, thread by gossamer thread."
Astray and adrift velveteen petals dancing lost with the wind
Skull overflowing with swarming wasps.
My mind feels like a butterfly in a tornado.
The horror owns my soul but I think my heart owns the horror.
Lightning in my eyes and leaves in my ribcage.
I’m hard work but being made by others to feel it is soul destroying.
I dont care enough to be vindictive.
Butterflies in my chest and bullets in my skull.
Flowers in my mouth and blades in my throat.
I know you remember
I do enjoy watching things burn.
Undone by demons ones I know intimately  the beats to my heart
Sentenced to life I die a little each day
I wonder how many could have loved me had I given them the chance.
A gown of fire dripping embers and frail ash a life cleansed by flame
Cloaked in fallacies of a life forced to walk through a shadow of lies
Rip out the ruined pages.
I drowned I think in the waves of him
As extinguishable as any flame
"Walking through the blaze of apathy, understanding that there should be emotion."
Between the chaos I plant flowers
My heart is forever winter.
"She’s part desecration, part salvation."
"I’m here in body existing with the living my mind, realms away"
Faultlessly flawed.
"I am my own lighthouse, serenaded by the seas."
Refusal to catch fire; I’ll only burn internally
Refusal to bleed.
Lethal silence shattering my ether deafening my soul
A dungeon within  forever trapped and trapping  oubliette of heart
Clear as cut crystal.
"Elegies of the flesh, as deep as bone, as marrow   pic ~ yourschizophrenia"
"Her heart speaks in storms Rumbling tempests, shrieking pangs Of sorrow and rage So intimate and intense Fluently devastating"
An anxious bird takes flight in my chest
Moon fire scorching my throat.
Confessions whispered in the cathedral  of my heart feverishly pleading absolution
"I only want to adore the sky, and for her to adore me back"
Wolves in my head  howling  hunting  the scent of blood a taste of flesh their prey me
"The moon, forever my predator"
Inhaling clouds becoming the beauty  of stark thunderheads
Just be gentle with her wings.
"This shipwreck, my soul abandoned in the dark depths  oceanic tomb"
Spewing from blood lips  Remorseful recitations  Tangling in the trees
"Strangled anger dancing in our eyes, entangled  with heartstrings  hauntingly dangling  love"
Ignoble emotions of this damn humanness.
Silence and other twisted daggers.
A flowerbed of this blossoming ache.
"Tear my skull open and spill all the furious wasps, shrieking their horror and hate."
Unsaid words and the pain they inflict.
Butterfly corpses spilling from my skull.
Carefully pinned wings  forever in pseudo flight eternal glass tomb  #haiku
The abandoned ruins inside my ribcage.
Rewriting myself as an elegy.
Think in syllables feel in metaphors  act as poetry
Feigning existence Breath and blood but absent soul Imaginary
Poets and thunderstorms.
Unstitching emotions that are woven in too deep that pull flesh too hard  and tear soul apart
"mutations of heart black chambers of disease, rot specters of the light"
Saturn's storms are nothing compared to the ones that rage behind my eyes.
I’m the only one who should have to endure this chaos.
The meaningful absences.
Should visit the ocean tonight. She’s always prettiest on a clear winter’s midnight.
I’ve felt this blade before. And survived.
The flames lick my mind.
Get the fuck out of my hippocampus.
Stitched scars  upon her soul a mosaic of misery holding her together
The internal howls are harder to suppress right now.
I hate allowing anyone to have this control over me.
Back step from my sea tumultuous tombs of many lay here
Calling tidal waves  Invoking oblivion  Sweet serenity
Praying for butterflies.
Fog hides me For a minute From myself
Another jolt into dismal consciousness for the next 12 hours.
Fuck sugar coating it.
Enamored by all the little sad and dead things.
Solitary moon wading through my nights  hung with dying stars
Nothing to everyone.
Plundered  of passion eviscerated soul rent from all reality
The thing I want to learn is to not look back.
I cannot hurt graciously.
No softness remains.
This library of grief.
I don’t know how you process anything healthily.
Deep dive into oblivion.
"So in the scheme of things, who cares."
The fragments will eventually become dust and nothingness and time meanders on with or without me.
And I don’t care if I do or don’t.
This time it’s all about me. Trying to survive.
Gardens wilt inside my ribcage.
Curated so you don’t pop up. Just so I can control when and how much to see.
I am both empty  and full to overflowing  of feelings
Deep dive into your delusions.
Taken under by an ocean of Tool waves.
I want to lick Maynard’s brain.
"One slice at a time scalpel to skin, excise them and lull the havoc"
"Like stars sewn into midnight, she stitches breath back into her body."
Every arrow to my heart is etched by his pen.
Like an ice pick to the skull.
Squeeze tighter make the blood spurt between your fingers
Ice hearted.
Nothing to see here anymore.
Safe from emotion
Sea of souls eddying wildly drowned at last
Dilute my sorrow dilate my oblivion
Deaden my mind  to match my eyes
Pills  forced in  to blunt the  existence
Trust is a butterfly I always manage to crush and maim.
"Flame or blade,  the flesh doesn’t care"
I won’t stain you.
Moon glades and melancholy.
Nothing can survive me.
Lay me down with your demons.
Cedarwood and sorrow.
And they never spoke of it again.
Cauterized heart closed wound  hemorrhaging no more
A barrage of emotions  flow from me spilling bile and blood
Spilled words abandoned and strewn upon her lips
"A graveyard lies within me,  ancient bones and dead flowers"
I dont want to care anymore. Im going to do anything I can to not.
"Stalactites adorn  pristine thorns, tiny daggers   my ribcage cavern"
The tension sits like a stone in my heart in my bones
Earth to earth   pic ~ yourschizophrenia
Composed of damage.
Barbed wire tears.
Desolate barren nothing for anyone including myself
Take it all away. I don’t want anything anymore.
I’m the one who has to pick herself up off the floor.
You’re going to need to tell me straight.
The goddamn sting.
Teeth on heart.
I feel like I identify more with the dead than the living these days.
Lips on bone.
Teeth on skin.
A circle of salt around my emotions
Everything shifts.
Blood-soaked psyche.
From stem to spine darkness inhabits me
Withdrawing from life.
"My mind, like a wolf baying at the moon."
I’ve stopped allowing people to let me down.  Mostly.
Pray to flame.
Pushing all away  defensive and protective traumatic fear
Soul strewn in ribbons flayed and discarded in time apathetic death
Take me.
Please fly today.
More ❤️s from women than men on my fleet which is pretty cool.
I can’t even save myself.  Right now.
Fine but dying.
As darkness uncloaks me.
Shipwrecked soul.
Gardens planted with melancholy.
Oceans swell within me.
halo slipping down
Medicated drama queen
I’m nostalgic for Kurt and Courtney tonight.
I Like You
Carve a space inside your brain
You come to bury me
So battle weary.
Lost ghost girl.
"Sorry, this is my space. I have to."
I just want someone as broken as me.
I lose more  but they gain more
'and we are the imagination of ourselves'
Ungraciously alive.
'days away I still feel you'
'Venomous voice tempts me'
Not allowing thoughts to be thought.
My black heart rots any hope that dares trespass.
Bewitching ravens obsidian protectors  perched upon my soul
"Smothering feelings severing their breath, their life deathly numb and void"
Adoring the sky.
Battle weary girl ghost.
My. God.
Learn to swim
We watch the silence atrophy our existence  unforgiving faith  #HaikuChallenge
‘Core is black as pitch’
‘But I’m more than just a little curious how you’re planning to go about making your amends’
G o d A l m I g h t y  Maynard James Fucking Keenan 🖤
It’s like you’re reading my mind.
Once upon a time
It only looks like I’m carrying on normally.
"Ribcage snapping with  haunting spirits, feasting on  my deathly dark soul"
Thorns flow through my veins.
Tearing thorns from flesh.
Neglecting life.
Friend is foe.
"Bird hearted, trilling the song reverberates and  dies upon my lips"
Retreating from it I've no more fight to battle surrender me now
A shadowed haunting  piercing and wounding the flesh his iron tipped gaze
These tweets  a r e   n o t about you
Mood
I wish someone else would address my feelings.
Might get shot drunk Friday night.
You’ve made me into a war.
"I don’t need to be liked, I’m more comfortable with being despised."
"I’m not here to make friends, in case you hadn’t noticed."
Tears threatened demandingly today.
Feel what I need to.
Psychologically balanced.
Exhumed.
The monsters go in the box inside my skull.
Moon fire scorching my throat.
The horror clings follows
Benumbed.
Licking your ghosts.
Haiku is my love language.
Dark and sinuous my heart slithers through razors sliced malignancy
Razor grin.
Coffee stained kisses.
Neon colored eyes.
Final girl.
My breath has been severed.
I’m feeling hard to breathe today.
Deletion  in silence
No control over the depth your blade bites into me.
Unwhole.
"Like a scar, I am repulsive, but composed of tragedy and chaos."
"Chipped skull, the damage disguised by dahlias."
Digging graves with arrow tips and crawling inside to await fresh souls.
The death of horizons.
All make believe.
Purge.
"You break my arms, you spoon my eyes"
Wave of mutilation.
Blood letting but for emotions.
Drifting away.
‘And kill us all with holy fingers’
Wearing moonbeams as a masquerade.
Prove yourself with blood.
A cursory demise.
Perched upon rib bones my eternal demon holds the cold barrel  against my heart
Lost between the melancholy and midnight.
"The seas hide my hollowness, drowning me as I succumb  to life"
Haunted by forests.
Searching for solace in the embrace of demons.
Gouge the memories out with a rusty dagger.
Murder scene  crimson love  we’ll bury each other
Lithium and loneliness.
Interlocked fingers and lithium.
"Seams tear and rip, spilling stars and ichor and oceans from her heart."
Frankincense and forests.
Murder scene mind.
But mostly destruction lights my path.
Lips like a felony.
Mood swings and myrrh.
The shore strewn with pieces of our souls
Patron saint of apathy.
Blood moon and butterflies.
A willing vessel to carry your darkest ache
Moods are exhausting.
Forever in your sky.
It endures.
Skull full of fog.
Reptilian heart.
I wish I was a nirvana song.
Her filigreed flesh delicately obscuring  wounds and battle scars
Eyes open to light subsided unconsciousness recollected war
Lavender and lethargy.
Wallpapered with pretend.
"Mottled cadavers rigor mortis, opaque eye freed of life and light"
She felt like you were shooting arrows at lightning.
Emotions impale both the flesh and the figments
A heart straight from the imagination of Poe.
I’m purely shards at this point.
Sedation and solitude.
But if only the sea in my skull would stop surging.
‘This refuge for the demented’.
My flowers bloom as thorns.
I am your darkness.
Show me how to live.
An aura of melancholy and moths.
Claimed by the sadness buried deep within my bones silent and deathly
Composed of galaxies and poetry.
Blood in my butterfly stream.
Devouring the dark  a feast of illness and angst becoming the death
Soaked in bleach
Apathetic  stained by melancholic  episodes the numbness snarls a chaotic shroud of oblivion
"Midnight calms my blood.  The darkness caresses me off to oblivion, the sanctuary of sleep."
I can’t tell you everything that’s wrong with me as it would make it real.
A sepulchre by the sea.
"Resuscitation emptied of life, breath  reborn of his poem"
Poetry and disorder.
Undead but unalive.
Bergamot and bloodlust.
Sewing on smiles.
Emotions distort like shape shifters bend and bow a gamut of mood
Carving bones into crucifixes.
My soul as dead as my eyes
My heart holds your apocalypse.
"The day blurs, the hours hazy"
Mutilated mind.
"I am the cold, stone sepulchre."
"Kiss my wounds, absolve my scars"
Heart like a dungeon.
My heart  in a cell padlocked
Sacrificial poetry.
Poisoned prose.
Chained to the melancholy.
Detach all emotion.
It’s always clearer from neutral territory.
Dwelling in the horror.
The terrifying relief of being seen.
Will the damage ever come undone?
There is nothing here.
"Hiding between the poetry, in the shadows of every cadence"
This destructive vessel that I am.
Existence juxtaposed with living.
Stowing away in the shadows.
"Vanish me, I will burn and exult  in ash"
Leaving my destruction up to the sky.
Fuck you/them/me/everything.
Empty the ashes from my heart.
"The midnight brims, full of stars, overflowing into daybreak"
Sweeping ashes into ink.
Butchered words by dripping knives
A shining harem of stars  in worship of the Moon
It’s not about me but my mind won’t stop creating tragedies.
I feel horrible for having horrible feelings.
Sky fire
Delicate and deluded.
The shame of admitting feelings pierce like a dagger. Why am I like this.
"My head is in Hell, my heart, Valhalla"
"The battles are fought, bone deep and blood drenched, in heart and head and hell"
Fluent in self flagellation.
Lone oblivion. Fragments of reality. Disappearing.
Fortressed.
"If you don’t have anything nice to think, don’t think anything at all."
I have nothing good to think.
Drown me in catastrophe.
A sea of ice flows through me.
Misery and horror compose my soul
Flesh of blades.
I don’t know how to love or be loved
Death by a thousand cuts.
"You play games, I build walls"
The words burn on my tongue Ash collects in my throat Chocking me from my silence
I am the distance between myself and life
Loud and clear.
I just want to be someone’s shrine.
Coffined in sadness.
Shards of me lost in each memory
"A piece of me is buried with them, in each of their graves."
Blurred and befogged I barely remember me Time and torture has prevailed
"Existence is like a fiend a quiet misery, a cold rage degenerating melancholy in an asylum of sadness"
Soul ache.
Lunatic.  And not the good kind.
If bad thoughts were butterflies.
Get a room.
Heartbeat of a tempestuous ocean.
The held tension driving daggers of pain
A vow of butterflies.
Unable to compose happiness.
A bow of butterflies.
The moon delights in her darkness
Flowers fluttering over flesh.
Your heart may drown you.
Your mind may suffocate you.
Horror movies in the dark.
"A life led in fragments, fractured pieces. Avoidance of the whole, the entirety of hurt."
Vanquish the heart.
"She flees reality,  hides amidst pretend."
Adorning thorns prickling eyes  piercing heart
Noose of roses.
Entire galaxies form between our silence.
Muse
I carry sadness as much as it carries me
Just good at keeping the world at a distance.
Trust is everything.
I’m sorry you feel that way.
Knew you couldn’t resist.
Palliative prose.
Words help assuage the wounds.
The blood is truer than words.
Wrapped in a melancholy charm.
I consent to the abyss to suffer my anguish
The malice of existence.
Get back in your den.
I prefer poetry to people.
I spend so much time looking at clouds.
Beautifully bruised.
"A feeling that everything must end, the music, ourselves, the moon, everything. That if you get to the heart of things you find sadness for ever and ever, everywhere; but a beautiful silver sadness, like a Christ face. - John Fowles"
Unhealable wounds of grief.
Belonging wholly to oblivion now.
You can’t drag me under more than I already am.
Origami heart.
Fiend of soul.
Spiriting
"People who think they understand you, know you, but couldn’t be further from the truth."
Oh the deletions!
"All the patterns are there, you just have to know how to read them."
The holy Trinity.
I hope he does it again.
Show some self worth.
As I inhale you.
Inhale me.
The orchestra of oceans.
What a shame.
A tendency to atrophy.
‘Give me my give me my wings’
I’d rather be wandering an ancient graveyard.
"The storm clouds inhabit my heart, sometimes docile and calm,  other times trying to tend flesh from flesh"
"Inspirited daydreams, fervent desolation, beauty diffusing horror"
"She pretends she’s oceans, independent, unfettered, soft or sublimely savage"
I pity her.
"I am necrotic.  From soul to mind to body I feel eaten away, day by day, trauma by trauma, mood by mood."
Lone girl ghost.
Flowerlike eyes.
The symphony of oceans.
"Daemons behind my eyes,  strewn throughout my skull"
Dissociative darling.
"Block, mute, murder"
If I was smart I’d have been gone long ago.
Stripped down to sufferance.
Collection of sadness line my skull
"The thoughts may not be truth, but they feel like it. That is the key thing to not being able to just ‘stop’ them."
Crown your melancholy with a wreath of thorns
Swollen sadness and necrotic nostalgia annihilate my soul
Decay with me.
Maybe I just don’t want to be better. I’ve often suspected I was the problem.
I despise this changing.
Frayed and untidy  strands of my soul unravel  abandoned ruins  #haikuchallenge @baffled
Suppression.
Let go.
Slinking back into invisibility.
Extraneous existence.
Soul of a Winter's forest stark and silent ethereally dormant
"""...I realized the destructive power of sheer exhaustion. It is as deadly as any disease, and kills all joy in living."" ~ Simone de Beauvoir"
"We’d invent a new kind of love.  Just for us, from us, to each other."
Some people will ruin words for you.
"Her heart’s slaughterhouse splattered and smeared, pooling blood brilliant-cut rubies"
Your eyes  and mind eventually become accustomed to darkness
"Tear the midnight from my chest,  scatter the stars across my flesh"
Unfashioned creatures  writhing inside hearts desirous pneuma
Every lethargic thud of my heart feels like a tiny death.
"A hurricane of apathy has formed within me,  it swirls,  hellbent on pretty destruction"
The morbidity of existence.
I wish I felt like living.
"Acquainted with decay,  churchyards of beauty"
"She pretends she’s thunder,  an entity beautifully frightening"
Please refrain from shattering me further.
It’s lovely to feel appreciated.
Enticing spirit hopeful depression sustains future survival
Inured to worry.
Acutely possessed of wretchedness.
You’re still here?!
"A sky swollen with nostalgia, nebula memories of the dead"
Becoming pages of words that will yellow and gather dust  in a library destined to crumble
I could do with more unconsciousness in my life.
"Chord after chord,  chorusing the chaos"
Adorned with a crown of celestial splendor.
"Inspirited by daydreams,  fervent and vivid, undiscovered solitudes"
"Stagnant, untethered, maladapted."
"The sorrow possesses my soul, wholeheartedly"
The lethargy has encroached.
That was too easy.
"I am a vessel of crushed petals,  listlessly curling and decaying"
"Like a dark fairytale, I live in tragedy."
The tomb of existence.
The blurry darkness encroaches.
Chaotic apathy.
"Clouded heart, occluded and foggy."
It’s a shame you blocked me because I would sooo be retweeting you.
Time zones do not hide you from insomniacs.
The sky has taken my heart.
Don’t make me block you.
Composed of regret.
Haunted by the spirits of ‘what if’.
Insignificance.
"She’s part annihilation, part divinity."
"She’s part inspiration, part destruction."
Drown in your delusions.
4am insomniac ghosts.
A heavy silence their hearts skip multiple beats  her eyes locked with his  #HaikuChallenge
Altered.
Your words will make you come true.
Hewn out of melancholy.
"Shaped of howls,  of screams, piercing hallowed midnights"
Bloodstains and birdsong.
"My stowaway soul,  adrift in existence."
My liege
I’d rather be a raven.
"Praying to forests, the purest deities."
The silence starts where the sadness does.
"Pictures prove existence, thats why I refuse them."
"The darkest blooms adorn my skull,  clutch at my throat,  haunt my eyes as they cloud over with petals I am destined to drown in"
In another realm I may have survived better.
I am the epicenter of the abyss.
Stardust clouds my sight.
"I belong to horror. Morbid massacres and gruesome deaths, believing in this unreality manifests a somewhat peace."
I depend on no one.
Lovecraftian heart.
"Take me home, Moon."
At the shore of my soul my heart stands sentry a desolate warrior  warring with oceans
Not my cup of tea.
The moon  stitched  to midnight adorning  dark hours
"I pretend celestial bodies flow through my veins, the beautiful luminosity makes the darkness less dark."
Nonexistence insistence.
Are you the muse or the minstrel?
Dilettante of blood and forest blossoms.  pic ~ Natalie Ving
Struggling to soar above the torment.
Blooming stars scattering their dust enlivening souls and  brightening hearts
Wistfully waning as his perfect howls curdle my blood and shatter bone
Wavering between the forest and the grave.
Some days I just want to disappear into a forest.
Swooping spirits of a spectral sky  pic ~ Darragh Hehir
The internal war is worse than any external wars I battle.
"The tendrils of darkness reach out, coaxing me forward to her embrace."
Fun and fancy.
Noose of butterflies.
"Clenched by the melancholy in my mind, it seizes up peace and grips hope, squeezing and chocking and obstructing breath."
Overflowing full and searching for depletion numb capacity
The defiance of death  will eventually surrender
The atrocities our hearts put some of us through will never  heal.
Even your ghosts abandon you at 3am.
"submerged  mind, body, soul  pic ~ Natalie Ina"
Wandering lost aimlessly meandering yet not moving a step
Everything I give is for the abyss
"The trill of my heart, broken birdsong from beneath my breast"
Constellations bloom across my skin with his every caress of prose
Caught between your sadness and mine
"Promises of better, that dream has died with the stars"
"A cell made for spirits, steeped in nostalgia and created to crumble, my mind contains only death and figments"
"The language of darkness, lulling whispers of contentedness"
Mood
Smudging my soul.
Bury me in a graveyard of stars.
Butterfly bloodstream.
"Desolation agitates my mind, hurling fierce lightning bolts into bone and lashing my heart into wreckage."
"The tempest in my throat, the storm within my eyes"
I just wish I could believe it.
Let’s just pray I don’t wake up.
Constantly feeling blamed.
I detest being like this.
Nothing.
Moon healing.
"Clouds nestle within my skull, obscuring receptors and dousing transmitters, chemically calm"
I will abuse my mind harder than it abuses me.
Below the surface everything bleeds profusely she smiles serenely  #haiku
Got numb.
Laments of indigo discolor my heart slashing blood red  prose of pain
Stitching soul to flesh staving off abandonment of spiritual death
Howling gales assail my soul
Tempests inhabit my lungs and every ragged breath is drawn through lashing gales.
The guise slipped.
"If I ever do remove myself from this world, you can fucking bet it won’t be because of someone."
Existing painfully ever after.
As dead as the forests are alive
It’s all my own doing.
I’m hard work. Don’t bother.
Disheartened.
Blocked by another reply guy I ignored hah
I am as abandoned  as the stars are cherished by the sky
It’s only descending deeper into depression.
The thoughts get louder and deeper and begin to occlude it all.
Arranged by abandonment.
Concocted of chaos.
"Farewell notes penned in scarlet, slashed across corpse white flesh."
She scribes love letters and epitaphs across her heart.
"Elegies from the ocean, of her lamentable loss"
Im as empty as the seas are full
"More and more, not even caring is staining my soul"
‘The blood is love’
"Summon the blood, to entice the heart"
Our reflective stars mirroring chaotic souls drenched in splendid angst
Shattering in unison.
"Synchronized dark hearts, flailing as one."
"Every shadow is a ghost I long to embrace, long lost nostalgia that rises every dawn and pricks the back of my eyes and pummels my heart."
"Always a dying star, never a ray of sunshine"
Its exhausting constantly fighting yourself.
Perpetually shattering.
"Abandoned, haunted asylum worthy."
"A bed of earth, mossy logs, autumns worth of leaves petal against flesh"
"If you've ever blocked me,  play it for keeps, do not retreat"
A reclusive bird hiding in forest shadows coveting each dusk
I would just like to flower in peace.
I mostly feel like the thorny weed growing within the blossoming garden.
So much self flagellation my scars have scars
Some people are just designed to be destruction/destructed.
"My head is like a museum, a labyrinth of galleries decorated with cezannes and renoirs and dead eyed statues crumbling with ancient ruin."
"Her heart is lined with pressed flowers, delicate and fragile with age."
As pretty as pressed flowers between pages of Keats.
Ethereal fog rolls placidly through my veins.
Hoax heart.
Smother me in oblivion.
Conspiring maladies.
Depressive reveries.
My dark soul delicate glass  filigreed shards shatteringly ornate ruins
Meet me in the ether.
Take me.
Cutting her teeth across his ribcage
Hoarding trauma.
Too many coincidences to be coincidental.
"Her mind is a warning sign, a keep clear message flashing luridly."
The ruins are stored locked away in secret rooms collections of pain no intention to unpack no wish to revisit them
Composed of haunting dreams and chaotic delusions.
"She’s part existential dread, part death wish."
"Plucking petals, live, die, live, die"
"Provide me a sledgehammer, an axe."
I’d rather let go.
No one realizes my chains.
"The chains of nostalgia, jangling and shackling my prisoner heart."
She made her darkness sparkle.
The circles become more stained and dubious day by fucking day.
Belonging to beasts my soul snarls and howls a baying brute within me
"My heart lies dormant  slice skin, wrench my ribs apart reach in and save her"
Swallowing dirt to regrow the garden in my heart
Are you passages of scripture or ancient incantations?
"She’s part razor blade, part velveteen petal."
"She’s part muse, part dreamer."
I hold your every sky within my soul.
The unbreathed poetry that perches in your throat.
"Repaired by night, stitched back together with strands of luminous stars."
"Holding my heart down, clipping her wings."
Windchime soul.
"Black stars spilling from wounds, ripped from galaxies inside her ribcage."
"Wildflowers bloom across scars, obscuring blemishes and adorning imperfections."
"Bones to charcoal, flesh to ash"
"Everyone’s shattering is different and I don’t think you can ever really know how anyone else’s will feel.  It’s a sad, lonely process."
"There is never light, it’s always varying shades of darkness."
"I’d rather be an ancient, long lost forest today, adorned with moss and thickets of thorns to keep everyone out."
Ugh ‘an’
"Play my heartstrings like a violin, mournful and lamenting"
"Torment tumbles from my tongue, shredded heart spewing forth."
Feeding on razors.
"Feral and clawing,  fetid and corroding."
Craving the nothingness of obliteration.
"I’d rather be a ancient, long lost forest today, adorned with moss and thickets of thorns to keep everyone out."
Pretending.
"Coiled vines, beautifully choking the breath from my body."
Afterthoughts and apathy.
"Like a faint smudge, marring life."
Drawn to the unattainable.
"The texture of melancholy,  chilled and smooth but sharply edged with pointed vertices"
Chemical curation.
"Woven with sadness, the violence only hurts herself."
Silky eyes and a maroon pout.
I’d share my night sky with you.
A dungeon of demons  dwell in my skull
He composes a storm of sighs and gasps as her tempest swells.
"A slow dancing blade, dresses flesh in gems of ruby red"
"The words darken and stumble from her lips, twisting and flailing and screaming,"
A barbed wire tongue and lips like petals.
She’s a wicked hymn sang by haloed demons
Bleeding him from every open wound  into every poem penned
Lust an anthem of blood flowing faster  with every gaze every caress
You won’t find here  what you’ve lost
A mood that makes me want to lick your skull.
"Serpents in the skull,  hissing their hapless hatred"
Tempting oblivion until I can feel him within my skull again.
Kneeling at the dark altar of the church within my soul.
Building coffins for my heart.
"We painted love black, a darkness to embrace us, our kisses in shadows and caresses beneath night."
"Entangled; lips, legs, hearts"
"He conducts with strong hands and a warm mouth, composing our perfect symphony."
The butterflies are stirring within my veins.
He’s the wolf in her heart.
"All I can give you is my indigo night,  a cluster of stars to share and a sliver of moon to gaze upon"
He’s always the scream caught in my throat.
My demons tend my wounds.
"Of flowers and figments, stems as skeleton  pic ~ Mimmilie"
Your remnants are now excised.
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts
Limit my time with everyone
"Flesh against flesh, heart beat against heart beat"
"The house of my dead comes in dreams, fragments of misinformation, the reality absent, yet the ghosts haunt."
"He sheltered me from the ghosts of memories,  held my body and soul close to his, provided peace and solace and strength"
I dreamt of him with me in a house of the dead
These impenetrably dark hallways of me.
Tendrils clutch as  darkness creeps upon the hollow voids in blackened winds roaring around my heart
Lips like a loaded gun.
"The flowers flourish upon our flayed flesh, fluently and ferociously  aflame"
Lost in the forest of sadness.
She’s envied by stars.
Excise the malignancy.
"Jilted poetry, abandoned on her lips."
‘Abandoned breaths’.
Immersed in dark poetry. Mingling murder with melancholy and magic.
"Wrists offered, thorn or rose"
The violet eyes of her murdered stars.
Swallowing oblivion.
My lone war.
"I wish for abandoned ruins today, ancient sites of war and religion and magic and horror."
I have enough demons of my own to entertain.
When will looking back not hurt?
"Daggers buried in metaphorical flesh, surrendering to beautiful oblivion"
My bones sing with melancholy.
"Brittle heart, shards and sparkles"
"Butterflies pervade,  harmless bullets striking skin, smearing their life against ours"
"Her lingering virus,  a venomous heart,  putrefaction"
"Holding all the chaos in my ribcage, exhaling the ruinous beauty of my death."
"I’ll crawl to no one, apart from him"
A glutton for pure ruin.
"My heart, my life, dies in my throat, clenched and strangled over and over and over again."
Laced with malevolence.
The broken beats of his heart lay strewn beneath her pretty corpse
Her heartbeats reborn as thunder
"Like a blade,  sliding into your ribcage, you’ll feel every word of my poetry"
Infiltrator.
With her serpent tongue and halo of moonlight.
"Destruction, darling, is all I know."
"Fingertips tracing every beautiful word, every sad cadence  of your haunting prose"
Fluttering prose erupts from their blood to create butterfly souled girls  pic ~ federico bebber
The ashes of mutinous emotions strewn across my soul staining my heart
And even Night was in awe of her darkness.
Diseased.
Heart infiltrated by dissidents.
"Carnage litters my skull,  the debris of time, scraps of my being, violently ruined and discarded"
Heart clenched to a pulp.
Sink your teeth into my spine.
‘Everyone becomes a poet when their heart is screaming’.
"Exquisitely approaching the void, tiptoeing between the souls."
Adorned with jewelry of pain and apathy.
As pretty as an elegy and twice as sad.
;
Entrapment of soul within existence   pic ~ federico bebber
"She’s part butterfly priestess, part oblivion.  pic ~ federico bebber"
~ Manuel Lestheim
Curated insanity.
And they’ll gnaw at you marrow and sinew and heart
"Tormenting blood as thick as mud, lurches through veins, between organs, ensnaring every last scrap of life."
~ Charlotte Grimm
Don’t allow yourself to be stained by me.
Murder house mind.
"Normalcy is a wound, stagnant and rotting"
She wears opals as skin as pale and translucent as death
"Sadness dancing with melancholy,  a slow dance towards infinity"
I’m running out of excuses to explain my absences.
"Desiring only severed ties,  absent memories"
Craving only endings.
Beacons of sorrow brightly dotting the dark seas of melancholy  Holding her false heart hostage  as the waves pull her under
Where flowers are yet to bloom.
"The brittle parts of me, where nothing lives and I violently try to ignore"
"The assault of a glare,  and words as missiles. Do not underestimate."
You missed it.
Infiltrating tendrils.
"She is part gilded cage, part broken winged bird."
"I only want us to endure, together"
Resentful heartbeats rue the heart’s continued attempt at existence.
"What is this shadow that falls over me, blinding my heart and blocking my soul. Perching on my chest and flaying flesh, picking bones."
The girl made of thorns.
Following clouds off the edge of cliffs.
Chasing waves into oceans of melancholy.
"With axe and shield  we continue to ravage our demons like Vikings plundering, warriors warring"
Suppressing storms.
The strength in never letting go.
What’s that command to type in search to reset the people twitter displays?
"My conscience is clear, I’ve kept the rot in there at bay, so I’m happy to explain if I’m approached with respect."
I’m good at imagining the worst things.
I’m only her for the dm room split up and walk snd I’ll dlinknout leter.
I might seek out lithium and icecream.
I do not want to do this anymore.
"And I flail and wither, but not quite until death, but rather to a half death, infinitely worse."
"This playground of monsters and fetid souled demons, venom soaked hearts grazing innocents and baying for flesh and blood and sanity."
Feverish festering and black old wounds never close  but new ones infect
"Blood spills, warm, crimson rivulets"
Below existence.
No one knows.
Alone.
The scariest part is her own thoughts.
"Corpse heart,  dying to be alive"
Dissection.
Half in love with oblivion.
"Oblivion, like a lover"
"Flailing and writhing, the throes of death thresh against my skull, violently dying."
Ancient wars are fought within me.
"This throbbing emptiness inside my chest, dull and decimated, echoing the abyss of my heart."
Barbed wire heart.
"Butterflies lay dead within my soul, draped in the silvery dust of time"
Insignificance.
The mad leading the mad.
Hollow chambers vacuous spirit
The creeping vines can take me  pic ~ sylwia anna
A mood as peaceful as death.
Forget about me.
Her caress like a scalpel
Waning crescent heart.
"She’s part creature, part goddess."
Cradled in his eyes.
Hearts come undone and feast on the night.
Shaped of grief.
Immaculate darkness caressing and clawing
Webs of wrath.
‘I am alive at night I am dead in the morning’
I think in elegies.
Alive with impending doom.
All I hear is poetry.
These cthulhuian hearts of ancient emotion.
Mist silent and ethereal crawling across flesh snaking between ribs bloodless and spirit bound
"Long blade,  hilt deep"
Composed raindrops whispering melodies of melancholy
The inspired revulsion.
Those who try to start wars yet only manage a whimper.
Every shadow has talons snd claws and wants to expose your bones as much you desire to hide within them.
Your psychopathology is no match for mine.
"Standing sentry over the seas, I am forever the lighthouse"
Go play with your delusions.
The sickly sweet smell of decaying souls.
Orbiting this life.
Blood attracts blood.
Bad behaviour will get you exactly nothing.
Soul like a supernova.
She is simply a beautiful nebula in his night sky.
Light years pass between our silences.
Constellations of flowers bloom inside my skull.
Adorned with a blue moon and lilacs.
The girl with asteroids in her eyes.
Fluent in shattering my own heart.
Existing alone is second nature to me.
She’s pure carnage.
"She’s part magick, part delusion."
The girl with a galaxy in her ribcage.
Strychnine tea and cake.
Black apparitions cascading through the broken  realm of my vague heart
Voodoo heart.
At this point I exist purely as oblivion.
Winter resides in my heart eternal.
Pray to the flame.
Winter has ushered Autumn away.
Damnation and dahlias.
My cemetery is full. Fuck off.
When you want to feel it more than you actually do.
Don’t flinch.
Abysmal and yet beautifully celestial dying stars demand her light
The irony is delicious.
Black souls are always betrayed by the light.
Writhing soul erratic death throes  manic  heartbeats  tragically  beating
Graveyard heart.
Heart afflictions.
Amethyst illusions.
Treacherous griefs barbed and thorny cling to sinew and clutch at heart
The humbling darkness.
The first death is always the most beautiful.
Wishes and hopes  destroy like landmines and aneurysms
Priestess of ghosts   pic - Paul Apal’kin
"Seated at a pew within my soul, this rustic church of me, my cloaked ghosts chant hollow-voiced hymns promising bitter sweet deaths and resurrections."
A semblance of uncivilized savagery.
Grief like a thorn that will rip flesh apart if not handled gently
Disconnection.
A posey of personality disorders.
Beasts and ghouls are worthier.
The gaslighting is vibrantly virulent.
"Endure thy demons, abide thy ghosts"
Such fragrant lunacy blooming beautifully
A sigh like a tempest.
Ethereal insanity.
Butterflowers 🦋🌸
"Here, have some nostalgia."
Rue the day.
Dirt-filled skull.
Mere ships passing under starlight.
I can’t recall where a lot of my days go lately. The hours blur.
Butchered sanity.
Die by the pen.
Heart attack. Attack heart.
Words more deadly than a dagger held against your jugular.
The perfection was our inevitable tragedy.
"The beasts, the brutes, the demons, they all claw at me, tearing flesh from bone and hope from heart."
Save your prayers.
"Unfelt emotions coalesce into waves. Some undulating prettily, others crashing furiously."
'What cannot be said  will be wept'
"Blind beauty, feel me don’t just see me  pic ~ Mira Nedyalkova"
Of clouds and vetiver.
"Crystalline waves smash, beautifully bruising with such soft violence"
The piercing apathy cuts through sinew and skin soul and spirit
"Perpetually half dead, the decay blossoming through stem and leaf, thorn and petal   pic ~ Lucille Jean Kiwan"
"The force of seas,  harmonically in rhythm with the blood streaming through my veins"
This furor in my bones.
"My path, lined with lilacs and lamentation."
Blocking is mute when the deranged have a billion alts.
Bays for blood ring out from my soul.
My shores littered with debris of soul and sanity
I’m remnants abandoned by ancient ghosts  in this amaranthine darkness
"Stitched with threads of silvery starlight,  my wounds are protected by the heavens"
Trees are glowing autumnally
I know all the enemies.
"Deeper than oceans,  darker than winter woods"
Poetry wielded like a blade.
Sedation and pseudo serenity.
Violets and Valium.
"I think in syllables some days, arranging thoughts into words into poems"
"And she bled out, word by word."
"Petals and blood,  thorns and flesh"
Hold the grotesque vampires in your heart whilst speaking the divinity of angels.
"The words come, shrieking in protest, as I force them into tragic prose."
Clotting clouds obscure my view. There is no way out.
I want to be anyone else but me and anywhere else but here.
Books are so much better than people.
I’m blocked. I must be important .
Would the trash kindly see herself out. I’m tired.
The silence of being unremarkably pathetic.
You simply have no notion of truth.
Apathy will be my undoing.
Grievous bodily harm is not enough.
I’m working up quite a collection.
"I have storm clouds to placate, I’ve no time for narcissists."
"Anyone who associates with her, kindly see yourself out."
I wish I could infuse the most lovely peonies into my heart to replace the barrenness.
Scarred hearts and dying stars make a perfect couple.
"Fire bullets, get missiles in return"
Too late.
Two psychopaths is better than one.
"The decay spreads, from flesh to blood to spirit."
I forever huddle in the heart of the beast.
You know who keeps an accurate and exhaustive track of avi/name changes? Twitter.
I desire only sanctuary at this point.
Dead zone.
You have no hope in hell anymore.
Practice what you preach.
It’s cute how you think you can hurt me though.
Ravens will always be my alibis.
Drawing blood.
I am destructively alone.
Nothing is the right thing to say.
"Until you’ve lived it, you’ll simply never understand some things."
"Wretched, pretty things."
There is poetry in spilt blood.
The stinging sadness like slits to a pale wrists.
As you were.
What’s the word for wanting to be left alone whilst wanting to be be talked to forever.
Floating beneath the surface.
Comas and cedarwood.
Murder scene asylum and chill
Slithering through your limbic system.
Drown me Drown in me  pic ~ cassio meireles
Goddess of rot.
Death and diazepam.
Beneath this skin roiling creatures bleeding and howling
Mist upon the hamlets.
Deity of oceans.
Snarling and snapping.
They don’t care.
Dreams of monsters and mermen  subdued indigo lagoons under stern silver moons  Shattering to nightmares  evil casts shadows swallows it all taking me with it
You don’t know.
"Swimming through the ichor of my loneliness, creatures pull me under as hands wave me past."
"Future is an ugly word, it provokes anxiety."
Only the dead are on my mind right now.
"The absence of resurrection tolls true to my soul. Lifeless and scarred I wander through reality, one foot in my beautiful grave."
"The ghosts of nostalgia have taken up residence in my heart, scratching and clawing and biting their way through my soul."
The nighttime nourishes my soul.
Through suffering  you learn to comfort the sufferers
She looks like the saddest Shakespearean sonnet you’ve ever heard.
Sneaky people making fake accounts to target others are amongst the worst of the worst.
"With this bleeding crown atop my skull, I kneel before Darkness, at his merciful, beautiful will."
"As silent as death, that is how I desire my heart, my demons."
Autopsies and apathy.
Peonies and postmortems.
Lithium laced.
"Part dire wolf, part girl"
My ship  destined to sink  Fated darkly a journey to sorrow Never to be worsted ruined hull of heart
Tears of ink streaming down my page rivulets blurring beautifully  escaped emotions
Mood  pic ~ Reka Coti
Homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
"This invocation, a chanted prayer for the skies to take me."
Oblivion and peonies.
"Barbed spirits inhabit my soul, thorny demons drawing my blood and tearing my mind to shreds."
"Awaken my melancholy, caress it."
Conspiring with forests.
"Complete darkness, total absence of light"
Not fit for society.
Little buds of self doubt have blossomed within me forever and now I’m a beautiful garden of anxious flowers.
The boy with mischief in his soul.
Why won’t everything and everyone just leave me alone?!
"No beauty,  only blight."
The answer might be homicide.
"Voice like a forest,  heart of the breeze"
"Soul like Jupiter, heart like Mercury"
"My walls built up high a laid bare soul, my battle wars could not defeat"
Drained from reality.
"Waterfalls of spirits,  sojourning home to my heart."
My demons piled up like skulls in catacombs  reminders and trophies.  Walk my foggy path  come and visit play amongst my ruins.  For even my ghosts get lonely
"Full moon return me home to where I’m with the earth skin to dirt, decaying flower renew"
"A voice like rain, a heart like thunder"
The darkness coruscates like diamonds.
I am the overflow.  Spilt.
The same tired bullshit.
"I understand, I don’t want to be dragged under and drowned by me either."
From the sea.
I would prefer to be levitating somewhere in a misty wood today.
The oeuvre of my melancholy.
"A cursed divination,  of holy hell."
My subconscious is a witch.
Inhabited by wraiths.
"Play the game, blur reality, get through."
This stalking sadness.
I wish.
My words may be pretty and stringed fanciful together but I’m not.
The point has been obscured.  I don’t know why I continue.
Lavender and oblivion.
"The darkness rarely lets me down, yet I fear I am always failing him."
"Sparrows dart between my bones, a constant vigil they keep."
Loveless Soulless
I fear the castles inside me will never be rebuilt again.
A curation of trauma and grief.
I resonate with darkness. We inhabit each other.
"The museums of my heart, housing ancient ruins and long lost works of art, incomplete and gathering dust."
"I wait for the sadness to abate, to go dormant, to ascend to the sky.  But it never does."
"I never desired the entire sky, but I didn’t expect it to condemn me either."
"Lingering in magic, in the pretend places, as my soul dies another death every day I have to force reality."
Blood flooded with wildflowers and hellfire.
Emotional intelligence is becoming a lost form of art.
"This charade of life is killing me, grotesquely and horrifically."
"The nib slashed, her ink bled out."
The echoes thunder a Hellenistic hymn  to my heart
I’ll dress up my darkness however I see fit.
"I walk this crooked path,  paved with nostalgia,  following sadness home."
"And I, the hallucination of ravens."
Composed of figments and melancholy.
Caressing the chaos in your head.
"The intoxicating scent of ancient pages, the feel of weathered leather."
Serpent tongue delivering the prettiest prose.
"Anyone can have the light, but it takes a certain person to be able to hold the darkness and not let go."
The coexistence of loneliness and being alone.
"The patience of depression,  he lingers maliciously  and will never be hurried from your soul."
"My soul is like a ghost. A wispy, transparent thing, here but not, sad memories of what used to be."
"She is created of symphonies and sorrow, butterflies and blossoms."
"Some seeds sown in the mind will grow into thorny brambles that claw and tear your thoughts, memories."
"And it looms somberly, this twilight heart of mine. The eventide shadows deepen as violet and grey and midnight stain my flesh.  #vsspoem #poetry"
The approach of winter revives my soul.
Winter caresses my cheek like a lover.
Deep autumn demands reverence.
My world is copper and marigold and crimson with autumnal stains.
"If I can’t destroy myself and everything around me after continuous daily attempts, you certainly won’t."
"Your scars are war stories,  sagas of strength and words of willpower"
Pretending the monsters don’t exist don’t make them go away.
Her pitiful search for relevance.
Abysses occupy my soul.
Voids inhabit my heart.
Stupid is as stupid does.
A harlot’s heart.
Tarts and their hearts.
"I have had my fill of real life today, give me magic and whimsy and pretend."
They are simply awful human beings.
The irony of people is killing me.
"""I am not empty. I am full to the brim with murder and revenge. I am overflowing and I do not think you wish for me to overflow on to you."""
Don't banish the flowers from your heart completely.
Do not believe the narcissistic and mean witches.
Some days I feel like rigor mortis has set in before my full death is complete.
"He is the constant and consistent wave,  smoothing my edges, my sharp corners"
Goddess of dirt.
Paranoia pleasantries.
"Slow drops of melancholy, a stalactite created. Sharply pointed to stab savagely at my soul."
"Waning moon, disappearing beam by beautiful beam."
You know those days where you simply  want everyone and everything to disappear and leave you alone.
Functional girl ghost with the heart of mist.
"She’s the winter breath, inhaled deeply, that settles into your bone."
"The spectacle of shattering, the wonderment of piecing back together"
"Earth to earth, the dirt buries my soul, suffocates my body. I am returned."
"This possession, held hostage to my ghosts, a beautifully violent siege"
"Burying my breaths, the ragged inhalations beneath flowers, the pretty façade"
My north star seems to be sadness.
Born into the dark from the dark
Living as scavengers this creature of exhaustion
I’d rather be unconscious.
‘The moon is the mother of pathos and pity’
The heart still beats despite the half dead soul.
"I’m in that realm, where you function automatically but tiredness has removed all other aspects of life."
Ghost stories and gothic horrors are penned on the pages of my flesh and bone.
Darkness  a plethora of depths my constant  a fathomed galaxy an eternal inamorata
"On the edge of a scream,  the precipice of my soul, is always him."
The shelter of darkness.
He dreamt about me last night.
Ravish my darkness.
"His set lips, my complete undoing."
Her arsenal consisted of a faint smile and shy gaze.
Those who listen and hear versus those who simply wait their turn to speak.
A sacred morning frosted fingers grasp the earth in Winter’s embrace  #haiku
Within the column  of the living I blearily sit
"My heart, like poems that hang in the air before breaking into a thousand tiny pieces."
Being in his dreams is sultry as hell.
Expectation is a dark mistress.
My patience for this rubbish is waning.
"Broken wings, shattered halo"
From the ruins I observe my further demise
Garland of sadness achingly rests at my throat pearlescent and lush  #haiku
Graveyard eyes.
Soul occlusion.
Honor the forest.
Forever chasing butterflies.
The eternal undercurrent of desirous oblivion
Narcissists squealing about narcissism.
But the echoes sometime close in and suffocate you.
"I feel taken by a tsunami of sadness, tossed and battered and clutching and clawing for escape."
"Darling, I’m amazed your black heart feels anything."
The dirty soul and ugly heart will betray you in the end.
"Our hearts, like the stars, refuse to be ignored."
I am having a bout of wanting to ruin everything.
Watch out for the silences of certain people; they read like a saga.
Me soul crawls lurches across the ruins the chaos searching for asylum  or a peaceful death
"Inadequate soul a darker, sadder shadow of the other girls"
No one is worth any of this.
Kicking up a merry hell.
Snarls of the heart.
"Float or fall,  I never fly"
Perfectly flawed  these immaculate failings  stain me
Her dirty mirror the decayed reality  of dark delusions #Haiku  pic ~ Emily Hansell
I am a dark replica of a real girl.
I always feel like I’m trespassing on normality.
"I constantly feel like I’m shrouded in a stain, marked with a dirty, inferior smear."
Forlorn ghost and dark hearted witch.
Didn’t I block you already..?
"The days condemn, the nights acquit"
I’ve grown to detest the word ‘love’. It has been recklessly flung around so often that it has lost any significant meaning.
Screaming in the shadows that everyone has forgotten about.
"I don’t really know  where my pieces were lost, strewn along a past path  #Haiku"
"I’m not cold, I’m just empty and apathetic."
My words seem inconsequential.
The wounds never heal Decay blossoms slowly and corrodes the remaining soul
I have so little fire these days.
"It’s the fragile, pure-hearted ones who always fade beautifully away."
Emmanuelle Brisson
Sometimes the mind makes terrifying demands.
Fleeting life Impromptu death  Pic ~ Katia Chausheva
The disenchantment of being.
Nothing of consequence.
My ribcage burns the fire inside has seared and blackened I’m ash and embers and charcoal
Some of us are darker than others.
My harvested heart unto the ether an empty rib cage  still feels phantom beats the pseudo palpitations remain and shock
He grew her like a flower  then watched her bloom
"I live in the background, shadowed, hidden to most"
So starved of real life The forgotten sentience Resuscitate me  #haiku
The universe consistently fails to answer me.
"Rose garden at twilight / Rose garden at dusk  (self-portrait, Rzesz óww, 2021)  ~ Kamila Kansy"
Nestle inside my skull
Heart of thorn.
Delusions of meaningfulness.
Aligning myself with midnight.
Mosaicked soul heart shattered and sharded  etched as if with daggers scarred wings of sorrow  pic ~ chrisfriel
I wish in my pages that everything  was how it used to be
Like crumbling ruins I’ll nestle and succumb
It’s easy to mistake my silence for coldness.
Such an utterly perfect darkness.
Musty and brittle yellowed pages of my soul torn out one by one  #poetryin13
Ripples in the darkness.
Expectations for nothingness.
Cocooning in oblivia.
Blood rites and winter nights.
Nothing means anything.
If melancholy was a flower.
"Selective memory doesn’t trump the truth, sweetheart."
I’ve never been good at forgetting.
Disordered and dark This mess we’re so deeply in Looks me in the eye directly
"The art of melancholia. Darkly toned elements, dully repeating patterns and jagged motifs. Starkly contrasted against hues of ebony and indigo and forest green.  pic ~ Daria Amaranth"
Arrayed moods   pic ~ Maria Hochhaus
A tempest is brewing.
Smooth out the sharp edges of my brain.
"When I try to ruin it all, don’t let me"
An impeccable mess.
Self destructivism.
Let’s go astray.
Ancient rites for aching nights.
We’re all simply poems Some classical sonnets Others fading elegies
Darkness is a vigilant mistress.
In the stitches of darkness I find my religion
Protect my words and I’ll deliver you my soul.
Blood rites and butterflies.
I’d search every abyss to find you.
The hue of beauty  emanating from your heart ethereal halo
Escaping demons is an art form.
Everything I know divides into before and after. Then and now. When I was alive versus now that I’m a ghost.
Wading through the malaise.
We are the debris of time.
Time skips past me  as I wander my dirt path dazedly
I do not really feel like convincing anyone of anything.
"My altar, beautifully adorned with dirt and decay and moths."
Frenzied heart.
"In love’s wound, darkness infects."
A tiara of narcissus.
Ashes to ashes Blood to blood  pic ~ Wolf’s Kurai
Composed of regret and lamentation.
Your authentic vileness always creeps back in.
"Mouthful of ink, spitting prose"
"Keep your dysfunctional, maladaptive self away from me."
I much prefer the fucking abyss to people.
On the outside I’m placid and serene and quite opposite to the decaying filth and rabid demons eating me alive on the inside.
The deepest loneliness hits when you are with people. The ones who have no idea of the turmoil tearing you apart inside.
Eternally parrying with demons.
Trees whisper secrets that only the pure of heart may hear.
"These bruised words of mine macabre, melancholic yet straight from my soul   #haiku"
The exhaustion of being empty.
I’ve lost enjoyment again.
The dark in me can sense the dark in you.
Heart full of mourning wreaths.
Head full of tombs.
His fingers on my lips.
A tornado of thorns.
A mouthful of moths.
Flowers in my eyes.
The sky comes undone when she cries.
She is the prettiest sad poetry.
Tethered to spirits Tethered by spirits
She is the saddest prettiest poetry.
Grief causes the steadiest ships to pitch and yaw.
Kindness and loyalty.
pic ~ Monia Merlo
We begin in the dark and birth is the death of us ~ Antigone
The chords of sadness.
I am created of unfulfilled good intentions.
"Seated at a pew within my soul, this rustic church of me, my cloaked ghosts chant hollow-voiced hymns promising bitter sweet deaths and resurrections.  #salemverse"
The forests know your poison and will deal with you in time.
Some people simply do not deserve forgiveness.
"The threads of all fate weaving insidiously  between sinew, bone, destiny seeps into blood, our journey towards the end   #MadVerse"
"The moss and lichen, framed by decaying logs and blooming flowers would make a pretty grave"
"Part flower, part sad girl   pic ~ Rewinda Omar"
Small and unassuming is generally my intention.
"Starve the shadows, flood the darkness"
Darkness has a certain benevolence for sad people.
The ritual of butterflies.
"The darkened chaos of a tortured soul, harrowed such unkind living  #haikuchallenge"
Artificial life realities of pretend  a feigned existence
Elapsed memories  fluttering away like moths  beckoned to the flame
Communing with ghosts rather than with the living they give dark comfort
Forests gaze solemnly into our souls.
"She feels like a breeze, but her soul is a gale."
The shades of shadow dove grey and lilac to black bruised hues for hiding  #haiku
I’d dissect your heart with a rusty scalpel.
Seduced by existential angst.
I’d like to dissect your darkness.
"Your absence fatigues my soul, my heart,  like blood draining from a body and leaving only lethargy"
Rustling leaves in a stilled breeze.
The undoing of my soul  by his poetry
Love stories told in stained glass window panes.
"A raven perches within my ribcage, always preparing for battle"
"Brambles and briars  have overgrown my limp heart thorns ripping, tearing"
A forest grows within my ribcage.
Sad girls resurrect as butterflies.
Deep and guttural  the chorus of her silence sheltering his heart  #haikuchallenge
All the beautiful words decay on your tongue.
Stay away.
Do not purport to think you are the only one to ever have suffered.
"Your dagger gaze, penetrative"
The forests will always protect the innocent.
In my head Ive buried you a million times already.
"I’ve experienced too many funerals, real and imagined"
Cloaked in flame.
Sheltered and haloed
The moon approves of our darkness.
"Half stone, half flesh"
It’s only confirmation bias but continue to play make believe
"Venomously sick  the haggard heart gouge her out excise her malignancy  Ghismonda with her lover’s heart, Bernardino Mei"
Adorn me with wings and I'll speak with ravens.  pic ~ Natalia Drepina
And you’ll never know my darkness either.
The hardest part is getting over the remembering.
Midnight will be more chaperone as I try to calm.
"Comfort eludes me tonight, physically and spiritually"
Deciding you’re a ‘good’ person without evening attempting to right the vile and many wrongs of your past.  Just fucking no.
You cannot absolve your own sins with flowers and quotes.
"Like an ocean at night, serene but with untold violences"
"The truest friends, I think, don’t require anything of you, just for you to be well."
"‘Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon’"
The ocean lays wrecked at the bottom of my heart
Flint of heart.
"Blown off course, unable to find my true north."
She is simply His poetry
Sad girls make the most beautiful graves.
A humble servant of melancholy.
A willing subject of darkness.
"The forest, my liege"
"My heart of sticks, all empty branches and absence. This melancholy, an oppressive balm of  fallen promises.  Once blooming and full, my canopy of colors have disappeared into the fog."
Some doors you need to close and barricade for your sanity.
A cemetery of broken stemmed flowers.
"At this point the melancholy isn’t just in me, it’s a part of me. And I worry I’ll never be able to escape it."
Neuroses and poetry.
Wrapping poetry around my wounds.
Love hearts and arrows
Averted heart shunning and shunned
The frantic clutching  clawing wildly for purchase  we fall together  #haiku
In every pale grey shadow I wait.
Desperately seeking actualization.
Massive Smiths mood.
The creeping moss and lichen hide my scars.
My epitaph  inscribed upon your heart
Oil painted colours  mutated crimson and gold shimmering with dust artistic flecks on canvas an eternal masterpiece  #TankaThursday
Consorting with the skies.
Walking barefoot over the shattered pieces of her heart.
gleaming and taunting the finely honed silver edge of my sharpened heart  #MadVerse #haiku
"Kiss my wrists, my throat your lips will feel the tempest you create in my veins"
The presence versus the absence.
Fluent in fathoming shadows into fortresses.
"The impregnable sky, I sit, rewriting stars into love notes and requiems"
"Night gives way, a new day to stain me with poetry or pain"
"Melancholy, my lore etched on every one of my bones"
"Lured in by pretty possibilities,  the thorns then ensnare, tear skin or spirit  #Poetryin13"
Fluent in butterfly.
Living can be a fate worse than death.
Fae of heart.
Being wounded from the wounds others are suffering.
Feeling next to useless.
Fluent in misty and ethereal winter woods.
Dusk falls and stars shoot; the sky is anything but tender
Tear off her petals to find her soul.
Hide your demons with roses.
The stars align with my sadness nightly.
The little things I remember  that others don’t  are what hurt the most at times
The secrets our lips would press into each other.
"Part fairy ring, part hellfire."
And I’m here  caught between  my mind  and my demons
Kiss your darkness into me.
"The waves speak, chant, promise you your heart’s desires"
Flayed by invisible demons.
"Swallowing words, dreaming poetry"
Too many darknesses have taken root and overgrown my heart.
Some words destroy everything while others resurrect civilizations.
"But sometimes words don’t work,  sometimes they’re not enough"
"I can see all of your colors,  true or not"
Peonies and poetry.
"I am composed of absences, things taken or left or departed"
I am all broken pieces but I conceal them well
Forests recite poetry if you listen carefully enough.
"Blind and doubtful, as I stumble around with bandaged eyes"
Write your silences.
I don’t share my vulnerability with just anyone.
Exposed to every stray arrow of thought.
A sky full of art
Eyes of swirling fog tsunamis of dark promise your soul they will have  #haikuhorrorprompt #haiku
A bell jar contains my heart and I wait for the day when it will violently shatter.
"The hymns,  mellifluously floating between my ghosts,  tell of tribulation and salvation, pretty bedtime stories"
"Born of beginnings,  existing of endings"
"Come, dissociate with me  pic ~ nona limmen"
mesmerizingly lyrical   pic ~ ezook
I often daydream about being with the forest on a misty winter’s dusk.
Wielding wrath with her impetuous ink.
Wrapping midnight around my little finger.
Wanting to be alone but not wanting to feel alone are paradoxically tragic.
Our sighs became a tempest.
You never see the mental wounds.
I took my peace for granted  and then I became a war
Shadows so fleeting  as scratches of dawn  dapple eyelids and sleepy sighs  skin against skin embracing his shadows  #BlackDahliaProse 685
A key  to lock a box with my sadness tucked away inside
"Drowning in blood, resurrected in flame"
Daydreams spun of blood and butterflies.
A pretty little aquamarine dream.
The most exhausting thing is pretending to be alive.
The ruins only enhance her ethereal beauty.
Moody and amorphous I continually exist
Bound to butterflies.
"Yes I’ve survived before, and yes, I will again but bloody hell I’m tired of it."
Eyes cut from an unblemished emerald.
"Some days I’m the fog, others I’m a fugue."
Why can’t I just write it all away.
"I’ve lost track of the light, the end of the tunnel is just too far"
My words have run out. I only have sighs left.
shrieks and screams ascend skimming the surface of lips shattering silence  #SlamWords #46thEdition #haiku
The arduous voyage of survival.
How to escape the snares of mind. How to flee the pangs of soul.
The wretchedness of depression.
Her amorphous heart lucidity of torment a coma of love  #slamwords #46thEdition #haiku
insomnia swirls  hurtling down the rabbit hole  drowned in consciousness  #slamwords #46thEdition #haiku
"Composed of death, my corpse will be my final and loveliest sonata."
"My grief is gathered and arrayed prettily,  like bouquets of amaranthine peonies"
Soul of a churchyard.
"Inevitable, merciless oblivion."
And her sole lover was terror.
The night knows my truth. The deeply hidden truth that I shroud constantly. The truth that I am ashamed of.
The flame has my heart.
Incantations of blood and wildflowers.
I’ll be your beautiful omen.
Oceans bloom.
Ancient cemeteries at dusk impress me.
The girl with the heart of a wolf.
Shaped of loneliness.
"I’m more frightened of the light than I am of darkness, for darkness holds the night, who holds the moon and all her protective stars."
"Lost with my demons, your soul found me."
"Here, let me carry your demons."
My melancholy is more prosaic than poetic.
Eulogize me.
Block me harder.
"‘Every word has consequences. Every silence, too.’"
Lost between a growl and a gasp.
The monster in my mind.
I’d rather be a forest.
Locking doors do not keep them out.
The wreckage in my chest.
The dirty little thing that is my heart.
Of dark forests and tears.
"Razor blades across my tongue, bloodied prose"
Thorns behind my eyes.
Razored emotions.
Dagger thoughts.
"Lips on my ear, he whispered to my bones razored lullabies hyperarousal, chemicals course breath quickens synapses explode ice entwines my veins, heart, soul exhilaration  fear"
Melancholic lust Seraphic lips pouting with their fatale vermilion A divine experience
"Feeling unsad, unanxious, such foreign emotions. I don’t know how to assimilate them,  I simply cannot recall."
I’m apathetic and nothing else matters.
"When all I had were words, you took them away"
"descension halfway between death and hell of soul tumbling, slipping beneath the flames  #Poetryin13"
Your mind pressed firmly against mine
"I’m not anything today.  Nothing as usual, just more so."
The anatomy of melancholy  ~ Kamila Kansy
I don’t need anyone No one needs me Copacetic
Sinking my teeth in.
"Stay or stray, there is no in between"
Wreathed ivy cascades ancient palatial ruins strangled so by time  #haiku
Thoughts roam busily from neurons to synapses transmission complete   #HaikuChallenge
The melancholy is me. I am it.  It has inhaled me deeply and held its breath.
Cavernous voids are my kink.
Skulls and poetry and candles and lavender stems.
Poised for tragedy.
I need to enjoy some autumnal leaves.
A Heaven-sent hell.
"the pathology of loneliness  malicious, insidious degenerative of spirit and flesh"
A howling inertia.
Love spread her arms.
Blessed or burning
"The shoreline glistens beneath a tortured midnight moon jeweled, silver gown  #haiku"
A heart full of twittering swallows.
Subjects
This habit of existence.
Mood  ~ Teresa W Photography
"Your touch sets fires, while your words inflame them."
"Self admiration is fine,  to a certain point, and then it’s just ugly"
Some days are lived deeper in the dark than others.
~ Anne Silver
"Warrior goddess, of blood and of bone, side by side with my demons I fight an inevitable and eternal war"
"My belief wanes. In love, in flesh, in blood but never in darkness."
"The cracks are there,  I’ll just never let you see them"
"Some days I contain the ruins, other days I am the ruins."
I lingered too long in the darkness snd eventually became her.
Gather your pieces and continue on.
"The stars are my kin, and the ravaging oceans, the ancient forests."
I wish I could capture the moon.
The moon is stunning tonight.
Just be there when she inevitably comes undone.
Where the moonlight never quite reaches.
My obituary.  pic ~ wolf’s kurai
She is the most harrowing loveliness.
"Some days I swallow the darkness,  other days it swallows me."
~ Louis Rakovich
~ Garmonique
Waning.
We always believe we can stop wars until we become them.
calm the buzzing mind and subdue the queen within a placated hive
Thy name is Endure.
Rising from the dark depths of my coral grave I penetrate and ascend wild crests  for home
A life tantamount  to death
One day she’ll just flutter away.
Meet me in perdition.
An autopsy for emotions.
Dream-like.
The anatomy of melancholy  ~ Kamila Kansy
Eternally dreaming in indigo.
Dead ghost girl walking.
I imagine my demise often.
My soul is writ in winter.
An ocean of exhaustion
Just as you are.
Tea lights and vetiver and open windows in winter.
"The pieces have scattered on the wind,  I may never be whole again"
The emptiness resonates whenever I stop.
I never realized someone like him could even exist.
A gallery of your perfect flaws.
Moonlight psychology.
Hearts like ours will always end up as embers.
Suicide and stardust.
"Tear the poetry from my tongue, my heart."
His lips are my poetry.
We share the same rain.
Composed of crumbling gothic tombs.
Born of blood and butterflies.
Blow out the candle the moonlight will navigate  your soul into mine  #HaikuChallenge
Murder and moonlight.
"Soul of an ocean, at times he serenely laps and ebbs, but mostly he crashes and ferociously destroys himself"
"A smear, a blur only dimly glimpsed by many apart from him  Pic ~ Philippe Conquet"
Some girls will become the forest if they’re lucky.
The goddamn beautiful lies.
Gypsy hair tangled with butterflies  and moonlight
"A pristine cathedral on the outside, a ruined battlement on the inside."
Butterflies and bones.
Thirteen echoes chime  and I’m rendered mute the pleasure and pain of silence dances throughout glimmering and shattering but my mind darker than death can only scream into my void eternal disquiet
Pervasive nightmares imaginary demons nemeses of soul
Her eyes are always in mourning.
If only I could preserve my heart like pressed flowers between the pages of classical poetry.
Lost between a whimper and a war cry.
"I, mostly, do not feel worthy."
"The decay piles up, rot by rot by rot"
There is a cemetery within my ribcage.
I’ll pick up your pieces every single time.
I only exist in shadows.
Seraphic cumulus skies.
Your heart on my sleeve
The intimacy of falling apart in the arms of someone.
Be her every breath.
Leave her breathless.
The angst flows within my veins.
"Tender ghosts, consoling the sorrow"
Melancholic and elegiac.
Existing vicariously within every lamentable elegy.
Emotional bloodlust.
Your playlist is my safe place.
Nightmarishly lucid.  pic ~ Katia Chausheva
Desiring to be someone’s everything instead of my own nothing today.
"The silence, like a dagger"
The emptiness echoes within my heart and  without you.
He’s my wolf in mortal clothing.
"Blooming a little, with every sad poem"
"The echo chamber of my mind, and all it’s divine ghosts."
As hauntingly beautiful as a Chopin prelude.
The catharsis of rainy mornings and beautifully dark aesthetics.   pic ~ Wolf’s Kurai
Mood   Pic ~ Wolf’s Kurai
A heart composed of tragedy and butterflies.
Classically trained heart.
"Sober hearted, a solemnity of sorrow"
Our souls rise together  as our bodies fall apart
Untold moods constantly bound through my heart with every beat.
"Him, the lamentation within my elegies."
The gilded cage of my delusions.
"Her, a sacred fortress."
"Him, a tempest riddled angel."
From flame to frozen between life and lunacy  beautiful schisms  #haiku
"Writing poetry, healing wounds"
The intensity of my apathy.
"You, the flame, extinguished"
Your heartbeat a war cry
Your sword tapping at my shield
Your wars forever behind my eyes
The peace you grant to my wars.
Craving escape.
"A calamitous girl, ruinously sad"
I want to get lost in the prose.
"She, a tragically beautiful poem."
Your ink absolves me.
Write me into a reviving poem.
Clutching at shadows.
My reeling and convulsive mind.
"A reverie untouched by anxious dreams, slow and soft,  with him"
My chalice is dwindling.
If I don’t give you anything you can’t hurt me
I relinquished all dependency on anyone years ago.
The empty absences.
His darkness is all the poetry I need.
We’re all just stitches unraveling together
Crucified on your lips.
I imagine simply holding your hand.
I’m content here in my real make-believe realm.
How do you dispel the uneasiness?
"Lead me, entice me down the path and through your heart, ending in embrace  #NRRTG #humpdayhaiku"
There is a certain comfort in sonder. An appeasing of one’s soul.  Realizing you are not the only one feeling broken or the only one blossoming alone with no one to witness.
I feel like a mere dust mote.
"Inhabited by sirens, beautiful, luring, destructive"
"Breathe in, breathe out, get it done"
"Playing with fire, daring your flame"
Sepia daze.
A life astray strained and frail afraid and flayed
I promise
‘Until one of us makes the other one come true’
I must away to the sea flee these figments and follies
This place  where I am that doesn’t know time
A hamlet’s ethereal mist.
Longing to destroy herself and  everyone around her.
Undulating moods pulled like the tides by the moon  a violent force
Disquiet dispersing
Metastasizing unease
"We all just want that one thing for ourselves, from someone else. That private thing only we share."
"Like the moon, be a gentle and beautiful influence."
He is a gale of wind that rebukes my storms.
"Tormented by figments, enjoying antipathy"
He can read my mind and my silence
Anchor at the harbour of my heart.
Something quiet and gentle.
Beacons of sorrow brightly dotting the dark seas of melancholy  Holding her false heart hostage  as the waves pull her under  #vsspoem
memories as a tsunami crash lap surge leaving nostalgic debris  littering your soul  #Poetryin13
Such vile deception is always remembered.
A decaying flower by any other name.
Composed of echoes.
Composed of endings.
Overtures of screams.
Infuse me with ink  so I may become a true tragedy
Seep into me.
Infuse me with stars so I may adorn the  darkness.
"Bleeding brokenness, all the badness forcing its way out, away."
"My soul, a chimera of nightmares. Lurking and prowling and ravaging, she razes my days and defends my nights."
I want to retreat to the shadowy comfort with my delusions
The demons are conspiring against my ghosts today.
"Trudging through existence. The heaviness weighs constantly, the murk and the mire tugs at my soul and skin."
That unattainable chasm between appreciating what you should feel and actually feeling it.
"Beautifully blurred, she is my heart, my soul  Pic ~ markkinrade"
"The dagger sits permanently under my rib, the only discernible difference is the wound depth."
The gleaming midnight plumage  of my wings
Don’t stumble there are always crows waiting to pick your bones
The prelude to lust can be most godly or monstrous.
I want to be inside the sky.
"He piques my inspiration, arouses my apathy"
Never wield emotional blackmail as your weapon.
Melancholic lust Seraphic lips pouting with their fatale vermilion A divine experience  #SalemVerse
I’m very protective of my circles.
Seduce me with your mood disorder.
I cannot devour enough books and poems and beautiful prose.
"Essences of joy substances of soul, spirit caressing senses pricking nostalgic echoes summoning ghosts and demons  #BlackDahliaProse"
My liege.   pic ~ matthias luege
‘I measure every grief I meet’.
Bury me here.
Absence accumulates over my head like a heavy sky.
The smile she keeps for you.
My sin on his lips.
There’s no aphrodisiac like sharing your darkness.
The poetry of blood red against lily white.
Slip into the eternal midnight of my skull.
I miss you like sleep.
"Heart of wood, seared, splintered"
The anticipation of rain.
Escorted from the light by Darkness.
"Her lambent light, a muted radiance only few are favored to share"
"Today I’m sea spray. Fine shards of icy ocean, tiny daggers against your flesh, disappearing into the ether."
Predawn pitter patters
Mauve mood.
A breeze of silver fallen autumnal leaves dance their twirling encore
"Today I am a low-laying, mirage-like mist. Obscuring life and eventually, silently, disappearing into the day."
"Flesh of a girl, soul of a crow."
"Ascribed to you, I’m forever your poetry"
Fixated pupils A trance of the slain That dead-eyed stare No longer in pain  I removed his life From flesh and vein Most neat and tidy No messy bloodstain  #vssmurder
"Memories, echoes pressed between yellowed pages  an opus of soul"
"A tempest within At times, tranquil, but others tormenting ‘til death"
"Have you noticed how the most deafening silence swirls when it’s loudest? That shrieking within your skull, the spiteful demon of soul.  #MadVerse"
I feel like a fallacy today.
"The reviving nighttime,  a cathartic cleansing a restive reset"
Most days I consist of mere melancholy and valium.
The enduring sunset  disrobing light
"Strewn stars, as delicate as porcelain, solemnly adorning Midnight’s tiara."
Indisposable  and most undissolvable the sadness hovers  #haiku
"Some days the shadows hide you, but other days they spotlight your every damn flaw."
Dysthymic priestess.
Not statistically significant.
Take my breath.
Absolve me of my moods.
Beating heart betrayer.
"The elegance of the abyss,  imparting her most graceful assurance"
"Afflicted by life, by breath, by the beating of a heart."
"Just leave me with my echos, my figments. No one shall enter here today."
Absent of myself. Devoid.
"Shards of glass pricking my mind, gouging my amygdala, shredding my hippocampus."
Lurid life Macabre dreams
The darkness is a foe today. He is not comforting me but rather twisting a dagger slowly and malevolently into my skull.
Sweet surrender.
"‘Surviving’ feels like the most insipid, monotonous chore right now. I cannot see the light, I’m alone and broken. This strength I’m told I will develop, my scars that will become armor; when? It’s approaching ‘too late’."
Hopelessly nothing. Vastly evacuated. Existence lingers but desire is spent.
I float outside the window of life looking in. Although I’m not even sure I want to come in.
"The darkness commands my attention, always"
Just be on her side. Always.
"Heed the sky, she always steers true"
Fevered dreams of your words against mine.
I’ll forever pretend my walls aren’t crumbling.
The woman here now is very different to the girl I left behind.
Dismembered demons in my wake.
Weather is a powerful aphrodisiac.
Her turbulent seas massive voids of starlit depth minuscule relief   #StarWrites
"Each new week brings that uneasiness. It seems a most daunting, insurmountable task to overcome."
"Most days I’m composed of only exhaustion and a pretty, lingering  perfume."
Rain upon the roof like a metronome for the soul.
"Enduring angst, pain, together, thriving from it; that is true soul growth.  #haikuchallenge"
"Lone wolf, abandoned pack"
Don’t flatter yourself; you never mattered
"Some realms I abandon, others I’m cast from."
"Lusting for the feel of old books today. Wandering shelves, caressing spines with delicately discerning fingertips."
I wanna be adored.
"Sleeplessness crouches within; malingering behind my ribs, suppressed within my skull."
Your truth might be a bitter pill or a decadent treat. Swallow it anyway.
"Like a death rattle in my blood-filled throat, you bubble out and dissolve into the fine scarlet spray of expelled illness."
Guardian angels
Your relevancy will be concreted or withdrawn based on your behaviour towards towards others.
"The opium den of my soul. Opulent haze, smokily shadowed."
"Fostering guilt, allowing it in, is like inviting your demons to a tea party."
"Bartering hearts, such precious commodities, against profit and loss."
But is she really a fallen woman or a stray shooting star.
The horror festers but is hidden by the blossoming of prose. Beautiful words blooming over decay and molder. Bleeding wildflowers of poetry conceal ugly wounds of soul. An evenly composed symphony of delicate death and beguiling beginnings.
Lamentation and lust.
"Her putrescent soul, no beauty can revive."
"Without you dreams vanish, nightmares reign ichor runs through my veins thoughts become swords"
"Sufferance, a double edged dagger, delivers self understanding along with the desire for existence to cease."
"The darkness has not malignantly enveloped me,  I have benevolently embraced him"
"Never forgotten, but a semblance of forgiveness."
"Existing in dark profusion, dreaming in muted light"
"The ache of loss. A permanent star in my sky, wave in my sea. It permeates all crevices, saturates my vision and clouds perception. I view life as a potential loss - people, things, feelings, desires, you."
Without you everything is nothing realms blur oceans empty  the skies surrender
"Part girl, part midnight."
"I’m eternally trying to secret myself away. Guised, masqueraded. I covet frail shadows to dart in, darkness for my splintered soul to rebuild in and exquisite winters to retreat into, cocooning and snuggling myself whole again."
"Inside I’m obliterated, abandoned but I’ll never allow it to show"
Not obliterating; blooming
Absolution can always be found in the stars.
I seek words to feed my moods. Words to pen and those already penned.
My heart is a rosebush budding and blooming breaking and bleeding
I want to poison the infiltrating weeds.
I’ve forgotten how not to succumb to life.
"The gilded needle,  with which I will someday stitch myself back together"
Sometimes simply existing is your most alluring artform.
The poetry in healing.
I just want lusts; torrid and bewitching lusts.
I’m eternally waiting at the dusk for you.
Look for my shadow at the edge of your heart.
The depths to which I hide myself.
"The daytime is my foe. A constant struggle, a heavy guise, emotionally exhausting. But the night, she repairs me. I can coalesce, rejuvenate under her throes of midnight."
"She compelled wolves. With a whisper, a promise, a threat. They obliged their mistress, their gothic queen. An inextinguishable bloodlust, of both beast and beauty.   #horrorprompt"
Pretending at life is exhausting.
A mood for graveyards and poetry.
The darkness flourishes with me.
"Foraging through stars, pulling at lunar threads of time and space and you"
"The wolves have my soul, their howls enclose my heart."
"My wounds hold me together, in them I hide the very worst of me"
A heart of both water and woods. Trickling and lapping between tangled thorns. Soothingly brutal in its very existence.
I take solace in him.
If only I were a book so I could tear out  the useless pages
"Our divine bones, moldering in the burial grounds of our intwined souls."
"Sometimes I am the ghost, floating sadly, ethereally, alone through the nothingness, but mostly I am the void with everything flowing invisibly, violently through me."
Enslaved by the weariness of being.
Labors of love and other self harming.
Emotional blackmail will get you nowhere.
I’m not sure I can release the embrace of my darkness.
Desecrated souls beget desecrated souls.
"A seed of grief can grow wild, if left untended, into an overgrown thicket, a thorny tangle of thistles and prickles."
A void full of silence.
Some people simply have a malignant soul.
"Soul of a butterfly, frantically searching for the solace of flame"
One day the sky will deliver her majestic vengeance to you.
"My heart grows a forest. Muted but beautiful,  wildly overgrown yet peaceful."
The endless echo of my abyss.
"Like the waves to the moon, you have me completely caught in your tidal force."
Weathering my demons.
Sparrow hearted.
Falling for all the beautiful dark prose will be the death of me.
The provocation of stars.
Collecting echos of real life.
Thorny briars weave my soul.
Existence is the blade to my heart today.
Deeper and darker and more desolate.
"My guise, my mask a human girl concealing a ghost a shadow of living a blur a faded memory that has yet to be woven  my favourite costume"
"Like a squall at sea,  my heart flurries and blusters within his storm eyes"
Imprinted.
Divinity in his lips.
We survived in the darkness together despite the floodlights trying to extinguish us.
Waves of under appreciation are crashing my ocean today.
"Frequent stumbles, much horror, but we follow the path."
Every demon want his share of my soul.
"Sometimes I’m the cloak,  sometimes, the dagger"
"His heart, my canvas"
Even the shadows crave my darkness.
Lusting for unconsciousness.
The sky keeps my lonely secrets close to her breast.
"A shred of soul, withered and wilted, traversing life."
"Arrayed emotions,  betrayed by demons, invade my mind and  serenade my sins"
"The baying of my soul, calling to you, a seeking siren. Eerily desperate, this agonized wailing, plaguing. Satisfied only after I taste your skin, your blood, your heart."
"In surrounding myself with vast nothingness, I became a mere echo."
Clandestine love.
"Hidden island haunts buried below bestowing skulls, skeletons  of ancient aquatic creatures. Ocean tides timelessly crash, deep waters expose their secrets. Hollowed ship hull heart torn, stained sails of my soul my shipwreck exposed"
His dominant star that stills my waters and clears my skies
Our ghosts have known it all along.
Learning to embrace the vulnerability in me.
Beautiful vulnerabilities.
Hive mind.
The delicacy of sunsets.
The difficult conversations make us granite.
In my garden of ruin I unfold my mind a unique mess I cannot fathom  Shadows whisper  thoughts decay  Plummet Pummel Rise
"I felt everything but controlled little. Witnessed it all, yet understood nothing. I could hear entire languages, but believed naught."
"And his love melted her ice. The water flowed between them, within them, until the sky inhaled it. Then together they fell as snow.  Inspired by, and with thanks to, @whyilovethegir1"
"She compels butterflies, butterflies compel her  Pictures ~ Mira Nedyalkova"
"My depression is a crow, an eternal presence, perched and cawing at me. Sometimes he is deep in the woods but other times he is right outside on my windowsill."
"The ritual of eerie, winter forests."
The ways I miss you collage themselves onto my soul. A mosaic of sadness and longing and a fervent impatience until you’re mine again.
Tired of willing time to hurry.
But the violence that stirs in my ribcage for you is simply euphoric.
The stars sink in the liquid midnight and my soul sighs a little.
Ordained by flame.
"I see you in every lone, little cloud that wafts across my sky."
"The shiver, the jolt imagining your hands, mouth all over my poems"
Trust is my foremost adversary.
"As cedars become cinders when touched by flame, my heart becomes flame when touched by you."
Heart shaped ghost.
Deviant details of you cross my mind recurrently
"He is a faint candle to my darkness, yet I am the darkness for his light to dangerously indulge in."
Will your soul ever let mine go?
"Bury me in pages, with words strewn and ink spilt, so I may inspire beautiful tragedies."
"From a torn night sky spill lust laden stars of glass shattering deeply pouring passion, tipping heat and burying us in love"
"The same lies I live in this same life over and over again. Repeating failures and echoing mistakes, unable to disengage or release."
tiny careless heart  negligently pumping blood scarlet lust or love?  #inkMine
"She compelled ravens. With a whisper, a promise, a threat. They obliged their mistress, they were bound.   #vssdark"
I fall to my knees as he rises for me.
"And then reality collides, splintering our skulls."
Whiskey reveries wrapped in valium vagueness.
"And her fire became embers, and the embers ash."
Fueled by the beauty of words.
"My path, a labyrinthine trail, scattered with  broken souls and strewn hopes  #vssDreams"
"And so I sweep up the shards, collect them in a jar and keep it in a dark cupboard until I’m ready to try again."
"In being cold, repelling everything and everyone, I became ice."
Cedarwood and rosemary reveries.
You are my goal.
"A manuscript of unpublished emotions, yellowed with time."
I have nothing left to give and I just want someone to give to me for once.
Reigned over.
"The more whimsical my words, the closer I am to breaking."
My devoted demons determined to devour
"Surrounded by armor, I protect my flesh and spirit from life. Wielding shields against friend and foe, I am impenetrable to love, lust, laughter, pain."
Deliver me to the stark lap of a winter’s river.
Distortion consortion
"Distill my soul and sip me, neat like a fine whiskey smoothly searing"
"Moods of an ocean, as malevolent as Poseidon. Grey mist lashing, waves crashing, breaking me down."
The threat of his lips.
"I want a release of prose,  but it’s not flowing, it’s not ready"
"The allure of melancholy. Like an amaranthine cloak, velvet soft, draping me in a soothing cocoon."
"Soul of a forest, mind of a snare"
"Your taste, darkness and stubbornness, would compliment my melancholy and apathy"
Exsanguinate my mind free me from its clutches
Drug of choice.
Devoid of patience.
"From the moment I saw him I had a lascivious desire to trace him with my tongue, to lick the lines of his tattoos, taste the salt of his lily white skin. A longing to feast upon him, devour him mind, body and spirit, swallow him whole."
It always feels like abandonment.
"My penumbra is blackened, tarnished with the ugliest and most unflattering grey."
"Muted melancholy radiates, unobtrusive and invisible, infiltrating my every cell, a black aura of decay."
"I live a dead life, speak a dead language that only demons and ghouls can hear."
Feverish eyes gazing lies slip off the tongue and over scarlet lips
But I mostly feel unspecial and insignificant.
"I am the origin of apathy. It has seeped in and become my blood, oozing through veins and infiltrating bone. Corruptive."
Oceans in love with forests.
"I sit and watch, as the desolation accumulates over my head, like a heavy sky."
Angel of chaos.
I’m consumed by hate shadowed by an abhorrence of self and others  violent and vitriolic  so despising and despised
You’re already relieved of your place in some people’s souls.
"I don’t flirt, I curse."
"My anxieties are licking at me, nibbling my edges. They’ll soon tear and devour me."
"‘What horrifies me most is the idea of being useless: well-educated, brilliantly promising, and fading out into an indifferent middle age’"
I’m Nordic noir today.
"You and me in death harbingers of creation. From our synapses firing, flowing and forging a shared heaven for our bones"
I desire nothing but numb existence today.
It’s hard to remember my joy.
I’m living in lavender today.
Alone with my spirits. Their pain soothes mine.
Bloody well feel this too 🖤
A tempest within my skull.
As dark as a moonless midnight.
I hold more conversations in my head than I do in real life.
Jump onboard if it tickles your fancy.
"My feigned heart,  merely a sketch beneath my breastbone"
Join me in my crypt.
"I’m enjoying other’s words lately, more than my own."
"I feel so  forced and feigned, contrived and unnatural"
"That pesky sorrow will clog veins and silence breath, rewrite all your hopes   #vsspoem"
"A heart for battle, a mind for ruin"
"A delineated love. Precise of heartbeat and pulse that quicken with every word, every glance."
"Define the demon, delineate the horror"
Are you an echo of insanity or an echo of hope?
My prose will die on my sleeve.
I’m lost but not as lost as your sanity.
"There are shadows that embrace your soul, while others slash it to ribbons."
Real wisdom comes from being real.
That soothing absence in the guise of a girl playing pretend  with a vacant soul
May you forever hold the most lovely blooms in your head.
Some days I feel like I may never resurrect myself again.
"A thick, dark fog cradling my soul."
"Sometimes I’m silence, sometimes I’m a hammering heartbeat"
"Extorted eclipses, corrupting the skies. Threatening heavens coerce the stars and moon and bribe the emptiness from black holes."
"Don’t gaze at me, gaze into me."
Complicit with the oceans.
Reminiscing about the times I was alive.
"Wash over me, collide with me"
I just like you.
"Horrorshow heart, frenetically slashing, lashing out. Bleeding and butchering beasts and men."
"I’m part catastrophe, part ruination."
"Nothing is forthcoming right now, no matter how much I wrench and wrestle"
I want to dissolve in sleep.
"An inspiration pervasive, insidious your darkness, my heart"
I find inspiration on your lips.
Holding a storm in my ribcage.
I don’t want to disappoint you more than I don’t want to disappoint myself.
I wish I was wandering a museum today.
The intricacies of self preservation.
"The impregnable sky, I sit, rewriting stars into love notes and requiems  #MadVerse"
"Feeling obscure, a veiled dream, ethereal, like mist adorning  an ancient forest, long lost, beautifully forgotten"
A breathing elegy.
"Mind of a haunted house, heart of its spirits"
"Captured in the reflection of your eye, for a fleeting moment I see myself as you do ..and believe it"
Tuck me up in your liquid gaze  solemn reverent our love fated depth   #Poetryin13
"Ambushed by grief, cornered and enclosed. Surrendered, surrounded  to heartache, by soul sadness."
"Captured, enraptured  by the darkness within you"
"Captured in your skull, I’ll never escape, nor want to"
"Sometimes I’m trapped, sometimes I’m the cage"
"A shot of darkness to the soul  calming and ruinous a poisonous kiss validating fear, excising chaos  an embrace a shield a force  #vss365"
Impressions of you in images reflected  dreamscapes and mirrors
Receive my darkness with reverence.
"I imagine fluttering above your darkness, reaching down and choking your sorrow, alleviating your pain."
"A poison, a position, a draught a vial of him"
"Time bottled in an ornate, crystal decanter sip it or spill it"
"A gilded epitaph upon my soul,  inscribed with blood, adorned with flourishes."
"Like a star without a twinkle, I don’t know myself without the darkness."
"Unable to forget. Unwilling maybe. The trauma resides in blood, bone and brain. In soul and heart.  I’ve come to understand that it cannot be pried out, gouged away. It’s a delicate creature, and if cracked or spilt will seep deeper and more unreachable.    #BraveWrite"
Sometimes I write sometimes I’m written
My safe place is nestled beneath your darkness.
Arousal of life infusing heart and hope evoking feeling eliciting emition
"Your words are like fog, lingering and beautifying. Hovering majestically over over my frigid soul. Hiding my heart when I can’t be seen."
Bone of a mortal soul of a demon
Head of a poetess heart of a witch
Obsidian gleams in her dreams of sleek shadows and dark demons   #vssDreams
"Burgeoning beliefs  emerging, coming to light and prodding my soul, my heart, my mind. Synapses firing and uptaking life"
"I am born of eternal battles, internal wars, conflicts of flesh and soul. Ceasefires are rarely declared, and truces run defiantly hostile."
I’m dreamt up of  indigo ideals and  intimate ideations  Soul suffused with sleepy seduction and lullaby lust  #366FF
"Ruptured chambers, spilling blood. The haemorrhaging of a thousand ghosts from my heart not even a tourniquet of flame could cauterize."
Shattered and shredded stitch my soul back together stronger than I was
Intimate ianthine ideations.
The prettiest little personality disorder.
"Sometimes I’m buried,  sometimes I’m the cold, frozen earth."
The dreadful beauty of a midnight graveyard.
"Submerged violently into an abyss of dark memories and dead  emotions, buried deeply, eternally in my bones"
Do you remember your existence?
I never knew you but I loved you to death anyway.
There is comfort in the horror.
I cannot stand the swarming gnats today.
Lavender longings.
People throw too many words around too often and they’ve lost any genuine meaning.
My insecurity will be the death of us.
"It’s not you, it’s me."
"The creature is back, perched on my shoulder, picking at my skull."
‘Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness?’
I shatter my own heart constantly and consistently.
You are the torrential rain to my soul.
Internal peace ideations
"The innumerable tombs in my mind. Dead and buried parts of me, my past."
Show me the portal straight to your soul.
Wildfires flare when you touch me.
An adorned mood.
My sky is a bit prettier today.
"If you have to loudly and repeatedly proclaim you are not x, you probably are x."
"Darling, deranged begets deranged."
"Breathing galaxies, bleeding stardust"
"It’s time, the creeping vines can ensconce me with the mossy logs and skeleton leaves, and adorn me with wildflowers."
Divinity on his lips.
"Scarlet lips, angelic kisses."
"My garden of midnight, starlit and spilling with moonbeams. Spirits roam, wander draped in silvery fog, drowning in the apathy of my soul.  Tangled and dying. Eternally."
Keeper of sad souls.
"Head of a poetess,  heart of a butterfly."
Sweet ghost(s).
"The smoky incense curls and wafts between us, as our senses embrace. Souls tremble under solemn gazes as we inhale lust.  #IntrigueVerse"
Take me back.
Take me back to the earth
Mood: Lana Del Ray and castle archers at the ready.
Looks can kill  so now you’re dead
"My walled empire. Vast ruins protected by sentries of forests. Fortified by centuries of loss, sadness, grief for those fallen. The wars ceded and won, the battlements manned by spirits snd demons. The drawbridge to my heart forever bolted."
Composed of lovely and lost abysses.
"His incantatory whispers at my ear, beauteous and soul soothing. Settling my butterflies, appeasing my blood. My world lulls, tranquilizes as he murmurs ‘mine’."
Receive my abyss with tolerance and acceptance.
"Write like you’re writing for the stars, the sky, the forests."
Mostly I just wish I was the night sky.
"Revere your abyss,  wear her with honour."
Everyone is here to be lonely together I think.
The most charming little depressive episode.
"The violently beautiful symphony of sadness. Orchestral grace conducted by despair, sonatas of sorrow swallowing tempos of desolation. Classical grief mingled with crushing concertos."
"I am the past tense of a ghost, beyond haunted, I float blithely by. Like the dust on a butterfly wing I leave infinitesimal smudges wherever I pass.    #WeirdVSS"
At the brink of becoming an echo.
Lovely 🖤💀
"Manifest sadness echoing through bone and blood betwixt sinew and  entangled with heart and hope dulling colors, dimming joy   #vsspoem"
"The art of melancholia. Darkly toned elements, dully repeating patterns and jagged motifs. Starkly contrasted against hues of amethyst and indigo"
Serenity
That demon at the edge of your periphery.
"Absent, like a fugue this dark, stalking apathy  embraces ‘til death"
"My anhédonie or yours, my love?"
My soul has no fight left so the tempest is guiding me.
Roaming the dark regions of my mind.
Disassociated distortion.
Nigredo tenebrositas
Sadness is my constant bedfellow.
"The licentious sky, such controlled beauty yet she loves with loose abandon, eternally lavishing her heart and unbridled lust upon you.  #inkMine"
"Stars softly die out and my night sky pales, lightens stained by a sunrise  of mauves and lavenders, which prettily cloaks him  #MarchFalls21"
The ocean is a religion.
And sometimes I just cannot.
"Your roots have taken hold in my veins and my soul, so deeply entrenched"
"Somewhere between your silence and noise, I’ll be the voice guiding you home."
"My little creature heart feels like it could beat right out of my chest. Shattering bone, cleaving flesh."
True silence is a blessing.
Entombed of mind.
Sadness begets sadness.
Broken begets broken.
"Inhale me, eliminate me"
"A girl of temporary.  The memory will fade, dreams will be forgotten. Thoughts and beliefs evaporated.  Blood that will eventually dry up and flesh that will rot."
"Idyllic insanity imposes a breathtaking madness coercing comfort from crazy,  desire from deranged   #poetryin13"
"Flowers spilling, blood spattering."
"I want to flee this space.  I’ve come to despise my everything. I want better, different, far away. I want to want nothing, no one."
"Overcoming the obstacles of soul is a true talent, which I’ve not mastered."
"My ink flows darkness. It has pooled in my soul, drenched me completely. Stinging with cold, it seeps into my veins and ensnares me entirely."
"This realm feels uncomfortable to me. Like I’m not supposed to be here, not supposed to exist here and now."
Narcissistic nobodies
Forever in lust with gracefully shattering.
Taking comfort in the beauty of the sky.
The clouds are soothing my soul this morning
I only remember the soul shattering dreams lately.
You can’t explain away repeated bad behaviour.
"A veiled secrecy, their shrouded echoes reflect and lament love lost as voices of ocean souls  sadly bay from tidal graves  #MadVerse"
Welcome to my circle.
Marooned in the melancholy.
Tangled up in nothingness.
With torn and bleeding souls we smile.
This constellation in my chest is heavy.
Torrential sorrow
"Today is looming, overbearing and arrogant"
Reaper of flesh and blood soul and spirit   Pic ~ moonpollution
Severing ties and heart strings.
A poem wrapped up in a ghost story tied neatly with an elegy.
"I’m composed of grey gunmetal, steel and iron my dreams, my visions"
"These flowers flowing through my veins, taking root, blossoming belligerently  despite the darkness"
Put a bullet through my heart and I’ll bleed moonlight.
Sadness abounds surrounds my soul and seeps into my bones
"I have built a labyrinth around my heart,  find the path if you dare  #whistpr"
"Recklessly I rip myself apart daily with careless abandon I abuse soul, body as I never would anyone else I love with violence and vitriol I shall die  #DarkLines"
"Force your lips to my spine, my veins. Press pieces of your soul into me, deliver me. Unleash my mind, free my heart, unbind me completely."
I’ll placate your demons.
Painting my pain as prose.
Spilling.
"As much as I will it,  time will just not pass faster"
I want to ruin everything.
I don’t believe you.
An ocean of sorrow swallowing my soul drowning my heart
"The insignificance, desiring something unidentifiable, looking for the unfindable"
"I am my own transgression, my own sin, but he atones me with his howling eyes, blazing and baying for my blood - lifeless lyrics in the rainfall - he cleanses and absolves my soul.  #atreyasverse"
Celestial souls seething in stardust and sin.
"Some people are so difficult to write, while others are rife with rich and sincere inspiration."
My garland of sadness achingly rests at my throat pearlescent and lush an exquisite elegiac experience  #vsspoem
Never enough.
"An apparition, drifting mist and swaying fog. Or perhaps just an  unlit illumination. I’m convinced I am a dream."
Hands off ladies.
🖤
"Observing forests longing to regress, revert to a feeble wraith, drifting gracefully with mist to the celestial realms"
"Imposing mirage of a euphoric pretense, a life but unlived   Pic ~ Caryn Dexl"
4am conversations
His dark and sultry  voice nestled against my lobes seducing my soul  #SatSpark
Keep your enemies close.
I wonder what my judgers and detractors whisper about me.
"Blue blush tinged lips,  the beguiling beauty of anti life,  a final kiss to seal her atonement.   #prosewords"
"Emotions echo, divinely reverberate, churn, ripple and die as their resonance glistens with iridescent decay  #vssDreams"
Why can I not have bliss?!  It’s not fair.
I need something to enjoy.
"Seethe and scorn, lamenting my life,  imagining an idyllic existence."
The men are touchy today.
"I feel stifled and stuck, in between  nothing and everything everywhere and nowhere nobody and somebody"
I want to play with words but they just won’t come.
I’d rather sleep forever.
"I feel so adrift, tethered to nothing, no one"
Multiple standard deviations away from happy.
I never feel. Enough.
Might become an abyss.
Dread  existential and theoretical
Eclipsed by butterflies.
"A mirage or a figment, you cannot be flesh  and blood, but simply a dream"
"Like shackles, silken strands of thought hold me hostage and  pollute my heart  #BlackDahliaProse"
"Enraptured by the  hollowed and heartless beauty  of the solitude. From an exquisite torture  springs lustrous, enchanting prose.  #vsspoem"
"Wreathed stars, a spangled tiara, adorned her pretty, dark mind."
Some do not deserve the oceans.
Few know. Really know.
"The seething midnight moon, in her celestial madness, glares over a pool of absent tranquility.   Her silence drinks me in, becomes me, while rufescent winds of carmine and copper bluster, billow and atone my blasphemous soul.  #atreyasverse"
"Her lovely abyss, never underestimate  it’s divinity  #haiku"
I want to spellbind the hell out of you.
"I need the words to heal me, invigorate me."
You’re my enough.
"I am in lust with the contours of prose. Their curves and dips,  their lovely and lilting lineations."
"Walking through a dream feeling absent of flesh, soul  A spectre, spirit  pretending, acting  Awaiting return to life"
The abyss is enough.
"My soul, like a wrecked ship at the bottom of an ocean."
Some days I feel less here than others.
We’ll follow moonglades across oceans and starlight between woods to find each other.
My exiled faith  a moth spasmodically flittering from flame to flame to flame
"You’ll never be absolved from repeated guilt, repeated hate, repeated harassment."
Slipping silently into your soul.
"A weeping, unhealable wound."
Realms of broken souls alluring and suffering  seducing dark hearts  #haiku
Collecting thunder from empyrean kingdoms  the sky will be mine  #haiku
Flame and blood cleansing cathartic
Like an asp to my breast.
Healing and bleeding.
Like a stain that you can’t wash away.
Slithering back.
Haunted by the ghosts of him  soothed by his melodic hymns forever in the beautiful limbo between flesh and whims
Searching for a trail to follow
With dreams on her skin  and moths in her skull she’ll be your winged nightmare  Pic ~ yourschizophrenia ig
"I’m endlessly here. My desirous ghosts lurking, clutching at my throat.  Longing for blood, baying for flesh. I’m here."
Bruised by prose.
I’m a pillar of exhaustion crumbling about to topple
"Clifted shores above a murderous ocean. Looming, standing sentry over the attacking waves. Midnight exhales her breathy storm, her devastating power unleashed."
"Ritualistic burnings at sunrise,  cleansing the night demons, resetting the soul"
A tiny death with every absence.
A kiss from her dagger.
"This collection of scars,  mine to endure, to honour."
A quill plunged into the inkwell like a dagger into flesh and the unspeakable damage that both can cause if in the wrong hands and wrong hearts  #vss365
Willing to be weak for you.
"That tired, old refrain."
"Some days, things, people I want to burn away like the pages of a book."
"You’ll feel the right ones.  In your bones, your blood, your skull."
"Deep, dark indie in People out"
Your delusions may be your only true love.
"I’m too tired to read between the lines, pick up on mixed messages."
Flee or forge Cleanse or retreat Burn or extinguish  Pic ~ Mimmilie
"The fairy fires in my head are all but ash and cinders, thoughts seared, ideas burnt out."
Silken silence  glimmering with fairy dust
Words seem dull today.  Stained with a blurry veil.
"Like an ocean, undulating serenely, hiding the rips below"
I love what is below the facade.
"I can’t get all my pieces to fall into place together and all at the same time. Singularly I master each one, but once I try to entwine them, I lose."
"Tiredness is a war, battling mind and body, no glory at all"
The intimacy of poetry.  Dedicated poetry.
His chest freckles are simply begging me to play connect the dots.  With my tongue.
"His pretty noose, adorned with the spirits of his previous lovers, hung high upon the gallows of his favoured work space. Here, clemency was often moaned for  but he never provided  that particular release  #vssmurder"
"Sinuous  lithe withstanding the pull of life like a taut tendon prepared to tear, rip or an aneurysm  threatening to rupture   #vss365"
"The name of the dagger wielded over me is Sadness. Sharp and precise, the blade severs heartstrings and flesh consistently.  Brutally beautiful blooms of blood."
My muse is angst and I have enough to fill entire oceans.
All of my internal monologues are for you.
I want to be the subtle side plot of a Lovecraftian tale.
Lay me down with butterflies so that I may become your tsunami.
Open up my skull and you’ll find wildflowers.
At the mercy of oceans.  Always kneeling at the altars of crashing waves.
I’m the flaw in your masterpiece.
"Accustomed to the chaos, it is mingled in my blood and tangled in my sinew"
If you get too far inside me you’ll only see echos
‘15 blows to your mind’
Marrow deep Radiohead circa Ok Computer mood 🖤
‘I am the pick in the ice’
Composer of skies.
I’ll bleed out into the ocean before I let you go again.
I’m more about souls and hearts than faces these days.
Don’t you want to hold my bones.
Here; awake between the moon and the sun is surely the most loneliest time and place.
I am lusting after winter.
"Just the moon isn’t always full, we don’t have to always feel everything."
This razor wire ensnaring my soul tiny daggers drawing blood
"Block me, then return to unblock and refriend and tell me I should be thankful? 🤣 Darling, no."
Perfect emptiness.
Half flesh  half stone
The language of sunsets.
A kiss to spill the night sky of stars.
The mute midnight  silently proclaims desire  for my dubious heart
An ancient forest  stands sentry at my ribcage guarding only ghosts   #haiku
"An archangel,  winged and beautiful in his darkness, nestled in my heart."
Tragically finite.
I made the mistake of thinking that purely talking about my trauma was processing it.  It’s not.  At all.
Between an angel and witch.
One thousand demons all mutilated and mauled  howling and snarling  and baying for my dark soul as I lay dying  #vssmurder
"I can’t help it, I’m a Taurus."
"If you really are the lightning, please strike me."
"Midnight knows her every star by name, by twinkle. They're always present, serving their mistress until it is time for her to take leave."
"The tiny skeletons of butterflies adorn my soul,  their ivory bones sparkling and twinkling and sighing."
"'She struggled with her sadness, but tried to conceal it, to divide it into smaller and smaller parts and scatter these in places she thought no one would find them'  ~Nicole Krauss"
"The vigour, the fire burns through the blood nestles into marrow awakening"
"Frayed sadness, he helps me unravel it."
Saturating myself in stardust.
Sundry demons at my altar ritualizing  incanting
"The Lady Darkness ethereally noble, devastatingly. Her beauty you’ll behold and fear, as she swallows you up.  #tanka   Pic ~ Nil Hoppenot"
There is a particular musicality to certain screams.
Body in the forest head in an otherworld  Pic ~ Crystal Lee Lucas
"Your hand is always inside my heart, stroking and caressing."
"Words are like an imaginary friend, comforting and soul soothing"
"Ill omens in black a midnight sheen stains plumage  the pretty and dark spirit bringers, harbingers prophecies of her ravens  #TankaThursday"
I always seem to stumble upon the hardest way to learn whether people are genuine or evil.
"The vows are all broken, the promises fled"
"A library of souls, stories of tragedies and conquests"
Some of my favourite people are books.
I am neither the woods nor their stark siren of silence.
The abyss is my eager companion when people fail me
Darkness grasps my hand when the loneliness threatens
Wounded stars casualties of  midnight’s war waged upon her
"Across skies and moons, I feel your every mood."
"I need a cold, dark cavern to introvert in please."
I have had my fill of the living today.  I’m ready for my ghosts and figments.
"Burn them all a pyre to purify  to cleanse thy soul stars licked by flame her celestial inferno built up, lit up raze the living char the dead become ash in the breeze"
Fledgling spirit merely a little twinkle in a collapsing galaxy of her soul  Gather up her shards scattered upon your heart a little heap of stars ready to be hung again
Unusual souls Localised skepticism Of their sinister intent
"I will be your vampire. I’ll revive you for a thousand years if I must. Breathing the darkness back into your lungs, pumping the blood back into the ruined heart."
They of urban legend whispered eerily around camp fires setting hearts beating like butterfly wings
Love me  like I love a stormy sky
I’ll read your soul through the books you keep.
A pen or a dagger?
My soul is tired.
Vampire soul filling yours from mine
Bibliolust
The poetry of my sky stanzas of stars  cloud cadences moonlit monologues and  sensual sun kissed sonatas
He makes me want to try.
"Brief forays, visits to a reality where  silhouettes, yours, ours intertwine, combine and sway  in death as we did in life  #MelancholyVerse #poetry"
The gentle damage will only hurt a little under his dark crush  #HaikuChallenge
"Between the hemispheres I perch and protect, cocoon the anxiety and diminish his desolation"
"I reside in the ribcage, calming her bones and stoking her desire"
Until the oceans empty  and the moon falls.
I need more pretty prose in my bloodstream today.
Beware of this sorry excuse for a man 😡😡😡😡
Dark nights in his eyes swimming and sinking without  fear of drowning death
She fades  from hearts  and hurts
The path of dreams obscured by haze a mere glimpse  a taunting gaze
Composer of storms.
"You can find me in your every heart beat, every pulse of blood through your veins."
Seven earthly and heavenly sorrows.
"With each word and every pretty prose a little more breath, life seeps back not my soul"
Every word a drop of blood.
Sharing stories with my 3am ghosts.
I’m unfamiliar with emotions that are devoid of darkness. I require practice.
"Like a false god, false feelings destroy your self worth."
Not feeling like the most inferior little flower today.
I spy with my little eye.
In the library  with a candlestick
Real women act like it.
This winter’s wood of silky mossed ground and twinkling silvery streams feels like home.
"Your demons, your darknesses are part of your masterpiece, your beautiful dark art"
I want my narrative to be that of a 17th ghost story.
Come fly your butterflies around me like a whirling halo a fluttering headdress as delicate as peony petals
"Come set your calm upon me, embrace my anxiety away and render my negativity mute"
"Devoid of golden gardens, growing only sweet blooms of decay"
I may be dead inside but I can still charm the pants off you if I want something.
"My skies, so filled with ornaments of lunar and cirrus and bruising the most beautiful hues of navy and lapis, magenta and amethyst,  ash and pewter."
The clouds can guide me today.
Existing as flurries of snow today.
Faded to barely discernible hues.
A secret passage hidden behind a bookcase to escape my mind.
Knowing the emotion you should feel but being unable to muster it up.
Dissolve me in oblivion.
"Crystallized love spilled as her heart ruptured. Stark beauty spread, prettier in death than ever in life.    #DarkLines"
The hate the venom the hostility of heart thorns draw blood daggers gouge out the soft and pure until I am more dark than light   #vsspoem
"I know I should, but I can’t."
I cannot fathom how to feel self pride these days.
My circle consists of the abyss.
Gouge away and dig it out.
I was never fire. Aligned with the ice eternal.
"He wanders the spooky corridors of my mind, darkens every shadowy corner."
"Her fractured dark soul solitary, not alone escorted by ghosts"
My joy I cannot awaken.
For every depth of darkness my stars dimly light my way
"But at times the night sky, impassive and soft, lessens the acuteness of sorrow."
Pulling poetry from my ribcage.
"You accepted my all, my damage, and did not flinch."
I don’t know. It just is.
A flight of fancy to the heavens and the hells a journey of soul  #FlexVSS #haiku
Stay purged.
One day karma will have her dance with you.
‘I’m sorry’ I whisper to my ghosts at every midnight.
"These wars behind my eyes  the carnage, the brutality waged silently, fatally"
The invisibility of the ghosting silence.
Bewitched by oceans spellbound by seas  Pic ~ @mrs_white_photoart
Manic words  flying through hemispheres  scattered across skin blood into ink into catharsis
Rambling through time submerged partially in between the nostalgia of past and that to still emerge
Girl of ghouls grimly ornate in her gown of dull gold and thorny stem tiara
I reside in Sadness his sweeping plains of woe scars of tormented tears run as bleak rivulets. His stark expanses the corpse cold temperature nothing will thrive  no one will escape.
"Her cortège, accompanying butterflies  shepherding enlightening  delivering  Pic ~ ana caballero zea"
I shall only annihilate myself.
My passivity is my demon.
I want to not plummet numerous times a day.
"When the moon first spilt me I had a place. But I’m so far removed now, maybe the stars cannot even lead me home."
"My most devoted companion faithful, persistent the sadness rolled in and remains eternal. Gray hued and textureless, dulling sight and sound, wrenching spirit from body, breath from lungs, me from me."
"Sorrow demands nothing of you. Just to be still, accept it, as it spreads throughout and drains you of life, everything."
"I am the wound and you, the blade that created me"
The choir of an abandoned forest.
Her manic spiral of swirls and twirls  of rapturous descent of perfect despair
That flutter of heart your conflict or confusion  brokenly beating  #vsspoem #haiku
You with your dead oceans eddying through your veins
You and your edgy devils withering without
You and your sweeping declarations now as dull as an antique blade
"When it was ours, it was ours alone."
Crowned with darkness escorted by flame  to the depths of Hades
Retreat and reflect with your high priestess; you.
"Continuing on unaided, alone I drift until it just ends"
"I have to be the romanticism of melancholy,  the beauty in brooding, otherwise I’d be nothing."
The stars keep my lonely soul company.
I only belong to the clouds now.
It all spins on so seamlessly. Agonizingly so.
That deepset of pang of having to continue things without you.
An infinite ripple in the darkness.
"I’ll drink from your darkness, my hands cupped, sipping"
Smooth me soften me take these thorns
My soul is a misty winter’s wood.
Until all the stars burn out.
Her blood. An offering of corrupted wine.
Spending too much time with the dead instead of the living.
I desire to leave some days like the sun slipping silently away in quiet serenade to the stars
Stars spilled down as midnight broke.
"Tearing words out of me, rending them asunder."
My tremulous soul requires a safe passage through the woods today.
The moonlight may reveal your prettiness but the stars know your every demon.
Midnight will never betray me like people.
3am rain will never lose its faith in you.
You’ll never know betrayal whilst you follow her.
"The blood tide of her ruptured prose violently swollen, scarlet hued cleansed"
Fleeting moments of wanting to inspire and be inspired.
My walls are like Babylon.
Reaper heart gathering ghosts
This persisting existence alluringly endures despite stars bright and moonlight and you
Poetry with butterfly wings.
Once upon a never time.
That perfect storm that we became.
"Darling, my snowflake heart melts a little with you."
As warm as freshly spilt blood and just as poetic.
He tastes of stars and feels like the dark side of the moon.
Reside in me curl up in my skull inhabit my every dark thought whisper your protection
Existing in a dreamscape today.
The guise slips but you’ll never witness it
Her ethereal facade belied her inner demons.
Spiritual death cutting the throat of my soul  rebirthing in flame
His steel eyes belied his fractured soul.
She smelt of lavender and felt like petals.
You don’t see me.
I get all the wrong attention.
I need an end.
"I have no reasons, no ties."
Unseen feels like unalive.
Swallowing oblivion inhaling the abyss I will be ethereal nothingness today
Everyone leaves in the end.
Lay me down with flames so I may be cleansed
Drawn to crippling emotional dysfunction.
Follow the moon.
Believe the darkness will cradle you.
"Between the dreams of memories  the ghosts haunt my abyss clenching, clawing, drawing blood"
Shattering silently.  No one wants to hear.
No solace in words right now.
"My heart feels mean, ungrateful barricaded and blocked."
Unanswered whispers  linger around unclear paths. Lost.
Daylight shards glint and light up inadequacies that I prefer midnight cloaks to dissolve
"Bone, blooms and butterflies   Pic ~ Toru Kamei"
Every broken sunset weighed heavily on her soul.
"Crawling between my ribs you wrack my abyss, dismantle and reassemble me with prose and posies"
More elegy than allegory.
Bury me with poets so that I may become their eternal prose.
My emotions consume me and I just wish they’d stop.
The inadequacies pile up on days like these. Minor self worth becomes dangerously out of control avalanches.
"An uneasiness has awoken with me. Grasping my throat, stabbing my heart, injecting poison into my already fragile soul."
Validate my existence.
A discernment for the dark.
But my memories all blur together and I’ve no sense of time or space or color. Just you.
"The soft oblivion, it’s beautiful depth"
Oh reckless abandon!
Crawl in next to my heart.
Floating into the arms of dusk.
One day she’ll become a wood in winter.
Mood; Nordic noir
I miss the stars. It seems like a lifetime since I have spent time with them properly.
I eternally hold you captive in my skull.
Deep dark indie songs and melancholic prose.
I grapple with time.  We are not friendly.
Hummingbird heart.
I wish I had wood to ramble through on dark nights.
Sorrow descends unbidden.
A human battlefield wars of emotions raging
Impressionism
"And so I perish softly, delicately"
I want to slip quietly into contentment and never recover.
Somewhere along the line I misplaced myself.
There is only a finite amount of dysfunction you can handle.
Sadness stitches up all of my moods.
"A litany of loss inhabits my spirit. Brought forth by a thousand demons, the doom takes root, throughout my veins, within my skull."
I just want to be ethereal mist and lavender today.
Pierce my carotid with a dagger and watch the butterflies flee.
"Drenched in midnight, glinting melodies of Her."
The beautiful descent into his embrace  of apathy
Down my spine the darkness weaves agony and angst
Lain upon the grave of my heart
"Oceans of woe, rising and falling with my heartbeat."
Memories rupture nostalgia seeps in
I feel like I could drown in my misery.
The sadness is so oppressive.
"How do you save a soul?  That has been left to wither, abandoned for so long."
I need to unsee so much.
I just want someone to write sonnets about me.
I feel censored.
The sting of you.
Hurt me deeper.
I don’t know how to do this.
Detach.
Love is no muse of mine. I’ve no history with Her.
The shore of my soul  you wash up eternally littering shells and memories  undiscovered trinkets
Sadness decorated with prose.
Meek and mild.
Even my unpenned words ache.
"Toppling out of hearts,  spilling from memories"
Stay away for she will only drag you down with her.
"Gather up my shattered pieces, cradle them until She comes for me, to return me to the stars."
"My bones weep and wail,  raging and reckoning  your shackled lies"
Unfurled resurrection  Pic ~ kristamas klousch
"I continuously walk through the days as if in an echo chamber, screams reverberating and piercing my skull, but numb to it all."
"And every night I fall out of life, into the oblivion, the beautiful oblivion."
"My doleful soul, withering in agony, wrapped in a crown of thorns."
"My heart, a dark basement, I’ll hide. Painted with ancient dust and adorned with cobwebs."
Survive the chaos or thrive in it
I have no one and nothing.
I’ve swam in your waters frolicked in your waves but now I’m anhydrous
Accustomed to angst yours and mine
Minimalist
The sadness of lovely things shattering.
"Cut after cut, lash after lash I inexplicably plead for more reveling in the agony dying by the ecstasy"
"The hostile malice corrupts my heart, breaks my soul as it perches upon my skeleton, between flesh and skin."
Every wound can become a butterfly.
Adorning the pain makes it tolerable.
Held together by stardust.
Killswitch.
If only we could rip out the ruined pages of our book.
The stars sigh sadly beside me.
"The absence of language, violent silence shatters me"
I need more Queen of Swords in my existence.
Disassociating is the new high.
🤖
"For anyone plagued by trust issues, this place will ruin you."
"If you have built a persona, or multiples, and deceived me with it/them, please fucking leave."
"Dirty mirror, your reflection."
You have tarnished my soul.
My place is tarnished.  I hate you for that.
These games and lies and deception on twitter ruin me. Honestly.  Physically and spiritually.
The nausea-inducing realisation of lies.
"Here, have some sadness."
The skies are grey like me
Aggressive people who have the audacity to call themselves passive.
It hurts to see.
Crazy cloud lady.
I have lots of memories of stars from when I was growing up. Not so many these days.
Bruised
You know what you did.
Destined to dream fated to fall
My patience have fled.
Forever drowning in an ocean of magenta.
Conniving harpy.
‘My shadow’s shedding skin’
Shifting paradigms.
I am the obstacle.
Sorry. I didn’t get that.
I can’t take care of me.
I have had enough of conniving people. It’s a very unattractive trait.
You had me at ‘depressive episode’.
Narrated by Death.
The haunting hum of the void.
Conscious efforts are required.
Don’t flinch.
Introspection makes for dark spaces.
Queen of Sorrow ~ Natalie Ina
Reminding myself that no one can wound me as badly as I wound myself.
"Illusions of bleak, beautiful winters."
Bled of soul.
I’m petty. Mean. Mostly out of pain.
My garden of spite blooms at midnight.
Might live my life by moon times from now on.
The hurt of causing hurt.
Burrowing delusions.
Pain is my ritual.
Seething Brooding
Does it hurt.
Those people who used to know exactly what you need and when.
Sometimes I feel that you need to get a genuine clue.
Muscle relaxants and a Valium tonight is a perfectly adult dinner choice. But I cannot type for my life.
"He’s nice, keen, So I panic.  You know."
Niggling devils in my skull.
Come from way above
My soul  a lone traveler
You are derivative
You recreate me
It’s me you love
With my voice
I want him but we’re not right
Jesus. Lana del Rey. Would.
Enfolded in oblivion with your thoughts my memories our moments
In the woods somewhere.
Stay here
In the evil heart
My clouds are simply sheer exhibitionists this evening.
Purple patch
The ritual of sunsets.
The darkness is my religion.
Night falls  to her knees as he commands
I want to taste your darkness.
A hazy den of oblivion smoke filled cedarwood and vetiver
Abyss adjacent.
To oblivion or not.
Mood stabilizers and icecream.
Hello lover
I don’t care that you don’t care.
Too exhausted to spiral.
My soul is too tired to care.
"I wish I was ethereal, low laying fog today."
In league with forest mist.
Composed of exhaustion and tears.
"I die an infinitesimal death each sunset, losing a breath of soul and a beat of heart to my grave."
"My dark wings are broken, in ruins."
Some days I glimpse the horrorshow within me and flinch.
I embraced the dark until the dark embraced me.
Mood anticipation. Already feeling the darkness descend for 5 hours in the future.
"Born of ravens, an inherited prophecy of loss and ruin"
If only you took your own advice.
The veil lifts for a semblance of life.
I despise your new brand.
The solace of unconsciousness.
Fled a dream awakened in a nightmare
And all the wars within me will be fought violently and until the death.
"I feel like chaos will embrace me forever. Or me, it."
Imagine the silence  Pic ~ 柳青 Liu Qing
Unapologetically dead.
I conduct the murder in my mind.
Your loss.
Wrack and ruin.
It’s all in your head.
Sadness is my echo.
I’m simply a series of dark moods.
"Don’t want to be here, don’t want to go there."
That bone aching tiredness.
The absence of words says more than the words themselves sometimes.
Be very aware that I read everything you say. And don’t say.
The sound of the waves collide
Descended Ascended
"A star to follow, a path to travel."
I want to bed a bard.
An affinity with ravens.
I have to tuck you away.
I desire to be a sonnet today.
My elegy of lamentation elegant  eternal
Composed of butterflies.
The scent lingers I can’t extinguish it
My temptress reaching into my skull  caressing  whispering  of no more
I hate this.
Muting my mind.
Undone unbound  unalive
Soul oppression.
I wish wishing would work.
What mysteries lie beneath?
"Grim and bleak, I cannot even play pretend with positivity these days."
My words are a bloodletting of my moods.
Hell leaves it’s mark.
Gossamer outlines of my previous lives.
"Seeking refuge, to forget time, in a cavern within another realm. A fissure leading to nothingness, a choir of silence."
"A comfortable creature is oblivion, as he wards off the beasts of apathy."
"Darling, you are the only masterpiece in all of my galleries."
"Take my tears, drown in them."
"Scorched and throbbing, my spirit festers incessantly. That eternal ache of ancient agonies, the light and lethargy of life."
"The delight of darkness, a serene melancholy soothing wounds and appeasing emotions."
Can’t stop can’t keep going I’ll just float
Liaising with the moon.
"My shield is heavy,  battle worn and splintering,  but still a protective force"
"Fragments of ocean crash through my veins, the beautiful swell spilling through my bloodstream."
I’m remnants abandoned by ancient ghosts  in this amaranthine darkness
The beautiful violence of a summer storm.
This choke-hold of apathy is tiring.
He holds a knife against the throat of my loneliness.
"Darling, I dream of a thousand symphonies all composed of you."
"A thousand spirits circle my soul, forgotten and furtive."
"Marred with maladies, I atrophy a little more with every sunrise."
"My ghosts collects the pieces of me that slip away, shard by shard, shadow by shadow."
"Distorted life, through a dirty looking glass. From underneath a frozen lake, I look out at flickering shapes and colors."
"Time, a monster, perched on my shoulder, shadowing me as I float through this daylit nightmare."
"The days seem unending, perilously long and arduous."
"This amnesiac soul,  life and feeling forgotten"
Thinly veiled delusions.
I imagine letting go feels amazing.
The desirous fear of numbness.
"The meticulous midnight collects her strategically smattered stars. Tucking them away like diamonds, set for worship on another night."
"Unlaced from life,  oblivion my safe place."
An apathetic armor shields my soul cautioning  guarding standing sentinel against such suffering
"Time slithers painfully slow these days, dragging out every hurt, every wound."
Death and the Maiden ~Jaroslaw Datta
At the mercy of my moods.
I wish time forward continuously  over and over to a better time which never seems to arrive
The shackled chains are my lover.
Half in lust with Death I bed him nightly
👻❤️
Ghost likes.
Safe from emotion
You will never be free
I want to curl up inside Maynard’s skull.
"Your scent in my skull, your taste on my skin"
And writhe in your heart
"The stars,  in mute recitation of beauty, adorning the midnight emptiness"
The survival in shattering.
👻
"Synthetic soothing repose my mind, my dull soul  drifting peacefully"
The illusions comfort the delusions fracture
Dreary
Crawl back to the shadowy dark.
Ugh
Tainted existence  smeared with sadness
Decayed serenity drifting  darkening deepening
"Maelstrom of mood eddying, swirling a black hole, emptying and refilling"
Full moon magic.
Lock it away.
Lay me down with thorns. Blood let my apathy.
"Belonging to an other world, an other realm"
With midnight tangled in her hair.
Tangled up in cerulean
Lie supine
Reporting the patterns
"Nostalgic notions  both soothing and saddening  clutching, caressing   #haiku"
Reverential  the awe inspiring beauty of academia  University of Greenwich  ~Pic by me
Blooms that bind
"A serene depressive episode.  Rare, but real."
Shake my tomb
"Nature, nurture, heaven and home"
I have a sad in my heart today.
To wither and wilt alone in a crowded room invisible death with a facade of peaceful serenity masking grief  #vsspoem
Tempted to bloom tempted to perish
A temple is never truly perfect until it has withstood ruin.
‘Their words were only accidents in the mutual silence’.
Few know the dead and dying stars of my galaxy.
In chains entombed
Restless dark desires
When will we ever learn?
From ancient lore beauty blooms
"Syllabic whispers, moans echo across the fens as I shiver, shrouded in mist bloodletting my remaining spirit"
"I, a fevered dream, where abandoned ghosts seek refuge."
Whiskey and daggers and revenge.
The flame will only end up singeing your broken wings.
Purging your poison from my marrow.
It’ll be awe inspiring to watch her crash down again.
"Pot, kettle"
I’ll be waiting for your downfall.
Forevermore
It’s difficult to watch.
My life has been too long already.
Sleeping is my comfort these days.
I see what you’re doing.
"Weak and sullen my fire fighting for breath, for oxygen a flame dying slowly   #MoonMystic"
‘My eyes are painfully open and I want to escape’
The shape of ruins. Shaped by ruin.
"The void is my muse.  And I, his."
"The shine is duller right now, my world  tarnished"
My soul has donned her armor and wield her sword.
The monsters and creatures and demons who we hide within. Who we lock away and try to suppress and attempt to minimalize their ruin and destruction.  To keep us  alive
The thorns in my side  the open wounds
The maelstrom of mind  illuminated by her midnight maladies
You’ve exposed your rotten soul.
I’m set ablaze exhaling smoke becoming ashes
"How can people, who’ve acted in many and varied vile ways, simply just cut that part of their life out?"
It’s funny how you think he loves you and only you.
"Deftones, my sadness and the abyss please."
My self worth is ready for its grave.
Imagine putting up with that behaviour for 12 months. That’s what you did to me.
I wish to be lost even further darker  deeper number
"The darkness presses against me smothering yet comforting the beauty of it, the fear"
Wake up remember medicate
The thuds of my heart at thoughts of you
Terminal emotion.
A pleasant oblivion please.
Desiring to give in.
Running from  but imagining running to
The trickling sadness becoming a wall of misery.
Crashed waves exhausted calmly regathering life
We have a Lady Whistledown among us.
Might get drunk on whiskey and start posting pictures next.
"There isn’t enough coffee, cigarettes and music to fill your void."
"Bit it’s ok to tell women they have a big nose, I think Ivy said."
Don’t forget the wise words you had for me about him.
"Enjoy or excuse my current pettiness please, I’m exhuming toxicity that I have been dealing with on here."
Wake up remember die
A requiem for the loveliest dead.
Waves of nausea my emotions an ocean
Draped in tatters bound for hell
‘Formidable piles of mute bone’  ~ Aimé Césaire
Flimsy aching to shatter my bones and breath into oblivion
Etch my skin with the beautiful cursive  of your pen.
I’ll be drawn into no one forevermore.
I’ve learnt so much the hard way this year.
I can’t do this.
I bear it alone but you will hear about my feelings.
The atrocities are mine.
My skies are feeling dark and heavy today.
No one will fix me and I don’t think I can. So.
You have no right. Yet here we are.
Deep diving into away from here.
"Disassembled and astray, my soul requires care."
Betrayer of ghosts.
I do despise time merely filling it in and wanting less each day   #Haiku
Empty and vacant nothing fulfills me these days except the despair
A religion.
My ex did it all the time 😡 It’s a trigger for me now grrr
I am a fortress beyond the dark wood pristine impenetrable
I’m too dark it manipulates me these days  instead of me controlling it
Pearlescent scar tissue.
Being told how I feel is always a joy.  I am the escape room.
"I won’t beg or plead. I’ll remain my bitter, silent self."
You’re so edgy and cool.
The pic of you and your husband of 20 years is my screensaver.
I see your deleted tweets.
Time to start naming names.
Time to start introducing evidence.
Battle ready. Soul ready.
Stitching my lips shit.
"Earlier I wanted to destroy the sky and everything in it, hear the screams and panic."
I like to imagine I’m functional.
Mood
Smudging my soul.
A flame a blade to cleanse
A shattered realm fragility ruptures and defies my soul  Pic ~ Katie Griesar
"Drape me in devastation, adorned with angst."
"Hello dear spectre, you can have me now."
"I’ve finally been draped with the gauzy veil, a semblance of serenity."
"Her indigo midnight, flung with silvery and gold."
"Our amber sunset, interlaced with mauve and stitched with bronze."
I never dreamed I’d break.
A blossom of blood blooms and beguiles breath taking in its brutal beauty    #poetryin13
Pushing people off the bridge and then burning it.
The damage I do is humiliating.
The fine line between space and spurn.
Maudlin mauve   ~ Wolf’s Kurai
You are my devastation.
Mood: Monochromatic vignettes
Im sorry for what I said when I was devastated.
"The moon, and I her devoted disciple"
"When will the scabs form? Will the scar tissue become armor? The wounds are raw, they sting sharply and glassily reflect beautiful crimson."
"I’ve stopped kneeling before prose. It’s meaningless, vacant and cloaked. The true prettiness is in its absence."
Your parade of words belie nothing.
The words curdle and sour. Exhaled but never consummated.
"These familiar places have turned terrifying. Detoured from comfortable to painful and I can’t find solace anywhere, with anyone."
Words mean nothing.
And now I feel like I can’t keep expressing it all here.
"I’ve let everything good in my life go. Freeing them from my negative pessimism, my apathy and emptiness."
"And my ashes feed my torment, nourish my shriveled soul."
"Snarling and clawing, torturous and flagellating. The demon perched upon my chest is hellbent on his blood sacrifice tonight."
"The screaming echos within my skull. Shrill, hysteric, manic, mean.  ‘Just leave me alone’."
I’m centered on my self loathing completely today. I have no space for you.
"I feel ensnared. By thorns, pricking and ripping my skin. Smears of blood, tiny rivulets forming crimson pools on lily white flesh. My darkness swallowing my light."
"When many ruined souls lay in your wake, you are their sum."
"Embraced by war, comforted by ghosts."
The darkest hours are only distinguishable by their depth of darkness.
Some people are so comfortable with embarrassing themselves constantly.
False virtues and imaginary morals.
To sleep and dream perchance.
"My nocturnal fiends betray my heart and slit my soul, ravage my flesh and discard me to the midnight."
"Fire-thrown shadows eclipsing my demons, if only for an infinitesimal moment."
"Come, rage your storm upon me"
"Born of oblivion, eternally he whispers for me to return. I’m helpless against his enchantments, woven with beautiful prose, and the promise of elegant nothingness."
The impenetrable fortress of my anxiety looms large and formidable in my mind. I am unable to escape.
"Dancing with the demons, twirling and swirling and dying."
I’d like to be taken apart from the inside
YoouuOouuoo
"As above, so below"
"Morning light, shadows cast nocturnal adjourned revenant souls reposed  in reverence"
You’re the wave
This guise
I wish I could remember sleep.
"The catacombs of my heart, chambers of bones and ghosts, empires and armies victorious in death."
"Branded by demons, scar tissue tarnishes my soul, but make it all the more harder to desecrate further."
"A requiem for my ghosts, whispered fervently in the darkness. The language, long forgotten, speaks to blood and bone and soul."
Today I will incorporeally exist.
I wish the void to crash over me like an eddying ocean. Furious waves of nothingness dragging me under.
"Creatures of night, of gloom and shadow, lie in wait for me. Their imperceptible stalking with keen eyes, the bloodlust rising. Yet I desire the ambush. Tear my flesh open, muscles from ligaments, from bone. Leave me laid bare on the bloodstained moss.   #vss365"
"Time after time, star after star, I remain stagnant and still."
The silvery evocation of him.
Amidst an eternal midnight we hide. Within shadows and between our sighs.
Nestling in your skull.
Exiled demons that creep a path back to your mind.
I can’t salvage your mind while I’m losing mine
Deepest dark   ~johnscottgfx
The battle cry of my soul.
...all around me
"A flawed ghost girl, recklessly lucid"
"The punishing light examines every imperfection, every flaw, that is why I prefer shadows."
Deep dark indie  shadowy mysterious sensual
Down
My venous system
Whispered lullabies from the ghosts.
It’s cute how you romanticize your brokenness.
I wish to be unseen and hidden today.
Even your demons will jilt you eventually.
But you are mentally disturbed.
A relentless ocean crashes within my soul.
The depth of each plummet gets deeper and harder to crawl out of
Empty and absent like a forlorn ghost
Enduring the minutes waiting for a comfortable numbness
Such mood!
Run away with me tomorrow
Disassociate mind from life me from you me from me  Pic ~ katiachausheva
My temple  built of broken souls and darkness now lain in ruins   #Storyin12
Hiding in your words as they shatter one by one
Loneliness is my sage.
Muse of sadness.
I wish I could expect more respect. It’s hard when I can’t even respect myself.
Butterfly flutters like lingering lips  delicately pressing caressing  the nape of her neck
Laudanum laced lure.
"Brutal yet beautiful, the words hidden within, unuttered and unveiled."

A torrent of stars  ablaze in my darkness.
Dreamily enduring the oblivion of clouds
To the person who told me to kill myself? No thanks.
"I hope a violent fire takes you, blistering your heart in deepest crimson and coolest sapphire."
"Expose my heart, pull it out and rip it up. Weave me a new one."
Catch me. Heal me.  Free me.
He can take me all. Body and soul.
Surrendering to the void.
I can’t wait to meet you there.
Another needy hole
Imagine tweeting every single word just to hurt someone.
You’re so pretty when you’re unfaithful to me
Fu ckedup
Stay all day if you want to
Every you and only me.
Kiss me then bury me here
Does it make you happy to willfully hurt others?
Refusing to dwell on the past because you were an awful human does not absolve you.
"I’ve forgotten how to enjoy, how to desire, how to accept good things."
"Empty my skull, euthanize the remainder."
The 3am ghosts are handing over their care of me to the 4am ghosts.
"Oh what a shame, @Darkestblue_ blocked me for calling him out."
This persistent and soothing rain 🖤
Don’t crawl into my DMs and passively aggressively attack me for not retweeting you. Write better and then I might.
"My midnight garden, ghosts and ruins"
The trust is toxic.
"Loathsome and lonesome, you cloak my soul and burn my heart. Lacerations and wounds upon lacerations and wounds."
Flirting with oblivion.
"Born of storms, of lightning and thunder, of winters and ethereal mists."
"The wind is blustering,  it’s sternly ripping apart the sky to allow the stars to fall to me"
Some people are craving attention today.  I crave shadows.
Self destructivism
Pocketful of shells.
"Like a bullet, careening through flesh, grey matter, you tear through tissue and rip my veins apart, wrenching soul from body, spilling blood and dreams   #horrorprompt"
"The incessant ripples within my heart, lapping, rising and falling, undulating."
Destined to suffer or revel in abundance.
"There are those who infiltrate your bones, seep into your bloodstream, nestle in your skull."
A vermillion sunset woven with violet  adorned in golden braid
"Retreat, my heart, run far away."
A war continuously fought and lost.
Lunacy and love.
In league with the moon.
The enduring spaces between us. Time and space and soul.
A thousand storms wouldn’t be enough.
"Like daggers piercing soft skin and blossoming in burgundy, these jagged edges of my tears  bloom beautifully bereft of you  #MoonMystic"
You occurred as an avalanche tumbling and swirling leaving beautiful debris  around me  #poetryin13
My cloud is lightening and lifting.
"Ruined ghosts, dark and tormented, coursing through my bones and spilling from my veins."
"With bloodless hands, I draw the abyss from the confines of my tattered soul."
Swallowing oblivion.
And just like that I plummet.
"Blossoming, bit by trembling bit."
"I darkly bloom, timidly, at the mere thought of him."
You draw me in color #5wordspoet
The blithe beauty of darkness. Unadorned. Undesirable.
Silver streams trickle and woven through verdant woods  invite beauty in
I’ve never had a burning passion and I wish I did.
I am fated to his beautiful abyss  eternally.
You are my fate.
That roar of waves can always quieten the shrieking in my skull.
You are the music furling all of my prose.
Hope clings to an empty soul no matter how hard I fight it.
If I could have my past back I would be oh so much more gentle with it.
Your psychopathology is my favourite.
True love is our disorders aligning.
My soul is laden with iron chains.
I’m not enjoying this darkness.
My cloud won’t lift.
"Some people tarnish my place here, my people. I despise them for that."
I’ve lost any good people I had and I don’t want the left overs. Let me make the death icecream for then all
I guess there used to be hopes and good times but they’re all faded and split and shattered from my memories. Were they even real? Who knows.
"Macabre heart. Of grim and gory tales, entwined with nerves and mingled in blood."
This massacre of mind. Of soul.
I’d rather be absent.
Willful ignorance.
All of the imaginary conversations I hold.
An unsent note.  Love or farewell.
The slow and distorted beats of the heart.
Swallow your shame.
The disorders are best left unspoken.
Leopards don’t change their spots.
Your faux persona is much more palatable.
Pulled under.  Deep into the insignificance. Meaningless.
Tangled in sadness.
Nostalgic and missing.
"No words, just caressing skin and playing with my hair."
Drifting and dozing.
I trust I can rely on your vote
Be quiet and hold my hand.
"Care of something, somewhere better."
Don’t struggle like that for I will only love you more
Pull on your pout
A big Cure mood 🖤
"I wander and roam, float aimlessly, fall and sink deeply and darkly."
People signing off their tweets 😣
Mastering the art of me.
Comfortable numbness sought.
Head static.  The buzz and drone request beautiful oblivion.
Kiss me
Letting go is an art form in itself.
You are the rope to your own petty noose.
The deserted and solitary ghosts of my witching hours.
You lured me in with you.
You flutter through my consciousness constantly  consistently
In league with the oceans.
"In league with darkness, consorting with ravens."
I’ll ruin your soul as I revel your flesh.
"Our ghosts. Bundled within my heart, huddling for warmth around the dying fire of my heart."
"The noise. A hum that never disintegrates, the monosyllabic drone within my head, keeping everything taut, ready to flee, escape."
My endorphins are visiting.
Get out of my circles!
The unsettled specter of doom hovers above my soul like a dense fog hellbent on my demise.
"He lurks beneath my ribcage, lashing my heaving heart and plunging my soul into beautiful oblivion."
"I will be your ghost. Bearing your angst, your melancholy. Embracing your demons, in the folds with my own."
"The decay of a soul, swallowed by shadows and dispersed to the abyss."
"Treacherous heart, a duplicitous ghost of my own mind."
What lesser depths can there be?
Are you a dream or a damnation.
Her intrepid little heart.
"Infinite hallways of my mind. Dreary and dark, eternally spiraling."
"Cling to the shadows, embrace the darkness, wear them like a tiara of thorns."
The girl liked to believe she was impenetrable. An icy castle no foe could conquer.
"I don’t belong here, with the pretty things. I am shaped by and for the darkness. The melancholy."
I exist with thorny stings.
"Captive to thoughts, the beautifully violent and haunting."
Hostage of darkness.
Why won’t the void just assimilate me.
Being an afterthought is ripping my soul apart.
Even the ghosts abandon you by 4am.
Bluntly stabbed a million times over
Mundane and melancholic.
A teensy summer storm ⛈
I would like to receive and embrace some healing this year.
Read away. I hope if helps.
"Yes yes, we know you’re ‘watching’."
It is done. Burn it with fire.
Haunting renditions  of past hurts
Woven with a bad temper today.
A stupor for the mind and soul.
Embracing oblivion.
Unfortunately I’m best at reading the words you don’t write.
She blocks then worms her way into my circles. No.
Excising people.
The four right chords can make me cry.
"Yes, my ways are always terrible."
Beautiful. In my own terrible way.
Out of touch shielded from feeling your mind and body
A Prussian blue dappled in shadow braided with stars
"Douse the anxiety, cleanse your soul with flame."
"In a dark, dark wood stood a dark, dark house"
I wish I was lunar.
The battle within myself will slay me eventually.
I want to be a top priority for someone.
I don’t make a habit of being seen.
"Emptied of desire, hollow and vacant, for then nothing can pierce my heart."
"Resentment braided into my soul, infiltrating every cell. I need to purge. Rip it out. Cleanse myself with flames."
I wish I could forget I am alive.
She’s either all fire or all ice.
I don’t care and other lies I tell myself.
"The sorcery of sadness my tears, my talisman"
"I malinger from reality. The oblivion is a gentle lover, albeit a silent assassin wielding a double edged sword. He caresses with one hand whilst smothering me with the other."
"Enduring is my means to survival. Days like this sting and I cower and wait them out, shielding my heart and cloaking my mind."
I am your abyss.
Haunting lovingly
Hauntingly lovely
Lovingly haunted
"Spheres of ice water orbit my soul, freezing feelings"
Deep in the abyss I hide with my ghosts
Twirling through the void with tangled butterflies in my hair.
"The nightscape of my soul has been bare for so long. Eternal midnight, absent of stars. A new moon will hopefully soon arise, a beacon of hope, leaving a trail of space dust for me to follow."
The eternal equinox of my heart.
For all her darkness she still sometimes sparks
Hazy wandering.
The shadows of his absence are the saddest.
Some tiny waves of peculiar peace lapping over me today.
Pouring rain and Tool.
I used to believe you could read my mind and silence.
My mood is somewhere in a blizzard.
Maybe one day I’ll find some peace with myself.
Synthetic sleep.
I despise wishing.
Insufferable regret.
"Butterfly heart, flittering chaotically"
The roiling venom churns within me.
That lingering destruction by you
Anhedonic priestess.
I want to get lost in the fog.
"Aim more shards towards my heart,  it’s not quite obliterated."
Seething for you.
"My tranquil tempest, such delicate chaos."
Forgery heart.
I remember your unmemorable things.
Crystalline glances that cut through the soul and leave shards of you
That internal shatter.
Storm clouds billowing within my heart.
"The doubt clings to my spine, flows within my blood, is exhaled with every breath."
She speaks the language of butterflies.
How many ruined altars did you leave in your wake.
My answer shall be in blood.
Sanctimonious reveries  malefic and spiteful
A pestilence of prose.
Arrows shot straight through my everything
I’ve lost myself in layers of protection. So many and for so long.
"Heart of onyx, connected to night."
Poets can hold no candle to your words.
"I’ve come to despise the light, both figuratively and literally. The dark cloaks me, shadows me, shrouds me. Concealing the lamentable life I wander through."
Birdsong like bullets shattering my unconsciousness
Wounded words are the saddest.
"The beauty of fog, foreboding enchanting wrought with possibilities"
Evening blooms.
Let’s run away to the sky.
I wonder what stars wish upon.
You are the aneurysm to my artery.
"Tuck me into your darkness, wrap me in your melancholy."
I’m drawn to flaws.
"We’ve whimsically woven our words,  reckless and wrought with wishes."
"Neither the lantern or the moth, I am the potentially fatal lure."
The girl cloaked in her void.
Beneath this guise is a mere decaying flower.
"Make no mistake, I know exactly who you are."
The apathy is shackled to my soul.
Indigo night sky  woven with filmy cumulus and punctuated with stars
No one can have me.
I will eternally cage the darkness.
The darkness will never relinquish you.
Tempestuous violently desirous  wielding words against pillaging prose
"Colors swap and change ghosts escort the moon away as the sun makes her  arrival, sending shadows and fiends skittering away"
A dark wood to lose myself in.
The crescendo of your symphonic soul.
I'd steal dying stars  to light your way along the overgrown path towards my soul  #BlackDahliaProse
"Of all the fractured creatures, you are my favourite."
You’re the shadow to all my dark thoughts.
I am neither the lighthouse nor the shore.
Claw your fingers into my words and wrench them apart.
"The words have become shadows. Elusive and hazy, I’m unable to find the ones I seek."
The darkness has a discernible depth today.
"Rain against glass, smattering dully."
My last nerves are frayed and people keep stretching them further.
"Guided by darkness, dying stars lighting the path."
Sadness will outlast the stars.
The wrought magic of melancholy.
This cottony fog I am shrouded in.
Been picking scabs again
Everything you thought you knew was simply your own projection.
So soon you’ll take me.
Stop
Hearts are safer off sleeves.
The shore adorned with the fresh corpse of my battered soul
Avenged by the dark prose and bruised words.
‘He’s more myself than I am’
Your words stab deeper than my blade.
Entertaining certain people will be your downfall.
💋
I haven’t got a thing to wear
I was happen in the haze of a drunken hour
If you go I will surely die
Sleepers make me an awful sleep typer
"I am human and I need to be love, just like everybody else does."
"Driving in your car, please don’t drop me home"
Days away I still feel you
Fledgling spirit merely a little twinkle in a collapsing galaxy of her soul  Gather up her shards scattered upon your heart a little heap of stars ready to be hung again   #SlamWords #42ndEdition
"Mossy green vales and undulating mountains silhouetted in  the night. Her outline, in the shadow of the pines, kneeling at her altar of dirt.  Musing melancholically.  Whispering with the whistling wind and wishing her woes away.  #SlamWords #42ndEdition"
"Brittle and fragile just one wish for strength or hope chance and circumstance   may intervene, bestow and paint her a happy ending   #SlamWords #42ndEdition"
Glazed eyes like cracked ice bruised and becoming my stunning corpse awaiting your second coming  #SlamWords #42ndEdition
My altar of apathy adorned and armored  by apparitions of you
If a ten tone truck...
"Her ruined abbey, scattered and strewn, caressed by softest moss. Dim shards of solemn moonbeams reflect her bones, while her ruined soul absorbs the stars."
I wish I was a Smiths song.
There is a light that was extinguished years ago.
"The dark, barren underpass that is my mind, my soul, my heart, my everything."
Dust your darkness upon me.
Many sky decorations
Mine is the hand that plunges the dagger into my flesh.
I assassinate myself on a daily basis.
It’s working.
Posies and pain.
My bones ache.
Pathetic little creatures.
My skull is constricting.
Illusionary and elusive.
The language of forests sighing and growling
"Existing as rolling fog today,  enduring ethereally"
Inhale my darkness and breathe light into me.
"Your haze, your haze"
Ease me out of oblivion and into consciousness.
I am simply an elegy waiting to be penned.
"My soul exists in eternal winter night, huddling with the stars, cocooning itself in fog."
"I silence so many tempests raging inside me, choke them down and entomb them to never be spoken of."
"I don’t know how to escape anymore. Every day feels more futile; sinking deeper, feeling darker, the sadness settling densely in my bones. Suffocating my soul and swallowing my heart."
There is a consuming ache in my heart.
Like it never happened.
March into the fumes
This halo of apathy.
Maybe I can find purpose today.
Not all martyrs see divinity
Billowing
I spend a lot of time admiring clouds lately.
Vast significance
When you’re ruining it all but you can’t seem to stop.
"I want to want nothing, feel nothing."
The clouds are just showing off now.
Tendrils
Daydreaming about becoming dust insignificant specks in the ether nowhere and everywhere
Ugly by nature. That stinking soul.
I feel like I might shatter into a million tiny shards of cubic zirconia.
The problem is that I allow myself to be stabbed over and over and over again. At rock bottom you don’t really care about the outcome; it’s the need for immediate dagger against skin.
Ice Queen.
"I write of darkness, with ailing emotions. The prose suffocates but I have to let it out."
Composing my loneliness into a concerto.
My rainy sky is vast blanket of nothingness
"Storm cloud heart. Billowing, angry, marching across my days, it constricts my walls and darkens my vision. Forcing people away to calmer weather, lighter hues."
My room streaked with feebly dying sunbeams  motes dreamily floating within dust and bone and withered hope vacant trapped
"Stagnant air swirls through my sad soul, the dust of past hopes gathers in corners. Vacant and idle, existing through time, waiting."
Abandonment is a part of me.
Disassociate harder from your wretched soul.
I always reach for the comfort of darkness.
When she sings that it’s over
The crumbling castles of my will the wars have been lost my armies defeated
Assimilating shadows.
Your cozened soul will betray eventually.
Weaving my soul with shades of indigo and magenta.
Heart of mist drifting over an ancient graveyard hidden in a haunted wood inhabited by my sad ghosts
My bones are knit with darkness.
Gonna kick tomorrow
"Burn them all a pyre to purify  to cleanse thy soul stars licked by flame her celestial inferno built up, lit up raze the living char the dead become ash in the breeze  #horrorprompt"
"Fleeting presence, here yet not."
Bird of soul  a raven heart ominously dark stark scavenging my mind sleek psychopomp silhouettes nevermore  forevermore   #DarkLines
Your arrows don’t pierce as deep anymore.
I know better.
The patterns and circles are suffocating.
My apocalypse is satiating.
Deliriously delightful.
Inhaling realms is my ascension.
Swallowing shadows becoming the murkiness
Incantations for a peaceful void today please.
He mosaicked her heart glass shattered and sharded  etched as if with daggers scars of sadness and sorrow  #vss365
My dark and amaranthine heart.
You wear your abyss beautifully.
In love with  my sadness
She’s not worth it.
My head feels filled with cotton wool today.
Blurred mirage hazy and fuzzy
Cmon cmon cmon
Suck me under
Ill hold your breath.
Breathe in
"I just want people to be present. Here, heart and soul."
I’m not much but I’m here.
Hello hello hello how low
Lord have mercy
The siren song that is my weeping.
My bones sing sad soliloquies to my ghosts.
Kurt 💔
Dig your thumbs in
Girls like you
Colliding with the night.
Fated stars led me here.
This ship was destined to sink.
I am the darkness.
My cobweb heart flutters a little at the divine words adorning this place.
A whisper in a storm straight to your soul
Like a scream trapped in your throat.
Transcendent apathy.
"Restless sleep, dreamscapes including insects crawling under the sclera of my eyes."
"Wreathed wildflowers in her hair, spangled with stars."
My torment is light years in length.
It’s chilly and rainy and breezy today and I miss winter.
I don’t know where I want to be.
Etched within my dark place scribed in light my fate my death metaphorical maybe write me until the words don’t hurt anymore    #MadVerse
At the origin of lovely dreams landslides of crystallized anger emanate from nightmare ghouls banned from her head this night  #reevesroses
My fairytale nightmares haunt my delusions
I’m just a figment mostly 👻
Blurry mirages fading between illusion and delusion a waking dream
"It is raining a flood today,  cleansing or drowning."
Gracefully departing.
Never reread.
"The sky is displeased,  rumbling and rolling her anger."
Our sky is grumbling!
Dusk swallows the sun and unveils the evening.
She screams symphonies.
The silence will expose all.
Harmonizing my psychopathologies.
Atypical apathy.
Lost without connection.
"My stagnant fragments of heart, soul a war waged upon battle weary thoughts  #Poetryin13"
An attic full of  unthought notions filling empty boxes  inside my skull packed away neatly collecting dust  #mentalhealthprompts
"Foolish, fragile spine"
This black gash across my soul oozing poison emptying the negative
It’s in your blood
Maslow shatters me every single time.
The unachieved self actualization.
Deeper and darker.
An aesthetic malady blooming darkly I can still see  mostly
Tearing out the necrotic flesh.
Unpicking the stitched memories I need to forget.
Anytime
Excising wounds.
My lonely and aimless wandering will endure.
"Fragile and lithe, she skips upon floating atoms  voided in ether  #ScifaikuSaturday"
"My constellation of scars arrayed across skin and soul my ache, a galaxy within the  heavens of my heart wounds tended by a tender cosmos salves of stardust planetary potions  my salvation waxing and waning  with each axial tilt  #MadVerse #poetry"
"Filmy tendrils slow danced as coagulated strands wound their way through her blood. A masterpiece in plasma, surrealism captured in serum. A breathtaking bloom blossoming beneath her lifeless body, her wide eyes recounting the final stanza of her poem.  #horrorprompt 394"
"This is a part of the blast @Perpelledead aka Broken Stems, aka Lethe put me on today."
"My November heart, a frozen moon hibernating beneath my rib. Icy cold frost shimmers through arteries, freezing it’s path throughout my soul. Drops of blood, freezing.  Silver icicles, glowing. Shattering to shards, sharply.  #ficchills #WritingCommunity"
All very illuminating.
"A sting  a white hot tear my wound of want, pining for a veil of content, shrouding the ache   #vss365"
Retreating to oblivion.
What a pain to the head.
Next level.
"Go to bed little girl, it’s past your bedtime."
Such a charmer.
Isn’t she lovely.
Craving fame
The blade under my ribcage versus the dagger through my soul.
You are only the venom spat from my lips.
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
Except the little fish
When I see your ghost
Romanticized anhedonia.
Fluttering between the undreamed dreams and madness.
The pathetic messes who ridicule others based on physicality. Especially the women tearing down other women.
"Practice what you preach, stupid girl."
I’ll dissolve into the ether  haunted and haunting forgotten notions
"I’ll remain a string of words, an idea"
"At best, you’re a song lyric."
At the end you’re just a faded yellowing page. Forgotten.
Deny everyone.
First it giveth.
I bruise in peace.
I shatter alone.
My bones march onwards  to the beats of my heart towards war
Are you a silent prayer or a whispered incantation.
Save your prayers.
Landsliding moods burying me
Survived by sadness.
Evaporate me.
In a mood to walk away and never look back.
Imagine belonging.
"The ache intensifies exponentially after bad days. The loneliness of not having a person, having to face it all yourself."
Bruised of heart contused and forlorn
A million shards to my soul.
Deliver me the rites  for my wrongs
"She tames poetry, one word at a time"
Her divine ghost soul fatalistically transpired to hold beauty most bleak and malevolent  #BlackDahliaProse 624
The lonely language of butterflies.
The silent sadness is the most haunted.
Heart of flame cinders dance embers play amidst her  ashen soul
Clawing to get out of my own mind. Escape.
My bitter hands cradle broken glass
The cascade of lilting shadows  encompassing my soul stumbling and toppling both heart and head  #vsspoem
Enchanted kingdom of ghosts.
Heart of flame.
Soul of ash.
Forsaken me
My shattering narrative.
One above and one below
My heartbeat stumbles often.
"The chimes of my soul, these days, clang raucously rather than twinkle melodiously."
I exist in hazy dreamscapes.
These ghosts complete my soul.
Are you prose or the words left unwritten.
Resting in pieces.
Trying to unshatter.
Tuck your darkness away with mine.
Divinely losing time.
Serene swirls
I will only obfuscate you.
Cradling the sky.
Why thankyou! I wish they didn’t feel sandy 😣
My eyes feel like they hold a beach.
Comatosed and caffeinated.
Nestle into the oblivion. Dream through the day.
Replenish my will.
"The shadows echo, layering darkness upon darkness. My candle too burnt to withstand, flickers in and out and away."
"Hello, Love."
Dark and fallow heart loss and isolation my constant companion   #HaikuChallenge
The sounds of soliloquies  screaming through my soul shrieking shatteringly since him
The harrow that is consciousness.
Just being horrifies me these days.
"Wake up, sleepwalk through life, repeat"
Sleep that hasn’t felt like sleep.
I have to stop crying over people.
"The constant dull ache in my heart, each day is a various hurt. A dark tunnel, Im blind to escape. The exhaustion of trying has penetrated deeply today. I just don't want to anymore."
Maybe she's busy constructing more alts to ruin people's lives with.
I just want a little relief. A little peace.
Drank a potion
Take my soul to a winter wood and kick the earth over it. Erase me.
"'you have my light, and I am darkness, left outside of you A heavenly body in fragments, sick and never whole'"
Everyone is temporary.  Remember that.
"Bound by the darkness, enraptured with its tender touch when I return to his fold. The safety, the promise of oblivion. Walled from my wars, the armies against my heart and soul."
You altar of lies will collapse.
She’s a lost cause begging attention denying her lies
My sad house of melancholy  a miasma of misery heaven and hell unwelcome
I’ll only make you cry
The dagger that is my soul.
I gazed a gazeless stare
Relinquishing  bodily and soulfully  to sleep
Drowning in a suffused sea of sedated sadness.
This illusionary life.
She studied the lines on my face
My oblivion is decadent.
Of what was everything
Returning to my dark fold.
I can feel that mood like a bolt of lightning straight to the heart.
Stitched through with sadness.
Resentful as hell.
He fire in your eyes
I miss Kurt.
‘Some day you will ache like I ache’
I love him so much it just turns to hate
In a mood to damage.
👹
Florence is my mood tonight.
You’ll be just fine
Kneeling the deepest corners of your soul.
Oceans of angels
I can’t wait to meet you there
Lamented and assured
The right words can make me cry.
In love with pretty lyrics.
You’re the murder in my world.
In you I taste god
My self destruction is a seething ocean today.
Dirty mirror
Too far away for me to hold
"The wanton lust of tormented love leaves ruins in its wake and all that remains are the stars who'll reflect your anguished soul, crystallising the fissures in a forever mist   #InstantEternal"
💃🏼
The unbloomed girl.
Hung ghosts dripping from my soul consoling and tormenting
A tapestry of melancholy.
Those patches where you feel so soulfully and emptily done.
A consenting flower willing to wilt   to shed petals  undress  #366FF
"My ribcage, you sat perched so piously and pretty snapping and smiling bending, bowing brittle bones  only to knit them with yours"
The void continues to shriek my name and pull me under his cloak of deceit and pure love
My dust wrought soul.
Uneasiness settles.
Upon my sea of darkness Stygian glass drifts shredding dreams   His auburn moon breaths pull at my tides  ebbing and flowing me  I’m laid bare Silk thirsts of soul saturated  #atreyasverse
"Tumbling, stumbling down  ricocheting against panes like ancient drums of war  This sunflower rain drenching my drought of his perfect soul   A tonic, restorative  quenching every inch of my cherry kissed dreams  #atreyasverse #poetrycommunity"
"Gauzy threads of dream settle on the backdrop of yesterday, as unconsciousness caresses with a velvet touch. This night may be eternal, I’ll awaken maybe never, instead becoming stardust and sighs as you fall asleep with my name on your lips.  #PenPixels"
The moon sorrow is tidal.
Sequestered sadness standing sentry over my soul Stilling my shrieks Soothing my shattering  #Poetryin13
The susurration of fine satin against thigh whispering secrets threaded with her promises of his salvation   #366FF  #poetrycommunity
The void in my soul likes the void in your soul.
"A weary traveller or a fading star, ghostly mirages tangling between here and gone. Unseeingly seen, noticed but not. Leaving no shadows, no imprints as they away. Further and further. Fading and fading until nothing."
'I had all and then most of you Some and now none of you'
The soft wave of oblivion  floating me away afar across rising and falling oceans in time with my heartbeat as inertial force pulls me back to you  #2amTale #poetrycommunity
Tangled shadows spilling from the background Im spellbound by words remaining unuttered decaying My heart's soul keeper left writhing dying My bulletproof angel  fallen  #MadVerse #poetrycommunity
a constellation of moods
My ship  destined to sink  Fated darkly a journey to sorrow Never to be worsted ruined hull of heart  #vsspoem #poetrycommunity
It’s a shame your soul reeks.
The siren song that is my sadness
My bleeding words will bloom poetry.
The lulling of raindrops liltingly lovely
"Imagine, just for a night seeing yourself as I see you and I, as you see me"
Iridescent incantations His voice  is sorcery to my storm Leaving me lost in a catatonic state   #SalemVerse 130
Pluck my petals one by one
Destruction of heart.
Created of butterfly souls.
Imposter heart.
Living in lyrics and lamentation.
You. My altar.
An invisible line through my soul Half disassociating In a dark and misty wood Earth on skin
Butterfly with bullet hole wings.
Bullet hole heart.
"I feel between existences today Here, not here More spirit than mind"
I wish I wasn’t.
I wish I didn’t.
Broken wings crushed petals
The jilted one is mad.
Like a dog with a bone.
You’d make an interesting psychological case study.

"I desire darkness today.  An ancient graveyard aesthetic. On a misty winter's eve.  Century old tombs, lost souls, broken marble.  Faded words and faded lives."
"""If the full moon loves you, why worry about the stars?"""
This solitary space echoing with a crushing silence  enshrouding my aura blinding my perception darkening my mood  #moonmystic  #poetrycommunity
"My walls built up high a laid bare soul, my battle wars could not defeat   #HaikuChallenge"
"The ceaseless sighing of a taken heart, loved and cherished eternal   #HaikuLust"
Thankyou 😊
Nostalgia ravages.
Of red and gold crimson and aurum  a canopied gallery arboreal lust  A path through time shaded shadows  I collect fallen leaves as so frequently I must with my awakened heart  #wineverses #poetrycommunity
Serenely careening through my veins you pour in through every pore your sweet pathogen binds my receptors pretty poison floods my blood with you  #vsspoem #poetrycommunity
Her risen moon dewed in melancholy exhaled by his crushing silence their skies forever night   #moonmystic #poetry
Clouds promenade towards the horizon and through   (Pic by me)
Sadness marches on A war at my walls
Loneliness is standing sentry over me.
Save your prayers
Raindrops as pearls Littering her skin
Dreaming as time ricochets  forward propelling  beautiful misfits towards a velvet spun twilight circled  with cerulean reveries  #atreyasverse #poetry
Cirrus of mind.
Cumulus of heart.
A tonic for darkness To wither it’s hold
Soul sonatas sultry soliloquies  serenades of sadness
"‘And his sadness is Dionysian, Black champagne his lamentation’"
Secret 4am business. Insomnia.
A bouquet of darkness.
Soul contusions.
Oblivion to lucidity ruin to reconstruction  you’re my every spectrum  #hangtenstories 1433 #poetry
Drowning in motivational theories and it’s very unmotivating.
I don’t care what you think
I’d die in your arms
A proclivity for petulance.
Love is a verb
"Baby, just spit me out"
Sheltering eternally with your poetry wrapped around me
To with in denial
Rising from the dark depths of my coral grave I penetrate and ascend wild crests  for home  #VerseAngel 389 #poetrycommunity
So new to your bedroom floor
And the world got still
That sepia day your time to leave a hazy replay my air hard to breathe  Memories fill time picking up the pieces an eternal wintertime healing from releases  #vsspoem
The ocean her waves my eternal Svengali  I feel her pull and follow her siren always  #moonmystic
Sheltered by an umbrella of dreams day and night engulfed  #hangtenstories
Yeah they really want you
Come set your ghosts around me.
Ugh 🖤🖤
Wistfully waiting wondering  watching looking out and lamenting this life  Photography: Dorota Gorecka
naked and pure from earth to ashes and back a whirlwind venture  #HaikuChallenge
"A fate the date with her destiny, designed and delivered like a sharp blade to  her heart  #BlackDahliaProse 620 #poetrycommunity"
Carmine petals cascading over me silky skin to silky skin
Blood letting petals from my wrists
A thousand flowers could bloom upon me and I’d still not feel mortal.
Arcane of soul  clandestine of heart
In each sunrise those we’ve lost visit in remembrance Like a mourning dove we keep wait and watch every dawn  for faded memories From darkness to light each morn will herald  all lost souls into another new day  #zenverse
Come strike your lightning upon my flailing heart.
Invisible ink or missing pages my story is incomplete  Notes doodled within the margins but mostly written  outside the boundaries In this life or the next words will continue  to tumble and spill  towards The End  #RavensVeil
"Less than and beneath my  own high expectations  an unjust standard, which I fail daily  #poetry"
Shrieking thoughts shhh pill or potion to tame the torment and quieten   #Storyin12 #poetry

Wait
"Jealous eyes of stony  silence and vitriol sear the soul, scorching flesh and bone to ash  #poetry #poetrycommunity"
One by one
Phrenology for the heart.
My psychopathology is you.
Scratch away
Cresting seas spill from my veins a tsunami  for you
Iced coffee weather.
I want something good to die for
I’m petulantly and irrationally selfish 🖤
Big black hearts thrown around always end up as daggers in my own.
My bones still murmur to you.
Drape me in stars a moonlight cloak Weave stellar magic  throughout my hair Celestially sparkling reflecting my adorned flesh Douse my soul in space dust bury my scars Crash your lunar waves  cresting cleansing  collapsing me  #moonmystic
"Cozened heart the night, a thief  silent stealth she tiptoed away smirking   #Storyin12"
Learn to swim
Weeping shades of cozen indigo
"Charades and ruses alchemist of mind, he bends illusions of her   #HaikuChallenge"
"Release the day from heart empty the mind and soul embrace night, she will replenish and cleanse  #vsspoem"
Swept up in daydreams I live cloaked and protected half living half not  #Poetryin13 199
A thousand flowers could bloom
Absent of a North Star.
I can’t trust my memories.
"You look me, in the eye directly"
You will ache like I ache
💀
👻
My harvested heart unto the ether an empty rib cage  still feels phantom beats the pseudo palpitations remain and shock  #Grimlist2020
My veil is thin my line is fine my soul fractured  my mind a hive
A bend of the light refractions trick the mind and treat beauty to sight  #ScifaikuSaturday
"My guise, my mask a human girl concealing a ghost a shadow of living a blur a faded memory that has yet to be woven  my favourite costume  #BadWordSat #poetrycommunity"
I stroll beyond my grave  watching those weeping souls torn from their realm and into mine welcome  #BlackDahliaProse 619 #poetrycommunity
"Full moon return me home to where I’m with the earth skin to dirt, decaying flower renew  #vssnature #poetrycommunity"
I desire oblivion today nothingness
Bizarrely scattered and mixed up dreaming.
Landslides of listless loneliness.
We can’t make up our minds or moods today.
Beautifully grim Together for never  Jan Saudek - Hungry for Your Touch
An eternal filter of dusk such gorgeous gloaming the dark part of twilight  where my helpless heart lies murky of mind and somber of soul  hide me in eventide embrace me with night  #MelancholyVerse #poetrycommunity
Procrastination flirtation
Death does not discriminate  at each ending He will come enticing and cajoling let go  abscond this mortal coil transform  transcend rebirth relent  #TarotScribe #poetrycommunity
Bonfire heart  to ward off evil
This evil  needs gentle hands to caress mold and evolve a sadness  to be overcome a darkness to be at peace with a self to accept  #vsspoem #poetrycommunity
Like a million shards of glass to the eye.
Smooth pale skin hiding a heart of hurricanes.
Please do.
Empirical emptiness.
A tonic for my ailing soul.
Colliding with the sky.
His apocalypse smirk.
Ischemic   #onewordpoet
Daddy’s little girl
It’ll go away
They don’t go to Heaven where the angels fly
I’d be untrue
Click click boom
Comparing mood stabilizers with the sky.
And what quaint variety of sociopath may you be?
"Ischemic heart starved, dehydrated my blood supply waning clotted life force ebbing darkness flowing  #Beautifulmess"
"Triggered and trauma are the new love bandied about with abandon and nonchalance, almost frivolity but there are people, such lost and wretched souls  who know who get it  who battle their traumatic past year in, year out day in, day out every hour, minute, second #painfulprompts"
Drown me in beautiful aesthetics today. I’m going to weave a perfect daydream for self care.
"Pestilence follows closely, watchfully  awaiting  abiding time he knows a plague is due is deserved gleefully rubbing his hands together smirking at the thought of ruin the pain, the fear the damage, the death  #grimlist2020"
Take me here
A thousand flames lighting my path to return unto my darkness my self
A fresh corpse washed up on my shore of desolation.
"So much noise,  so little substance"
A reaper soul.
"My heart, a cage for a tiny jailbird in and out  of love  #Poetryin13 #poetrycommunity"
Precocious weather Flurries of rain and snapping wind gusts
I desire a lonely dark graveyard and a cold plot to sleep in.
I am a dark shadow in the middle of a very much lighted world.
I am the icy chill of lost souls.
🖤🌺
"I want a noir filter over today. Cynicism, stark light."
She’s melting again.
"The ceaseless sighing of my soul,  just like an ocean"
The numbness and disinterest.
"Half here, partly present floating in a cloud displaying appropriate shell but wandering soul a day lived inside glass"
An aptitude for darkness.
Only philistines color coordinate their hardcovers.
A driving pain to the skull.
The emptiness is quite complete.
Just like it never existed.
"Storms and dragonflies dance  lazily upon clouds, between lightning tracing translucent shadows  obscuring  chalk outlines of dreams eclipsed when their words have failed  #PenPixels #Poetry_Planet"
Now I’m doing time
Fire tribe of blood ice colony of soul  dead ghosts  nightmares alive my temple doesn’t discriminate  #BlackDahliaProse
Make me cry
Full of good will
I don’t think so
Refractions glinting rose quartz emitting from her eyes as sadness through the looking glass reflecting her heart fractured apart  #CeruleanProse
Seared across my flesh burned and blistered scrawled onto bone jagged little lines  etched into my memory  deeply embedded scarred and marked ‘I’m fine’  #weirdvss
Never again.
Baying for quiet.
"Barren soul, desolate mind"
Disassemble and  disconnect me unlink my breath and detach my emotions  sever my arteries and spill my heart deactivate thought cut off sight discontinue   #StarWrites #poetrycommunity
All the other flowers have a bee.
A counterpart  for my heart to replace  the voided space  #hangtenstories
Soul snatched by the ether.
The torn wings of my heart.
"A searching curiosity to discover, obtain a worldly seafarer or a naive girl  #MelancholyVerse #poetryin13"
"A clockwork mood to be tinkered with when faulty, repaired when destroyed, maybe replaced entirely. A machine. Black and white. Effective, defective.  #vss365 #poetrycommunity"
Time ignores like the silence of death
An everlasting journey towards self  #5wordspoet
We were ephemera.
Abyss a silent scream hushed by shadows densely  smothering and suffocating the noise  #whistpr
"Spilling, overflowing"
Delete me.
Abnormally psychologied
"I won’t say it, but you know."
Feverish lips whisper lies as the essence of luscious lilacs seed their glorious sonnet of delusion  Malevolence drenched with passion moody beats my satin heartbeat beneath decaying ribs and mildewing posies   #SoulfulOde #poetrycommunity
Breakdown coming running
It’s abnormal. I don’t like it.
Beauty of essence and ethereal facade  the cool mist swirls and envelops  me whole  #vssnature #poetry
Repose my ruined soul.
"The eternal bite of consciousness prowls the dawn  snarling, dragging me awake jolting my system into remembrance chasing away the beast of night  #InstantEternal #poetrycommunity"
Your ghost floats around and hovers between my light and dark horror
Dreams of monsters and mermen  subdued indigo lagoons under stern silver moons  Shattering to nightmares  evil casts shadows swallows it all taking me with it  #DarkLines 494
Love hangs herself
Took a bus to Chinatown
The way
With the birds I’ll share this lonely view
Care of something  somewhere better
I’m dark I always thought I was alone tried to hide it but I found another darkness they’re few and far between but he bestowed hope to me
Shouting wind rattling and whistling  vying for my idle attention  #storyin12
"Tragedies become easier to assimilate into yourself, the more you endure. Or maybe you’ve just steeled your soul against them - reinforced the heart and mind, held that little bit back, subconsciously rehearsed each little tragedy you could eventually face. #BraveWrite #Writing"
"Tragedies become easier to assimilate into yourself, the more you endure. Or maybe you’ve just steeled your soul against them - reinforced the heart and mind, held that little bit back, subconsciously rehearsed each little tragedy you could eventually face."
"A sphere of light blue sadness in the middle of my chest delicate, easily shattered"
Darkness my old friend and familiar embrace return me to your sullen fold captive
The lies we tell ourselves.
A thousand flowers could bloom
Not you. BBH. The ‘others’.
They’re all insignificant now.  White noise Dust Echos
Don’t bother milk or cream
Trust I seek
Fearless on my breath
Might migrate to tumblr and start a savage blog
Going to need to carve out a chunk of my reality for a while here.
Face to face
Has anyone heard from @Marks_of_ink - he appears to be  MIA
Paper thin patience prettily perilous
Wake me up when it's over when you are over disintegrated to dust just gone forgotten never was  #DimpleVerse
A sniper foolish trust confirmed kill shot    #7wordspoet
My treacherous breath catching and holding admitting defeats and failures of desires of heart I am her unwilling accomplice   #vsspoem
Wondering if her was still red
and burn your bridges down
A shyness that is criminally vulgar
Numbers do not lie unlike people
Trust the data.
My trusty hatchet  rusty and bloody splattered and dull from decades of use upon my own heart  #horrorprompt 385
"A Cinderella midnight-black raven dust shivering between fine feathers a shimmery beacon, a sentry, observing lustfully kissing starlit spirits as flecks of a thousand ethereal ghosts wail through the shadows and weave their woe with the heavens  #atreyasverse #poetrycommunity"
My dark soul delicate glass  filigreed shards shatteringly ornate ruins  #hangtenstories 1423
"It took barely a sudden gust of breeze to shake her foundations these days. Subservient to acute threat responses, her flight or fight demons were always lurking, under the skin, poking her brain, prickling the back of her eye.  Chemically aroused. Exhausted #mentalhealthprompts"
"Beastly palpable His insatiable hunger For her, her alone   #HaikuLust"
A howl plaintive and mellifluous  passionately painful your attention held  Secrets shared desires delivered  upon whispering winds  into your ear and straight to your heart  #SundayShadows #poetrycommunity
"Eyes illuminated by fireflies,  darkened by moths"
Biased to the confirmation of everything and nothing.
Predisposed to broken moods and fallen halos.
Torn pages and broken wings.
Am I merely a mirage A wrinkle of mind A spirit disappearing into a shadow
Resentment erodes me.
Just stay away.
My soul is a rolling thunder clap.
I do not like my feelings today.  I desire to ruin everything and everyone.
A veiled moon hangs over my ocean.
I watch symphony orchestras and feel so envious of the beautiful music those musicians can make.
"I often fantasize about running away and starting a new life. Like, no trace of my old self. Totally erased and reinvented in a quant little English hamlet."
Mistress Miseria
A sadness to rival Oizys.
Silver tears by candle light  #5wordspoet
Moondust particles sprinkling my soul coalescing into dreams and desires to dream of  #Poetryin13
You're out of reach.
Spider under my skin.  Kill the bitch.
"Small and tight and tense Dark, muted, overcast Sweet oblivion as relief"
"Your poison drips from every word painting your ugly veneer, exposing your toxic soul no antidote can save you from yourself  #vssmurder"
Purple bruised mood.
Insignificant twit.
The Devil’s playground is ensconced deeply in my mind.
"I want to be absent today. Of soul, of heart, of head.  Sleep me for a couple of days."
You’re both as bad as each other.
Another slipped rung of the ladder.
Taking my ghosts to bed.
"Confounding and confuting  the magic will consume you. Cut the deck is this your card? Watch close and keep your guard. A hat with a bunny bewildering and funny but a lady cut in two? A wave of wand, some uttered words and you could be in thirds!   #FlexVSS"
"A tear in time, rip it apart"
A gleaming gibbous silvery tendrils of moonbeams spotlight the beach beauty vibes as love waves goodbye  #moonmystic
I do not feel today. I am without a mood.  Vacant.
Your voice soothes my every war wound.
I am the final gasp of darkness.
Dip me in dopamine  a deficit is dragging me down deep into despair.
"Ominous odes devolve me, a truth inhaled and alienation exhaled to suffocate my self actualization. Depraved dissonance dances me into temporal chaos, stalks my sanity and  strangles my soul into eternal sleep   #horrorprompt"
"Sinister scrawlings sinful scribbles across my soul etched deeply in bone Desires and pains wishes, past trauma An endless tombstone graffiti worship of past, present and emerging   #DarkLines"
Witch of heart and soul.
"Hidden island haunts buried below bestowing skulls, skeletons  of ancient aquatic creatures. Ocean tides timelessly crash, deep waters expose their secrets. Hollowed ship hull heart torn, stained sails of my soul my shipwreck exposed #ficchills #WritingCommunity #poetrycommunity"
I linger and wander my focus culled motivation maligned  I mistrust myself decisions unmade incompleteness my ally Strength I once possessed  abducted and exiled I bend and break instead of flex and flourish  #vsspoem #poetry
"I’ve woken with a shadow across my mood, heavy and somber."
A delicate construct of driftwood and sea foam.
"Eternal shores of transient oceans, silent tears shed and  neverendingly washing up, crashing against my dimmed lighthouse. From dusk of illumination to dawn in darkness, my ship will never be guided by your beacon again  #InstantEternal #poetrycommunity #Poetry_Planet"
Younger English Tudor historians are sexy.  That’s it.
"Fallen stars are fine, but imagine a shattered moon,  splintered into a million silver shards perforating the night sky, watching it hemorrhage indigo and black"
By night the blade gleams it stabs grinning at the  stars and moon  #Poetryin13 #poetrycommunity
I am the pick in the ice of your mind
A darkened ocean of an esoteric fashion.
You are my war. My surrender.
"Dancing dreams behind my eyes of lovely lavender lullabies and symphonies of butterflies mellifluous choirs doth arise high above smoke and azure skies lilac shadows embrace, tranquilize    #SensualScribbles"
Bloodless Exsanguination if you please I can’t abide mess Cleanliness is next to godliness  after all  Although I’m far from that A neat demon Picture perfect Cathartically cleansed As I’d like your corpse   #vssmurder
"He knows how to push every button, manipulate my body and soul. And revels in it."
I lay in wait mind body for only you. Sighing to my memories designing your new ones imagining those we will make. My tongue your fingers my lips your mouth our heat shared goosebumps. I will lay in wait for you always ever until my grave  #Erotica280 #poetry
The splintered shipwreck hollow of my heart.
My eyes knew you before I ever opened them.
Exhume my heart.
"I live a lot of my life in darkness, figuratively and literally,  it stops me seeing myself clearly, as above."
"A trail of tears filled with fire and ice cleansing and purifying her drifting, dropping they fell  #painfulprompts"
"You course, unendingly, through my limbic system."
Black heart ~ now next forever  #5wordspoet
With a flourish of my tongue I sign my name upon your skin and claim you as  eternally selfishly mine  #vsspoem
"Whisper murmur anything, as long as it’s  your voice it will irresistibly  and delicately  leave a pretty scar across my heart  #becomingfragile #poetry"
The repent of thoughts accusatory silence alone in the night   #moonmystic
"Echos fade in death beneath the devil’s shadow my malevolence is laid bare. Unfelt feelings, unuttered words slip down, raze like swallowed incisions. Repair me with your  silver thread of words whispering in the stitching so I may breathe again.  #atreyasverse  #poetry"
The soft dive of oblivion
Send me all your vampires
"Reading you, head to toe, heart to soul, cover to cover."
The ovation of the abyss.
"I covet, but am I coveted? By someone unknown in secret without words or communication. I wonder if I am  someone’s unrequited love as I have unrequitedly loved  another   #SensualScribbles"
Cottony veil. Partly here.
"My heart of sticks, all empty branches and absence. This melancholy, an oppressive balm of  fallen promises.  Once blooming and full, my canopy of colors have disappeared into the fog.  #RavensVeil #poetrycommunity"
My void is not merely a facade.
"My mind is full of cinders, remnants the leftover bits"
"A shattered ocean, a million spent waves weary and weak"
The chaos dances me around and around sweeping me off my feet  dizzying and disorienting. It dips and lifts me chasing and teasing as  it plays me into the darkness.  #MoonMystic #poetrycommunity
"Like a beautiful vine clamoring and climbing ancient castle walls, you’ve enshrouded my soul, protecting me from inclement weather  #whistpr"
I have a symphony of exhaustion.
"I feel like I’m floating in a bubble. Here, but not. Pretending."
Dirty words murmured by the prettiest lips.
Slipping into reality.
I wait between the story and the sigh.
Your demons are my demons.
"How gentle I fall every time you inhale words and exhale poetry for me. My darkest dreams whispered, our heartbeats finding rhythm, your intentions delivered. My scarlet sin blooms crimson for every moan  that escapes your lips.  #InstantEternal #poetrycommunity"
My demons piled up like skulls in catacombs  reminders and trophies.  Walk my foggy path  come and visit play amongst my ruins.  For even my ghosts get lonely  #SundayShadows #PoetryCommunity
"It lingered, just beyond the pines, a little too far away to be sure it was even really there.  A gauzy shape, nothing solid, the fog made sure of that. A shadow, a blip. Maybe, maybe not. It saw everything. Everyone. But no one saw it.   Oh but they will.   #horrorprompt 383"
..the wicked
Lead me out of the dark. I’m beneath shadows between breaths lost parted from a path. Guide me through the clutching thoughts ‘til I can see inhale be  #MelancholyVerse #poetrycommunity
Like a fist to the jaw
Beautiful sad boys.
Surreal shame the mirror betrays impure truth shroud it’s shrieking   #hangtenstories 1416 #poetry
Whispered something in your ear
I had built such a pretty fortress.  I tore it all down. Welcomed the war.
War lain at the drawbridge of my heart.
Shadows on the wall forming grayscale  love hearts and arrows  as we flutter to sleep amidst our anxieties and  neuroses and poetry  #Beautifulmess
The tainted wastelands of my wicked soul adorned by grim duplicity of heart. Coal black lashes bat  upon indigo eyes  which lap every inch of your crimson lip. Whispered incantations inhibit and inter  my mind with yours.  #SalemVerse 126
"Footfalls echo behind and around surrounding my senses. Shadows shadow,  the mist disguises form  but not intention. Gazing evenly, noticing patterns  plotting the crime scene. I will be beside you by moonlight and standing over you, lifeless by dawn.  #vssmurder"
"Pristine and unflawed soft imprints bloom to crimson bite, adorn my neck  #HaikuLust #haiku"
"Saturnian rings  we dance along, twirl beneath iced moonlit wonder   #scifaikusaturday #haikuchallenge  #haikuLust"
This one knows better than I do embracing a dreamcatcher night. Handfuls of haunting reveries holding hostage the heart. Instead caught in a filigree web so finely and beautifully woven from the loose threads of my soul  #BlackDahliaProse #poetrycommunity
"Instinctual, base he reads my blood crashing through veins, as an animal would it’s prey.  He nears attuned to scent, stalking his want.  Helpless with anticipation an ocean of adrenaline  drowns me.  Synapse fire, a heady intoxication as I  pounce and claim him  #Erotica280 389"
These haunted chambers of my heart.
Your words  across my nerves inhibit and soothe dull my vigils sequester zen  #Poetryin13 183
Paint the prose prettily purple allegories in antique fuchsia  opera mauve for metaphors  berries and lilacs linger upon lavender language  while pomp and power  personify my poetic pathos  #CeruleanProse #poetrycommunity
"Your blood speaks wildly, yet soft listen for destinies  and fates  #hangtenstories 1415"
Who’s got the loneliest feeling
I wont close my eyes
Faultlessly flawed.
Again and again
I’ll only hurt you in my dreams
"Bound to spirit lashed to soul eternal entanglement  crumbled and numb revive me alive, darling  recollect me  #poetrycommunity"
You are my perpetual blind spot.
I will forever deny the tear in my eye
A chorus of silence  eerily poignant ardent arbors in tourmaline forests moonlight and sunlight dapples and reflects acts of pleasure and pain between this world  and the next  #MoonMystic #poetry
"Can you absolve  a black heart of hate? Justify an existence unlived and alone? Forgive a mind so narrow and wretched?  True tests of soul of morality  of awareness, but easier believed than achieved  #vsspoem #poetry"
Blindfolded by hands smooth and strong roughly tight slipping lower pinching lips squeezing throat pale assassin stealthy amidst the light hiding in plain sight my antidote  to life  #vssmurder
Knowing me remembering my little things
I’ll strangle you with my poetry and then revive you with my silence.
I can romanticize anything.
Girls like you
Waiting for your three wavy dots.
Tired and tied sleepily bound love   #6wordspoet
Flawless melancholic beauty.
A corpse to fall in lust with.
Don’t tell
My lover is trauma a piercing kiss  into my skull thorns to my eyes caressing and blinding eternal memories preferably buried   #poetrycommunity
I know better but I don’t
A dystopian heartache.
Inscribe your desires across my lips sweetly and soulful your motive my accomplice    #Poetryin13
Your flame licking at my shadow smoky tendrils reaching out delicate ash floating dreamily I inhale your embers and fumes you hold my gaze blazing beauty smoldering souls signaling our spirits   #140Line
I’m the bad cop.
Thirteen echoes chime  and I’m rendered mute the pleasure and pain of silence dances throughout glimmering and shattering but my mind darker than death can only scream into my void eternal disquiet   #atreyasverse #poetrycommunity
Caught between every sigh.
Lustful love heartstrings tangled  as well as bed sheets unzip my soul and then my dress leave me exposed bare caress my mind as you trail fingers across my skin over curves between my moods  #Erotica280 #poetry
Diminished of heart shrouded and guised play the part do you even realise  #Poetryin13
Tear the veil away. Rip me back to consciousness.
Our eyes meet in the mirror.
The seemingly incurable melancholy.
Fount of blood.
I am absent of new words. Take my old ones.
Spilt.
Daydreaming about floating away on a cloud of smoke.
"She stood out despite wanting to hide. More green than hazel,  her eyes sought and demanded everything from you. Messy hair a most delicious cafe noir  highlighted with caramel fairy lights. Pearlescent skin, prettily pale.  She definitely stood out.  #poetry"
Words that pierce like bullets.
The flames leap and pirouette  the finishing touches your cleansing of him taste the holy smoke on your lips the acridity at the back of your throat  the remnants of your broken pieces powdered and ashen discarded and forgotten  #vsspoem
Your debacles of heart unpretty and messy outlined with hate  #hangtenstories 1411
Silently violent in love and lust a heady cocktail to compel us in body and soul  #vsspoem
Tendrils clutch as  darkness creeps upon the hollow voids in blackened winds roaring around my heart  #SalemVerse #poetrycommunity
"Conspiring thoughts buzzing caution emotions appear louder than they actually are objects may seem bigger, harder breathe reason relax  #FlexVSS"
Igneous thoughts sodalight whispers  sculpt and polish my words with your lips.  Read my blue dreams caress and taste my intentions and  return them to me  in your kiss.   #moonmystic  #poetry
'No vacancy' a flashing neon sign across her heart since he left   #Storyin12
A blade through the words slicing a thousand tiny wounds and bloodletting my prose excising the poison within draining you out my premeditated slaughter  #vssmurder
My being is jittery today soul shakingly so
Deftly whispering odes prose and poetry into my ear straight to my heart   #Poetryin13 180
The preluding banter setting stage alighting neurons setting fire lust  #hangtenstories 1410
Wouldn't you love to love her.
Big big love
Drive my car into the ocean
Sitting beside this wishing well whispering hopes to cast a spell upon my heart and soul to quell the thoughts that weave my private hell.  #poetrycommunity  #WritingCommunity
I’m the man
"On guard, always, against the hateful demon inside. He is watching, waiting for a chance to attack and topple me. Gnawing on my thoughts and memories.  Lurking and prodding, I feel his presence more often these days. It's harder to suppress him.    #SundayShadows"
"It resided. Nestled, tucked.  Clinging to sinew and enmeshing with bone. Infiltrating the sulci and fissures, the lobes ravaged. The chambers surrendering as  poisoned blood coursed through. The chaos was winning.   #SunWIP #WritingCommunity"
I’ve observed your soul and that pretty face has completely vanished.
I would like to forget curl up in nicer memories
Permanent stains marring my heart that I cannot remove.  So now I hide them behind silk throws  under fairy lights inside a pristine but impenetrable abbey.  #vsspoem  #WritingCommunity
Lips of a violent nature stalking your wounds seeking to soothe creeping and shrouding neuroses coalescing and committing trust  #vsspoem
The skies remember indigo with reveries of blue and gray purple bruising of a stormy eve contusions and lesions beauty spots  #moonmystic
Insipid and uninspiring.
"My fortress torn asunder  your war spilt at the drawbridge of my heart ravaged and corrupted your willing prisoner, I condemn myself"
The brittle husk of a life lived lined with  delicious memories and dust  #Poetryin13 179
"My path  a labyrinthine trail  scattered with  broken souls  Demons of unease beneath my breast  hinder and handicap and sow seeds of doubt  Seduced off course by threadbare whispers of contempt and scorn twirling me, dizzying my direction  I must bleed conviction  #atreyasverse"
"Confessions and conspiracies  recanted by candlelight. Illicit alibis, imprinted internally. Spells cast, souls summoned. Our sinking prayers unanswered. Our sins witnessed. Condemned.  #DarkLines #poetrycommunity"
"Adorn my lunacy with amethyst stars.  Tangle them in tragedy,  weave them with woe.  Surrender my wars, tranquillize my tides.  Protect my soul and defend my heart.   #moonmystic"
"Torture and torment  the foreplay to murder.  Prolonging the pleasure, a panacea to palliate the  perverted pangs  #vssmurder"
Confessions like confetti late night acknowledgement of private lusts saintly sins whispered  divine forgiveness sought for transgressions we plan to commit  #SensualScribbles
Your beautiful words abandoned you when you wielded them as weapons.
The mystery of being found amidst ruin. And without looking.  #inkMine
Pull off my skin
Your halo slipping
I hope you've exorcised me  cut me out completely because otherwise  I will only return to haunt you  #vss365
Like a torn out page flittering listlessly  yellowing discarded  #micropoetry  #poem
"Give me words that bloom beautifully, even when rooted in the deepest darkness."
Your wounds will tell me everything I need to know about you.
Ugh 🔥🔥
The merciless gaze of stars suspending you in their eternity standing sentinel in the sky just outside the galaxy door.  A strangled silence unsettled space a cosmic ceasefire  shattered at the speed of sound  #SciFiFri
You fell like a star and even then  no one noticed you still  #Poetry #Poetry_Planet  #micropoetry
Forever the bait for my heart. You.
Bleeding petals.
"My glass heart, cubic zirconia a charlatan lurking inside  prettily playing pretend  #ThursPeak #poetry  #Poetry_Planet"
You go in shadow
I have never felt so well
"Glancing my way, your eyes swallow me whole imagining skin on skin pheromones dueling, cedar and patchouli  soliloquy sighs slipping between salty kisses sweetly settling on our lips adorned senses  senselessly adored  #vsspoem #poetrycommunity"
"Sugared lips, honey tongued"
Extinguish my sins.
Feebly available wretched and unwilling to help myself without you  #hangtenstories 1408 #micropoetry  #poetry
They never needed a safe word instead reading every flinch  every sharp intake of breath every clench of every muscle every sound that escaped each other’s lips  perfect synchronicity  he kissed her beauty scars and she told stories with her tongue on his skin #Erotica280 #poetry
"She stood out despite wanting to hide. More green than hazel,  her eyes sought and demanded everything from you. Messy hair a most delicious cafe noir  highlighted with caramel fairy lights. Pearlescent skin, prettily pale.  She definitely stood out.  #poetry"
Subverting my emotions.
I have no specialty
All the blood that I would bleed for you.
"Your heart, it sings"
"Cool, cool hands when the fever hit"
As Autumn languidly awakens she daintily unfurls into a showy foliage display of dancing leaves and  bending boughs.  Her oil painted colours mutate crimson and golden  conspiring to be deeper and richer shimmering within the dust of  every approaching darkness.  #SoulfulOde
Come crash your waves upon me.
When I must remove your wings
The system is collapsing
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
I'm here.   Between your words scribbled hastily to the heavens.  Upon the sighs  passing your lips when we talk.  Within the memories that dance across your mind when we're apart.   #poetry  #poetrycommunity  #poetry_planet
Enmeshed with waxen shadows my soul slips between  low-lit dreams and reveries  #Poetryin13 177 #poetrycommunity
Slipping through thin reveries.
In the pines
"Breathe in, breathe out"
I’m a slave to my emotions. Helpless. At their mercy. I have no control. I don’t know how to escape.
I can taste you on my lips
Every broken bone
Deciding whether to fight or flee.
The more you change the less feel
Looking out from the inside.  A child who is not allowed to touch anything.
In the throes of sadness.
Baptism of butterflies.
How do you own disorder
Keeping company with rain
Then I laughed
I’m with everyone and yet not
Hurtfully hateful mostly to self but to some others
Ruining destruction  a maelstrom of mindlessness
Nomad thoughts take flight wandering lost a misery plight  A rope to rein them bind securely tether them to me let me think clearly   #vss365 #WritingCommunity  #poetrycommunity
I would like to be a storm cloud today.
Bury me with butterflies.
I’m ready to return to the stars now.
Jealousy  high voltage electrons fly my senses fry it’s electrocuting  #hangtenstories 1407
"Like an insane asylum, my mind is full of damaged memories, forgotten feelings. Memories that have murdered my heart, feelings I’ve forgotten, the bad ones always hide. An horrifically sad facility, locked in, no escape. Wailing, screaming, crying. A madhouse.    #horrorprompt"
Levitate me higher but who will catch me when I fall the inevitable collapsing  crashing back down  This is where the let down finally begins  #whistpr #amwriting  #poetry_planet  #poetry
"A storm does not dampen my spirit.   Instead it uplifts.  Ferocious and furious,  a sudden spike or an anticipated buildup, my spirit is seduced, my heart swollen.  Cleansing and soothing,  awe-inspiring, pleasure-inducing, beautiful and dangerous, you.  #flexvss"
The silencing of raindrops.
"My heart protests frequently. And too deeply. Perceived betrayals and untruths. Paranoia engulfs my sensibility. Like a child not getting her own way, I accuse and abuse. Trust was eroded long ago. It is a weak point.   #140Line"
Heart of hurricanes.
Stained by emotions. Cleanse me.
My melancholy  pristinely polished immaculate and intimate enshrouds my being I’m eternally entombed   #Poetryin13 176
My ghost girl is visiting.
"I am not easy to perceive I’ll admit, I do deceive it’s a wall, simply, to protect but it instils neglect its unhealthy, imperfect  a structure I’ve established to repel trauma fight off fear halt any hurt from doing further damage  #vsspoem"
The wind plays with my hair like your fingers used to caressing and tugging and pulling me in

Train my heart to lower her walls and rebuild a  cosy cottage   #Storyin12 #poetrycommunity
A show of hands the ocean waves and breaks upon the shore  Offering treasures from her depths such beauty to adore   Shells and pebbles and occasional trinkets fathomed into eternal folklore   #BlackDahliaProse  #Poetry
ok
"Judging by that one 'friend' you're a wonderful judge of character, Love. Now nighty night 🌛"
And I’m still not convinced about you!
It’s cute how you carry on about coming at you directly and then subtweet me.
I am so angry about how badly some people choose to damage others. And then carry on as if nothing ever happened.
She’s nothing but a forgettable smear a spirit to rue and regret transparent and transient instigating and irritating from her lonely island  #1lineWed
"After the death the death of my soul from you, your mind  My retribution slow and steady a thin stream of  vengeance  Seeping into pores enveloping your senses a brief sting retreat, repeat  Bitter, but not sweet prolonged and persistent  timeless torment   #vssmurder"
I admire the tenacity of wildflowers  to bloom amidst adversity the poeticism of a single flower  stalwartly holding place in a plot of arid land  #vss365

He realizes. He just doesn’t care.
"Jealousy is a curse, random blockers whom Ive never interacted with."
"Mayhem flirted with the storm  seductively glancing at the clouds being escorted to the gates of hell  A life of havoc had caught up - lain with the devil, once too often so a fate was delivered  The demise of disturbance carnage committed to cease anarchy avenged  #vssmurder"
Matters of the heart and other disarming disasters often leave me ruined  An autonomic hypnosis sedation adoration expiration  An autopsy of soul what went awry and why  #366FF #Poetry
A letter to you on a cassette
My skull is insufficient for the blinding hot and painful demons behind my eyeballs 🤕😣
Savage the circles  cauterize the cliques erase the scams and algorithms
Symphonies from the sea forbidden forest forays beautiful things should not be a challenge but loving you ain’t easy  By design or default  you challenge my emotion force me to question  what it is that I seek and my answer is always resolutely  you  #moonmystic #WritingCommunity
I know.  Doesn’t mean I have to like it.

Players only love you when they’re playing
I want to make it wit Josh’s voice
My costs versus Your benefits
Some people just infect you harder.
Stolen moments opportunistic glances sought breaths caught dreams fraught  with fragments of you and my tongue on your skin tasting you a teasing rendezvous overdue between me and you  #Erotica280 378 #Opportunity  #poetry  #poetrycommunity
Ears are full but you’re empty
And forget with the kiss
"Burn the sorrow from my eyes leave them lifeless, listless devoid of despair  absent of angst unalive  then reignite my sight with shards of light rays of hope and  dared dreams a desirous heart  reflecting and remembering your ability to kill and reincarnate  me   #vssmurder"
You play all the right games
A low throaty laugh appreciative I do enjoy a gruesome tale dark and dreary settings morbid and morose characters I will lap it up blood and gore mingled with imagination and intelligence draw me the way to my heart is straight though my rib cage  with secateurs #366FF #amwriting
I start to complain

"She stood out despite wanting to hide. More green than hazel,  her eyes sought and demanded everything from you. Messy hair a most delicious cafe noir  highlighted with caramel fairy lights. Pearlescent skin, prettily pale.  She definitely stood out.  #CeruleanProse #amwriting"
As it’ll rain like the moon I’m here your surety  #hangtenstories 1404
Rain down on me
You cannot rewrite your history no matter how beautifully you string words together
Your heart in a single  teardrop   #sixwords

Plunging #back down deep into  toxic habits eddying and swirling with hatred and disgust that vicious cycle strangled choking clutching for escape any escape the escape  #vss365
The system is collapsing
Inhaling lightning exhaling thunder
I fall at your feet every time you sigh my name
Fifteen blows to the back of your head Fifteen blows to your mind
Open up your skull

Lunar reveries stardust memories  moonlit darkness soul catharsis we'll play pretend float and descend you and I the day and the night sky  #moonmystic
You’ve seen my words. You’ve seen me.
You’ve seen me.  And I’ve seen you.
Walk through the flames with your words ablaze.

Butterfly manifesto.
Red wine declarations adorable

Your guise does not fool me I know a black soul  Rip off the mask bathe in the beauty of your darkness  Wield it like a dagger and  thrust it at feelings  Wear it like a crown and  we will kneel before you  #Spooktober

A bouquet of lilies white as snow upon my grave  Is there no return? No rebirth?  Nay a renewal a return to another plane  To live beside you but unable to touch to listen to your voice yet unable to converse  You will know I am here for I am curled in your soul  #horrorprompt
Slip inside my soul.
I’m simply a graveyard guest for now.
Efflorescence blooms  icing my soul a delicate crystalline lace adorning  a haunted hollow  #Poetryin13 #poetrycommunity
Get off your high horse. Sanctimonious nitwit.
The blowing gale and full moon are at play regarding my dirty mood today.
The brilliance of him raising me up whilst sinking himself   #hangtenstories

Adorned with string lights  twinkling intermittently  my heart is not always black.  Simple trinkets strategically placed add atmosphere.  A little sparkle a lick of flame can always lighten the darkness.  I continuously remind myself.  #Beautifulmess #WritingCommunity #poetry

You don’t scare me with your barking.
"The beauty of discolored-by-time, mossy tombs. The untold stories. The pretty pain."
"Meandering monasteries, imagining the memories."
"In a mood to wander through an ancient graveyard, overgrown and abandoned, and befriend the ghosts whom surround me."

"'Mischief managed', she whispered to herself, with a smile playing on her lips.  She knew she had won this round with him. And that there would be retaliation. Stubborn and determined, achingly pleasurable.  Payback is key in the game of lust.   #366FF"

Kept some company with other lost souls in nature today.
But I would not want you any other way.
You will ache like I ache
Oblivia times three tonight. And maybe hope it sticks.
Extremely well aware of my place of priority.
You’re a stake through my heart.

Drawn to the moon.
Toss my soul into a grave.
This fable of mine is mist swirled with platitudes I used to grasp and claw but it’s impossible to hold a dream
Alien nation.
"Shatter me, again and again, until I am dust upon a moth’s wing."
I desire ruination.
No one knows.
Chaos shaped girl.
Making your amends
Wounds in the mirror waved
I will swallow your abyss whole.
Plenty of other lost souls in my abyss.
"If my content displeases you, float off."
You do realise you don't have to follow me. Or anyone. RIGHT??

"The tide is strong this day, I need to return to shore."
Eyes of tragedy
"Save yourself, take your heart and soul and disappear into the fire."
"Flagellate me on the ruined altar of flowers and moss, leave my skin flayed and my soul released to the butterflies."
Bullshit fakers
"A beautiful cremation of words, a semiotic death"
Beat me out of me
Head first into the flood again.

Desperate and ravenous

We should find a black hole to disappear in.
Feeling reckless.  C’mere.
Baptized by butterflies.
Indulging my dark dalliances.
"With an open palm, a slap to the senses."
My demons  I sway with Contoured together not a dream between Our subdued dance of death.
Delusion exclusion
"Draw the blood from my heart, syphon my soul."
Get off my cloud.
Expelled by those I don’t even like
Beautiful bones adorning my garden of mildew and decay.
Divine draughts delicately palatable silky and smooth quenching the purest of thoughts

"My sky is a masterpiece of contusions, a grey mass of a hundred shades, swirling and dancing past."
"The sky is moody today,  bruised and battering."
I fantasize of our leaving
Tiny love hearts etched into my skull.
"Haunt my words, my heart revenant apparition specter soul phantom fantasies relapsed, reposed returned"
"Freeform feeling, amorphous affection"
Arranging the stars in a pretty configuration of a map to find yourself
A tortuous tiara to adorn my skull.
"A gallery of my melancholies, my sole masterpieces, adorning time, dusty and forlorn."
Melancholic maladies  damage wrought daily weight release
Unsupportive judgmental  toxicity let them go expel to the ether you’re better without unkindness  grudges backstabbers 𝓉𝓇𝒾𝓂 the fat  #whistpr
The pitted steel of my heart’s rusty shackles.
"Invisible explosions gusty and squally panic and childlike petulance blustery, buffeting a maniacal maelstrom  rupturing skies, ripping the heavens apart  unseen turmoil a growling cacophony, uttering displeasures frenetic furor, frantically fracturing"
Desolate  of psyche  inconsequential  pneuma flicker out fade to black eternal peace
Darkness  a plethora of depths my constant  a fathomed galaxy an eternal inamorata  #Poetryin13

The crescendo and everything after.

Who taught you how to paint the wind?
"Those emotions that hit like a bolt of lightning straight to the heart  terror, pain, jealousy  piercing, takes your breath away   hope, pride, adoration  warming, fills up your soul  #musemon"
Existing between your words playing amongst your thoughts thriving in your adoration
"Souls clashing beautifully like wars of oceans violently cataclysmic  pure, idyllic"
Our flaws  will paint  a masterpiece
As per absolutely always;  You.
"A fitful fever full of fervor,  fierce and frenzied, finish  for  me"
Our ghosts can play while we kiss.
The beautiful gloom of a rainy day.
"A soul, perhaps beyond retrieve Reposed gently Beautifully broken Fragility, frailty  Eternal external  #Poetryin13"
"Mary’s gold, Upon the altar Offered, accepted Marigolds or coins   #hangtenstories"
"He built the house, their forever home. They filled it with things and created memories.  He died in the house,  surrounded by the things and their memories. It really was his forever home."
This lightness triggered renewal a pinpoint of hope
My heart is his lonely haunt.
"His intention alone, before setting even a finger on you."
"The enduring 𝓈𝓊𝓃𝓈𝑒𝓉 disrobing light  Whilst a darkly moonrise  slips into place  Romantically moody Spiritually fierce Waxing or waning Blue, silver, blood or black  #SunScribbles"
"From the moment I saw him I had a 𝓁𝒶𝓈𝒸𝒾𝓋𝒾𝑜𝓊𝓈 desire to trace him with my tongue, to 𝓁𝒾𝒸𝓀 the lines of his tattoos, taste the salt of his lily white skin. A 𝓁𝑜𝓃𝑔𝒾𝓃𝑔 to feast upon him, devour him mind, body and spirit, swallow him whole.  #SeduceMeSundayWrite"
"With an abundance of confidence, his 𝒽𝑒𝒶𝓋𝓎-lidded eyes held my gaze, as I looked up at him.  A power struggle.   #SatSpark"
"It all seems so hard, so 𝒽𝑒𝒶𝓋𝓎, so hurtful.  Striking at the heart like a dagger.  Twisting and tearing. Colors fade, life is lived in greyscale. Melodies seem off-key and a persistent hum fills the mind. Perpetual life appears as a daily chore, a soul ache. #SatSpark"
"Frail girls and birds, wraiths walking barefoot in the woods and floating in water like corpses."
"Opening up, exposing everything that you detest about yourself naked, stripped, spotlighted there’s not a more pure, raw feeling in the world apart from acceptance #vsspoem"
Unconveyed feelings fluttering furiously awaiting admission into reality for you  #hangtenstories
When you feel someone’s sadness more than your own. That.
"'I made my bed, I'll lie in it I made my bed, I'll die in it'"
....and she was never heard from again.
Of love or lust?
Amidst betwixt medial entangled with surrounding  your mind
Kissy kiss in the rearview
Adorn me with wings and I'll speak with ravens.
"Honestly, show some class."
Choking on the ashes of her seared soul.
"People never talk about the women cheating on their husbands, I find."
What a stupid little girl.
Nasty and jilted is an awful personality trait.
You should learn when to go
In you I taste God.
"Lovely girl, you are the murder in my world."
The world is a vampire
"Adorned words, strung with sparkling fairy lights the pretty prose, gilded and elegant poems and lyrics and narratives blooming with emotion invoking all senses in myriad ways"
A collage of memories etched across my soul death love remorse regret accumulated   #Poetryin13
....she 𝓌𝒽𝑒𝑒𝓁ed helplessly as the bullet careened into her heart  #hangtenstories
"Dark and muted  the colors haze slate, pewter, smoke converging across life moody and somber of psyche and solidity midnight, charcoal, ash dimness encroaches and envelops"
"The human condition is cataclysmic trauma, abuse, neglect mine is unto myself and by my own hand shame guilt, hate, sadness daily I inflict and flagellate myself  whilst empathizing with others who do the same"
"Tragedies exist within me, past and future. I understand the language of devastation better than that of love."
No 𝒾𝓃𝓀 required  when he can pen love notes  directly to my skin  with his tongue #FridayKiss
Soporifically awake take me back
"Tempestuous consciousness sleep eternal preferred relax and wish hard to return it’s gone, evaporated  awaiting the next swallow of pills"
Kissing your neck tastes like nectar and ambrosia.
That pious sounding little demon should stop offering her stupid opinions.
I want to be doted on. By at least three men. Who adore only me.
Resurgam.
I’m going to stop falling for words.
"I’d scratch your eyes out, given half a chance."
Be better.
My heart vigorously holds the entirely of winter.
It does take two to tango.
My soul rests on my lips as words pour out.
My salvation will come from the beauty within darkness.
"Read me the classics, or anything,  as long as it’s your voice."
Write our destiny on my skin with your tongue.
I want to be alone with him.
The beauty of hastily scribbled notes in the margin of a book on a shelf in an abandoned library.
The stars are shrieking.
I attempt to  hide things from my mind but I’m simply too smart  for my own good !
My MO is to ignore things until my world implodes.
Kiss my soul better.
"There was a particular absence of light in the dark woods. Trees canopied densely and clouds obscured what little moonlight shone. The earth slumbered silently while nocturnal creatures tiptoed around. Decay and mildew assaulted the senses, permeating heavily. #DarkLines"
Lust at first sigh.
Invisible wounds pouring carmine petals a flow of pseudo blood
A genesis  of hope poetry flowers  butterflies a palace of what may come  #Poetryin13
"Synapses firing lively impulses  imparting our messages  excitatory, inhibitory us  #hangtenstories"
I did a scary thing and didn't die.
My cycle of violence is only unto me.
I’ll be your blade of satin silkily slicing your soul
Read the room!
"Physical short sightedness I can forgive, psychological myopia I revile."
Your galaxy expands  black holes multiply glittery dust swirls lazily  gravitation pull tightens dwarfs to giants  stellar and interstellar she’s here
She compromises your cells playing in every nucleus tickling the membrane  threatening your very structure an invading molecule you don’t want to cure
Pluck out my eyes and fill me with the saddest dead stars.
Replace my anxiety with blossoms and butterflies so I may become an English garden in spring.
"Obscure, blurred, undefined these words captivate me hazy shadowy faint they enhance mystery, and help me to only half exist"
Sleepy murmurings intimate mundane words cozy nearness feeling and seeing and hearing regaining consciousness with you waking to a beautiful dream
Blurry kisses for your broken body.
The final petal curling up and falling is my own personal metaphor.
Fleeting companions
Bone shatteringly beautiful
A glittering tiara for your pretty skull.
Temporary is tiresome.
"The familiar, comfortable but can ruin. Bad habits turn into vicious circles of self abuse. Escape, flee, fall, return. Repeat."
Crying tiny shards of crystal
Sleepy soul weary and wary
I just wish everything.
A rainbow's tail a ladder's top fortune or fall fate   #hangtenstories
Spent.
Your pathos speaks volumes.
You feel like a power struggle.
"Self assuredness invites personal scrutiny of all the ways people treat you. Which you deserve, which you don’t, which you should sever, which you should cherish."
"The power to feel better, to do better, to be better. I’ve not felt this in a while. It’s a jolt to actually feel that I deserve better. How do I bottle this?"
A myth ?
Absolute transparency
"Beautiful writers, lovely image curators you are my bibliographies my inspiration and motivation"
Intoxicated by emotion quell and numb me
Asymptomatic carrier of kindness
Magnetised melancholy frenetic apathetic a mood
"In a mood to carve your heart out, plant it and see if it blooms or decays the earth and everything growing around it."
Mood
Preserve my corpse let it not fall into wrack/ruin like my soul  #Poetryin13
Seething silence tense  reckless ruination I'll hide between words and behind prose orchestrate the semantics choreograph the logic and concepts to befuddle you and wreck myself
Going to offer my soul up to the woods and moths forever and ever amen.
"Blinded by the pretense,  swallowing and lapping it up,  remember, its not my problem,  its your dysfunction."
Pathetic  antithetic being
Metastasizing thoughts bore through my mind exposing pits of clarity exposing unwanted truths sounding a death knell
Inauthenticity versus delusional versus lying.
"The skies enthrall me.  The beauty of bruised heavens, a stormy vastness, punctuated by clouds. The hues, the layering, the eternal ether. I'll not stop admiring."
‘Adoze and adream’
"Shades of lust written in the sunsets crimson, carmine, blush the passion and ardor  ochre, amber, mauve the mind absorbs  the body reacts"
"A crown of hope nestled atop her tresses unloved, abused but still there a thin conviction yearning faith, perhaps"
"The sky, a vast keeper of secrets and wishes and hopes."
"The bleeding prose gives way to blooming wildflowers, which will eventually become a garden that feeds your soul."
Wind chimes strung with the bones of enemies the sweetest serenade of victory
It’s more greyscale than black some days.
He makes her darkness softer.
The void is always there. It’s just a matter of how soul encompassing it is.
Ticking time bomb mind.
A clockwork heart.
I think about your lips a lot.
Manipulating words into a galaxy.
Letters to words to sentences to forever.
"Dreams in beautiful, dark and muted shades of baroque."
Words seem ineffectual. My words. I’ll just enjoy the words of others today.
Notes become chords become a song To dream/die by #hangtenstories
"A museum of undreamed dreams, unthought thoughts. What will be."
Imbibing darkness.
Scribbling  I 🖤 you  on tombstones
I’d rather be glitter today.
It’s ok. I can’t deal with myself either.
Occasions of hate.
An alcove a nook to huddle  with daydreams of you revive my soul #Poetryin13
Cyclonic winds to blast the atmosphere apart rip the sky open tear the clouds apart split rent lacerate ruin myself
"Th ravens peck at my heart, a thousand tiny gashes. No one will remain."
Let flowers bloom where I pass and butterflies flutter in my wake.
"A hateful ghost, vicious and desiring to hurt herself and others. Caged, broken, damaged and damaging."
"Bury me in a dark forest, smelling of the earth, alone with the creatures forevermore."
The bitter bouquet of you.
"The plummet is silent and eye-wateringly rapid, no warning, no reason."
Whiplashing moods.
A war of seas Tsunamis of mayhem  Waves of destruction Mood and mind
‘Bullet with butterfly wings’: Just pure perfection 🖤
"Murderous mouth, suicidal lips"
We’ll all eventually be consumed. By something.
Toxic trains of thought poisonous and pensive
I feel only half alive.
Arsenic thoughts.
"Palatial heartache, extinguishing light, removing color, silencing your world."
Offerings of blood and prayers from ancient souls.
It started with a plaintive moan and ended with me paying perpetual penance with my soul #horrorprompt
Butterfly priestess.
Lunar lullabies dark and eclipsing waxing and waning  as sleep orbits and lands
Some lips are not worthy of speaking pretty prose.
The abhorrence of beautiful words being abused.
Pretty in pallor 🌸  Photography: Katie Eleanor
Broken craves broken.
Earth to earth With a gamut of heavenly bits between #hangtenstories
"A spiritual garden growing intricate mantras, tender self talks and personal kindness."
The silence of self    photography 🖤🌺
"Abandoned on the side of a back road, a ditch her eternal unmarked grave #Poetryin13"
Words in a box on a shelf in a cupboard awaiting their   perfect muse.
"I captured dream fragments. Little whisps, lone snapshots, a blurriness."
"A heart beats through the words. Syllabic sentences soothe souls,  the meter of the prose mediates the mind."
"The otherworldly place, nestled between awake and asleep, I lackadaisically dwell and decide whether to rise or fall."
"A hall of mirrors, reflecting and refracting your dreams and nightmares."
"Words shelter me. Yours, mine, theirs."
Embrace my affect.
Darkness disordered.
There is beauty in breaking.
"The poeticism of a simple moth, flittering madly."
Merciless daydreams of your lips.
Meandering through your mind.
A steel-cage death match for our souls.
"Awaken my soul, I’m yours eternal #sixwordstory"
"Silvery cumulus, gliding across the azure"
With silver thread I suture flowers to my skin and stitch butterflies in my hair.
"His soul is blood and love, ripped black jeans and a double Jamesons."
Suffer for your ghosts.
My ancient archetype is one of moths.
"Adorn my soul with rose buds, thorns as pins, so I may bloom as they do."
"Darkness and beauty ~ the manipulation of beauty,  the enhancement of darkness.  The antithetical and contradictory draw me.  (Photography: Leila Forés 🖤)"
"Twirling a loop of my hair, deciding whether to bloom or bleed  today  #poetryin13"
Hide in shadows intertwine with night evanesce into nothingness eternally I never was  #Poetryin13
"Otherworldly realms, darkness accepted, the beauty of ice and snow abounds."
"Mood: covered in butterflies while they slowly open and close their wings, their velvety caress soothing me to sleep."
"Ascending  back to life consciousness returning drop by drop warm and cocooned oblivion drenched the veil slowly slips  awareness, alertness remembering  head noisy and eyes gritty the daunting war ahead"
"Self preservation Ignore, dismiss the predators stop, halt, cease engagement wait, wait, wait don’t open up remain dormant protect, shield, defend"
"Haunted farewell notes, telling tales of loves that were never meant to be."
My psyche is just a series of ghosts and moths and ruins.
"A bonfire of flowers, an oblivion of fragrance."
Looking inside from out a despised accumulation  lamenting regretting the past and present
Looking out from inside  a pseudo life hoping wishing reveries and realities
"My lonely tomb, repository of mind. Nameless, unmarked. Interred with ghosts and flowers and butterflies."
"The seconds to hours, the sunrise to sunset, time is a nemesis. Waiting it out, filling it, ignoring it - you will never conquer it."
"Strings and strings of days and nights, like cheap plastic bead necklaces that will snap when pulled too tightly."
"A fallen abbey, ruins enveloped by mist. If you listen carefully you can hear the faint and maudlin chants from past inhabitants."
I want to not want anything/one
I want to be ok with being alone
"A ruined poetess, wordless and empty, a ghost of everything that was."
The cherished reveries evaporate at the first drop of light.
02.22
Oh sweet oblivion.
Ophelia. Avenging siren song.  Kalliope Amorphous
A mute function for my mind.
Spilt. Empty.
Labyrinthine mind.
"An orchestra of weeping ghosts, composing songs full of sorrow."
"Never an outlier, forever the mean."
"Occupying my cells, the darkness is my structure."
Pinch out my candle.
I look forward to consuming him.
His blood is of the finest vintage.
You left your shadow on my soul.
"I smooth your blurry facade, now crystal clear and opaque, and I can read every inch of you."
The discernment between lethal love and hallowed hate.
Parasympathetic parasite.
"An alluring aorta, a heavenly heart."
Think you’re kinda neat
"Soliloquies spilling from the stars, shattering the silence."
A nourished soul is my embraced intention.
"Crawling across my skull, languishing within my soul."
I eternally feel you there.
Design us a narrative with a beautiful plot.
Write me into existence with your poetry.
"My heart is adorned with fairy lights, strung with precision and twinkling prettily."
"The prettiness. Autumnal, ethereal."
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
"We keep playing with thorns, like wishes, which only end up tearing our skin and hurting us."
"She is a sparkle, a light, a rare star I cannot fathom into a galaxy."
"Cradled, ensconced, caressed.  Earth to earth."
"Passionate drops of you, in each word, eclipsed by every silence."
Watch the temple topple over
Flowers bloom when they’re ready and are strong enough to face life.  I want to believe it’s the same for me.
There is romance in the darkness and we can dance to its maudlin melody.
Well versed in the language of loneliness.
A portal to an alternate sadness.
"The place that I fit in doesn’t exist, Until I destroy it."
My pretty
"Oh, reckless abandon"
I gazed a gazeless stare
There’s nothing romantic about the hours I keep
BBH
When will I learn 😅
"So simple, so pretty. Stop to smell."
I trust I can rely on your vote
"Honey, I’m home."
"Stay your path, don’t stray."
My venous system ❄️
I just want to buy all the books please.
"Petals pooling, her body a beautiful corpse amidst."
"'I had no idea what I wanted, only that I wanted something, which is the worst kind of wanting' ~ David Levithan"
"And you, you knew the hands of the devil   #NowPlaying"
Remember the sparks when our words first collided?
Sonorous heartbeat in rhythm with yours.
"Your sighs, a symphony An orchestral ovation."
Never underestimate the power of a beautiful fragrance worn upon the pulse points.
"Darkly dancing candle flame, a moth flying to her death of splendid sadness."
What a tragic fall from grace.
It still is.
I'll be the thorn to your heart.
"You're nothing but a cubic zirconia, Darling."
'So cruelly you kissed me Your lips a magic world'
🖤🔥 @_Hasoooo
She ‘left’ in April. Still pining in September.
What ineffable tactics.
"Woman, your desperation is showing."
My words have fled.
Thunderstorm heart.
"A love note, penned upon my heart."
"Dead flowers, living words"
Bones bleeding floral blood.
Hemorrhaging butterflies.
Skipping heartbeats like skipping stones.
"Language is a life force, lilting and lingering"
Her prose pools like blood.
My background music is a storm. A beautiful tempest.
"Quell my vulnerability, tranquilize me  with your embrace of solace  and your lips of enchantment"
"The mist, the fog, the veil to escape."
The creeping vines can take me. Hidden with mossy logs and mildewing leaves and adorned with wildflowers.
Hollow ghosts inhabit some But the pretty ones know their worth And always return home.
"My fatalism adorned with jewels Cruelly mournful and wistful Plaintive, maudlin  My mind magnetized by moths and Soul sated and sanctified by   You"
"Unapologetic manipulation Put down, tear down Validation external, look at her Fantastic, grandiose exploitation"
Truth twisting and other narcissisms.
Aesthetics 🖤
I feel your presence in my skull.
Be here with me.
Another dead flower weeded out.
"You are the pull towards consciousness, yet the oblivion is strongly calling me back."
"Mood: a graveyard saturated in funereal gloom, dotted with ghostly white tombs."
The malevolent forest that is my mind.
Succumbing to the moths.
Leopards. Spots.
🔥🔥 @_Hasoooo
Some people exist just to teach us who we don’t want to be.
Manic stare.
Mirrors and smoke.
Fading and floating like the final petal to drop from a rose.
Am I under your skin yet? Inside your skull? Rattling your heart?
One day I’ll wither away to a pretty Gothic poem.
Even my heart butterflies are listless.
The heavens and earth know how tired my soul is.
Show me that you love me
The quickening pulse at the thought of your lips.
Leave me in the woods for moss and wildfires to collect me eternally.
Ethereal mist is my favorite mood.
"Dream collecting. To store in a jar, on a shelf, for when required."
Torn apart by what brings us together.
Please unlock my dreamless sleep.
I wish my dreams would return.
"The slumber of the dead; no dreams, no nightmares, just enduring darkness."
As beautiful as elemental dust shimmering along moonbeams.
Bridge our hearts.
The antithesis of hope is me.
"I am your farewell note, penned in her blood, under your pillow."
My heart and soul and other black holes.
"Heartbroken butterflies, forlornly fluttering."
Tangled in your orbital pull forever.
My soul is a graveyard for the sad ghosts who die from heartbreak.
Eternally in love with the prose.
Pay attention to your data and examine them closely.
"Mood: wearing lace in the woods, barefoot and virginal."
"Warm fingertips, traipsed lazily along collarbones."
"Ruin me. Shred my soul, hammer my heart.  Then it’s my turn."
Ethereally elegant ghost girl garden party.
"Decaying and mildewing petals, just like you."
I’d keep you in a jar and pull off your wings.
I’ll be your beautiful destruction.
"A museum of mood disorders, maladies and diagnoses. Symptoms exhibited, treatments showcased.  Success and failure your only exit and entry ticket."
"A pristine library, reverential silence. Paying respect to the antagonists and protagonists of the ages. The delicate pages offering up gothic typeface, gold and maroon richly textured illustrations and the whisper of the ancients."
A perfect black dahlia for a heart.
My blood only makes my flowers bloom more furiously.
"The sky is bruised and battered, meandering carelessly towards me."
"The wind is howling again, braying; righteously shouting, laying down the law of the sky."
My soul belongs to the memories now. My heart to the nostalgia.
"The archetypal sad, broken girl."
"Doe eyed, with an ancient truth."
"A shrine of moths, velvety and muted wings, praying feverishly to your deity."
Please allow the pretty flowers to bloom about my corpse.
Yes I take my citing seriously! You haven’t lived until you’ve spent 6 hours getting 5 references into perfect APA style!
"If you’re going to quote Sylvia Plath, for God’s sake, please quote accurately."
"(Please leave, please leave, please leave)  (Please leave, please leave, please leave)"
"Chronically apathetic, serial sadness sucking at my soul."
Stem my bleeding soul and stitch me back together.
Oh to be a butterfly X-ray!!
The reality has infiltrated my little make believe bubble.
So beautiful and perfect and beautiful 🖤  'I would like to skip this part. Bend time. Unravel the weave of my life. Rearrange the ribbon dipped in blood. Wash it clean. Let the silk lay smooth and in the sun.'  Helaena C Moon
'I never wanted the flesh. How it never fails to fail so accurately.'
Its all just temporary.

Nostalgia
“Her heavy hair was full of the perfume of roses and sandalwood. Beneath the languor of her heavy lids slept passionate violence. She was almost terrifyingly beautiful.”   Renée Vivien
I miss driving to pretty places.
There is never anything just for me.
I’d give you all the blood in my veins.
Mood: unraveling
Mute me harder.
You are the neoclassicism to my renaissance.
Tread carefully on thorny paths.
An asylum for my moods.
Adorn me with garlic flowers and douse me with holy water.
"Bleeding flowers, petals pooling"
Speak in tongues and let me read you.
"My heart library is dusty, old tomes unread for centuries."
Civilizations rise and fall as we kiss.
I’d spend hours inside the library of your mind.
Old sepia photographs of smug young men with their shirtsleeves rolled up. The world was their oyster.
What a rube!
Pretend ghost girls at a pretend party.
Hiding the panic in petals.
There is a baby dragon in my throat.
Quieten my limbic system and I’m yours forevermore.
Sever my cingulate gyrus.
‘I measure every grief I meet’
With myriad pain.
This mess we’re in.
Post adrenaline brain ache.
Counting every tear and sigh Laced with sadness where they lie
I am my own noose.
"A tormented shore, like my mind."
Just cease to exist.
Why can’t I float away.
"I’m periphery Shadows Like looking through glass after rain Here, but not A name to ask another about Someone you once knew"
Unseeing Uncaring Stay there
I stand amid the roar Obscured and unseen Others know of me  But not  Me
Damp souls sprouting despondently.
Moths are my support systems.
Venomous soul and heart. I hurt and want to hurt. Then guilt to complete.
Make no mistake; I know.
My life is his.
Every new day is a passage of horror.
A hyphen between realms.
"A library of trees, every one in its place, waiting for the readers to find them."
Some people are your noose.
I’m petty and I don’t even care today.
My ghost is not used to so much from someone and seeks shadows once more
The line between sleep and waking is blurry so my choice is neither
Wandering a lonely churchyard For a grave to rest my weary head
Flow through my soul In rapidly rolling waves.
‘Daffodil bulbs instead of balls Stared from the sockets of the eyes!’
‘Say maiden can thy life be led To join the living to the dead’
Ruin my realm.
The prose consumes me.
A discordant melody Tunelessly tuneful
Rule my realm.
Clasping arms and cautioning lips.
Either the dark alters or something in in adjusts itself to be seen.
We grow accustomed to the dark. And the light.
Surrounded by mad disquietude.
Sacred palaces of queens crowned.
Reading Dracula and eating marshmallows.
Learn to swim
Addle my senses.
Burningly sublime.
Fire will cure this place.
See or shut your eyes.
Ominous dark towers hide my soul.
Ruining altars and lives.
Ensnare me in your eyes.
Mood: clouds billowing across an everlasting slate canvas.
The sweetest ghost belongs to me.
My dreams conspire with the daylight to torment me.
My dreams like to hide and tease me.
"An age-old love note written in the clouds, protected eternally by the silver linings."
I missed saying goodnight to the moon.
How many dreams slip through your fingers every time you wake.
Sewing stars to the night sky.
How many fairy fires burn inside your heart.
How many sonnets have you yet to pen.
How many apparitions does your heart ache for.
My soul is your abyss.
A haunting curse laced with loneliness.
"Howling winds, but no leaves left to blow."
"Catching falling stars, as they dancingly descend."
A paroxysm of lustfulness.
Ancient tomes telling of civilizations no longer amongst us.
"The divinity of the ocean. Turmoil and carnage, picking up and destroying everything within. A maelstrom of godlike proportions."
Pricking your finger on a thorn of the most beautiful rose in the garden.
I bared my heart and survived.
And then retort that they don’t know why they attract demons.
Some people invite their demons in willingly.
A cleaner love
I shall shatter these circles. Or at least remove a few arcs.
Fairweather people can get off my cloud.
"The asylum of loss. Lost souls, abandoned minds. Shells of the people who once were. Beautiful devastation, abhorrently pretty. Bleak, grim, dark."
"A crystal palace of broken hearts, shards glistening and gleaming in the moonlit courtyard, amidst beautifully wilted and decaying roses."
"A haunted library, with sparkling dust in sun rays, and ancient moths keeping watch over every beautiful and tragic story."
"Abandoned abbeys with moss covered tombstones, telling stories of the past."
"Don’t be mistaken, the poetry chooses its muse first."
I want to go here with you.
"Brooding clouds, every shade of grey and dirty white, stacked up across the sky. Menacingly hovering, spying their targets."
Spinning a web of wisps of hope around my heart.
There’s an emptiness inside that beautiful flowers just cannot fill.
The sea will save us.
I am a rusted padlock without a key.
Play with the words until flowers bloom.
Exhausting emotions are egregious.
Saturnine girl ghost Abounding hopelessness and  Eternal ruin
Tidal crashings.
My castle is broken and the wind blows cold through ruined battlements.
Inherently damaged. I know nothing else of myself.
Petals trail behind me as I wander.
Let me bury my head in prettiness.
I’m not ok. But I just want this space to play with prose and look at pretty images.
These words are feelings.  I don’t need any more guilt for them.
My words here don’t require sympathy or advice.
A shield for my soul.
Armour clad heart.
The bile is rising just thinking about you.
I wish I was a gothic ghost story.
"Honestly, I just wish."
An abject apathy dwells within me.
I have enough wars going on in my head.
You’re a battle that is not worth my effort.
"My goddess, the tempest is here."
Glass cathedrals filled with beautiful butterflies.
I just want my peaceful place.
Felt 🖤
"A rusty dagger, dull and pitted, for your soul."
A dagger for your rotten heart.
Ugh so many vile things I regret not reminding you you said.
The shimmery iridescence as a soul passes.
"A poison rose, the fatal fragrance."
"Always in shadow, silhouetted by your gaze."
Kiss the darkness away.
Kiss your poetry into me.
I’m not worthy.
Your demons wont observe boundaries.
Conversations with the wind.
Black lace to patch my soul.
Scars laced with silver thread.
To accept your demons as a part of you.
"To know that they are almost a comfort, as you wouldn’t know what to do or be without them."
It takes a certain person to see your demons.
A haunted love for my girl ghost.
The sky is brooding and huffing and puffing.
The wind feels like it is trying to push us down to hell.
Vanilla clouds
"There’ll never be what was. I don’t know how, right now, but I have to figure out the what will be."
My demon today is anhedonia.
Gothically beautiful.
A voice that regales ears.
All the deliberate lies we tell ourselves.
Of scorned delights.
The wistful pensiveness of darkness.
Thoughts fracture ideas shatter the crackling #turbulence of mind bestows agony and sorrow  #poetryin13
The ghost girl with flowers in her hair.
Sharpening the knives of my apathy.
Imagine revealing your shadow self.
My blood crashes like the tides when I think of you.
Worshipping moths.
Bury me in the catacombs of your soul.
"A haunted labyrinth, spirited with ghouls and ghosts."
Roses amidst ruins.
Honey wine and ancient tombs.
"Life is a blood-letting, the only variance being flow speed."
"A brook of tulips, babbling beautifully."
Thoughts covered in thorns.
"Coiled souls, waiting to strike."
Seeds of light  pinpointing stepping stones  towards...  something
The soothing murmurings of adoration.
When dreams aren’t all dreams.
Condemned to eternal butterflies.
The flowers and the fire free us.
Press your hand against my soul. Feel the flutters that I feel.
"A ghost song, a beautiful lullaby."
"A ruined priestess, circled by butterflies."
The blood never lies.
"A past to not remember, a future to not want to."
A few shards of myself would even suffice.
"Ethereally poignant. Misty misery, melancholic mood settling within the soul."
"This clamoring heart, suffused with butterflies suffocating the bile."
Gothic ghosts guarding graveyards.
The abyss is spectacular today.
Devoid. Positivity. Hopeless. Guilt.
The venom gleams upon my fangs.
Thinly veiled ideations.
I don’t know and it’s too hard.
Instructions for my heart.
A map for my soul.
"Perhaps rock bottom, a call to action. A new cocoon to release a new butterfly."
A shell. Nothing left but memories  that torment.
Controls everything I am.
This stranger has infiltrated and  inhabits.
Ceasing to exist sounds delightful.
"Pretty prose, painfully penned."
Ruining worlds and restoring love.
"Sacrificial souls, purification offerings."
"I would wish to shed time, like a snake would it’s skin."
With trembling lips I whisper.. ..hope.
French kiss my soul.
I want myself back.
Preordained by divine butterflies.
💜
The dark love owns me.  It splinters my bones and laps at my blood.
"Soothe my nerves, relieve my soul."
The tonic of you.
"To breathe, to feel"
Complete annihilation in a single heartbeat.
The intense destruction of self.
Pretend ghost girl.
I don’t want to pretend life today. Lockdown fatigue has me in its clutches.
Tangled up in grey.
The epitome of exhaustion is the daily pretense that you are  f I n e
Pretty girls make pretty graves.
Swathed in abandoned souls.
Reading with the rain.
Abject simplicity A gaze held a second longer A hand caressing slightly further The unobtrusive inhale of your skin
A rare bird. Sigh.
Tempestuously alone.
Nerves explode and I am the fallout.
"Ripples in the looking glass.  Blurred, unfocused, obscured. The timid soul."
This is my Nothing Effect.
The crying demon across my throat.
The emptying has begun.
Butterflies weep within the depths of my soul.
The nothingness. Arrives and settles. Like an old friend. Lingers longer each time.
The emptiness is soothing.  For a time.
"A box, shut up tight within myself. I wouldn’t know what to do otherwise."
"A trance,  spellbound. The resonance of your heart and the coursing of your blood."
A new universe blooms every time you sigh my name.
Revere the boundaries.
Your echo always remains by my side.
"To feel admired, wanted, enjoyed, adored."
Graveyard romanticism.
Pretty little maladies.
The veil seems resistant to lifting today.
The blades your words could wield.
The tides rise and crash harder when we’re together.
My blood pumps in rhythm with your words.
My unrest smothers the night sky.
I am a constellation of apathy.
Where does the vision end and the reality start.
The solemn gaze penetrates my being.
Forgettable agonies.
An endless fury radiationg from his bones.
It’s just a matter of time before you become a drop of blood in my glass slide collection.
Returning to the fold of those things which spark some contentment.
Where can I get a Dexter?
Shake my tomb.
BBH
Cut you in
🔥
🖤
Thankyou my friend 🖤 A beautiful and much appreciated wake-up message! I’m so thankful for this little circle of likeminded writers we’ve become 🌺
A soul to resonate with.
This beautiful soul 🌺🌺
Every breath contains potential.
The pangs are awful.  The jolt to your being.  The stomach drop.
A piece of mind for peace of mind.
A ravaged soul to ravage mine.
Spread nothingness throughout my mind.
Engulf me in numbness.
Neutrality and apathy.
I need pretty silly stuff now.
Freeze me. Freeze my brain.
Mystify me 🎵
My grey matter is throbbing.
🖤🌺🖤
I snapped. I have been very restrained I think.
A black-clad procession down medieval cobbstoned roads. Bury me right!
Caress what has been long untouchable.
It’s ‘just’ a game 🐈 🐠 @violet_skyx
You hear things enough times
The fetid stench of decayed and mildewing fairytales.
What a palaver.
Poof! Disappear!
YOU’RE THE VICTIM
Filling in the fissures.
Arsenic and coffee.
"Without you, there is no me."
"My soul is a rose garden, dappled with thorns."
I had to bury mine - this place is no place for beautiful hearts.
Everything is sailing right through.
There is a gash through my heart.
I want to ruin everything.
I hate it.
Absolutely no remorse.
Ofdarkblooms has taken control.
Lethe is no more.
"Good one, Ivy."
"Exhale the wanting-to-murder-someone, inhale the harmonious-peace-of-real-people-and-kindness."
"You deserve nothing. At. All. You are an awful person. A flea. Go away and stop playing mean girl, high school games. You are showing zero grace. It’s embarrassing."
I hope your husband isn’t psychologically scarred.
"I sincerely hope your jealous, jilted grudge decays you forever."
Stay out of my lane.
Boundaries being breached.
Bring the oblivion.
"My mind is restless, like a poet whose words are stranded."
Horror wraps my soul in dead repose.
Too much but still nothing at all.
"Ripping petals, crushing buds underfoot."
Solemn gloom.
"A steadfast gaze, conveying worlds of classic love stories."
Indistinct murmurings of your ghost to mine.
Always leave them wanting more.
The acute ache of desire.
Vivid soul aches.
A profundity of beautifully sad ghosts.
"A fervid want, need, desire for all of him."
It’s comforting to know we’re not the only one fighting demons.
Your scars are a map that always lead me back to you.
Holding pattern.
Massage my distractions.
The wind is desperately trying to rip the sky apart.
A philosophy of romanticized darkness.
"Rose tinted reveries,  radiant and rapturous."
She’s busy being the pretend girl.
"This bullshit, 3 ring sideshow of freaks"
Breathe.
In flux.
Kiss the snake goodnight
Intrinsically and fundamentally you draw me in.
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
....take my hand
"Dull blades, for your dull soul."
"She is abject misery, a toxin."
A playground for nature to absorb.
"A ruined fortress, abandoned and discarded."
Bound to this flesh
"A thousand dreams, lost to consciousness forever."
You are deeply etched into my soul.
A litany of lust.
Shake my tomb
A maelstrom of beautiful disorders.
What a cute massacre you’d make.
Languidly daydreaming about murder.
"Lost dreams, find their way home through the slumber."
"Collecting tragedies, one blossom at a time."
Bloom so hard that buds fall from your bones.
The forgotten silhouettes of broken stems.
Your words make me bloom deeper.
The hypocrisy is incredulous. I. Just. Cannot.
The cockroach won’t go away.
Pesky jilted ghosties.
A penchant for haunting your mind.
"Fill my soul with the simple, little things that mean a lot."
"The beauty of being present with someone, no words, but entire conversations through touch."
Entwined fingers and minds.
I think locusts live in my eye sockets between my eyeballs and brain now buuuuzzzzzz
You are the thread to my Y incision.
You are the scalpel to my skin.
Dissect my soul.
A post-mortem for my mood.
Appeasing my demons with a sacrifice of your soul.
Practicing witchcraft on your heart.
A silver chalice of blood.
I’ll witch thee.
In league with moths.
In league with the devil.
A coven of mood disorders.
"Bind her and throw her in the water, see if she floats."
Distilled dreams duplicating your demons.
Lonely apparitions of long lost lovers.
Plotting to murder my vile body.
Massacred emotions.
"'I exist in two places, here and where you are'."
"‘Treading water, dancing the dark turmoil. Looking for something to give’."
Let’s curl up in bed and read Lovecraft.
"Tip toeing over chaos, minding the pretty hearts."
Skipping over the discarded wreckage of your words.
Hiding amidst the ruins of discarded souls.
🖤
🖤
Tracing every vein and every tattoo.  With my tongue.
"The twilit corpses of an army, beautifully decaying back to the dust."
Ancient debris of splintered souls.
Bleed and blossom.
Breathe and bloom.
My temporal lobe is tired.
My grey matter is fuzzy.
Dream architects designing perfect illusions.
Dismally roaming ancient ruins forever.
"Cobwebbed ghosts, eternally forgotten."
Greek goddess envy.
The ruination of soft souls.
The dark shadows you hide in hide the dark shadows in you.
Dreaming silent dreams in pallid hues.
Ritualistically reading your silence.
"A sensual rite, seductive and dark."
My dark view of life is palpable.
Disturbed is an understatement.
A visionary of nothing.
Having a love affair with a ghost.
A million tiny prisms fill up my heart.
The pale weariness dances with my mind fog.
An ocean of bile surges through my heart.
The wrath of moths.
The heart knows your ugly soul.
An esoteric dance with my demons.
I’d rather tend to your pain than my own.
"For a moment, the world sighed with me. And everyone wore black.                                     ~ Helaena Moon"
Refract my melancholy.
"He is a cluster of data, yet to reveal his patterns."
She is an unproven theorem.
Thorny psyche.
Nostalgia  stings and pricks  and tugs at the heartstrings but also  warms and strengthens and mends a frail soul everlastingly
Soothe me in the sanctuary of you.
Transferred emotions.
Archetypal anxiety.
"Profile me harder, baby."
Would you loan me your psyche.
May I borrow your imagination.
Gods and monsters walk among us.
Ethereally lucid.
Serenity from destruction.
You are my divinity.
Embrace the abyss.
Broken prose shelters me.
The beautiful exhilaration of lunacy.
Broken souls scattered amongst the ruin.
You pilfered my heart.
The dulcet tones of your sighs.
Conformity or compliance?
Inhale the chaos.
Fierce lust cocooned in silk.
The ebb and flow of nothingness.
Final girl.
False hopes and butterfly dreams.
"Here, but not. Flesh, but untouchable. Awake, but dreaming.  (Art by Kim Jakobsson)"
Between your inhale and exhale is where I exist.
A crushing beauty.
Your soul shimmers beneath your darkness
A breathtaking wickedness.
Eternally unable to resist the gravitation pull of your soul.
"You’re on my mind, baby."
Sacrificial butterflies.
You’re my favourite b-grade horror story.
My blood courses upstream against the moths.
The pretend girl is noisy.
He wore the perfume of death.
Sad little girl.
Name calling is the lowest form of wit.
Go hug your husband for a change.
I do much prefer your alt to your real one. It’s cute.
Screenshots are a wonderful novelty. And handy.
Raven souled.
Aethsetic ambition:
Cloaked in Freudian melancholy.
"Fluttery, buttery petals on the wind."
Flowers bloom from my soul scabs.
Butterfly arteries.
Allay me.
So that guilt is crippling as well.
My psyche is doing this horrendous thing of resenting anyone who isn't feeling as awful as us.
Mind adjustment and alignment guild.
Reading me is just the start of the journey.
"Turn your head, baby, just spit me out."
Such sky moods this morning ☁️🌩🌦
Caress my words.
Use your teeth.
Nothing good blooms here.
A wishing well of wasted words.
I do enjoy reading you and reminiscing about feelings I no longer feel.
Emotionally anemic.
Demurely dimming. Waning and dissolving into the ether.
Just fading delicately into the night.
Sometimes you just don’t get the luxury of closure and have to move forward.
A single amaranthine flower on my grave.
"That soul shiver, when someone walks over your grave."
Floating and drifting and shimmering.
We were always a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled.
"Arcane stories, scribbled in the sky."
Pinch out the candle.
The moths are flittering and fluttering inside my heart.
The bees are buzz buzz buzzing over my brain.
Strange bedfellows.
"In the chaos, you are a minute of beautiful silence."
I thought only emo teenagers quoted serial killers to sound cool.
Be my landslide.
Your necrotic soul.
Forgotten feelings Expelled and trapped in a wasteland For my peace of mind
Don’t allow loneliness to lower your standards.
Let’s invent a new language.
Space junk hearts.
Too exposed.
"Bath, salts, bubbles, rain on the roof, thoughts of you in my soul."
Your sad truth will be your finale.
The sublime and simplistic elegance of hands. Reflecting expressions and moods and affect without words.  Photographer: Natalie Ina 🖤🖤
Old souls are unlike any others.
Your seething hatred is cute.
"The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you."
My cocoon is warm but I am without chai.
Cerebrally satisfied.
Mentally satiated.
Pretty bite marks to show the world you’re mine.
I’ll sew your lips together then kiss your pain away.
A tattoo of intricate lacework.
Whose demon is this?
Thinking of you 🖤
Snap at the abyss. You can bake cakes later.
Continue barking into the void.
Blood boiling and still my body is icy.
A masterpiece of maladies.
Choke on your jealousy.
A heart full of bile.
"A knife to each hand, severing ligaments, damaging nerves."
Endless vitriol. Pointless.  Go on a picnic or something.
"Your words are a sermon, searing souls and lightening hearts."
Go play happy families some more.  I’m not sure the family feels it yet.
A deep fondness for self sabotage and cake.
"Incite me cerebrally, but then go for my jugular."
Softly spilling sadness.
The rise and fall of your chest.
Dress me up in your soothing words.
Let them rant and rail.
"Unnerve, disturb and delete."
Shards of glass to my mind.
"Honestly, some people have the integrity of a wet tissue."
So much bluster.
Ancient love and loss.
And who is your guise hiding?
I’ve always haunted myself.  Right from the very beginning.
More soul than substance.
Listen to the medicated ghost girl.
Your malignant storytelling is fooling no one.
Your lethal sighs.
I'm more of a whisperer into the void.
The hollow of your collarbone is my favorite playground.
I shatter quietly. Unobtrusively.
Entwine our darkness.
In the mood for vintage candlebras strung with glass pendants.
Simple static. A soothing soliloquy.
The buzzy bees remain but the noise does not.
🖤 Oh sweet oblivion 🎵
The weather goddess is enjoying her rain play today.
Shards of crystal behind my eyes.
"The wrack and ruin Collapsed emotion Resurrect, reprise"
A fortress for feelings.
A citadel for my soul.
I’ve stared into the looking glass too deeply.
Pulling at the loose threads.
The beguiling sparks of your synapses firing.
Dust and bones and wildflowers.
Despairingly beautiful.
Pretty angst.
The agitated amygdala.
Adrenaline hangover.
The wind is tearing the sky apart.
Only the ghosts know my brokenness.
Emotionally gutted. Recompose.  Repeat.
Your words heal my wounds.
Depressive blood runs through me.
If I was an aesthetic...  (Photography: Jurgen Heckel)
Devour my limbic system.
The shape of sadness.
Next lesson; actually giving credit to the person whose words you are borrowing.
At least I taught you to use quotation marks.
Corrosive emotional pain.
Throttle my heart.
Incite my melancholy.
A fraudulent memory.
Anaesthetize my soul from the chaos.
Numb my heart to the mind intrusions.
I think they’ll tear open again.
Attempting to repair myself with pretty stitches.
Too much introspection will crack the facade.
My mind overfloweth.
I want to move into a daydream and live there forever.
I have never wanted to flee as much as I do now.
I think my soul is half way dead.
I want to but I can’t.
I’m going to die alone and I don’t know how to fix it
Disconnected soul The memory lingers and Torments forever
With shovel in hand I’ll dig a pit to bury The worst bits of me
The understanding that you’ve become a footnote.
I’m so exhausted by the monotony.
I don’t want to life today.
I’d fade as your memories of me will.
Wallflower ghost.
Your words throw the planets out of line.
That sharp nip of nostalgia.
A lonely soul of the abyss.
A heart ravaged by apocalypse.
I’m anxious about shadows hiding holes today.
I don’t want to leave my cocoon.
"Honestly, just let me sleep forever."
The sting of consciousness.
Cerebrally surrender to me.
A rich prose and I’m yours.
The anomaly is me.
I am the thorns.
"Strike a match, burn out the day."
A peaceful graveyard to wander.
Surrendered spirit.
Vacant ghost.
Unable to ever fully escape myself.
Melodic moaning.
A series of significant coincidences.
"Fleeting, passing thoughts swelling appreciation  treasured memories"
I’d just like to nap in an abandoned library.
Diminished capacity. But of the heart.
Delicately disordered.
Arteries ablaze.
Smoldering heart.
I need more asleep hours.
"The hours pass, the mood flip flops."
My soul is peacefully disordered in the abyss with yours.
A glance that writes epic love stories.
A look that speaks a million emotions.
That lingering gaze.
The alluring torment of you.
The mirror has 23 faces.
Contrite saints walk among us.
Gaslighting ghostie.
Inferior ghostie.
Psychological games are so passe.  You wore them out.
The ghosties are eating tweets and silently marking me as their goddess.
I find something so romantic about memories and emotions being triggered by smell.
"Condolences insecure goddess, decay as a saint, queen of nothingness."
The silent inhale of you.
"In the vast darkness  two lit candles, side by side  flames melding as one"
I’ll sage your bones.
Insert ritual cleansing bath here.
Practice what you preach.
"Blackened creatures, beautifully blemished, capture my heart."
Ghostly echos and accents everywhere.
Send me all your vampires.
"Throaty voice, velvet words."
Bleed me and tell me you adore me.
Adorable vampires.
I want to lick your disorders.
Ominous corners hiding bruised souls.
Shrouded in achromatic dust.
The alchemy of us.
Whispering to your bones.
It’s hard holding myself up right now.
I need to nail my heart down.
Burrow into my skull a little deeper.
Cure us.
Relinquishing love notes to the sea.
"Fractured wings, beautifully broken."
Icy ghosts tracing the hallways of my heart.
"Ict, rainy and wintery calls for reading period ghost stories all day."
"Pale, faint love letters from ghosts."
Carve it out and replace it with butterflies.
Archived emotions.
"Maestro del Papagayo / 'The Death of Lucretia', 1501"
Stack the bodies as high as firewood.
Sensual soliloquies.
I am utterly mind wrenched.
Petals pooling as blood.
My night dreams have all become day dreams.
Moonlit madness.
Unlaced from life.
Storms always tell their secrets.
Listen to the weather.
Pay attention to the sky.
The fine art of blending into shadows.
"A crown of dark, thorny blooms."
Darkly blooming.
You don’t get what you want until I’m ready.
Completely forgettable.
The delusion is just embarrassing now.
My lips will pen an elegy on your skin.
I’ve memorized you in many languages.
My fever dreams are only ignited by him.
I want a museum date.
Channeling lightning.
From the bottom of my melancholy.
The permeance of you.
Monia Merlo is this amazing photographer 🖤🖤🖤
Mood:
I can smell your sadness.
"Blended breath, mingled sighs."
Dissolve into the storm.
Mood weather.
A brewing storm.
Drown me in dopamine.
I wish I had a better version.  (Photography: Kira Sheker)
I cannot even feign positivism anymore.
Love is myth. Myths are love.
I only want to play with butterflies.
I wish I was a beautiful blurry photograph today. Unseen yet enjoyed.   (Photography by Veronica at Night)
No one will miss you. Off you pop.
Break my spell.
A sharp wit and soft words.
Addicted to daydreaming up unrealistic ideals.
I don’t know how to not write to you anymore.
Befriended by the sky.
The moths will always be my companions.
Have you considered a secure psychiatric facility?
Your imprints are everywhere.
"Sometimes I’m a sonnet, sometimes a eulogy."
Write me a beautiful sequel.
Cremating your words.
Fused psyches.
Imperceptible and obscure.  Safe space.
"Hazy and ethereal, unable to be completely seen."
"I am smudged features, blurry outlines, muted and dark hues."
Altruistic souls are the prettiest souls.
How much worshipping is enough.
"Hidden deep in a forest, a crystal jar housing my heart."
A birdhouse of tiny bones.
Such deep-seated damage.
Forging our souls.
Any rosy notions I ever held are long gone.
"Huddling beneath your words, embraced in your intentions."
I exist between your sighs.
👅🧠
Let’s go here forever.  Photographer: Nicholas Lenatti
Benevolent butterflies bestowing blossoms.
Taste my mind.
Drawn to you. And abandoned European castles in the wintertime.
Like a butterfly in a jar with no air.
You are the catch in my breath.
I am the murmur in your heart.
I am the void in your mind.
I’m the ghost haunting your forgotten memories.
Numb me to the depths of my bones.
Defend your own honor. Dont rely on others.
People overwhelm me.
"I’m a negative, pessimistic, quiet girl and I know that drives many away."
I need a poetic ending.
Sad unwritten words.
Beautiful corpses decorated with a million wildflowers.
"I hate it, too."
You’re the occlusion in my psyche.
An adorned dagger for your ugly soul.
A heart of storms.
You’re the monster in all my cupboards.
Death by fire.
"Muted heart, dark soul."
"The muted aesthetic of a woman strewn in gauzy, white fabric whilst floating in blurry water with a rose upon her breast."
Mood: imagining your heart rate rising as we chat.
The beauty masks the lunacy.
He grounds me.
The prettiness blurs the madness.
Wrapping my mind in roses and butterflies.
I swallowed the green eyed monster.
I feel all the dark prose.
I admire all the pretty prose.
Write like no one is reading.
I won’t give anyone the satisfaction of being my antagonist.
"Different names, pictures. Same stupidity."
The skulking around irks me.
So many different same people. Witch!!
I don’t know how to be without it.
Darkness makes me whole.
Mingled with maladies and malaise.
Doomed to moths.
Drawn to storms.
Diverging darknesses.
"Wavering shadows, steady souls."
Mood: Befriending neighborhood cats.
Into the woods I will wander Away from you And unto me
Wounded regularly. My armor has become a part of me.
Heart debris.
Meaningless.
I could never do that good of a job.
Kill me harder. Go on.
Write like you’ll die tomorrow.
Prettily violent. Savage sensuality:
Alien lizard people. 👽 🦎 👥👥
Remnants of my soul remain.
A procession of closure.
I’m an empty coffin today.
"Read, evaluate, convert."
Aspiring to a dark academic aesthetic.
I prefer adoration to love.
Keep it up.
Rain pain.
Take me back to the nothingness of unconsciousness.
"Pressed against shelves, knocking books 📖 off."
I’m the sort of girl you can kiss passionately in an olde library.
God Almighty.  Kim Shattuck.  Would.
Your sanctuary.
You take me to and lead me through oblivion
Gentle impulsion
And everything depends upon how near you stand to me
"I want to go back in time to The Smiths, This Chalming Man."
On the Leeds side streets that you slip down
We’re chained.
If you go I will surely die
"‘Give me my, give me my wings’"
....and cancels out the day
"You, me and the dusky shadows."
Mood: candelabras and goblets of red wine.
My soul identified yours.
Send me all your vampires
Deeper than bones.
The soft dive of oblivion.
The elegance of language.
"The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you"
A million tiny daggers stabbing my mind.
The wreckage that was my heart.
"My haunted bones, cursed flesh."
You ebb and flow throughout my mind.
A sea courses through my arteries.
Constellations erupt with every beat of my heart.
We’re all maladapted around here.
A penchant for petulance.
The beauty. The mood. kersti__k
Flowers bloom where my blood drips.
Dead butterflies adorn my soul.
The abyss is in my heart.
The crevices in your psyche are my favorite shadows to hide in.
The post panic attack malaise.
Emotional hangover.
Abandon all hate.  Claim all adoration.
Unconventionally traditional.
I'd rather write my death vows than marriage vows.
Im unsure whether I feel unburdened or not.
Eyes meeting over lily white Roman busts or beautifully muted Renaissance paintings.
"I want a story like falling in love with a stranger, in a museum, drinking in all the beautiful classics."
Ancient marble ruins and their ghosts.
Cocoon with me for eternity.
Penning love letters to imaginary people.
Writing love letters with a poison pen.
Beleaguered by the ruins.
"The fear of losing something or not being allowed to have it, only fuels my desire."
"Im subdued by the romantique, tranquillised by a bleak mood."
I soothe myself with daydreams of pretty and dark aesthetics.
I lust after pretty words and covet those who manipulate them.
I fall in love with thoughts.
Human contact is a mere blur.
What a cesspool of bitterness and brokenness I entail.
A metronome where my heart should be.
My heart died years ago. I think I have a chamber full decaying flowers there now.
I wish I was a moth.
"The self pity is looming over me today - why me, its not fair. I can usually conceal it well. Its erupting, full to the brim."
"I resent people. And then I feel guilty and awful.  Resentment and bitterness. They haven't had to walk my path, they have lives, they have people, they can manage themselves, they are 'happy'. What I would give to be 'content'."
"My craggy cave, dark and dusty, ghosts of people I once had."
"But Im also angry with those around me. Why don't they ask me how I am!? Haha Probably because Ive pushed them all away. They complain about insignificant things, they don't see the bigger picture. They don't get it. But, I don't explain it to them, so how could they know."
"I am always displeased with myself. I can do nothing right - eat right, look after myself right, be a decent friend, not do the bad things for me. I just cannot be right."
"I am consumed by an anger, a fury. A resentment."
The maddening hopelessness of it all. I have stagnated with a broken body and mind for so long. Pain and torment are my constant companions. I do not know what is good and right and healthy anymore. I cannot fix it. I need paths to follow and guides.
"I am alone because I have withdrawn here, pushed them all away. And now I feel like I have no right to ask them to return.  I feel deserted, abandoned, but again, it was in response to my pushing.  Then comes the unloveds and the uncherisheds."
The loneliness. I used to think I liked being alone.
Hopelessness haunts me. I cannot see ways out.
I seem to remember a thief. My happiness pressed against his chest. Gone. Departed with his footsteps. ::: Helaena Moon :::
It’s all ugly here
Nothing is right. It hasn’t been for years. And I can’t see it changing.
The ‘it’ll pass’ platitudes.
I’m so tired of waiting.
The dirty little secrets. The pain.
You see the words but you have no idea what is going on behind the screen.
I used to be perfect at holding it together. I can’t even a bit right now.
"I want to get out, but I can’t.  Literally and figuratively."
I’m piteously caught between a rock and a hard place.
I don’t know what to do with my tears.
I feel like destroying.
Not even my own.
I’m no one’s priority.
I wish I was less available.
A symphony of my sins.
Conductor of my own destruction.
The sleeping lll happily  do zC
Bury me in peonies and pansies.
"A beautiful moth, blending in with tree trunks, accepted by her own, not noticed by anyone else."
I’m not sure I have much faith left to keep.
Put an axe in it.
Jittery heart. Flapping and lurching.
Although I feel removed from everywhere.
I’m always near.
Sky ghosts.
"I’d like to run far, far away."
I’m trying to enjoy pretty things to stave of feeling like I’d rather be dead 🖤
Fluent in the language of loneliness.
Haunting your thoughts.
The fine art of mind preservation.
Eternally ruined.
"Some take up a lot of room, for significant time."
A fleeting inch here and then.
I don’t devote space in my mind to many.
A storm breaks every time you sigh my name.
"‘I like to be alone but don’t get me wrong, you have always been a part of my solitude’."
There is a certain...deliciousness in the macabre.
Your spiteful demons will devour you.
The beguiling beauty of broken.
"I wish I could wander ruined cathedrals, during winter, for the rest of my life.  Whitby Abbey Explore_photos_ann"
Some lightning you’re happy to be struck by.
Truce.
A constant war raging inside.
The weather knows just how to mimic my moods.
Both wanting to and not wanting to.
Keep your wars close.
I’m living in the entirely wrong era.
Seeing someone requires more than just sight.
I can read your soul like a book.
Tread carefully with who you pretend to be.
Petals falling as tears.
"Vacuously, you are your own victim."
The thunder is rolling and rumbling and stating it’s presence 🖤
Bewitched by the butterflies.
Our voids collided.
Creating a constellation of chrysanthemums.
Ascension protection.
Pressing flowers and butterflies between the yellowed pages of classics.
"Ancient tomes, covered in dust, protect my moths."
Da da da love yer hair
Noxious and nefarious.
And I laughed
Le Désespoir
Lined with bones of my past.
A crypt within my heart.
A crypt for my heart.
"An ancient cemetery to adore. The old souls, the beauty of mortality."
"Bruised petals, broken stems, dulled thorns."
"Orchestras of butterflies,  the crescendo of their tiny wings."
The symphony was played to death.
Surrender to me. Harder.
Your hollow hallowed words.
The key to my shackles may be you.
Just an abandoned girl and her words.
A baroque cathedral to cage my moths and protect mind.
And dreams. I like dreams too.
"I adore the mechanisms of memories. Who, where, why."
Skip intro.
Chrysanthemums for protection.
...and out into the aether forevermore.
Composed of poison.
The myriad of ways I die a little each day.
It’s my duty to remain vile.
I want a coven to belong to.
Intertwining bones. Interlaced veins.
Don’t make me drop a house on you.
The soul mingles with the mayhem.
You sound like an annoying duck Quack quack quack
"Wandering in the mist, searching for your plot."
Dream your death.
A library of butterflies.
Oh to have a fruitful and rich life!
A beautifully colorless mind-snap.
How many devastations did it take to break your soul.
Ghost girl.
My emptiness is not so empty with you.
"You are worth your imperfections, your insecurities, yours fears, your everything."
Provoke me harder. Deeper. Smarter.
"Oh my, how quiet the crickets have become."
Let’s get lost.
I like the thought of some people more than I actually like them.
"I have learned that if you keep hurting the superficial people around you thinking one day it will knock some sense back into them, you are creating for yourself, a room with no doors. Channing H. M"
The darkness is fluent in me. The absence of it derails my rhythm. Channing H. M
Fraudulent plagiarist.
and there’s nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
"What is beneath your somber veil, your guise?"
I fly away with broken wings and a ruined heart Channing H. M
Fluently sanctimonious.
A flurry of fanciful phrases.
Leaving bruises and teeth imprints to mark my territory.
"Your milky white skin, I will devour."
Swallow my venom.  Ingest it all.
A Trojan horse full of dead roses.
I like being here with the moths and the dust and our ghosts.
The noise will eventually be silenced but words will always make noise.
If only my words could write you into nonexistence.
The art of tenderness when all you want to do is destroy.
A waterfall of butterflies cascading over us.
She may be splintered and shattered but you can see how beautiful her darkness is.
My soul chose your soul.
The tragic forest that is my heart.
It only ever ends in self corruption though.
I possess a very corruptible quality.
You can’t contend with that level of self-adulation.
Lock away the too-heavy memories.
Indecency as an art form.
Your unmarked grave is waiting.
Where do you conceal your heart deficiencies.
How many mood maladaptations hide in your soul.
Discordant harmony.
Brutally comforting.  Beautifully brutal.
"To breathe, to feel, to know I’m alive."
I’ll let your scabs heal now.
Finding the beauty in dissonance
Droll.  Carry on.
Wake up
Save your prayers. Choke on them.
Insidious and malevolent beauty.
Passing peacefully from beds to graves.
Another of your victims has come out the woodwork. We’re stacking up quite a few.
🖤🔥
It's a Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of Freaks
From the lighthouse out on the ocean
Disassociation desperation.
Idol worship.  Worshipping idly.
Paranoid android. I see.
Panic is primal.
Connecting the dots.  Understanding the guises.
Idle minds are the Devil’s cathedral.
Idle hands are the Devil’s play thing.
Control freak ghost girl
My savage need for control.
Ive learned the patterns. They help dispel expectation hurt.
A masterpiece of undreamed dreams.
And will tomorrow too. I need a twittervention  and support people to entertainnnn meeeee
Our precarious time failed us.
Missed him. Like ships passing in the night.
Blow out the candle on today.
Inexpressively vacant.
A dead stare of frozen beauty.
A perfect asylum.
Affect me on a molecular level. Harder.
A flurry of feelings.
❤️
Wanting what I can’t have.  And probably wouldn’t accept it if I could.
Engulfed by my petulant child tonight.
Time interferes with my wants.
Separated by fate.
Satiated by thoughts.
"Strung together like pretty pearls on a necklace, my daydreams are always of you."
And swallow the specters that seduce you.
I will devour you demons.
A silver lined chapel to seduce my demons.
A shrine of butterflies to appease the deity.
A gilded cage for my escapee mind.
I will romanticize the hell out of my darkness.
The souls and their hallowed histories.
The mood of an ancient and sacred graveyard.
Step inside my confessional cage.
"My choir of moths, making beautiful music, beating torn wings."
My temple of skulls.
Polishing your bones to build my cathedral.
Sheltering in our sanctuary of each other.
"Stroke my soul, replenish my heart, ensnare my mind."
How many haunted nights does your heart hold?
"I’ll hold them gently like a butterfly, so as not to damage or crush."
"Tell me the stories of your soul. The deepest, dustiest ones."
"The hint, the promise of you."
I’ve picked your scabs enough.
Hello how low?
Your alts are honestly more intelligent than you are.
A butterfly blade to bisect my soul.
A little escapism is good for the mind. A little reality is not.
Shriek your silence to me.
The heart absconded long ago.
Perfectly spilling moonlight.
"Memories are bullets.  Some miss, some pass through without damage, others kill."
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Wounded souls and minds and hearts.
Abhorrent behaviour really.
7000 watchers and 15 communicators.
Desperate little girls will say desperate little words to get any attention at all.
Imagine writing every word for somebody else and nothing for just you.
You’re no Magnus Opus.
"Some days, though, I’m compromised more of death than life."
"He sleeps, so now I can sleep."
Murmuring is my preferred means of communication.
Know when to tread gingerly or stride purposefully.
Satiated by you. Mind. Body. Soul.
Made up of a million tiny wishes and prayers.
Soul protection mechanism.
I don't become fond of many.
The day can end. I’ve had my fill.
Infuriated wasps buzzing through my skull.
Hicherry 🖤 @DeviantArt
I don’t care if it’s a placebo effect; I’ll swallow it.
Bathe in the River of Woe.
"Shards of hope are rare, but I’ve managed to capture one."
Imagine thinking you’re an influencer of words and ideas.
"Rein in you petulance, little girl."
Solve me. Put all my pieces right.
"A lovely haunting. Taking breaths, engulfing hearts."
To cure the feelings that ail.
An antidote for emotions.
All I wish for is people on high horses to tumble.
"Since you arrived, this is the better place."
The dead can hold a grudge better than some taureans.
Some days all you can do is not succumb.
My mind crashes over and over and over again.
Your ugly soul is showing.
I’m in a temper today and having temperamental thoughts.
"I am lone waves, undulating, rolling,  crashing, searching for my tsunami."
The noise is like a million wasps screaming in my skull.
"I’m the petals laying scattered and rotting, peeled one by one, from a pretty flower."
"Loyal moons, spinning around their master."
A ship without a lighthouse.
Silence rips the power asunder.
Words wield power.
A moth. In a jar. On the shelf.
Are you the reason or the remedy?
Are you the cause or the cure?
The language of silence.
Shattered lightning.
The seduction of harmonious discord.
You.
Agonizingly pretty.
The adoring anguish creeping up your spine.
Your psychopathology is showing.
'It itches in your bones'
Hallowed hearts and sacred souls.
A safe haven for my mind.
Your false deity feeds your delusions.
Aberrant delight.
CGI girl.
Bloodletting for the heart.
Carve a space inside your brain
A garden of scorned souls.
"You don’t, you don’t, you don’t"
Stars and comets and moons disintegrate beautifully when you speak.
Your pretty words create galaxies and black holes.
This is getting old and so are you
Replenish my words so we can write the universe together.
The foliage of my heart hides the hurt.
Flowers bloom across my soul in the shape of you.
Abandon all hate.  Claim all adoration.
A dainty duck you are not.
"Casting arrows, missing every target."
"Invoke my darkness, embrace it, caress it."
You are the common denominator.
Butterflies fluttering at the windows.
The wounded soul wounding all the other souls.
Escape the insidious torment.
"Building a shelter from flowers, a cage from bones."
"I’m a blurred outline, muted and masked."
🖤Stephen Mackey 🖤
Veins will spill.
Your blood will turn black and malignant.
The venom will clog up your arteries.
A slow burning soul.
"Loosen your fangs, little girl."
I need to play with some frilly words and pretty ideas.
Imagine thinking you have an ownership over words or ideas.
Sleep with one eye open.
"These animals walk among us. They are like a cancer, infiltrating everything here."
"Causing pain, daily, and leading to self harm (at the very least). Premeditated and across various platforms and accounts."
I cannot fathom what would lead someone to target and harass people (yes multiple!) so abhorrently and for a sustained time.
Stephen Mackey 🖤
Tumultuous and free.
A wretched storm as a muse.
More beautiful aesthetics 🖤🖤 Stephen Mackey
"Pull the trigger, Love."
They know not what they are/do.
Don’t blame the villains.
Expunged from reality.
Desolately needful.
Witness the parallels.
Exquisitely absent.
Tragically needful.
It’s been a compelling procession today.
I prefer my flowers piteous.
Piteous posies.
Tentatively and considerately.  Not rushing forth.
I adore how you read me.
A formidable heart.
Recurring circles.
Your patterns are showing.
That eternal gaze.
Imagine peace of soul.
You force my darkness to behave.
Chronicles of a girl ghost.
I pulled off your wings
I found some beauty. Marco Mazzoni.
Daydream me to reality.
I’m filling my soul with roses to wither perfectly and die.
Choke on your hypocritical words.
Swallow your own pity.
Know your genuine worth.
..and then you crawl your knees off
The fire has burnt to pity.
"See through, see you"
Sending me to sleep with their lullaby.
The purifying rain chasing the cleansing breeze.
The ghosts are my perpetual company.
I will destroy myself one day.
The soul of my tragedy.
You’re so stupid for a smart person.
Continuously shattering.
I need more.
No one knows.
My void is massive.
Carve out the emotion with a blunt knife.
I dont want to fall in.
There might be a hole up ahead.
The deepest and most malignant cancer.
Ill swallow your lies.
Angst wrapped in hopelessness.
Im made up of a million existential crises.
Existence is a spectrum.  Im near zero.
Replaceable demons.
Detachable psyche.
A darkly hypocritically narrative.
Coded heartbeats.
Someone just walked over my grave.
Dusty memories kept securely under lock and key.
Blood merging with blood.
Dark hearts melancholically mingling.
You’ve lost yourself to the wind.
Every breath you exhale gives me life.
Forgotten echoes.
Unremembered memories.
We are not alone.
Goodbye notes penned in blood.
Love notes written in dead languages.
A burial wreath of thorns.
Heal your soul before it festers and dies.
Your withered heart upon your sleeve.
The poetry that comes from the squaring off
Absorb your beautiful words.
Choke on your poetry.
A fondness for abnormal psychotics.
Learn to swim
Swallow your sorrow.
Piteous prose but pretty posies.
A tragic comedy.
Nonexistent threat level.
Disposable emotions.
Throw away the rotten thoughts.
Disposable words.
Discard yourself.
Pathetically poignant.
Loneliness cloaked in the loveliest lace.
Bargaining with the breeze.
Shrieking to the hurricane.
I’ve only the wind to talk to.
Beautiful omens.
Fleeting feelings.
Necromance me back to life.
I’m the wraith of your dreams.
Haunting your everything.
"Wispy tendrils, translucent."
Generated from dust.
Ghost girl.
Emotional inertia.
This inbetween place  I wait and wander aimlessly For a piece of you
Heartbeat against heartbeat.
The rain cleanses our souls.
Lightning zaps my nerve-endings.
Thunder bellows your name.
You’re my most perfect storm.
Centering myself in the silence.
"Watching, waiting."
A background existence.
Elevator moods.
Designate your love as fate.
A gentle trait.
Swept along in the current of uncertainty.
The delusion runs deep.
Compliance or conformity.
A preoccupation of you.
I’m done with the day now.
"Some I cram down, but others I just let be. They affect no one but me."
"I know my damaging personality traits, but Im just not willing to stifle them."
Im territorial but Im trying to not be so.
The dull hum of forever.
Murmuring and softly chuckling.
Your voice is my lullaby.
Your aura is comprised of mildewing roses.
Simply inconsequential.
Tiny claws make tiny cuts.
Feeling such deep hate is poisonous.
Allies are hard to find in this day and age. Hang on to them.
"Rapid breath, thudding heart."
Existing between your breaths.
Your inner self decays your outer beauty.
"The problem is, if you trust people with ‘good faith’, so many will fail you."
Nature versus nurture.  Heart versus mind.
Lullabies to lament by.
My ghosts keep good company.
Thoroughly unappealing. Droll.
"Lashing out and hurting others, after you’ve been hurt, will only be excused for so long."
I’ll play with your ghosts.
Swallow my soul.
"Synapses snapping, nerves fraying."
Embrace the silence.
Silence is powerful.
Like a wound refusing to heal.
Scar tissue.  But for emotions.
"For you, not me."
Nothing sadder than becoming an afterthought.
I am merely a succession of resigned adaptations.
Drifting like a daisy.
Fading like a flower.
Baying at the stars.
Oblivion is attractive.
The seductive lure of the void.
The nothingness of everything.
There’s a method in your madness.
We’re all psychoanalysts around here.
I crave you on a molecular level.
Overflow my veins with tiny blossoms.
My cells like your cells.
The reek of death and decay.
The vultures are circling.
Pretty punctuation and plasma.
Haemorrhaging words.
Mend my psyche.
Meet me in my nightmares.
I know you’re there 🖤
Fragile obliteration.
Delicately shattering.
Like a storm that has blown itself out.
My vitriol has exhausted me.
Destined for everything and nothing.
Decaying blooms run through my veins.
Invalidate me deeper.
Nullify my void.
Breathtakingly null.
The theory of you.
Intervene my mind.
Receive my neurotransmissions.
Dopamine reveries.
It’s not at all like it should be.
I want to nonexist in time and space.
I want to be moth wing dust.
There is no point.
"Trust the process, stay the course, but why. I don’t care for a future."
What is the point.
The immutable sigh of loneliness
You feel like lightning.
The swan's escaped again!
She craved him.  He craved her. The end.
Desperately seeking adoration.
Always seeking catharsis.
Remember to dream tonight.
A succubus of your psyche.
A million tiny wings fluttering behind your eyes.
Thank Goddess for another pretty full moon.
A blizzard in my heart.
My head is ridiculous!
"Like, it’s all a great big joke. On me."
I still don’t believe you’re real some days.
I have always wanted green eyes.
So disappointing when people don't think outside their own personal little bubbles.
This goddamn pandemic!
Awful at having to assimilate a large amount of information quickly.
I wish I could capture moments and freeze them in time.
Forever.
I hate change.
Nostalgic. I miss.
Slipping away.
I can’t put you down.
Enter the gateway to my ego.
Step inside the portal to my id.
Disconnected feels.
"The mob, it cries for blood"
Obscured minds basking in the twilight of consciousness.
Pierced hearts lurking behind silhouettes.
Ancient shadows hiding broken souls.
Threw you the obvious
Did you hear the distant lie?
It’s like you never had wings
Don’t be tone deaf. Read your audience.
To find a reason
You’re my favorite story.
I want to sleep for three days.
4am has a certain sadness to it.
I am it all.
How much self-destruction are you.
I abhor hypocrisy the most.
Disappear again.
Practice what you preach.
Release me to the stars.
I’m the tributary to your river.
A modicum of peace.
A heavily saturated soul.
"Cloudy heads, thundering thoughts."
Stormy minds for stormy weather.
Reptilian oblivion.
Shroud me in your oblivion.
Where is the light at the end of the tunnel now?
Tsunami
I’m becoming a daydreamer. I have never really indulged before now.
Words fail me right now.
The moon is pretty tonight.
Reassurance is underrated.
Butterfly blood.
"Inhale rationality, peace."
We are all cautionary tales.
The sinking heart.
Be the tranquility.
Devour me whole.
Delight my soul.
Ravish my mind.
"Inhale the beauty, the loveliness."
"Great at giving advice, awful at following it."
We are temples. Holding ceremony for the demons of our mind.
Isolation frustration. Sedation.
Unreal reality.
Rooted in darkness.
Wounded of soul.
A ghostly revenant of my former self.
Your ghosts are devils in disguise.
People have aligned with figments of imagination.
No one is anyone around here.
Evoke my prettiest memories.
Invoke me gently.
Beguiling butterflies battering my brain.
Worship me deeper.
Worship at my ruined altar.
A chapel for my soul.
A mausoleum for my mind.
The litany of broken spirits is beautiful.
Insidious and damnable.
The unclean spirits of the dark side of my mind.
Envelop me forevermore.
A ramshackle horror house for my heart to dwell.
Dust and ashes line my soul.
I won’t betray your ghosts.
"I’m smitten by seductive words. Verbal, written, sighed or moaned."
The harmony and discord of being.
"Bind your soul to mine, your mind to mine, your being to mine."
"Your growl, my neck."
Your sighs beautifully break me.
The embers and ash of a burning enchanted forest.
Cursed ghosts singing macabre nursery rhymes are my favourite.
When do you become stronger from all the hurt you’ve endured?
I rise and fall with your mood; I feel them all.
"Dusty heart, lined with moths."
Your ghosts are my ghosts. Interlaced. Intwined.
How many disasters are you.
I’ll swallow your darkness.
The futility of frustration.
It is a struggle to find my consciousness today.
"The waking oblivia; drifting, dreaming, coming to."
"Consume, envelop, engulf me."
I like you just the way you are.
A courtesan for your demons.
The seduction of the beautifully morbid.
I absolutely love how macabre some old nursery rhymes are.
A ballad to rouse the sleepy ghosts.
“The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.” - Virginia Wolf
I will forever miss the days of having a virgin conscience.
Haunting the dusty chambers of your heart.
Live 🖤
I’m feeling beautiful visuals today.
"Those moments between waking up and getting up.  Peaceful, calm, attuning."
Your story is in your palm.
I am made up of defeat and memories.
Sheath me in scar tissue.
The scar tissue will protect.
After the break comes the repair.
Feed me useless lies.
"Pretty dead ghost. Pretty, dead ghost."
I was standing
My words are merely death knells.
"Pray to noose, to flame, to blade"
I need some fresh scars to decorate my soul.
🖤
Bleeding words.
Eternal storms.
You’ll only hear my words. What I want you to hear.  You’ll never know the truth behind them.
"Torn, black lace blinding me, and wrapped tightly around my throat."
I will bruise then forget you.
The emotional intelligence of a rat.
Pleading with the tragedy.
Praying to colliding stars
Meteor showers and tidal waves
I went to a whore
Mood
Cherry flavored antacids
This sludge in my veins is heavy.
"Consider me an illusion, a hazy cloud, drifting through your soul."
I see the patterns. I hear the empty words.
My words are a way of closing my eyes.
You are both the quiet and the storm to me.
I am the cage.
Anchored to people who are committed to ripping me apart.
I miss my dreams.
End the day.
Wanting desperately is just simply not enough.
Winding my way across your mind.
Pictures of you.
You are the muse to my murmurings.
A breathtaking afterlife.
It’s delightful not feeling horrendous!
I feel every inch and every second of your shattering.
Ballads to bewitch the demons.
A beguiling tempest to reset.
Heal thy soul with thunder and mind with lightning.
Evaporating into the atmosphere.
An almost perfect tranquility.
Enchantingly content.
My peace is crashing over in great deafening waves.
"A message in a bottle,  penned in blood."
Some days the words on my lips have a taste that uplift me.
The moon is my mute accomplice.
"Wandering the graveyard, searching for exquisite souls."
Attaching to moths.
Imprinting on mist.
Watch the weather change.
Wear your darkness like a crown.
"Life is free-er when you don’t look! The less you know, the better!"
I cannot deal with your toxicity.  I’m already drowning in my own.
"Capricious of mood, spirit and energy. But never of morality and heart."
"Please stop. No, don’t. Keep going.  Why did you stop. How dare you."
Reign. It. In.
Ahhh the mind can brew up some most ridiculous stuff.
"Shimmery, breathy and nihilistic."
Shattered dreams and pretty posies.
And he engulfed me wholly.  Spirit and body.
Melancholic whimsy.
Penetrate the realm of my existence.
"I went out driving with the windows down and it was spirit renewing, quite frankly."
Bound to this flesh
f o r  t o d a y
The End.
My p value is insignificant.
Type I error.
My schemas are skewed.
"“The fragility of flowers and their short lived beauty, and how they look beautiful even as they start to fade."" Trine Hisdal"
Stupefy me.
Obliviate me.
Sweet oblivion.
My true colors slowly come to light. And show my darkness.
Send me moths to beat them back with their wings.
Insidious creatures crawling around my mind.
My shadow friends.
Sometimes you need someone to tell you to shut up and then hold you hard and long.
Sonnets and soliloquies to cry to.
One of the first signs of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die ~ Franz Kafka
"If you ‘leave’, you don’t just go. You leave absence, a hole, an all encompassing veil of doom over some."
The loathing of the self is deep today.
I wish I could leave.
I’m a spiteful gaze.
I’m icy silence.
Visual stimulation.
I’m feeling more in lust with images than words right now.
Or a forest moth.
To be a rainforest butterfly.
Easy prey.
Heart full of thunderclouds.
Head full of decaying flowers and dust
"Comply, commit."
"Imagine if flowers fell, instead of rain."
It’s a love/dislike/feel guilt relationship.
The melancholy is hugging tight.
A beautiful rose corsage for my corpse.
Melting away sounds relaxing.
I’d make wine from your tears
Frenetic apathies.
Dead eyes smiling.
There are people and things that aren’t anywhere in the world except in my memory.
The conscience is a strange thing. Some don’t seem to work at all while others can break you.
Give me your heart. With your name carved into it.
The mysterious stir of lost ghosts.
After I crawl across your skull.
I will shake your tomb.
Your limp prose does not impress me.
Resist me harder.
Not that that is even possible.
Be everything for each other.
Occasionally I want my very own person who wants only me and I want only them.
I’ve done the math
The telltale silence.
The telltale words.
I hope my words plunge deep.
Shaming people into interaction is simply embarrassing.
You and your misinformation.
Every thorn has it’s rose.
Beating its beautiful wings in vain in the void.
An unearthly visitant.
"My aura is a dim, moody, Rembrandtish blur."
You’re the rhythm to my lyrics.
Exquisite dread.
A fatalistic existence.
Bullet with Butterfly Wings.
Illusions to soothe.
Skipping between galaxies.
Enchanted but doomed galaxies.
A thousand tiny daggers.
The loveliness in shattering.
The beauty of breaking.
Nothing will become of me as I will become nothing.
Wandering with all your banished gods.
Coded to self destruct.
Destabilizing and destructive.
"My aching ghost, longing for something unknown."
Haunted and doubtful.  Is this existence./?
Mood swings that peak and crash. Harder and farther.
Mutated fairytales.
A charming parasitic thing.
Floating aimlessly leaving ruined altars in my wake.
The niggling doubt never leaves.  Never.
"Break the stems, pick off the leaves and peel the petals one by one."
Bold capitals for your words that impale me.
The palest ink for your empty words. And soul.
You’ve left a clean smear across my murky soul.
The surface of night is scratched and dulled.
You.
"Petals leading me back to myself. My mind, my soul, my heart."
Leaving a trail of scattered petals wherever I wander.
A cascade of adoring emotions this week after being empty of everything last week.
What color is ‘beautiful’?  I see it as aqua.
I am a vague and befuddled ghost today.
To see but not be seen.
Consorting with the darkness.
Absolution and atonement.  I have sought and will seek. Forever.
The void can have us as long as we are together.
Spiral the abyss with me.
Stick my arm; drain my blood. Just a phial or two.
Decaying delightfully.
"A stupor would be fine, too."
Oblivia can take me now.
Why is life?
The shimmering shadows and deep recesses of my mind.
A sleepy awake.
Subtly catatonic.
Dark appetites.
Flowers and lace armor to protect my heart.
A flowery guise to hide a dark heart.
Flowers on my mask to disguise my dead insides.
"Abandon the negative, inhabit the neutral."
Revive me.  Spirit and soul.
A self destructive quirk.
My hardest lessons are generally the ones that will help me the most.
I’m slowly learning what is beneficial for my soul.
The tender darkness of night.  Softly stark.
A propensity to be truly heard.
Conspiratorial narratives.
The audacity of life!
"Lacking initiative, strength of character."
Feckless emotions.
"The noise is quieter, too."
The silence is louder than usual.
Absolved sleep is the best sleep.
Pray to the sleep gods.
Beg the devil’s pardon.
"Sleep, please let me dream tonight."
Withering and waning.
Life refracted.
Resurrected by rain.
Removing control.
Shattering intensity is my aim.
Your pulse will betray your emotions.
Toying with the thought of sleeping forever.
Weather can make or break your day. Mine is made.
"Thunder booming, rain cascading."
Tempestuous weather!
An habitual moroseness.
"Even flow.  Steady, serene, still."
Caressing my debris.
Softly imploding.
Mingling with the madness.
The whispering conscience.
Floating amongst the doom.
Living is draining.
I have a desire to do something dramatic.
Can I request a factory reset?
How does one reset a frazzled nervous system.
As clear as words for many people.
Patterns are a language all of their own.
Feel the truth in your pulse. His pulse.
The gauzy veil of sleep covering my mind.
Soliloquies to sleep to.
Mischief managed.
Words aren’t working right now.
"Locking eyes, holding the gaze. Swoon."
Shrieking into an empty storm.
My eyes will reveal nothing.  Until I’m ready. Until you’re ready.
"Heart to heart, mouth to mouth."
Emotionally diseased.
My ghost soul.
Spooky stories feed my soul.
A massacre of our minds.  But the good kind.
Masterful at cutting ties.
Fluent in bridge burning.
The aftermath will be beautiful.
Sedately falling to pieces.
Melancholy Roman numeral.
The stagnancy of being.
"Flurries of emotions, drifting and piling and being blusteted away."
Atone alone.
"Share my burdens, spiritually and physically."
Wandering eternally.  Point me to the path.
When you want to be adored by beauties but you’re really only stalked by creeps.
At prayer to the sky.
Listen hard. Many of the important things are silent or left unsaid.
A sunrise demise.
My phantom soul wants to play with yours.
Haunt me harder.
Very few get to hear the murmurings of my soul.
Reset time.
"Entomb me in your mind, your heart and your soul."
You’re a mere afterthought at this point.
The stimulant that is language.
The aphrodisiac of intellect.
A guardian for my soul.
A sentry for my heart.
Tattered and shredded and laid bare to the elements.
Gathering up the pieces of me that lay tormented and alone.
Implode with me.
The sum of our souls.
"Your spirit and mine, exploring our hereafter."
"Pretty poison, vicious venom."
"Don’t spit your venom, swallow it."
"Pretty ancient paths, lined with blossoms, lead me to you."
The night the moon was invented.
A pretty palace of bones.
"A shroud of glittering dust, swallowing us up."
Lace me with your heart and soul.
Intertwine your space with mine.
Take a sliver with you.
Carve your way through my soul.
But not yet.
The blackness pulls the strings.
Etch our names in a love heart on my tombstone.
I’m a reflection behind you in your mirror.
"Not just the feel of your skin, I want the smell of it."
Enter the basement of my mind.
Leave your last love note on my gravestone.
You flow as lava through my veins.
Infect me with you.
A falling star for your thoughts.
Bury me deep in the shadows and mark my grave with a single dead rose.
Anyway.
The absence of feelings evoke worry in me.
Absent emotions.
The tightening noose has slackened.
Take my hand
In your head.
Droll.  Next.
Spirit box static in my head.
A wordless whisper in my ear.
Eternities passing while we flirt.
I dont fuss or make noise. Just wait.
I’m always just waiting in the shadows.
Stark anhedonia.
"You are seared, carved, slashed across my pneauma."
A reckless caress.
Settle your grudges with voodoo dolls.
Careful not to trip on gnarled roots.
Ambling through time and space.
It is attacking multiple fronts.
My body despises me and is trying to kill me.
Abandon all hope.
I’m fluent in melancholy.
Impulsively patient.
Stalk my insecurities.
Haunted by daydreams.
Possessed by reveries.
Obsession confession.
Chisel me a mind from marble.
Carve me a heart from coal.
My blood isn’t fizzy and parts don’t feel like they’re going to explode. As much.
My skin isn’t buzzing and my brain isn’t humming. As much.
My sensations are less heightened today which is lovely.
Impassive and unresponsive.  Drive you wild.
Earn enough of the cruel gaze
Centre of her own attention
Damaged blood flowing through the veins to infect everything it passes by.
"This guise, this mask."
We say everything we need to with a big black heart.
The only way to win with some people is to not play.
We all go a little narcissistic sometimes.
"You’re nothing special, just another textbook narcissist forging their empire through likes and followers."
With breath that is bated.
"Interesting anxiety symptoms, I’m assuming."
My skin feels fizzy. Or tingly. Like a million little ladybirds are running around.
Buzzing and flittering and zinging.
Burrowing under my flesh.
Fluttering in my arteries.
Tiny wings beating throughout my veins.
Mend me with your kisses.
Patch up my soul with pretty words.
"Once bitten, twice shy."
My sympathetic nervous system is better than yours.
Concentrating the circles.
"Short sighted, conceited."
An unseeing gaze.
Detach from your inner turmoil.
"Instead of a reactive victim, be an objective scientist."
"Be aware, but not obvious."
"See me, but dont look."
Pause. Breathe.  Rationalise.
I recognize every move you make as I have made them too.
You take up time and space in everything significant
A grandiose sense of self-disinterest.
Bullshit  three ring  circus  sideshow  of freaks
Considerately killing me
"The shadows were suffocating,  yet she found breath to revive herself."
Rejection projection.
Depersonalize the drama.
"Trying to 'take in' rather than 'take on' people and comments and attacks, perceived or otherwise, these days."
How droll.
(Dis)ordered.
"Forevermore shadows, that I can’t seem to catch."
Shadows lurking at the edges of my oasis.
It ok. Attention will restore your life force.
"The more gothic, romantique and blood thirsty the better."
"Give me duels til the death, passionate and illicit flings, couples from warring houses preferring death together over being alive apart."
I loathe the construct of love in his modernity.
I will devour you. Every inch.
Don’t mistake my apathy for empathy.
Have faith in the axions.
Traitor neurons.
Stay the course. Trust the process.
I think I’m figuring it out.
Somehow. Some way.
There comes a point where you just have to cease the noise.  And be.
Willfully or not.
The mutable nature of memory.
Did you think the light would save you?
Observe. Notice. Validate.
Be evocative. And explicit.
A gaze that both paralyses and enables.
The chill begins to creep forward.
Our intertwining language.  Weaving and caressing.
Our words mingling.
Pneauma times infinity.
Dithering and dallying.
Procrastination prostration.
Open up your mouth
Maybe it’s just acceptance.  This peace.
Bizarrely serene.
😉🖤
I’ll see you
Some have a tendency to slide right past your awareness.
I hate your silence. I worry.
"This guise, this mask"
Can almost feel the sting.
Even having no pattern is a pattern.
"We’re creatures of habit, we thrive best with routine."
Watch someone long enough and you can guess at any future action.
Im grapplng to slip from beneath the veil of sleep this morning.
Like the chill void of ghosts floating towards slumber.
Yes. That collar bone right there.
Webs of toxicity.
Eradicate the bad. It works.
I am an olfactory creature.  Your scent is everything to me.
And there are parts of my totality that I would like to remove.
I think my totality is missing some pieces.
The worst storms bring out the truest colors.
Mass ❤️ings  🖤🖤
Sweetness I was only joking
Lingering absences.
Unforgettable absences.
I’m calming my storms.
Lockdown lunacy looms.
Imminently vacant.
A kiss of a perfect fit.  An embrace moulded flawlessly.
Fatalistic fiction.
A mighty vengeance upon my indifference.
Pristinely apathetic.
Forecasting an unknown future.
Illuminating the present.
Dancing in the shadows.
The spectres of my life.
In an abstractly concrete mood.
Shining darkly betwixt shadows.
Dull luminosities.
I m f I n e  F  I  N  E fine
We all have a little lunacy inside us.
It’s all precariously grotesque right now.
"Minute by minute, hour by hour."
Having someone never far from your thoughts is scary nice.
It’s a beautiful day for a lockdown.
Don’t look. Don’t look. Look.
Eye for an eye
"Misty, foggy, icy, ethereally pretty today."
Pretty pain
"All in all, I’m doing well as masking my negativity."
Lithe language is my love.
Empty but even.
Feeling empty.
I can’t wash you off my skin
The lucidity is overwhelming.
The solitary silence of a gloomy winter night.
Endeavoring to stop corrupting myself.
Penetrate my soul first.
"Your salient soul, and mine."
"Your growl, my ear. Your mouth, my neck."
I need to let your pretty words soothe me.
My being is in flux today.
Inane chatter is simply meaningless.
"Words are satisfying, but sometimes silence can be more so."
The words are fuzzy today.
The silence in my head is clamouring.
I am feeling majestically muddle-headed today.
"If you make my soul happy, you can stay."
Language stimulates.
Maddening minds mingling meaningfully.
Your words echo throughout me.
Watch me harder.
I see you seeing me.
"I have given my trust.  And in those hands, I am not concerned for it at all."
I like the way you say simple stuff.
You are enough.  More than.
Embrace my oblivion.
The beautiful language of sighs and gasps and moans.
You're not obliged to make sense to everyone.
I am my own worst enemy but I’m trying to negotiate some peace.
My soul has regularly been splintered into a thousand shards lately.
My soul feels patched up today.
And every spot of light.
I want you in every dark shadow.
Nothing compares to the serenity of an eased mind.
Nothing good happens at 4.10am
Every inch and every second of you.
An icy burn at the mere thought of us.
Flawless imperfection.
I want moments that cannot be put into words.
Nothing but you.
Heavy eyelids. Slowing heartbeat.
Meow
Looking up how to live.
Disconnect. Detach. Disengage. Destroy.
Although a brain dump sounds quite glorious.
A life audit sounds calamitous. Maybe next week.
"Day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute."
"Years to build, years to unbuild."
My heuristic life.
Need more beautiful aesthetics in my world.
Cruel and beautiful ghosts.
Solemn shadows punctuating the light.
A repose for my soul and mind.
Obviously obscure.
Glide over the gloomy tide.
Tranquility is underrated.
"A shrill, calm echo."
I need more austerity in my life. Austere positivity.
Sorcery of the soul.
Days are the trouble here.
My soul tends to set in darkness but rises with the light.
I think. For now.
I’ve leashed my emotions.
This new world order is disasterous for a control freak.
I just want an even head without the peaks and troughs.
"It’s a shame it all happened, as I really enjoy your writing."
I push them all away.
You can’t match my brokenness.
Mutually obsessive.
My soul scars are multiplying.
Beauty life scars.
I detest empty words.
Be your words. Fulfill them.
Rotting sentences trapped in the throat.
Decaying words.
Thoughts left unsaid. To mildew.
Inconsequential thoughts.
"Id choose an old, gothic ghost story. In black and white."
Fairy tale or ghost story?
And you could have it all My empire of dirt
My blood just wants to say hello to you.
The emotions are suffocating.
I wish I could extract the feelings.
Dissolving into the night.
I will be buried in pretty language.
Lured in by the words.
I’ll have to find a way to combat this.
I feel caged at times. This is a new thing.
There is a little dark box encasing my mind.
An unthought thought.
Petals for my skin.
Stardust in my veins.
Fortitude.
‘Watch the temple topple over’
The weather is pervading my mood.
Discordant affection.
Emotional dissonance.
"Winter is displaying itself beautifully today. Cold, grey, bleak, rainy."
‘What is lost can never be saved’
Un-need my needs.
It’s not as much fun to pick up the pieces without you.
You gave me life
Nothingness.
The words they use so lightly.
Not everyone deserves the images of you in their head or your memories in your heir heart.
"Know me well, appreciate me broken."
Read me.
Deep and with darkness The night crashes and engulfs  Light between shadows
Every breath an art.
Your words have branded my mind.
Essence sticks.
What is love
I wage wars of attrition regularly.
Provoke my indifference.
A divine trust. Everything.
Words are my annihilation.
Words are my comfort.
Words are my undoing.
The day has vanished quickly.  I do enjoy time passing easily.
Make me shiver.
Tingles in all the right places.
A pretty face doesn't cure an ugly soul.
Detachable.
Malicious manipulators.
Tiny daggers.
Contentedly chaotic.
A satisfying solitude.
"It is a beautiful, dreary, rainy, perfect winter’s day today 🖤"
Positivity infidel.
For always and ever.
💜💜
Pleasantly caving in.
"I’m nowhere, body and pale bones  Nothing But thoughts spiraling down and up Again Some can be leashed and led away Others Run rampant throughout my ruins"
The resonance is deafening.
My refusal is stubborn. And toxic.
My awful addictive personality.
Be better.
I’m too possessive. I want everything. And now. Gimme.
I’m really attracted to teal and/or purple avis for some reason.
I’m here. I’m present.
Block the hurt. Do not acknowledge.
A stripped naked soul.
Replete with sensitivity.
Go gently.
Seared together.
Lives collided. Drawn like magnets. Entwined and still.
Impatiently awake.
Remember; we are merely players.
My disdain is sustained.  For you.
Spontaneous stillness.  Calculated chaos.
"God, I adore Kate Bush and her lyrics."
"Soul reader, mind critic."
Writhing in your soul.
Burrowing into your mind.
The clarity and unheaviness is pleasant.
"I wander the straight, lost path."
The future is daunting.
I might have exceedingly high expectations of people.
All I ask of people is that they do what they say they will and be truthful. I honestly think it might be too much to ask of some.
We continue to collide elegantly.  With fire. And depth.
It’s all about perspective.  I am learning this.
"I have steered clear of them today, so I know I can do it."
I have bad patterns and behaviours which I need to break.
There is a fine line between enough twitter and too much twitter.
"Clearer, brighter, less toxic behaviours today."
Because of you
See you at
🖤🖤
I’m here
Amoebas on fleas on rats.
Insignificant blockings.
"Distorted by emotion.  Shadowed, reflective, obscure."
Colliding lies.
Self importantly unapologetic.
"Rely only on yourself.  It’s a stark lesson, I know."
I’m not easy. I’m hard and challenging these days. Especially to myself.
Perpetually forever. And ever. Amen.
Entice me. Entirely and tirelessly.
Divulge your desires.
Broadcasting the wounds.
Publishing the scars.
It is a game played best above the shoulders.
Bold engraving upon my heart.
Italicized etchings on my soul.
Throw it out and keep it
"I just like words, okay."
I just cannot move on from Kurt 🖤  Still. Forevermore.
No recess!
Truth covered insecurity
I gazed a gazely stare.
Dare me.
Adequately forlorn.
Enthusiastically bleak.
"Things potentially sprout, but not bloom."
Nothing in me blooms anymore.
Stained soul.
It’s tiring fighting mind and body.
I detest change.  I feel it. I can’t control it.
Archaic aches.
My soul is sighing.
Tricks are for kids.
My variables are confounding.
Your timing is confounding.
The problem with words is that you can prettily dress them up.
Flaunted.
Unreservedly.
Can’t stop.
I’m standing in your line.
Hang out on clouds
"Now are one, out of two"
We collide for one embrace
As I whisper in your ear
Multiplied moments equal memories.
"You like what I like, I like what you like."
Crossed over and interwoven together.
Our curated lives.
I miss dreaming. It’s been a couple of weeks since I’ve remembered mine.
Dreams dream.
Cut you in
Our interception.
Pretend we’re dead.
Take the pill drink the coffee eat the muffin
We’re running out of alibis
I want stability. Evenness.
This topsy turvy existence is not at all enjoyable.
Pouring like an avalanche coming down the mountain
I miss me.
Please even me
That would be an epic superpower.
If only I could literally bury myself under skin.
Under your skin.
Pay your money baby
Idle hands are the mind-demon’s tools.
I know
Eat right exercise take the pill act right don’t eat take the pills take it all take the pills repeat
I wish I was made of fire
Mildewed
In you I crash cars
Falling free
🖤
And I do too
I’m a shame.
That’s a shame.  You’re a shame.
"Inhale me, exhale you."
"Breathe in frigid air, breathe out toxicity."
Pity-less.
Some humans aren’t.
🖤
I see you
Perfect my closed mind. Rip off my blinkers.
Flawed humans. I’d rather be a flower.
Systematic communication using only sighs and growls.
"Sleep fades, consciousness shoulders it’s path forward."
Elegantly decomposing.  Decaying with dignity.
Flirting with them.
Your words know all the right places to target me.
Words hit. They bore into me.
Disastrously tired.
Scintillating and sultry.
My impatient existence.
Men are so predictable.
Equidistant between my heart and mind.
Modern love is getting a string of favs from you TC.
I do love a pretty fragrance.
Maybe.
I’d like to be the best thing that has ever happened to someone.
"Pretty words, beautiful sentences and lovely paragraphs."
We’re all just pretty words strung together.
"I am accustomed to grey, black, dark. In fact, I prefer it this way."
I’ve got to find my mind.
Mingling minds.
I want to know what passion is.  I’m not sure I’ve ever experienced it.
Nonsense. That’s all this is.
Keep your desire to demand in check.
"Too many, but probably not enough."
I’ve lost count.
My darkening echo.
All I want is everything or nothing.  All or none.
Altering paradigms.
Extract my emotions.
The body and soul have been rather well behaved today. Blessed be.
Missing particular people simply creeps up on you.
I’m cocooning.
Warm and soothing.
Inner fuzziness.
The absence of inner screaming is nice.
Threaded thoughts.
I’d prefer conscious fumbling.
Numbly stumbling through consciousness.
The malevolent chaos of people.
I am listening.
I recognize and respect the anxiety.
Breath quickening.
"The buzzing, everything heightened."
The tiny stabs of anxiety.
Align me.
Open up and swallow it down.
Do not believe anything. Question it all.
Paranoid android.
Spiked with distaste.
Laced with lust.
I know you know the unsaid things.
I know you know I know.  Everything.
Only crowd me if I allow it.
I wish I lived in Europe during the romanticism era.
It’ll never change.
The ruse is in play.
Waiting for it.
Silver tongued.
I’m just over here being word smug again. Don’t mind me.
Placated and peaceful.  The psyche is soothed.
Nonchalantly perturbed.
The moments. The feelings and thoughts. You.
Memory re/creation.
Darkly enamored.  Lustfully moody.
My blood just wants to say hello to you
‘Today I found my friends   They’re in my head’
Staying heightened. Keeping watch. Ready to attack.
The menacing thing is absent.  But it’s a precarious absence.
Shadowy and silent.
Beautiful disasters.
Promises promise
You might surprise yourself
Words are like blood sometimes.  Or poison.
A right person knows. Gets it.
The mood is ugly. I want to attack.
Slice and cut her out.
"I want to excise her from my being, like a cancerous mole."
"Allay me. Soul, psyche and pneuma."
Soothe the storm that is my soul.
Charge my nerve fibers.
Stimulate my neurons.
Your action potential is beautiful.
Eruptive evening.
Self absorbed brat.
I have renamed my narcissism ‘introspection’
Halfhearted.
Fluent in disinterest.
Delicately existing.
Pseudo tranquility.
The simulated serenity.
Don’t let the venom penetrate.
Acquiesce to me.
Emotionally passive.
Lethargically listless.
Indifferently apathetic.
Fraught with apathy.
Winter is wonderful!
This bitter weather rivals my icy heart.
I aspire to contentment.
"Audible sighs, low growls"
Sighs and growls are a special language.
Silence and whiskey.
Be present. Here. Now.
Flawed deeply.
My cracks run deep.
Time marches by me as I float erratically.
Compassion is a dead emotion.
I exist between the beats of your heart.  Amidst your inhalation and exhalation.
People loudly proclaiming they don't care.
A listener who really hears you. Your words and non-words.
A good listener is a rare find.
My spikes are high and my dips are low.
Excitatory or inhibitory?
Pretty little axons.
My whole being is an idiosyncrasy.
I’ll win.
But I’m suppression today.
"Synapses cracking, heightening everything."
Stoically brittle.
The biting frigidity ❄️❄️
Routine. Just do it.
Take the pill.  Trust the process.
It’s still there. Lurking below the surface.
Little solders in a row
"Bridging my heart, welding my soul."
I only have one way to shatter myself. It’s too few.
Abandoned proposals. We can inhabit again.
Crunch white grass ❄️
Wield my pain. Strike.
I just want my own person.
I know what you do because I do it too.
Have a field day.
I’d rather be dumb.
Too intelligent perhaps?
I’m probably a better person with you around.
The void can always do with more word smugness.
I am being defiantly word smug.
A dialectical opposition between the truth and your delusions.
Unpoetical.
Some cant help but lie in every word.
Erupt my mind.
I like having you.
Nullify my mind. Completely.
The dark thing is still here. I can feel it in the pit of my stomach.
Archaic hearts.
Chained. Emotionally. Soulfully. Mindfully.
"And you helped, reaching down and pulling me up. Chained."
You took my breath as I tried find my surface.
You crashed over me like an ocean.
Exhume my vigor.
Nurture my dead spaces.
Gently caress my mind.
Let our darkness mingle.
Intersect our souls.
Wrap your mind around mine.
"Honestly, I’d like a couple of days without an existential crisis, please?"
A lot of my day has disappeared.
"I’m still suppressing every emotion, just in case."
The hole was deep and I’m glad my mind has decided we’ve had enough.
I can see in color a little more today.
Toxicity is continuing to be released.
We are all our own worst enemies.  Some just can’t recognize that in themselves.
Such a nice place when a lot of trash has been removed.
Sleeping spell cast.
Slaughtered minds.
"When the words are absent, he reads my silence."
My biggest pet peeve is people who say ‘sorry’ and expect automatic forgiveness.
Don’t say it if you don’t mean it.
Apply pressure.
"Wring my soul, squeeze my mind."
I’m glad it’s gone though.
The day vanished. I’m not even sure to where.
Curated and polished. Haphazard and raw.
I have managed to calm my mind. Mostly. I hope there will be no more.
"If I could bestow a peaceful mind onto you, I would."
And a crisis of meaninglessness.
"I’m having a crisis of connectedness I think. I like to think I’m an island, but I’m not."
"Numbed, locked up, closed in, waiting."
Take the pill. Wait it out.  Repeat.
My maladaptive maladies.  Mine.
My maladaption is stark.
I can’t rely on people though.  What would I do when they’re not here?
You’re a relief.
This is all monumentally ridiculous.
And then I hate myself for allowing people to do this to me.
"I feel unstable, unbalanced.  People do not understand their impact on others."
I am so damn paranoid.
Super excited to go to sleep tonight.
Spilling petals.
I would kill for a quick fix.
I need to fix me.
I don’t know how to ‘be’ these days.  I think I’m just always running.
Cyclonic times.
My mind is an exquisite escape room.
Nothing to anyone. Not even myself. It’s better.
"Seeing things, mundane things, which I want to immediately tell you about."
"Recognize, understand, practice, heal."
My mood is maladaptive.
We’re all just here for a little avoidance.
I don’t want to inflict myself on people.
I can’t even conjure not sad words or thoughts.
I’ve forgotten how to be not sad.
I knew letting my walls down would end in misery. It always does.
People have crushed me.  I’m a bit ruined right now.  I’ll rebuild.
Im learning nothing from mine.
Without me.
I had a truly awful night.  Truly.  Awful.  Truly.
Cells colliding.
Sick and tired.
Screw up your life again
The meds are taking their sweet time.
Whatever. Hope you’re happy.
Obliterate me.
Kill me pills
Maybe they’re right.
I hope it just stops while I sleep.
My heart feels like it might stop.  Or burst.
Burn everything.
At it still.
Incessantly somnolent.
Personifying sleep.
The personification of oblivion.
It is challenging being a lazy perfectionist.
A typical Roman tragedy.
Descend into the maelstrom.
A frozen lake. Nothing flows.
House of the dead.
Ruins spring from me.
A river of desolation.
Gushing through the underworld.
I am an island.  Walled.  Surrounded by shark infestered water.
What is the point?
I cannot even be bothered trying right now.
Crashing ships in the night.
Flowery veins.
Bleeding petals.
Pave my world with bones.
Oh to be a cat!
.... a girl takes too much time to love and a few seconds to hate.
Numbness and nothingness for me.
I’m spiteful and I want to attack back but I won’t.
"People hurting people to make themselves, what? Feel better? Look cool?"
I’m so annoyed at myself. For allowing a nobody to upset me.
Nothing to/for no one.
So many of you are beautiful wordsmiths.
"Mutilate my place, ruin my joy."
The vitriol is disturbing. Worrisome. Sad.
I am sad and annoyed.
I’m tired of dealing with it.
Dissipate me.
Expel them.
The unsaid words lay dormant.
Resurrect me.
Spurn me harder.
"Disconnect, disassociate, disappear."
Disconnection is the name of the game.
Absorb me. I’d happily vanish into you.
I simply can’t do it today.
Just stop. Don’t look at me and I won’t look at you.
It gives me fire in my blood.
"There are some really nasty professional twitterers around here. Building their social media empire, one mean tweet at a time."
Jealousy is a curse.
Queen of self reliance.
"When they get what they want, they never want it again."
Self care sleep in. Self care coffee and banana bread.  Self care gym.
First song on in the car @_Hasoooo
Pray to noose to flame to blade 🖤
What a bunch of hard work I am.
Awful dreams. In which I lost.
I’m utterly broken. Utterly. I don’t even want to deal with me.
Anticipating the inevitable abandonment.
"Cremate and scatter me across mountains, on a misty winter morning."
The peace of ghosts.
Peace.
"My bones will crumble to dust, my blood will evaporate."
I will have enough one day.
"I feel so ill. I hate my mind and my body. If it’s not one, it’s the other."
I’ve been harsh on myself tonight.  I will pay.
I’m no rival.
I’ll acquiesce. I don’t care.
Rarely successful.
"Haphazard, styled to look the least ‘abnormal’."
My moods are arranged chaos.
Orchestral mind.
Composing symphonies for our souls.
Be my undoing.
The violent delights.
I do enjoy some ruination every now and again.
An adoration that you want to attack and ruin.
Malevolent melancholy.
Remaining.
"Cleansing, soothing rain."
To forget what I am.
Dissolving the day.
Warp my world.
Too busy with surviving to really listen or speak.
I didn't connect with anyone today. Not properly.
Souls aligning.
"Moody weather. Gun metal grey skies, gusts of sudden, fierce wind."
Mind ache.
Too much noise.
I am sick to death of myself.
I would really enjoy an even keel.
Emptying.
Stoic and stern and moody.
Exuberance. I have never.
My facade dropped a bit.
"Eerily enough, there is comfort in numbness. Familiarity."
Surety of nothingness.
Glitched.
Latent soul.
Dorment soul.
You soar. I soar.
You hurt. I hurt.
Suppress me.  Mind. Body. Soul.
Mental neglect.
Levitate me.
Shatter yourself.
My shell is here.
Beautiful words are escapism.
Neglected words.
Abandoned memories.
I’m under no illusions anymore.
Beguiled by poison.
Don’t preach to me. About yourself. I care not.
You can’t argue with hypocrisy.
"I never expect people to stick around and tolerate me, I only tolerate myself as I have no choice."
"Peeling moods away, layer by brittle layer."
I am going to attempt self kindness today. Extra self kindness.
Smother your delusion.
Remember to pause.
I react too quickly and too harshly.
"The cacophony you spew is empty, despite the words you select."
Your attempts to escape mediocrity are getting old.
Pretty words are reserved for those with a pretty soul.
I’d enjoy nullifying you.
Vacate yourself.
Sedate me.
Deliver posies to my corpse.
"Dying bouquets, lily white skin."
&lt;becoming a death and flowers account&gt;
Accidentally accumulating attention.
"Garnering responses I don’t want, can’t handle."
Forever saying stuff I wish I didn’t.
RIP
I’ve fought myself all day and now I’m losing. End.
Kill today. I’m done with battling it.
To sleep forever.
A shroud of petals.
Bury me.
A cemetery of my moods.
A graveyard for my thoughts.
A beautiful Winter's day.
Winter fulfills me.
When will my tide turn?
"Give me all I’m worth, or nothing."
True friendship is rare. I crave it.
A magnetizing misery.
Beautifully suffering.
Ensnared by emotion.
Surrounded by loneliness.
Cinders litter my heart.
Dust fragments my soul.
My heart skips beats.
I Like You
Severity of self.
I want so many more of you.
"He exists all the time, and eternally."
You only exist when I’m weak. When I’m hating myself.
Imagine us.
Hard and far away.
"I hope youve moved on, honey."
"I punish myself often, for not adhering to the rules."
Im hard. Im strict. On myself.
I wish my eyes told my story.  My story is locked away right.
I’ve eased my mood.
I’m the man
I have mind and body aches to dissipate. I will.
I am feeling vile. I want to attack and hurt.
Take my hand
Eyes of a tragedy.
"Maybe I’ll find myself a perfect, unmarked grave plot today."
Transforming into my ghost now.
Bleeding thoughts.
Hang on hold on hang on stay afloat breathe be rational think clearly slow down stop breathe
I must practise my empathy.
Sometimes I wonder.
Impossible insouciance.
The numbness is a recompense and also an escape from the demons.
The exhaustion keeps the mood at bay.
Your words echo within me.
"Comfortably numb, pleasantly fatigued."
Vitriolic and venomous minds.
Boring but blasé.
Weave your soul into mine.  Intertwine.
Mourn my melting mind.
Mindfully merciless.
Mind ache.
Scatter the splinters of my soul.
Silence the sociopaths.
Stupid girl.
Stay there.
Be vacant with me.
Peacefully floating restlessly.
Petty and poisonous.
Beautifully blurred.
My patience. Wherefore art thou?
My manipulated words are my best attribute.
Mentally and physically
A tsunami of energy to make it through the day.
Pure intention juxtaposed
"Darkness off, pseudo light on."
Cease thinking. Dont allow the mind to  conflate.
"It’s a blessing that you have words, as you have nothing else."
"Weighing me down; my eyes, my mind, my self."
The gray veil of sleep is always slow to lift.
Romance my melancholy.
You’re not lovely.
Idealizing my darkness.  Romanticizing it.
Hopefully dark and darkly hopeful.
"Some days I’m happy to acquiesce, others I will fight tooth and nail to hold my darkness close."
You’re encouraging me to lighten up my darkness. It’s a process.
I require a deep and imposing sleep tonight.
I do enjoy my smug exaggerations.
My bereft and chaotic mind.
I don’t want my anger to harden inside me; you simply are worth less than dust.
You are desperately and pathetically nonexistent.
Another alt for me to bury in your mass grave.
My thoughts frequently turn to you.
Silence can either be your worst enemy or your best ally.
Satisfied with my silence tonight.
A faded and foggy memory.
You expertly demolished my walls.
Waning consciousness.
Anaesthetized.
Temporary.
Mind exhausted.
I do enjoy meandering in the shadows.
"Managing, struggling but it’s no life."
Escapism.
I really don’t want to.
I exist best in the dark.
Why can’t I wake up with a calm and quiet head and rationalized thought patterns every day?
We all get a little possessed sometimes.
You’ve forced my numbness to glitch.
Everything is droll.
Nothing is appealing.
"Such hard words to type, read, believe."
I’m seen. I’m heard.
Note to self: I am Enough.
I still want to bury you and your multiple alts in a mass grave.
I need to practice my emotional truth. Deciphering and accepting it.
Life is not survivable.
"My feelings are no longer palpable, tangible."
I’ve managed to dissipate some of the heaviness.
My loneliness has shape today.
I have a worry I can’t/don’t want to explain.
Seether.
And to avoid feeling.
Sleep to restore.
Tumultuous and torrid.
I am having a lot of thoughts tonight.
Trust terrifies me.
Trust. In general.
Trust the process.
It’s healthier for me to not know.
"I want to know, but I don’t want to know."
"If I let you in, you’re rare."
I admire calm and rational minds.
I would like to be unflappable.
The shifting parameters.
Weather the evening.
My paradigm is moody.
It’s mine. I’ve learned to endure and enjoy it and will not apologize.
My quintessential darkness is a passenger for life.
"I do not have control over my day and I do not like it, being the controller I am."
Too many times shattered.
Anything to retain the numbness.
My expectations of people are nonexistent these days.
I cannot abide your righteousness.
3 Libras on repeat.
I see you. And through you. Into you.
Oh well
Hearts and thoughts
You don’t always to need to solve her.
"Love me, even though I am more flaws than anything."
Rip the petals from my ego.
I’d call you serendipitous but I wasn’t looking for anything.
Carefully curate your narrative.
Slump into it.
Embrace vulnerability.  Occasionally.
Eyes of a tragedy
My gypsy spirit has stopped by.
"Some days I have the strength of an army, others that of a butterfly."
My calm is always tormented by threatening anxiety.
My being is tranquilly serene right now. And I want to keep it.
You’re not quite a blip on my radar.
You bury my anxieties.
My crescent soul.
Elevate my psyche.
Feeling emotionally secure is nice.
Cleansed my heavy soul a bit.
I’m the man
Centre of my own attention.
Kiss the snake.
Pretty
It is meant to be my sanctuary.
"My heart sinking when I return home is not pleasant or good in any way, shape or form."
Steeling myself to meet the day.
Suppress my fire. Soothe my soul.
Floated through the evening.  Time to descend into sleep.
"Is it common for people to have 5+ alts, mixed sex and interact them? Or is it just her?"
"Grey, fuzzy, numb is how I like it."
Synthetic release.  Fade me.
You can tell more from my silence than you can from my words sometimes.
"I get physical symptoms when I share emotions. I rarely acknowledge them so I guess my body is like, 'what the heck is going on here, woman'"
I found an interesting gated track today
You told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
Bury all of your stupid alts in a mass grave. Here lies no one.
My vile side wants you erased.  Let her know.
Jilted women are the worst 🥀
My misty foggy soul.
I want to live in the filtered.
Craving my walls. To lock you out.  And my torment in.
Might build an army.
Die for a thousand years.
"Pretty words, pretty noose."
Trying to decide what brand of oblivia to subscribe to today.
It’s a beautiful thing waking up to darkness.
I dreamt about the old house that I apparently own and can’t use the second story as a man spirit is up there. It’s a regular setting now.
I’m a bit harangue-y.
Take the pills. Sleep it off.  Repeat.
I’m in one of those burn it all down moods. Dangerous. Reckless.
I would love for karma to be a bit more forthcoming though.
Stoop to awful levels that people regularly occupy. You know?
Some times I would just love to wreak havoc. You know?
Use me. As your conduit to healing. I’m yours.
A descent. A plummeting plunge.  Hold on tight.
My insensate self-loathing
Liberate my hate.
The bane of my existence is me.
Passing ships in the night. Across the tumultuous seas.
I’m not good during the nights. Can not escape their darkness.
Absolve my word smugness.
Entrance my psyche.
Subdue my mind.
Quell my torrents.
Silence my noise.
Emotions of truth and soul of empathy.
Words of wisdom and actions of conviction.
Enjoy our show.
Watch us harder.
"Your damage is searing, honey."
Change your taste in men
Don’t be skin deep. Be soul deep.
Dripping with alchemy
I ask to be a hummingbird
Patiently waiting for my turn with the flaying.
Desperate and vicious.
Your jiltedness is showing.
It matters. You matter.
The delight and validation from being seen by him.
Attention seeking lunancy.
The lunacy is piercing today.
Do not avert
If you could you know you would
"If your words can arouse me, you’re mine."
A calming presence.  Your tranquil reassurance.
Anhedonistic tart.
Nothing glimmers anymore.
"Careful, your truth is showing."
I am a nihilistic nihilist.
"“Everything has been figured out, except how to live.”"
Existential crumbling.
That entrenched mental exhaustion that sits in your bones and numbs your mind.
Sleepy and smug.
Disillusionment shadows me.
Afflicted by life.
Some days wreak havoc on me.
Numb. Body and soul.
My pretty hate.
Little soldiers in a row
"Dull, yet feeling every exquisite stab."
The noise inside is blinding.
How does one obliterate one’s consciousness?
That desperation reek.  Sears the nostrils.
Manic. Absolute.
Today might require some synthetic calmness. And early.
Irrelevant.  Be better.
Slash and shriek harder.  I adore it.
"Holier than though, whilst stabbing repeatedly with a sharp blade."
My sympathy and empathy have dissipated.
Playing the ‘poor me’ card while slithering through the long grass.
Only nice to those deserving.
Swallow
Lizard brain.
"The stomach knots, the anticipation."
Beware the false facade(s).
"Endure the agony, with poise and grace, and bloom again."
Relinquish it all.
The delusion is frightening.
"Splinter my psyche, my being, my world."
"I never did believe, but there are some who can dissolve the hardened barrier protecting your heart."
Some people will disintegrate your mind while others will help it flourish.
The sandman is coming.
We collided.  Didnt we?
The subtle persuasion of words.
Placate my impatience.
"Levitate me.  Emotionally, spiritually."
A clinical appreciation for the melancholic.
Caressing mine.
"His viking skin, hauntingly pale and luminous."
A kiss as deep as my brooding soul.
Gouge my awkwardness.
Besotted and smitten.
Rooted in somberness.
Afflict me.
Subdue my heart. And soul. And mind.
We’re all on trial around here.
In league with your soul.
Consorting with your darkness.
Placate my conceit.
Stroke my indifference.
Appease my narcissism.
Caress my disorders.
Anomalously same.
Unconcerned and uninterested.
The symphony of a peaceful mind.
Skin pressed against me tight
Your words have branded my mind
I’m the one with no soul
Two weeks and we had caught on fire
Swallow your sorrow
I will find a centre in you
They really want you...
I just want to scream hello
🎶🥀🎶🖤🎵🥀🎶🖤🥀🎵
"‘The less I know the better’ is a great mantra, truth be told."
Try your luck with heather
Caffeine and music makes my time instantly improve.
I want something good to die for
It’s sad when people move so far down your messages/text opening screen and then disappear completely.
"Waking, cocooning, still enveloped by the h avo arms of slumber."
"Every day is a coping exercise, the only variant is the depth to which I fail."
It is now my duty to completely drain you 🎶
Too many overthought thoughts.
Absorb the darkness.
Assimilate the darkness.
Missing someone after mere minutes.
Never forget.
The placid panic.
Quelling the disquiet.
Just eat me all up and be done with it.
The stomach gnawing anxiety - from out of the blue! - is the worst.
The anxiety ship has shattered my calm.
Thankfully my day contains a scintilla of peace.
I’m ok with that.
Unsure if I’m introspective or self absorbed.  Probably narcissistic.
The dread is just below the surface.  I’ll drown it though.
Wash it away
First it giveth.
Yeah you wish
...solemn gaze 🖤
"Promises, promises"
I caught the moon
Ghostly ghosts ghostingly ghosting.
Paying lip service.
Daydreams are self care for the mind and soul.
I’ve become a daydreamer these days.
Languid and lazy forevermore.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Caffeine procurement stat.
The mental fatigue is palpable.
One above and one below.
Cocooning.
"Sweet, merciful sleep is eluding me tonight."
The connection with another is an immense thing.
Occupying space.
I’m not like them but I can pretend
Moments congregate to become memories.
Prepossession of soul.
I want for the ability to turn unreality into reality.
The vacuous void.
We all need more sparkling darkness.
I‘ll give you the last word if it’s that important to you.
So much white noise in this void.
A (dis)heartening block.
Women who give women a bad name are my last favourite.
A woman scorned.
"From now on, toxic people will not affect my time with those who matter. Reinstating priorities."
Paid some penance.
I’ve worked my way out of the gray.
Thankyou for the motivation though.
The wherewithal is absent.
I’m in a gray space.
"The struggle to feel, do, be anything."
A window into your madness.
Thanks for blocking and locking as I dont always have the self restraint to not look.
The day has run its course.
Love having you but hate not having you all.
Dreary and weary.
Eager to envelop my solitary darkness.
Filled with soullnessness.
There is a fine line between regret and mourning.
I have had enough people today.  I’m craving the solitary.
Have a sip of reality.
I love knowing.
The sultry silence of a seductive mind.
She doesn’t deserve your time or attention. Float on.
Trying to remain unscathed.
The subtle art of self assuredness.
...je vois
My patience are fleeting.
Your screaming tells us it savagely struck a nerve.
"Misty, foggy, ethereal."
Icy body and frigid heart.
The dark and biting pre-dawn weather.
Find some restraint and move on instead of choosing to dwell.
I’d be mortified if I reacted like some people do.
You’ve overloaded my soul again.
Fade to grey or enhance the dark.
My pre slumber is evading me.
Infatuate/d.
Please remedy this wakefulness.
Project your vulnerability onto me harder.
"Propping up walls, word by word."
Words are my weapons.  And protection.
The serene torture of being alone.
I detest only having it partially.
Always.
Adequately satisfactory.
Addicted to the simultaneous oblivion.
I can’t wash you off my skin
Don’t tell anyone
I’ve kept my mind entertained today. It has behaved itself well.
I’d really rather I didn’t care.
Lucidity
Crawling back to you
"My coffee, my love."
The veil of unconsciousness is approaching.
Sorry for repudiating you.
Alluring awkwardness.
The Blood Is Love by Queens of the Stone Age   #NowPlaying
Flesh War by Total Control   #NowPlaying
Music from you that I cannot get out of my head.
Inherent self abuse.
I wish I could be consistently less hard on myself.
The curse of sentience!!
The unnecessary anxiety.
Smothering the rising panic.
Your irrelevance.
All encompassing exhaustion.
Still.
You should learn when to go
The inane chatter of people.
Fade to gray.
To hang my darkness.
A pretty noose.
Hurry.
The conclusion is about to begin.
Stop. Every. Thing.
The quietude.  Respite.
Solitary prelude to chaos.
My curated life.
Foresaken me in your heart
Ethereal low laying mists.
Expanding ripples of oblivion.  The descending haze.
"I’ve finished altering myself, and my relationships, for others. They can just not look at me 🥀"
"I don’t need the oblivia tonight, I just want it."
"I’m filtering today. With a pretty, washed out filter.  All the imperfections. All the noise."
I would consider imploding everything if I could. Reduce her to ash.
Petty little girl.
I cannot envision a time when every thing is ok.
An unhealthy preoccupation.
iam adepto super eam
ad movere
I do not like having no control over things.
I ask myself ‘why’ multiple times a day.
My blustery 1am capriciousness will be my undoing.
Migh start an aggressive alt to instigate a love affair with this alt.  To fawn and defend and rant.
Our measured cadences.
You need to be severed.  Or maybe I do.
I want/need to be more asleep.
I’m too tired and medicated to be awake.
Blindly and naively believe everything.
I want an eternal sleep now please.
Let’s just go.
It’s not enough.  It’s never enough.
I think I need the normalcy back.
Desuetude of self.
Seeping.
Fraud.
Nevermore.
"You’re muddling up your personas, Lovey 🙃"
Might find solace in a pill.
It is descending.
Silence speaks volumes.
I am destroyed.
Doing nothing destroys me.
I actually prefer the psycho bitch one.
"And someday, you will ache like I ache."
"I do, too"
1010011010
Pretty pain
"Anything is better than being ignored, though. Right?"
It’s difficult to observe: the train wreck.
And this place a memory.
"You, me, whiskey, music, books, bed."
"‘She wasn’t looking for a knight, she was looking for a sword’."
We’re all just playing parts anyway.
This is getting old
Entertain us
It’s palpable.
I squashed the blossom and now the blossom’s dead.
Waiting like a stalking butler.
Hysteria/hysterical.
Your mania is showing.
Prolong the agony.
The solitary frigidity of morning.
Actions and responses define the character.
You.
I don’t even want someone.
My self constructs are bleak. B l e a k.
Unclarity.
Cloudiness.
We collide for one embrace 🎶🖤
But I feel nothing. Am I better yet?
Do not react
That we may make a kiss that can pierce through death &amp; survive
Eye for an eye
You were. Past tense.
Let me on your shore
The myriad ways that I love you
Frigid
Too many people.
The way
There are perceptible shifts.
My sleeping patterns are awful.
Quiescent.
Eulogize me.
"Was, is, will be. Zero."
The words are my salve.
Vitriolic and uninspired.  Be better.
Redolent and relentless rage.
"Beguiled, bewitched, besotted by your darkness."
The fury has ebbed and flowed today.
I know you crave the attention.  You won’t stay unobserved for long.  Very droll.
"Lock, block, delete, reinstate, repeat. Please feel free to stay absent."
We’re chained
Nothing but a malicious glint in my eye.
...breaks me
Try harder.  Be better.
Your banality is deafening.
The stark difference is that I am in touch with reality.
"Done, done and I’m onto the next one"
Unhealthy obsessions and attachments will destroy you.  More than you already are.
I am all in right now.
My kindness and allowance is threadbare.
"I’m so ugly, but that’s okay ‘cause so are you"
Oh I know.  I do.
The false facades.
If people knew the story behind the bluster.
It’s a bit too much love and light and not enough dark and twisted at present.
Jilted.
Possess some self respect.
Have some dignity.
surmonter cette salope
You are making life truly horrible.  Just stop.
It’s too early for the oblivia but my god I crave it.
You have become the happy place for my head and heart.
Spending a significant fragment of my time cacooned in curated fantasies these days.
Propinquity. Mind and soul.
My murmurous mind.
...now I can’t erase
The moon is quite full tonight. With a scattering of clouds to hide between.
Honestly.
The Descent.
"When you look, yet know you shouldn’t."
"Too much, too many, too frequent."
Labyrinthine minds.
"It’s a hard lesson, but worth it."
Help yourself. Depend on yourself.  For no one else will.
I’ve felt empty and nothing all day.  I like it.
Mine.
Have not decided on the mood as yet. I’ll remain empty and vacant for now.
Vague disinterest.
A way with words is fucking sexy.
Enamored.
Catharsis.
The capriciousness of our affect.
Won’t you please fawn over me. [Repeat x4]
"You, me and a lie."
I was not received
💜🖤
Oblivia.
Nihilistic existence.
I can never seem to cease berating my soul.
I’m considering the depth.
The oblivion is descending.
I’m seeking oblivion tonight.
A plummet.
The eternal search for peace.
Messaging that person at the exact same time as they message you 🖤
The words we use so lightly I only use for you.
"But the background noise can be loud and unfair and mean. But in the end, is of no consequence."
You. The rest is just background noise.
Words stick.  Your words particularly.
Simple words that lift my heart up.
"Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, and faster and faster."
Apart from you.  You can 🖤
Pls don’t try to engage me at 6.35am before I’ve come to terms with the day.
Don’t tell me how to do darkness.
And I will romanticise whatever the hell I want to.
No one else does.
I know.
Waking from insouciant sleep.
"The lady doth protest too much, methinks."
Compassion is challenging at times.
Me to 6 year olds. And many adults.
"Honestly, find a better hobby."
What a hive of interminable melodrama.
Now’s your chance.
Moodiness and dark &gt; love and light
Dynamically.
Everything is changing.
I have to do life today.
Future longing.
I hate it when you start to miss people before it actually happens.
Serene evening.
I like my darkness. It’s just mne. I share it with a couple of worthy people.
I’ll meet you in my dreams where our darknesses can mingle.
Falling asleep with you in my head and a smile on my lips.
My cognitive dissonance is one of my better attributes
I’ll probably never un-socially distance.
The Smiths are just a fucking Mood unto themselves 😍😍😍
It’s nice to feel light for a while. Before the blackout.
I’ve never been in love. Fascination. Adoration. Never love.
"You’ll think I’m dead, but I’ll sail away"
"This is where I’m raw. The bad, the ugly."
Exposure of my little dark secret.
L o s e r
Wasting life on a dream.
I know I’m not good enough for him. It can’t work anyway. But I’ll stay in this orbit as it’s better than reality.
Reality is dead. I’m going to stay in my fantasies from now on.
It is not fair.
Where is my nest of salt?
Time is my nemesis.
The humans can have their feels.
Innumerable stupid thoughts.
I’m so over everything.
Goodnight beautiful void.
Imagine that ‘what if’ didn’t exist.
Mislead/ing
Tangled up in blue.
I’m questioning e v e r y t h I n g
The soft dive of oblivion.
I can never have you.
Your soul is etched on my black heart.
I’m jealous of every second his mind is not occupied with me.
I dress my fantasies up as memories.
If only I could twitterfy real life.
"Nameless, faceless anonymity is all I crave in life."
I think I have two people in my life who can elicit a genuine smile from me.
The shadows hide my darkness mostly.
Fragility. Doom.
A melancholic mood.
Oblivion extra required tonight.
I am the queen of mindgames.  Being played on me.
Feels and relationships and people are my downfall.
Making mind fucking an art form.
When you know you’re on the wrong path but cannot find The One.
The eloquence of silence.
Obsession. Wholly encompassing.
"The arriving film over everything, the nodding of you head and eyes. Medicate."
That shiver from just the sight of him.
How do you make yourself enough?
All bough I know I don’t deserve you.
On another plane. Living another existence.  With you.  Instead of separated by our current plane and existences.
The night torments me presently.
I am not worthy.
My serenity is also my oblivion.
One above and one below.
Twitter is a faery tale.
The imperfections of perfection.
"Cold and icy morn, Burrows deep into the bones, Scalds like a blue flame."
The darkness is my favorite part of you.
"You know you should just withdraw, but it’s futile."
Watching the drama from a collateral damage perspective.
Imagine oblivion permanently 🖤
Serenely warding off the Day After.
Girls are less trouble amirite??
Do not get the popularity contest that is twitter.
"Whiskey with a cork, man...🖤"
Yasss
Abandoned and free.
Believe nothing from no one.
Debating oblivion.
Candlelight night.
Waking from an oblivious slumber is torture.
Tranquil languor.
"I live in the numbness now, in the background."
The darkness has captured me of late. Rapidly and all encompassing.
I’m just aiming to be as feelings-less as I can until about feb.
"Like, why the fuck bang on and lie straight to me?! Is it a kink to be a predator? Or what?"
‘Oh I think you’re awesome and blah blah blah. Here when you need’. Followed by radio silence.
Fucking men who come across as good guys then are not!
Here is the only place I’d verbslise not wanting to exist.
I’ve forgotten how to people. I’m unlikeable? Hysterical? All talk? I can’t understand:
"I expect nothing from real friends but stupidly expect more from online ppl (on my real account) And nope, I get nothing. Is it me?"
"I’m in a major hole. I’m broke, alone. I’ve had enough."
I would like to fucking die tbh.
I want to die without all the hassle.
I’m slipping today. It’s a day id like to be over. It’s too bright and my self hatred is massive.
I’m so tired of trying and getting nowhere.
I’d be happy to sleep forever. Never wake up.
I’m still here but wish I wasn’t.
Massive over-reaction from him.
I’m ashamed and worried for the future tbh
My finances are my biggest anxiety. I’m so sick living paycheck to paycheck.
I’d rather not be here.
I’m so sad that the end of the AFL season is in sight 😭
Too early for bed?
I know I should do something but I’m always tired and feel horrible and I just don’t know how to.
I’m acutely aware I have no one. I know it’s a risk factor.
"Hello, yes I hate myself and feel utterly and devastatingly alone. Good night."
I’m horngry
Ugh I’m alive
There’s no game.
This is where I declare I want to die when I feel like I want to die.
I’m alone and sad.
...do boobs get followers?
Zero
It’s good money but will take more post grad study and time off to pass said study and I’m not sure I could financially survive.
I hate my job. It is killing me.
Ever want to take a handful of pills after a shit day at work and not wake up? I would do it right now if I had enough.
I need a man whore.
I’m so pissed with my life.
"I can’t see any light. The darkness just continues to build, bill upon bill and MH symptom after MH symptom."
"I’m really sick of struggling day in and day out. If it’s not one struggle, it’s another."
"Off you fuck, rude individuals."
"It’s the blurst how I never want ppl who want me, but want the ones who don’t 😂😂😂"
I have watched too much football. My eyes are now football shaped.
I really don’t think I’d be as sad if I had money. Money would make existence much more bearable.
I hate myself. I hate my life. I don’t know how to fix me.
I would like to be put out of my misery. I’m sick of feeling shit.
These footy players who just make life so difficult for an opponent trying to stand up are ridiculously ridiculous at times @AFL
I feel hopeless. I figure what’s the point in even trying.
How do I be more likeable?
What is with boys honestly?
"It’s a weakness and I hate being weak so it’s like massively, massively difficult to admit."
And keeping it hidden is just as draining.
It might be time to seek help for my eating disorder. It’s just too exhausting. Mentally and physically.
Meow bitch.
It already feels like Thursday.
On a scale of chirpy to lethargic I’m fucking comatose 😭
The clouds are awesome today.
I have a TC and he always talks to all the women apart from me. I need to just lose him I think.
How does one make friends when one hates ppl..?
It’s very hard to find my place.
I’d settle for delicious oblivion.
I’d rather nap.
I could happily not exist but it’s too much effort to get my life in order.
My superpower is keeping people at arm’s length to avoid any relationship development whatsoever.
I’m socially media-ly awkward too 💁‍♀️
Moody af
I have no people.
I need this space. To get thoughts out. Find like-minded anxiety and depression riddled souls.
