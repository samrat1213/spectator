Beneath the Hollow LyricsHollow lies fill weakened minds with
Hollow dreams
Weakened lives fill infamy with failed beliefs
Shattered wills fall aimlessly beneath the Hollow
Hollow words can't fill the void beneath
Within they seethe
Again they breed
So Callous
Legends swollen, Hallowed Waste is stripped away
The venom growing with lust to feed the Hollow need
Return from Ash, returning from a banished world
To savor flesh of the Hollow, and all beneath
Within they seethe
Again they breed
No Solace...
So Callous...
So Seething...
In this they FeastEmbed
