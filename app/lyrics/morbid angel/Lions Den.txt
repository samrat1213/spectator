The Lionâ€™s Den Lyrics
Beasts awaiting, restless
Circus victims panic struck
Hunger spawns bestial frenzy
Commencement of the feast
By the sign of the cross

Whips crack
Centurions might be known
Christians standing breathless
Circus victims panic struck
Scream arena butchery
Where is their god
As the faithful meet their end?

Judgment has passed
Who questions this law?
Pagan belief of sacrifice

Kill them all
Kill them all for slander
Kill them all and mute their ways
Kill them all
Kill them all for slander
Kill them all and mute their ways

Judgment has passed
Who questions this law?
Pagan belief of sacrificeEmbed
