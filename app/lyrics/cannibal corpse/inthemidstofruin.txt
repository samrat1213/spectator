The present has become the past
Mayhem and chaos foreboding

Brought back to the dark ages
Modern technology wiped from the earth
A world darkened once again
In the midst of ruin we will be
Anarchy

Malicious indifference ruling the land
You'd better be ready to die
It's kill or be killed
Barely surviving through primitive warfare
Only the strongest will thrive
I will not be killed

Every man for himself
Most of them turn to suicide
The populace forced to revert
Lacking in normalcy
Anarchy

In the midst of ruin
In the midst of ruin
In the midst of ruin
Most life will cease to exist

Malicious indifference ruling the land
You'd better be ready to die
It's kill or be killed
Barely surviving through primitive warfare
Only the strongest will thrive
I will not be killed

The present has become the past
Mayhem and chaos foreboding

Brought back to the dark ages
Modern technology wiped from the earth
A world darkened once again
In the midst of ruin we will be
Anarchy
