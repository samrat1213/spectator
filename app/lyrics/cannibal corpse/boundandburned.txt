Born into a life of contempt and disorder
Living in squalor
Childhood and adolescence filled with abuse
Verbal, mental and physical

A lifetime of pain
Forced into darkness and feelings of shame
This will never happen again
Unforeseen vengeance will end this today
Violent intentions have surfaced
Now it's too late to reverse it
Knocked unconscious to the ground
Beat down, never to rise again

Arms and legs are tied up tight
Trapped, no chance of escape

Now regaining consciousness
Drenched with the stench of gasoline

The one who caused the suffering
Now begging for forgiveness in vain

Lighting the fire erasing the past
Death will be slow and painful
Burning in flames

Violent intentions have surfaced
Now it's too late to reverse it
Born into a life of contempt and disorder
Living in squalor
Childhood and adolescence filled with abuse
Verbal, mental and physical

A lifetime of pain
Forced into darkness and feelings of shame
This will never happen again
Unforeseen vengeance will end this today
Violent intentions have surfaced
Now it's too late to reverse it

Bound and burned
Lighting the fire erasing the past
