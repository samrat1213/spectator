Revolted by a sickened man
He breathes the same air that I breathe
I know he taunts
The scythe it shines as we say goodnight

Revolted by a sickened man
Disgusted by the empty glare
I know he taunts
I know he lives in those morbid thoughts
I sense the tribe step back
We saw the smoke from a mile away
I'll give him exactly what he wants
This scythe it shines as we say goodnight

Thoughtless vengeance
On moral high
Thoughtless vengeance
Say goodbye

He breathes the same air that I breathe
Isn't that sickening?
Isn't that sickening?

He says he could never make it right
Maybe

Maybe

Maybe
I am the answer
We shall see tonight
We shall see tonight
I am ending light
I am no answer
I am deranged with light
I have no answer but
I am deranged with light
I am no answer
I am no answer

Thoughtless vengeance
On moral high
Thoughtless vengeance
Say goodbye

Thoughtless vengeance
On moral high
Thoughtless vengeance
Say goodbye

This scythe it shines
As we say goodnight
It shines
As we say goodnight
