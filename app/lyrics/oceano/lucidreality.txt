Lucid dream states remotely view
A new landscape upon the horizon
Upon the horizon
As the vessel rests
Let your spirit escape towards the stars
As the vessel rests
Let your spirit escape
Project past the stars
Departing from the body to hold no true form
The conscious mind is one converged with the soul
Departing from the body to hold no true form
The conscious mind is one converged with the soul
To exit this world
Escape this world
Telepathy guides you
As you slip through the dream realm
You will be taken
To a new home and astral plane
You will be taken
To a new home and astral plane
You will be taken
By the ascendants
The ancients guide a path to your salvation
The ancients guide a path towards your ascension
Separate and ascend
Before this all meets an end
Separate and ascend
