Fomentatious perflation hydrogenates your foetal cisterna
Coagulating haemorrhage and your congenital hernia

Dehydrated soup - crumbling hygroma
Pectified sludge - dank, acrid aroma

Clotting uteral mucus, dissipating your foetus
Melting your uterus and evaporation your cyesis

Your molten foetus is reconstituted by warm, molten enzymes
Slowly digested in microwaved slime
Your stomach is churning, heat effervescing your succus
Your innards running like hot, sticky mucus

Mangled uterogestation, your perimetrium clots
Your insides cooking, steaming and hot
