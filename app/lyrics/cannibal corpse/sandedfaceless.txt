Rapacious for pleasure scraping
Filing down with intense grinding
Harsh abrasive friction deface
Countenance now removed forever

Scouring faces with flies
Tedious rasping
Painstakingly grate the skin
Insensate razing
Sanded faceless
A violent facial scrub
Malefic in nature
An art of shaving the bone
Insalubrious
Sanded faceless

Rubbing off a humans visage
Enduring display of malice
With celerity they perish
Countenance now removed forever

Everything gone from the head
Miasmal menace
All curves of a face are now smooth
Forced a new surface
Sanded faceless
Obscurity into black
Outrageous agenda
Sensory perception lost
Left to die in pain
Sanded faceless

<i>[Solo: Pat]</i>

Insane appearance eyeless
To calibrate the skull
Image erasing soulless
Retexturing of flesh
Suddenly to be faceless
For perpetuity

Scouring faces with flies
Tedious rasping
Painstakingly grate the skin
Insensate razing
Sanded faceless
A violent facial scrub
Malefic in nature
An art of shaving the bone
Insalubrious
Sanded faceless
