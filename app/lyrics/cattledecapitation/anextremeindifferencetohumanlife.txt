Coldly we're murdering, humiliating victims
Global unburdening, killing with conviction
Out of despondency comes human degradation
Cheapening everything with a pulse
A conscience, a soul, a subconscious

Rise! Ascend! Near-term human extinction!
The future begins where human beings end

When the fire starts
Our human counterparts
De-fleshed to the muscle
Tendons, bone, a still pumping heart
De-gloved alive, fed for 45 nights electrolytes
Plucked from this paradise this vengeance comes as no surprise

Reducing life to vapor
It's only human nature

Entire families are
Split up
Figuratively and literally
Their body parts are
Now chopped up
Into a sloppy mess to mop up
Bleeding profusely on an offal laden floor
Made up of human bodies marinating gore
Swimming in viscera, steams with a stench that triggers a
Violent vomit vagary, succulent yet so unsavory

They'll be dead forever
We'll be dead together

I live for this shit
So many homicides to commit

Coldly we're displaying our internal nature
Globally ravaging with human behavior

Rise! Ascend! Near-term human extinction!
The Future begins where human beings end

Now I commit suicide as it is only right
No amount of human pride will keep me here alive
