Oh, so my life was through, oh

I use to know you,
I knew everything about you,
but not your sticking needles in your arms,
if you'll just notice that you've taken it too far.

Keep myself, in.
So whats your excuse now, for just tearing apart
and you'll just continue worsening your own self.

You've got so cold, so numb.
So wrapped up in your blank touch.
You've got so cold, so numb.
So wrapped up in your blank touch.

Why you do these things,
they are leading you to grope for a lie.

Through your body,
Through your body.

You make me fucking sick,
You make me fucking sick.

So take this one chance, to start all over.
you took this one chance, and fucking made it.

I promised you I wont ever let you go around her,
remove the needles, grab my hand and pull yourself up.

So whats your excuse now, for just tearing apart,
and you'll just continue worsening your own self.

Grab my hand, pull yourself up.
Grab my hand, pull yourself up.
Grab my hand, pull yourself up.
Grab my hand, pull yourself up.
Grab my hand, pull yourself up.

While your still here, while your still with us.
While your still here, while your still with us.
