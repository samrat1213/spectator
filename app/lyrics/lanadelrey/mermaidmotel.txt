Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune (Avenue)

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

(Maybe we could go to) Suede Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
