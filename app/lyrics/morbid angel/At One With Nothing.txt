At One with Nothing LyricsOmniscient are the eyes that see beyond
What we choose to see
Transcending of beliefs, that limit man's being
The dogma that feeds the listless
Has thrived uncounted years
Impeding on ones perception
Of what is to be
Awaken to see
A god of a desertion
A god of lies
Enlightened by a way, deceiving
Only truth to the blind
The salvation that you seek is empty
No god of light
The venom that has fed your faith
You except with ease
But the sights that lay before you
Destroy your beliefs
Awaken to be
At One with Nothing
Now all will be seen
The seeds of the weak destroy
The lies told of forgiving, exposed
The ignorant, thrown to the wake
Your calling names of gods
They are only shrines
The waves of the truth, enslave
Slaying the blind
Awaken to a light of knowing
All your truth was lies
And the faith which you embraced
Has left you blind
Deceived like the fools that surround you
It came with ease unfulfilled were the days of your being
But now you will seeEmbed
