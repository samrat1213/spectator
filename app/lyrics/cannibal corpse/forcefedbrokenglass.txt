Flesh starts to rip
Gouging through skin
From the throat
Blood gushes
Glandular eruption
Blistered skin secretion
Internal punctures
Blood regurgitation

Gagging, choking, on broken glass

Shredded muscle tissue
Wounds too deep to heal
Severed esophagus
Tongue split in half
Lungs fill with blood
As vocal chords collapse

Oral sex
With broken glass
Ruptured flesh
Ripped through the neck
Mutilate
Pulsing veins
Sliced windpipe

Flesh starts to rip
Gouging through skin
From the throat
Blood gushes
Glandular eruption
Blistered skin secretion

Wounds too deep to heal
In me
Torn trachea
Splintered skin
Down the throat
Choke
Lungs fill with blood
As vocal chords collapse
Oral sex, with broken glass
