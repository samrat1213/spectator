Internal burning
An omen reborn
Embrace the torture
Purify the soul

Bathe in red hot coals, dripping skin become a pleasure
Face begins to melt, liquid from the head rewarding

Eternal burning
Sanctified with flames
Unholy recourse
The demons are here
Unleash the fury

Body slowly burnt, vital organs charred and blackened
Scorch to disinfect is the method for acceptance

Purification by fire
Transformation is rapture

Beyond recognition and deranged from the cleansing
Frenzied schizophrenic a memory before the scalding
Sacrifice for pain

Unrelenting heat scrambles the sense
Caustic remedy betrays existence
Hellish invasion just part of the plan
Beasts have been summoned to conquer again
Unleash the fury

Internal burning an omen reborn
Embrace the torture purify the soul

Bathe in red hot coals, dripping skin becomes a pleasure
Face begins to melt, liquid from the head rewarding
Body slowly burnt, vital organs charred and blackened
Scorch to disinfect is the method for acceptance

Purification by fire
From within the torment is complete
Any worthy future now obsolete
Purification by fire, transformation is rapture
