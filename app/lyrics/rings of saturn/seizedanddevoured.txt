Rebirth, turmoil among the slaves 
Cosmic realms far beyond the sun implode 
We are not of this world 

Abandoned our home; now we've come to take yours 
Unleash this wrath on your pitiful people 

kneel before my minions, as they kneel before me 

I take the form of a god 
The mindless follow me 
The gluttony I find in this filthy waste of life disgusts me 
Seized and devoured by your loving sun 
Migration of the slave human pigs 
No charred remains 
I take the form of a god 
The mindless follow me 

Cosmic realms far beyond the sun implode 
We are not of this world 
Abandoned our home; now we've come to take yours 
Unleash this wrath on your pitiful people 

Shipped off like cattle, butchered, now you'll see
