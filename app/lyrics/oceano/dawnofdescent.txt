This is not the second coming of lore
Don't pray, revoke
Dismiss your dissipating God and cherish one last night until humanity's lost!

War
The streets are dying for war
Cherish one last night until humanity's lost forever!
War
The streets are dying for war
Cherish one last night until humanity's lost forever!

Violence an insatiable threat in the wake of imposing events
Shattered faith manifests
The truth has lead to social unrest we are the cause of their presence
Now, bear witness!

Every mind is inundated, every eye captive
As monolithic transports draw closer
Transmitting telepathic information
Human origin and creation are finally exposed

Dispelling organized religion as a fraud
Society loses direction once its lost its hold
Witness the blood of riots flood the streets!
Triggered by desperation disbelief

The pile of bodies increase
The backfire of a collapsed monarchy

All that they've taught you is a lie
A lie

Cherish one last night until humanity's lost!
Cherish one last night until humanity's lost!
The streets are dying for war

War!
The streets are dying for war
Cherish one last night until humanity's lost!
The streets are dying for war

Panic, disbelief, and desperation
The streets are filled with war and stained red with death
