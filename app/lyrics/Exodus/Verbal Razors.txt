Every time I see your grinning face
I realise you're a pitiful disgrace
So many fingers pointing down at you
Talking shit behind your back and you don't have a clue
Parading around like you think you're god
You're just a cheap imitation, a complete and total fraud
I'm sick of hearing all your bragging and your lies
A real born loser and that's no surprise

You said your father died in Vietnam
But you're a bastard son with a whore for a mom
Mirror magnet, smelling like a rose
You plastic motherfucker, all you do is pose
Conceited, self-righteous, and arrogant
Your head is so hollow there's enough room to rent
Little big man, so full of shit
Just shut up, you pathetic hypocrite

Verbal razors - cut you down to size
I'm sick of wading through your bullshit
I see through your disguise
Verbal razors - slice you to the bone
You've been abandoned
And now you're all alone

You lost your job because you're incompetent
Everybody hates you, your friends all came and went
The facade is getting old, we're hip to your charade
You mother has disowned you, your wife's out getting laid
Evicted from your condo, now you're living in a shack
Sitting on your ass shooting up and smoking crack
Now look in the mirror, and tell me what you see
A strung-out fuckin' junkie with a college degree!
Nobody cares if you're alive or dead
We've had enough of being used and misled
You've pissed on everyone you've ever met
Now you're digging through the trash looking for a cigarette
No one's there to lend you a hand
You better help yourself, 'cause I hope you understand
Self-centered, back-stabbing egotist
Don't fuckin' ask for favors, 'cause you're on my blacklist

Verbal razors - cut you down to size
I'm sick of wading through your bullshit
I see through your disguise
Verbal razors - slice you to the bone
You've been abandoned
And now you're all aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
