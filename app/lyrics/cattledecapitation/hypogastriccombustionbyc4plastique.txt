We have our ways to make you die
Your request for a pleasant death has been denied

1,000 degrees
Disintegration above the knees

C-4 plastique, strapped to your chest
Detonation is imminent
A loud, unsightly death

Jammed in your rectum
Duct-taped to your genitals
Detonation is imminent
Flesh is flammable

Within the blackened soil of a human heart, awaits the bastard to be blown apart

Unstable explosives lodged between your teeth
A pharyngeal depth charge - dissolve what lies beneath
Level zero trauma - deceased on impact
Volatile incendiary turns crimson insides black

Obliterate all plexus
Packed hypogastria with plastique and dynamite
Appendages take flight
Detonate. Volatile. Discharge.
Epicenter. Relocate. Renovate.
All systems destroyed. Annihilate.
Phrenic, hepatic, renal, spermatic.

A bursting collage of human anatomy
The structure dissolves in goreified calamity

Jammed in your rectum
Duct-taped to your genitals
Detonation is imminent
All flesh is flammable

Hypogastric combustion
Airborne pieces spread
Umbilical prolapse
Fragments - a crimson shade of red
