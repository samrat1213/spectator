Upon a throne of eternal flames
A monolithic beast bearing many names has been awaken.
Off in the distance cries of anguish resonate beneath the surface.
Beyond thousands of agonizing screams echoes laughter of a dominant being.

The Devourer of souls,
The accuser,
Who find satisfaction in their pain,
This monumental destroyer awaits

Aroused in anticipation
For these black gates to open and unleash, implications of horror and bloodshed
For our sins.

Trading bloodshed for our sins,
There is no salvation.

There is no salvation.

For he has risen to conquer us.
He has risen to conquer us all.

He shall destroy you,
There is no saving you.
