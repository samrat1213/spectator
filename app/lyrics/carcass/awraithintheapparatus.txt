Little boy cries wolf for he cannot see
The emperor's new clothes syndrome
This diabolical transparency
Transitional seasonal change
Come palpate the shame
Another reign another dogma
Another shibboleth passes away

Harmless or nefrarious
A gilded new church
A false god to worship
Blind acceptance with no repentance
A jaded new church
A false deity to service

God save the king
Send out succour
There's a wraith in the apparatus
Long live the king

Genuflect before this mammon
A false idol to revere
A corrupt church of the blind
Cathedral of idiocrasy

A malfunctioning mechanism
A new hymn of praise to sing
But I serve only the true monarch
God save the king

A bewitching ritual to seduce you all
Apocryphal church a false god to worship
Fallacious disingenuous
Lords of the illusional new church
Pre fabricated pope to service

God save the king
Send out succour
There's a wraith in the apparatus
Long live the king

Repent

Necessity is the smotherer of all invention

God save the king
Send out succour
There's a wraith in the apparatus
God save
