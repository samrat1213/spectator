Screaming your name into the sky
Into the sky
Screaming your name into the sky

Were you just going to sit back
And watch him die? 

He screamed your name straight to the sky
He screamed your name everyday

Rescue him from the fall
Rescue him, take his hand 
Take his hand 

I remember the day and
every sound and smell of it 

I remember the day
Just like it was in a photograph 
Where nothing ever changes
and always stays the same
Where nothing ever changes
The memory stands still

You let him fall 

Screaming your name into the sky
So I tried
And I screamed 
Lord can you hear me

And I was left without
reply so I walked away
You let him fall 
You let him...

Without your response
I blame you
For this loss of love and life
