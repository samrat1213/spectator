These demons
Build you to break you
Rise to watch you fall
These demons inside
They know where you hide
And I don't know who I am anymore

These demons
Build you to break you
Rise to watch you fall
These demons inside
They know where you hide
And I don't know who I am anymore

Visions of atonement
A path that leads the broken
Into endless night
Horrified to face the light
For shall they see

Endless torment
Endless pain
The veins constrict
The heart is strained
Torture
Infiltration of the soul
All revealed for you to see
Stricken of all dignity

I don't know who I am anymore

These demons
Build you to break you
Rise to watch you fall
These demons inside
They know where you hide
And I don't know who I am anymore

These demons
Build you to break you
Rise to watch you fall
These demons inside
They know where you hide
And I don't know who I am anymore

Numb to the touch
Numb to the feeling
Powerless to find
Passage to healing
The heart is frozen
The body broken
All revealed for you to see
Stricken of all dignity

I don't know who I am anymore

These demons
Build you to break you
Rise to watch you fall
These demons inside
They know where you hide
And I don't know who I am anymore

These demons
Build you to break you
Rise to watch you fall
These demons inside
They know where you hide
And I don't know who I am anymore

Our past collides like shorelines and sand
Scatter the ashes into the distance
Victims of existence
Oceans carry you to the cold
Tired vessels cleansed below
Eternally you and me
My demon
We sink together
