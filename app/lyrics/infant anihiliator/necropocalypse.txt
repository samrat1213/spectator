Littered with carnage
Continents crumbled by the crusade of rape
The catastrophe of cock and divine desires
A deviant plague
Humanity reduced to rotting fetish fiends
Between the sun and the moon
The Earth now bleeds

A world dismantled and doomed
Defiled and decimated
The rebellion dwindled as the weak reaped corpses as prey

Humanity reduced to rotting fetish fiends
Between the sun and the moon
The Earth now bleeds

The Gods that gifted them a necrophilic, paedophilic paradise applaud the nobility and sacrifice
Beneath, the dead all soil and slay
Forever in fire
The price they pay

Trumpets bellow in the deep
As the victors call "where is your King?"
The soulless kneel down at their feet and weep
Repenting to the Gods they now fear

Forever in fire
Forever in fire

Devastated, desecrated, lubricated, penetrated, decimated, defecating, trembling in fear
So commences their fate
Manifested, uncontested, consecrated, venerated, motivated; ready to reclaim their rightful place
As the bringers of heresy

Dead in the soil
Forever in fire

Humanity reduced to rotting fetish fiends
Beneath the sun and the moon
The Earth now bleeds
Eternity in the dwelling place of misery
Beneath the sun and the moon
The Earth now bleeds
