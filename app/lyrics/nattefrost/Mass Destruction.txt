Mass-Destruction LyricsVicious times of turmoil
Faces in despair
All is left in ruins
All is laid to waste
Mass-Destruction
A conqueror in flames
Mass-Destruction
This is Death !!
Chemical warfare
Global Death
Human pesticide
Strangled with Poison !
Mass-Destruction
A conqueror in flames
Mass-Destruction
This is Death !!
I cross the fields of hate
Mile after mile, worldwide
A cold dying sun
Pandemonium !!!
Mass-Destruction
A conqueror in flames
Mass-Destruction
This is fucking Death !!
("Drep alt og alle - Terror, War, Destruction, Carnage and global Death")Embed
