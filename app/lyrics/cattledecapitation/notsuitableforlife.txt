On this celestial body, third planet from the sun
Of earth, of terra, of gaia...
a spreading cancer, the self-destruct financer
Earth's largest natural disaster

So this is what you want?
A world not suitable for life?
(Self-damning idiots, with traits abhorrent and hideous)
Damn your traditions, god damn your religions
Shit on your systems, to hell with your decisions
As long as gravity holds these two feet to the ground

I stand here guilty in sadness and humility
Part of the problems - never to solve them
In a way we have become... culturally dumb

How can you look me in the eyes and tell me you're proud OD what you've done within this life?

Ignoring the trash heap that is our daily lives
a disparaging wasteland, a hell on earth paradigm
Extinction level living - the fate of all unwinds
Too ignorant, too selfish to read the warning signs

So this is what you want?
A world not suitable for life?
(Self-circling vultures, damming garbage cultures)
Fuck your traditions, fuck your religions
Fuck your systems and fuck your decisions

How can you look me in the eyes and tell me you're proud
of what you've done within this life?
Your footprint can't dematerialize and when you die, look where you've left your children behind... a world unsuitable for life
