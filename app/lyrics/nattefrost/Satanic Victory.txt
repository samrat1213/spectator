Satanic Victory LyricsSatanic Victory
The Death of hope
Hellish sinner, the earth in flames
The soul is burned
Stigmatized , Satanized !!!
Life is Hell
Forever cursed and haunted !
Vile Suicide visions
Leaving this earth
Satanic pride, satanic possessions
Satan claims your soul
Satan, ruler, master !!!!
("This is War, victory is ours, Destroy Everything")Embed
