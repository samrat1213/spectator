Blasphemous man made abomination born 
Creating something that's never been made before 
Savior where are you now 
Wreaking terror through the sky 
Hate envelops every soul 
Your fate no longer in your hands, mind control to the fullest extent, 
demise of humanity 
Severed heads overflow as the spree continues 
Man destroys man, the ultimate killing machine 
Resistance-a ticket to sure death 
Słońce zachodzi 
Death now rules this hated land 
man made abomination born 
Spawned the destruction machine rises 
Eaten from the inside out 
Every last worthless piece of fucking shit dead
