All these years of torment
You were supposed to guide me
You were supposed to guard me
Instead you make me sick

Venom fed like medicine
Raping my innocence
I am not broken
I don't know just what to do
What's wrong with me is wrong with you

Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death

(All these years of torment)

Knight came to save me
Revealing the deceit
We see no escape
I don't know just what to do
You're killing me, now we kill you

Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death

Let's turn this room into a motherfucking crime scene
Motherfucker!

You're killing me, now we kill you

Love me to death
Love me to
Love me to
Love me to death
To death, to death
Love me to death
To death, to death
Love me to

Motherfucker!

Love me to death
Love me to death
(Death, death, death, death)
Love me to death
Love me to death
(Death, death, death, death)
Love me to death
Love me to death
(Death, death, death, death)
Love me to death
Love me to death
(Death, death, death, death)
