You arise - with the whore of Babylon at your side
Sicarii - no mercy shown by those whose crucified

No mercy shown

Barren bloodstained dominion
Foundations on the sea of the dead
Barren eyes that stared into the pits of Hell
The fallacy of the anointed race - 
A mere diasporadic tribe
Misappropriated promised land
Searched, destroyed, and occupied

You arise - with the whore of Babylon at your side
Sicarii - no mercy shown by those who occupied

Merciless neoteric Shoah

Nazarenes avenged the vaticide
Sculpturing the ashes of the six million who died

You arise - with the whore of Babylon at your side
Sicarii - no mercy shown by those who chose to comply

Ensanguined tallit and Magen by design

The two rivers run blue - the pigmentation of a corpse

Amortize with the whore of Babylon at your side
Sicarii - Nakba or Shoah
Tell me when exactly did your humanity die?
