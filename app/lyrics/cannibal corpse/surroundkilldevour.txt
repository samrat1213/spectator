Desperation
Starvation drives the pack
Society
Suffered full collapse

Desolation
The world we knew is lost
Consumption of their fellow man
The line that they now cross

Surround, kill, devour
The need for food compels
Lupine instincts, long suppressed now help them to survive

Surround, kill, devour
They run their quarry down
The weakest have been singled out to kill

Shadowing
They're following the tracks
Ambushing
Too late to react
Atavism
From our barbaric past
Reemergence of our darkest side
The violent traits of man

Surround, kill, devour
The victims run in fear
Cunning teamwork boxed them in, there will be no escape

Surround, kill, devour
Slaughter has begun
Cannibals will tear the flesh from bone

Torn apart
Famine fueled madness, they fight for scraps
Savagery

They live on
Rewarded with survival for their evil ways
The virtuous
Will die

Closing in on their chosen target
They force their prey to run
Encircled by the killers

Exhaust the quarry with the constant pressure
The weakest won't survive
The weakest will feed the pack
The weakest will feed the pack

Surround, kill, devour
The need for food compels
Lupine instincts, long suppressed now help them to survive

Surround, kill, devour
They run their quarry down
The weakest have been singled out to kill

Torn apart
Famine fueled madness, they fight for scraps
Savagery

They live on
Rewarded with survival for their evil ways
The virtuous will die
