A practicing christian
Overriding passions for the Lord
A member of the body of Christ
Cut off as she prayer
Left alone, with the devil in the house of god
Was she slightly bored when she left
For the rendevouz with the grave
So late at night, why was she mailing
A letter to a friend
I have been chosen to do the disposin'
Hunted, Stalked and Slain
Baptized in blood, ritual sacrifice
Hunted, Stalked and Slain
Enjoying the chase  the easiest prey to hunt
Adrenaline pumping  watching her look over
Her shoulder in fear, stepping into the church
Await the moment for the kill
Arils turns around as she sees
The beginning of the end
Blasphemy at it's peak
As he walks up to start the assault
I have been chosen to do the disposin'
Hunted, Stalked and Slain
Baptized in blood, ritual sacrifice
