Fused duodenum to esophagus
Inert maze of digestive tract
Visceral/abdominal U-turn
Diarrhea of the mouth
Broken capillaries and tissue
Combined with bile, hemorrhoids and feces
Microscopic amoeba, single-celled juggernaut
Regurgitation of shit and disease
You are what you eat
You are what you shit
You are what you vomit
