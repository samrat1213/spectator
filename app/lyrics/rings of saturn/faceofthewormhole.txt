Crackled, callused hands gripping the emaciated frames of all loved ones
Neurotoxins turning them opaque
Liquefying brain matter to capture your mind in binary code
Paralysis in the time vortex

A mouth emerges from the face of the wormhole
Something truly ancient is lurking throughout the deep, as it is moving in silence

Crackled, callused hands gripping the emaciated frames of all loved ones
Neurotoxins turning them opaque
Liquefying brain matter to capture your mind in binary code
Paralysis in the time vortex

These, these are, the afflicted, cursed, and broken souls
Ritual blood, reanimate
Their, their grief is manifesting so it can be known
Such a need to eradicate
Loathsome ideology
Spread to every newborn child
Spread to every newborn child
