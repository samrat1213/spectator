Horrific perception that enters the brain
An abnormal psyche insanity's brain
Cemented beyond immeasurable doubt
Psychotic or not they need a way out

Of their obscured minds
If they want to be set free
Lunatics of wrath
Horrid killing viciously

Like incisions
With conviction
Various deaths
Identical

In hell they will find
It is where they need to be
Murder redefined
Butchered meticulously

Killed the same way
On the same day
Various deaths
Identical

Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision

<i>[Solo Jack Owen]</i>

Aware not of the cruel visions each had
To slaughter alike they must truely be mad
Rewarded with blood on their ignorant hands
These psychos precisely slew many men

With their obscure minds
Feeling that they were set free
Murder redefined
Butchered meticulously

Like incisions
With conviction
Various deaths
Identical
Killed the same way
On the same day
Abysmal deaths
Imperceptible
