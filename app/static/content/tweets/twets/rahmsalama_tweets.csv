"the wrong person will find you in peace and leave you in pieces while the right person will find you in pieces and lead you to peace, remember that"
ok but hi
"bro, i don't even ask for happiness anymore, just a little less pain"
"no, i'm not always right, but i'm always real"
"and as broken as you may feel, you are still standing, there’s something to be said for how you hold yourself together and keep going, even though you feel like shattering. don’t stop. this is your healing. it doesn’t have to be pretty, or graceful, you just have to keep going"
learn to walk away from things not meant for you
"growing up means being honest. about what you want, what you need, what you feel, and who you are"
"there are people who are always in love with the sky, no matter what the weather is. one day you will find someone who'll love you the same way"
i got lost in your eyes and i didn't want to find my way out
the story doesn't end
woke up with a mind full of you
maybe one day
"bro, this year just feels weird, like it shouldn't exist but it does so we're just going along the wave hoping it doesn't drown us"
forgive me if i don’t talk much and push everyone at times. it’s loud enough in my head and it requires all the energy to control my thoughts
it has been very difficult to put my feelings into words
i am just very selective about everything
she tastes like love
by your side always
the right people will hear you differently
some days the words just won’t come out
i am still learning how to handle me
lonely clouds and empty skies
when does it end
"if my words don’t make sense, my silence will"
i’m too weird to be around people
"sometimes all it takes is one sentence, and you can either make someone feel really good, even if for a brief moment, or extremely sad, and that lasts longer than you'd think"
all she wants is someone to look at her and see the person she hides so well
i’ll make a home inside you
"but you did what you did, i felt what i felt, and it is what it is"
but would you love all my sides equally?
"i will never regret someone i had a past, an amazing time, and experience with. even if you're no longer in my life now, you made my life special at a certain time, we grew together, even if we grew apart. thank you for that"
"i want you to be proud of yourself, not ashamed of how anyone else sees you"
what you say to me don’t say to anyone else
i really shouldn’t be this tired at my age
"please don't ever stop being a good person with a good heart, i know how much it sucks being taken advantage of and feeling like it's better to be cold hearted but people like you matter and are so important to the world okay?"
let's normalize taking a break from people because we are emotionally unavailable and in need of space to think and heal
i woke up and felt like i don’t belong here
pretending you don't care is still not letting it go
call me at 2 am and tell me you can't stop thinking about me
"play with her hair, bite her ear, kiss her neck, and make her laugh"
the sound of my name on her lips
i’ll be the drugs you can’t live without
you will never remember what i will never forget
"it's the desire to move forward, unchained from the past, when i look back all i see are corpses and ashes and glimmers of things gone and misremembered that continue looping and circling in my head consuming itself and tightening till that trigger is pulled"
they will miss you once they realize what they had and failed to replace
"it’s like when you miss them, every song you listen to is about them"
"only two things will ever have me, you and death"
"bro, some people will learn how to appreciate you by simply losing you, if they treat you like an option, leave them like a choice. you're worth being loved and adored, remember that"
tell me you can’t get enough of me
"i always choose to play stupid but believe me, i know everything you think i don't"
can we just normalize not bringing up a relatable story about yourself when someone is telling you something about them and just fucking listen?
"i want you to be proud of how you've been handling these last few months, all the silent battles you fought, all the moments you had to humble yourself, and all the times you've wiped your own tears, you’re doing great"
"when somebody loves you, the way they talk about you is different; you just feel safe and comfortable you know?"
"because what i have with you, i don’t want with anyone else"
i’m less angry at the world when you’re with me
"you look beautiful today, not that i’ve seen you or anything but i just know you do"
i can’t wait to just leave it all
"yes, i do want you to stay, but even more than that i want you to want to stay"
her beauty is more than something you can see with your eyes
i don’t have the energy for today
you left her like she was never the reason to stay
we can fuck about it
there’s forever in her eyes
one day someone will give you so many reasons to smile you’ll forget what pain feels like
i just want to sit in front of the beach for a while and listen to my comfort playlist
"believe me, nobody else is going to make you feel the way i do"
"because if you don’t let go of all the wrong people in your life, you may never find the right ones"
"i have no idea where i am going to be 5 years from now, but i do hope it’s somewhere with a beautiful view and you next to me"
people who often tell you how much they appreciate you is one of the most simplest and uplifting feelings ever
kinda sucks you don't wake up in my arms every morning
your priority right now should be you
"because what i have survived, might kill you"
"the wrong person will find you in peace and leave you in pieces while the right person will find you in pieces and lead you to peace, remember that"

"there will always be this small quiet place in my heart that will always belong to you. and i don’t just mean now or until i’ve found someone else, no, always"
"this year is very personal to me, i owe myself a lot"
- how are you? - i’m not thinking about it
we’ll get through this
your heart is all mine
La jalousie (dir. Philippe Garrel)
"have you ever thought that maybe you’ve met the right person, but you’re just not ready to be in love?"
this month feels like a year long
it’s okay to disappear every now and then
"i don’t know about you, but i really like it when texting someone becomes a routine, and how weird it feels if you don’t talk all day"
i ask a lot of questions because i want to know all the details
"look at how tragically beautiful the sky is, a graveyard of stars"
wait for the person that is sure about you
i see everything and i say nothing
i see all the lonely parts of you
the sun has me feeling some type of way
will i ever stop overthinking everything?
"i don’t want to be edgy, self deprecating and mundane, that shit is just old, it destroys your life. i want to be soft and lovely and easily impressed, i want to appreciate all the little things that make me smile the same way i’ve dwelled on all the things that upset me"
here’s a reminder that you have survived every thing you thought you wouldn’t
it’s ironic how we can still get hurt by something we already see coming
"drink enough water, eat well, have good sex, and mind your fucking business"
"yes communication is everything, but so is a sense of understanding. if i tell you something and you’re not willing to see where i’m coming from or my point of view, then what’s the point of telling you anything?"
"because when you're attracted to someone, it’s because of their details, their kindness, their eyes, and the fact that they can get you to smile when you need it the most"
i don't want what everyone else has
"no, i am not sorry for wanting what i deserve and i am not afraid to walk away to find it"
"if this is real life, i don't want it"
a conversation with your thighs and my lips
the moon knows all my secrets
sometimes it's better to just stay quiet
"i will no longer offer my support, friendship or loyalty where it's not returned, it's that simple"
i really just need a break
you can always shut me up with a kiss
sometimes being alone is an upgrade
"i am very emotional, but once i’m done, i’m done"
"it's okay to fight for someone who loves you, but it's a waste of time to fight for someone to love you; there's a huge difference"
sunrises and your lips in my mouth
how is your heart today?
"hold on, someone will give you the world without you asking"
be patient with someone that’s never been loved right before
i’m not chasing anything but a better life
i hope you never experience the pain when the person you fought the hardest for gives you up without a fight
"sometimes i just really need my space, it’s nothing personal, but i need the time to breathe and take care of myself every once in a while, it has nothing to do with you"
"if they care they will always look for a way to make it work, no matter how hard it is"
i still remember the conversations our eyes had
"let me tell you something oddly depressing, yet oddly liberating; nobody gives a fuck"
"i don’t know but i’ve never been as anxious about my life or future as i am now, i really don’t know what the fuck i’m going to do and it’s fucking killing me"
"may your heart find peace, may your mind be at ease, and may you smile today and always"
"no, cutting people out of my life doesn’t mean i hate them, it only means that i respect me"
you will never get the same me twice
too tired but hi
"oh trust me, i am so much more than what i let you see"
i notice all the details that nobody else sees
"yes, you are good enough, smart enough, beautiful enough and strong enough. don’t let your insecurities run your life"
from someone i don't know to someone i can't stop thinking about
wake up in my arms
thank you for always being there when i can't be there for myself
all you have to do is stay
i wake up hoping you would be next to me
promise me nobody will ever take my place in your heart
"because i learned that if you’re not doing what you love, you’re wasting your time"
"pay very close attention to those who aren’t loyal to you but rather loyal to their need of you, because once their needs change, so does their loyalty"
she spends so much time wondering why she isn’t good enough when she is everything
never give your heart to someone who has no intentions of taking care of it
i avoid disappointments by accepting people as they are and not what they could be
"god, i need a hug"
"effort, not excuses"
"i love watching sunrises, stars, and you smiling"
"remember that if you repeatedly have to tell someone the exact same thing about how you feel and they change nothing, understand they don't respect you"
"because when you get used to losing people you love,  you stop caring about life"
"because if only i could show you how shity you made me feel, you would never be able to look me in the eyes ever again"
"the more we don’t talk, the more we get used to it, the faster we forget about each other"
hello
"oh, so you noticed my attitude but not your actions that caused it?"
you should be on my lap right now kissing me
i really dislike loud people
"if i care, you’re going to see it and when i stop, you’re going to feel it"
i have a plan for us
"when someone tries to convince you that they care, look at what they do, not what they say"
sadness follows me everywhere
she couldn’t heal because she kept pretending she wasn’t hurt
an over thinker needs a great communicator
it gets exhausting living in your mind
"i realized i never asked for too much, i was always just asking the wrong people"
"just please, no more temporary people"
normalize apologizing after you’ve done something wrong instead of being defensive and disrespectful
toxic is when they don’t want to let you go but can’t treat you right either
i have no words
"just because i’m patient, doesn’t mean you should make me wait"
please move
i was too young to be that hurt
"bro, they will pretend you’re a bad person just so they don’t feel guilty for the things they’ve done to you"
i will take it personal because i wouldn’t do it to you
"no, don’t tell me you miss me, tell me you’re outside and you need to see me"
i still can’t swallow the fact that i allowed myself to be disrespected so many times just because i cared about people’s feelings more than mine
"‘but who can remember pain, once it’s over? all that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. pain marks you, but too deep to see. out of sight, out of mind’ - Margaret Atwood"
i am a very private person that all you’re going to do is assume
"because i believe in loyalty above anything, it's all or nothing with me"
"yes, i might be damaged as fuck, but i would never hurt anyone the same way i’ve been hurt"
"relationships were never difficult, people are just too fucking stubborn to make sacrifices, put in time and effort into it"
"be committed that, no matter how lonely you get, you will never reinvite toxic people back in your life"
"i just need you with me, then everything is better"
"hey, stop trying to rebuild bonds you didn’t even break"
"stop trying to change people, just change how you deal with them"
welcome Nero to the family :)
"all we get is time and choices, be very careful with them"
maybe we’re all just desperate to be understood
"you can’t be strong all the time, sometimes you just need to sit alone and let your tears fall down"
"in times like these, just hold my hand"
bitch i’m not available only in your free time
i’ll take all the risks just to be with you
"always show love, even when they don’t, or you will become one of them"
hand kisses are so underrated
"yesterday is yesterday, today is now, right here. focus on that"
'knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people' - Carl Jung
coffee so good you want to drown in it
because the pain you feel when someone you love slowly distances themselves from you is the kind of pain that breaks you and keeps you down
she protects her feelings by acting like she doesn’t have any
a bottle of whiskey and the sea and you on top of me
sometimes the way i care about people makes me wish i had someone like me in my life
i wish life was more about living rather than stressing
be with someone that loves your soul more than your body
"your heart always needs more time to accept what your mind already knows, give it that time"
"yes i can go through hell and come back with my head up high unafraid of anything that gets in my way, don’t test me"
don’t allow your pain change you into someone you’re not
"everything's going to be alright, they just take time"
i’ve been through so many tragic moments in my life to get to where i am right now
"i’ve survived that, i’ll survive everything"
"i am just very proud of myself and what i have accomplished and achieved on my own without anyone by my side in the past two years, i am stronger than ever now"
because i’ve never found anything that makes me feel the way i do about you
one of the hardest decisions you’re ever going to make is choosing what’s good for you and what you want
"we question the good things that happen to us and accept the bad, we walk away from something because it’s “too good to be true” yet we hold onto the bad as if we don’t deserve better"
you’re that person i’ll never stop looking at in a crowded place
you’ll find me inside your heart
when you wake up from a dream and the fact that you’re a whole different person in reality breaks me a little
"open arms for you, April"
trapped in the corners of my mind
people will create their own storms then get upset when it rains
do not think less of yourself because they don’t know how to love you
"i never and won’t force anything on anybody, either value me or leave me the fuck alone"
you can’t force someone to appreciate you but they will feel it when you’re gone
"i’d much rather see them happy without me than unhappy dealing with me, and that goes for anyone"
to be with someone who understands how your mind works is a different kind of intimacy
"i’m just really tired of being okay with things i’m not okay with, you know?"
"if they don’t fight to keep you, don’t fight yourself to stay"
come lay next to me and i'll tell you all about my day and read you my favorite book
"if not for you, then for who?"
i really hope the path you’re on brings you the right people you need in your life
"i want what i give, it’s just that simple"
music so loud so i don’t hear my thoughts
"baby wake up, i've made us coffee"
always choose a good heart and not a good face
let them find someone else to teach them what they want
"don’t wait for me to talk, it’s not going to happen"
"i remember you asking me to open my heart and let you in, knowing damn well that you never planned on staying. there’s nothing respectable about that"
do it right or don’t do it at all
"instead of trying to find the right person, be the right person"
i want you to think very careful about whether the people around you are your circle or your cage
"i wasn’t angry, i was hurt.  there’s a difference"
do you ever feel like you’re constantly worried about the next part of your life without realizing that you’re right in the middle of what you used to look forward to? because same
stop dealing with people who think you’re trying to start an argument every time you express how you’re feeling. they clearly still have some growing to do
she's my favorite poem
"you want a piece of the pie, i want the recipe, we’re not the same bro"
"just be patient, one day someone will give you the world without you having to ask for it"
date someone who communicates and apologizes for their mistakes
it’s totally okay to unfollow people in real life too
it’s sad that we live in a generation where people ignore each other to get each other’s attention
"sometimes when she says she’s ‘okay’ she just needs someone to look her in the eyes, hug her tightly and say ‘i know you’re not’"
i know my worth
"do not settle just because of the time you’ve invested in them, read that again"
loving you feels like walking into a house and suddenly knowing i’m home
i am stepping over everything i used to trip on
"feeling safe with someone is just a different type of intimacy, the feeling of peace and protection is so underrated"
"2 MONTHS CLEAN, 2 MONTHS SOBER."
just hold on to me
i should really stop imagining situations that are never going to happen
"it’s okay, we’ll be a mess together"
all the pain i’ve endured is still holding on to me
a glass of whiskey and your naked body
"the light is jealous of every shadow that gets to hold you, the world bends the air to be warm around you, i keep thinking about your eyes like remembering how to breathe"
i liked me better with no feelings
it just feels empty when you’re not here
"if i’m being honest, you’re the only one i’ve spent this much time and effort on"
watch me disappear
"teach yourself how to be alone, and to like it. there’s nothing more empowering than learning to like your own company"
i wonder what’s going to happen next
why hold on to someone that’s waiting on you to let go?
"it’s not their ability to hurt you that should scare you, it’s their willingness"
"be patient with me, i’m still healing"
let my eyes explain how much i love you
apologize to yourself. this is where healing begins
my only goal right now is to never allow myself to fall as low as i did last year
"i want to know everything when i ask about your day, that includes all the details"
"all she wants is to be well treated, well loved and well read"
"don’t you just love it when people help you cut them off? like, thank you, you’ve saved me so much energy"
some people are just not good for you or your mental health
"you can’t control how you feel, but you can control how you behave towards it"
learn when to say ‘no’ without explaining yourself
"i don’t ever want you to feel guilty about removing toxic people from your life.  whether it’s a family member, a partner, a childhood friend, or even a new one; stop making room for people who cause you pain or make you feel small. you deserve everything, okay?"
"i am here to apologize to anyone i have ever hurt, mistreated, lied to, used, manipulated and disrespected. i might not have been in a good position nor mindset at the time and it’s not an excuse, i know. but i am genuinely sorry for anything i might have done wrong to you"
remember me when you listen to every song
who i was and what i am now
"sometimes i’m okay, and then i start thinking"
"and yet, i’ll keep going"
"sometimes i feel everything at once, and sometimes i feel nothing at all, but i don’t know what’s worse, drowning or dying from thirst"
"i would give you every hope back, you know that? if i could, i’d make us both a cup of coffee and we would sit under a tree and i’ll read you poetry and you could tell me ‘i do not chase happy, it chases me’ i’ll feed you every half of every cookie and give you half of me"
"i don’t look back, i never do"
i honestly don’t remember the last time i was genuinely happy
make it all about me like i make it all about you or don’t waste my fucking time
"you know when it feels like your heart is freezing and burning both at once? yeah, that"
i don't want anyone else to see what you show me
"i have learned to hide my emotions very well, now they are even hidden from myself"
"it’s always messy, my hair, my bed, my words, this heart. my life"
at the end of the day it’s really just you and yourself
go laugh in all the places you’ve cried
"‘sometimes you’re all you have, and that’s all you need’"
sometimes a poem is just a poem and sometimes a poem is actually a confession and sometimes a poem is a person and sometimes a poem is a cardinal and sometimes a poem is actually therapy
"i’m sorry if i don’t say much, it’s loud enough in my head"
i hope one day i wake up with a heart not this heavy
"i don’t want words that have been said before, i want words that are felt"
"all the signs you ignore in the beginning just end up being the reason why you leave later on, you feel it right away who's good and who's bad for you. don't ignore that"
you can’t make someone see by giving them more of what they already don’t see
"i don’t even know where people find the energy to argue anymore, i’m just like, okay, you’re right, goodbye"
"hey, your feelings matter, your life matters, you matter. you are very special and unique, i don’t want you to forget that, okay?"
"don't try to fix me, i’m not broken. just understand that when i’m sad, i shut the world out and when i feel better, i let it back in"
my mind just really needs a rest
i have lost and loved and won and cried and hated myself to the person i am today
not everyone deserves what you give
"all the pain i don’t say out loud, builds a home inside me"
i am exhausted from fighting my way through every single day
happy valentines
"it's just me, i don't like needing anybody for anything"
"sleep now love, let your heart rest"
will it ever get quiet in my head?
even sleep can’t fix this tired
stop hating yourself to be loved by someone else
i still repeat everything you’ve said to me in my head
"hey, stop going around telling people how they should treat you, they either appreciate you or simply lose them"
today ended before it even started
you can’t fix everything on your own
all my words lead to you
there’s so much i would do for you
because my heart sees before my eyes do
"forgive yourself, but not just once. again, and again, and again, as many times as it takes to find your peace"
spending time alone has taught me so much about myself
"i am always struggling between my need for acceptance, my fear of rejection, and the desire to not care about anything at all"
i want to kiss you in a way that makes you not want to kiss anyone else ever again
"i have no energy to hate, it’s either love or i just don’t care"
you're the last page
my heart aches less when you're with me
i don’t have to see you today to know that you look beautiful
"always try to be there for someone, you might be the only one that is"
"some people do nothing but take, and take, and take. then they leave. and you stay trying to refill yourself"
the kind of love where you love them without any fear of losing them. genuinely living in the moment with them
if i say i got you it means i got you
"i have my limits, and when you reach them, i dismiss you from my life. It’s just that simple"
we’re all just stars secretly wishing for someone to love the way we shine
"you know, i'm at the age where i don't have the energy to waste on inconsistent people, the patience to sit next to my phone waiting on people to make time for me. i don't have time to waste on people who put me last when i put them first"
you have to save you
"yes, forgiving people in silence and never talking to them again is a form of self care"
just survive today
"in just three words i can sum everything i’ve learned about life, ‘it goes on’ with or without people"
"i’ve cut ties with so many people recently and i have to say, i honestly couldn’t be more happier, relaxed, and most importantly, myself"
"you try and try and try, but it never seems to be enough"
that stare right before the kiss
"picture this; we’re drinking wine, reading poetry in bed and dancing in a quiet street to blues humming from one of the apartments above us, forgetting for one night just how bad the world is"
"i'm not saying it's going to be better or easier, but i am going to say that i will not leave your side and have your back through it all"
"but i know what it's like to want to die, how it hurts to smile, how you try to fit in but can't, and how you hurt yourself on the outside to try to kill that thing on the inside"
i look in her eyes and i see a future
i’d hold your hands and watch the moon with you
she wants somene who actually cares about her feelings
i’ll hold your hands through the nightmares
having you on my lap will make this better
some eyes touch you more than hands ever could
"yes, i forgive you, but that doesn’t mean i will trust you again. i forgive you for me, so i can let go and just move on"
"whatever, fuck winter"
nobody can hurt you as much as the ones you love
i’d cook for you
let’s kiss till there is no more sadness inside us
longest january ever
i carry too much inside
i hope you still smile when my name pops in your head
"no, you’re not an option you’re everything"
there’s so much on my mind and i’m so tired
"because you fall in love with their details, like the sound of their laughter and the way their smile forms"
i miss you and it hurts
"stop chasing people, do your own thing, be yourself, and love people; the right people. the ones who really belong in your life, will come to you, and stay"
i’d catch the moon and bring it to you
"logically i know i need to feel, feeling is healthier than being numb; but numb doesn’t ache like this"
"listen, just listen"
"goodmorning, i need coffee and your lips"
"it’s okay, you don’t have to be strong all the time, sometimes you need to be alone and just let your tears fall out"
"i want you to know that i don’t care how far you push me away because when i said i’m staying, i meant it. you’re a little lost, a little damaged, but not hopeless. i know who you are and i love who you are. that’s why i’m staying so you can learn to love yourself too"
"remind yourself that if it’s suppose to happen, it will"
"i feel empty and cold, lonely and tired, confused and saddened by the world. i just want someone beside me who stays and i want to be less scared of the future. i want to wrap myself in romance, literature, music, and poetry until the end of my days"
a black bird on my shoulders
at some point i’m going to have to think about it and then i’m going to be a complete mess all over again
"there's a kind of warmth intimacy my soul longs for, a kind of tenderness, a safe place to be, away from the stir of society, away from everything"
freedom is being yourself without taking anyone's permission
you don’t see yourself like i see you
i no longer have the energy for meaningless friendships and unnecessary conversations
i just want to fill all your emptiness with love
i want my lips to trace every inch of your skin
"they always remember the bad things but never the good things, no matter how much you’ve done to them"
"oh nothing, i just want to hear about how your day went and make you cum"
"no matter how much i wanted to be held, no one was there, i had to suffer, i had to feel every painful memory and yet, put a smile on my face. i had to accept it, i only had myself and i learned that was enough"
"3 am isn’t just a time anymore, it’s a feeling"
there will be certain feelings that can’t be described with words but rather names of people who gave them to you
i’m ready to grow and get better
i want to wake you up with a cup of coffee and kisses all over you
"i love you, ruin me"
i could disappear at any given moment and you wouldn’t know a single thing about me
"come here, let’s just kiss"
"you’re going to remember my name for the rest of your life, trust me"
"when you meet someone who makes you feel warm and happy like how the sun shines on your face in the morning, keep them. keep them because, my god they are so rare now"
a listener also needs a listener
"when you miss me, remember that you had me and i was never enough"
i am here for you
i want to wake up knowing you’re still here
"i do have a lot to say, but i’m very careful about who i open up to"
your voice is the first thing i want to hear in the morning
before this miserable year ends
"if they are fine without you, be fine without them too"
"i’d make your heart wet, too"
"people have taught me the more chances you give them, the less they value you. they won’t be afraid to lose you simply because they know you won’t walk away"
i am very distant from this world
"bro, when they constantly make you feel worthless or bad about yourself and make you feel like you can’t do anything right, it isn’t fucking love. that is called emotional abuse"
i needed to get away for a while
kill your painful memories by creating better ones
‘how long they choose to love you will never be your decision’
don’t forget to love yourself today too
goodluck finding someone who loves you half as much as i did
we all grew up and did everything we said we wouldn’t
"believe in yourself, you’ve survived a lot.  and you’ll survive whatever is coming next"
you have no idea what your eyes do to me
"sometimes i want to be heartless too, but that’s just not who i am"
never ending routine
"if you struggle, we struggle. if you fight, i’ll fight"
you’re going to wish you did me better
"yes, you deserve to be someone’s only choice"
"the feeling of you curled up in my arms with our hands intertwined can never be put into words; i can however, tell you that it’s where you belong"
she has a mind that craves to be seen the same way her body is
"as i grew older, i payed less attention to what people have to say and i just watch what they do"
"unless you’re me, in my position, don’t you ever try to tell me how to feel"
"loving you, supporting you, and believing in you, always"
at this point i’m just like fuck everyone and fuck everything
i looked at you and felt everything
"she wants everything and nothing, but settles for anything"
at least we see the same stars
losing you was the first step to finding myself
to express your love can be such a beautiful thing
i feel at ease when you’re with me
"open the door for her, motherfucker"
you feel the cold in your bones
maybe but what if sometimes
sometimes you just need someone to sit outside with and talk all night
"when someone leaves, you expect it to happen again, and eventually you stop getting close to people because then you don’t notice when they decide to leave"
whatever it is we’ll get through it
"i’m good at hiding everything. you wouldn’t even notice a change in my tone but i’m honestly so fucking stressed sometimes i can barely manage simple tasks, you might see it as laziness but i’m just so overwhelmed"
i just don’t have the energy anymore
it is what it is
i won’t give up on you even when you feel like giving up on yourself
only i get to make you feel this way
i’ve always wondered if you have ever thought of me so much that you couldn’t sleep
"how do you tell someone that ‘i’m not ignoring them, i’m just disconnected from reality right now and the days are all blurred together and i feel completely apathetic towards everyone around me so it’s really hard for me to maintain a conversation’ without saying this?"
you learn how to be strong on your own
melt into me while i get lost in you
leave me alone with my thoughts
"there was a time when i thought i’d know certain people forever, now i think of them and i don’t even know who they are anymore"
let’s talk even if we have nothing to say
"they’re not me, i hope you know that"
it’s not easy living in this mind of mine
you’re the only reality that keeps this reality bearable
stop going back to toxic situations just because you have history with them
i’ll be under my blanket all day if you need me
"because once you’ve been in the dark for so long, you learn to appreciate everything that shines"
i’d just like to exist with you
show me how much i mean to you
she’s pretending that nothing hurts and i can see right through her
the constant need of you
why did i even wake up
"i’ll ruin you completely, no ones touch can ever be compared to mine"
your nails on my back and my mouth on your neck
taste the words from my lips
"sometimes everything hurts, and i let it"
you keep wandering my mind like you own the fucking place
you're special if i share my coffee cup with you
love me when i can’t love myself
i'm so tired and i just want to lay my head on your chest and sleep for a few days
"‘trust the overthinker who tells you they love you. they have, most assuredly, thought of every reason not to.’ - LK Pilgrim"
come here and taste this coffee from my lips
excuse me while i slowly drown in your eyes
you really don’t need to explain to anyone why you are the way you are
i want to silence your thoughts and put you at ease
my heart is so fucking big and i hope it doesn’t kill me one day
bro i fucking hate winter
i can never see anyone else the way i see you
she stares at you in the morning when you wake up like you’re the only thing there for her
"when i can’t breathe, i write"
mutual obsession or stay the fuck away
make me not think too much tonight
it’s weird to think that a stranger used to be the person i thought i knew best
a home for you in my chest
i will love you so sweetly you won’t help but love yourself
"because when you care about someone, you’re honest with them about everything no matter what it could be"
"i no longer have the desire to get close to anyone anymore like yeah, i’m good"
"you’re very brave for getting this far, i’m so proud of you for not giving up yet"
of course i always want to make you smile
you get lost for so long that it turns into a comfort zone
i will make flowers grow in the saddest parts of you
the kind of love where your soul feels empty without their presence
"oh, November how much i love you"
last words
i want to wrap my arms around you and go back to sleep
even if you don’t believe in yourself then just trust that i always will
she silences my thoughts
"it's okay, we're going to be okay, everything's going to be okay"
i’m going to plant flowers in your chest and water them with my love everyday
"i know i need to stop thinking about running away to some other life, and start figuring out the one i have but i just can't.."
shut my mind up
i want to play with your hair till you fall asleep then just watch you
smile while you kiss me
"there’s only so much left of me i can deny, until i am no longer me"
conversations with the moon about you
a part of me is always missing when you’re not here
"that’s the thing, i feel too much.  every word, every action, and every thought goes straight to my heart"
"i want to be the one who heals you, that makes your scars feel beautiful"
sometimes love is saying you don’t understand what they’re going through but won’t let them deal with it alone
because sometimes the strongest people in the morning are the people who cried all night
"hey, just because you’ve learned to live with it doesn’t mean it’s okay"
"if words is all you have for me, i don’t want them"
i only want a life that’s not about wanting to escape my life
"it hurts, i know"
i am trying so very hard to keep myself from breaking
i like it when you seduce my mind
"love me, now and always"
when emptiness holds you tighter than a lover
"this could all be gone tomorrow, remember that"
i am comfortable being silent with you
"babe, we’re home"
"if i have you, i have everything"
"i long for a peaceful sleep, the kind where i sleep so well i forget my nightmares are waiting for me, will my screams of agony echo through abandoned memories or will i forget all that was taken from me?"
all the could’ve beens
"take me somewhere i may forget myself, my existence, and the rest of the world"
"if only you knew how hard it was, and how long it took, to rebuild such a state of mind, then you would understand why i’m so picky about who i allow in my life"
"‘almost. it’s a big word for me. i feel it everywhere. almost home. almost happy. almost changed. almost, but not quite. not yet. soon, maybe.’ - Joan Bauer"
you just need someone who understands what you don’t say
i hope one day you wake up next to someone who means everything to you
i just want to be everything for you
i learned the hard way to never set expectations towards anything
"just imagine being chained and thrown into the ocean at the deepest place you can find, you can't breathe and the pressure is adding up as you sink deeper. and the only difference between this scenario and my life is i don't drown but i feel the same and there is no end in sight"
"quietness, stillness, gentleness, tenderness for you, always"
she’s trying to be stronger than what she feels
i want to taste your words in my mouth
the kind of love that even on bad terms you still run to me first
maybe i deserve to feel this way
"you, me and the moon"
"you should see her smile, fuck"
yes i always want to be the reason you look at your phone and smile
do you ever get tired of lying to yourself?
one of the weirdest feeling is when you stop talking to someone and you still have all this left over information and details about them
some people will just never understand what they mean to you
can i always be on your mind?
get off twitter and get on top of me
"yes, you are beautiful, and i will always be captured by your everything. the smiles, those eyes, let me have them. even if i'm hurt, i will write about it, even if it hurts, i would write. for you"
all the ways i would love you in
you meet a stranger and your life changes
we should hold hands while watching the sky
i’m spending tonight thinking about you again
your eyes speak all the poetry my lips try to say
"but when everything falls into pieces, will you be there to pick them up with me?"
i woke up wanting to be held by something other than loneliness
how about coffee and your lips for breakfast?
sometimes i get scared i won’t feel present in the best moments of my life because of this overwhelming sense of numbness that hangs over me
i’ll live in your veins
i don’t want to do today or any other day without you
the softness of her hands and the way she holds my heart
yes i would very much like to spend the day in your arms
"take good care of my heart, will you?"
can i just disappear today and have a peace of mind?
do you feel me thinking of you?
because a day without you feels like something is missing
i want to close my eyes and see you
but what if i want you to ache for my touch
we’re not meant to stay the same
what do i tell the stars about you now?
why do i overthink everything
i’m saving my best words for you
i wonder if you write about me the way i write about you
stop waiting for nothing
i’ve seen the way she looks at the sky with eternity in her eyes
is wanting all of you too much to ask for?
i don’t want your words to be about anyone else but me
the way you said my name and the way it felt in my chest
"the older i got the more i started cherishing my privacy, cultivating my circle and only letting certain people in. yes you can be honest and real but understand that not everyone deserves to be a part of your life"
"and when everyone's against you, i'll be right here beside you"
"never beg for someone’s love, ever"
can i place my head on your chest for emotional support reasons?
i’m so tired of waking up without you next to me
"with a heart this heavy, i still somehow feel"
stop clinging to your mistakes just because you spent so much time making them
you know how to make me want you
fall in love when you’re strong enough to hold your heart’s pieces when left broken
"because as soon as i am obsessed with someone, there’s literally nobody that can get my attention no matter what they do"
i’ve lived long enough to know that nobody really stays
"oh honey, there is nobody else like me"
because i believe in the kind of love that doesn’t demand me to prove my worth or question myself
"so far away from reality, i never want to return"
"that feeling you get when you’re talking but no one is listening, when they look into your eyes but can’t tell that something is missing"
imagine what our lips would do to each other
love me enough to stay
you look at the moon and i’lll look at you
how many times have you faked a smile in order to avoid being asked if you’re okay or not?
the connection feels different when your mindsets are alike
because i became comfortable with being alone a long time ago
open my chest and put yourself inside
"yes, being well mannered is very attractive"
you are not a bad person for having to lose the people you are surrounded by in order to grow into a better version of yourself
"i will never understand how the silence between us aches this terrible, how the absence of you feels like the absence of myself"
"i was never the type to want to fit in anywhere, i’ll sit alone if i have to, i don’t mind"
i only like mornings that include you
be with someone who is as obsessed with you as you are with them
your heart and what it does to mine
"help me understand you, tell me what your thoughts are about"
sometimes i just can't
leaving
turn your pain into words
"when your head hits the pillow tonight, remind yourself that you’ve done well with every obstacle, you are trying your utmost best. be patient with yourself, and remember those big things are achieved not all at once, but one day at a time"
i will hug you and hold you for as long and often as you need me to
you either be real with me or get the fuck out of my face
"come here, let me show you what love feels like"
i can’t wait to see you in my hoodie
why aren’t you here right now
i am too tired to fucking think
stop putting this much effort into someone who can easily go all day without even talking to you
i want her to look at herself and love everything she sees
"only very few people will understand you, and that’s enough"
"breathe, i’m here, and i got you"
"i’ve always wondered if you know how proud i am of you, maybe i don’t tell you enough, or even at all. i assume it’s implied but i know i should make the effort. i am so fucking proud of you"
"it was the moment i realized what you can do to my heart, how you make it hurt and feel so good both at once"
at least my feelings don't lie to me
show me every side of you and i promise to love them all
my words are not about you anymore
i woke up and you were my first thought
"can we just take a break?  can we grab a few things and leave? pick a random road and follow it for hours during midnight. pull over somewhere and just watch the sunrise together, no phones, just music in the background. just anywhere away from reality and anxiety"
"once i leave, i leave for good"
"‘as bad as it was, i learned something about myself... that i could go through something like that, and survive.’ - Nicholas Sparks"
"i can see it in their eyes, how they judge me when they don’t even know  anything they see,  my skin is full of scars, but they don’t think about how long i fought  and tried to be where i am"
"yes, i would love waking up to your face every morning"
"ruin her panties, not her life"
"don’t only give me your love, but also give me your pain and i’ll make it mine so together forever we will remain"
"sharing music with you is like sharing my feelings, i don’t want you to share them with anyone else"
thank you if you've been good to me
i love the ‘i can talk to you about anything and never feel judged’ kind of vibe
pretty hands with a soft heart
when you get the same energy you give &gt;&gt;&gt;
"and no matter how low i keep my expectations, i always end up hopeless and disappointed"
because i either keep it all to myself or say exactly how i feel
everywhere but nowhere at the same time
"let me lay next to you for a little longer. your hands never touch my skin, i slip like sand through your fingers just a moment before the wind arrives and carries you away from me. just a moment where i speak a truth i can’t admit"
people forget that i have nothing to lose
i meant every word i ever said
you can't force anyone to care
because being alone is better than sitting next to someone and feeling lonely
every song is linked to a feeling
"hey, leave the past where it belongs, okay?"
nothing hurts more than being so close to someone and then watch them turn into a stranger again
write about how i made you feel when i looked into your eyes the very first time
the only thing they don’t teach you about love is the heartbreak
how getting to know me feels like
i’m going to kiss every part you hate about yourself till you start loving them
have you ever just watched someone do something like laugh or smile or daydream and you’re like how in the world are you this beautiful?
"because if you push me away, you won’t find me where you last left me. i am kind, and my heart is big, but not big enough to deal with people who decide to love me only when it’s convenient for them"
"just because i tweet it doesn’t mean i’m going through it, i just understand it"
one day someone’s going to enter your life and show you what it feels like to be loved
because once you lose my trust there is no way you’re gaining that back
"i’m just focusing on becoming a better version of me, physically, mentally, and emotionally"
forever can be a pair of arms
"because if you only  look back far enough, you’ll see how much i’ve tried to hold on no matter how hopeless and painful it is to keep breathing"
i can’t be myself around anyone anymore
i overheard someone today saying “you’re always one decision away from changing your life” let that sink in
"it’s okay to live a life others don’t understand, it’s yours not theirs"
"because if i treated you how you treat me, you would fucking hate me"
i’ll rest when i’m dead
"yes, i always spend my nights lying awake in heart wrenching agony, exhaustingly aware of the fact infatuation will never be requited"
2020 is an endless constant scream
"yes, it’s going to hurt. you’re going to scream and pull your hair, you’re going to sleep with tears burning holes in your cheeks praying that you don’t wake up. but you will, you’re always going to wake up, so be glad. it’s going to stop hurting"
give yourself permission to feel something everyday
let go of what you can’t keep
it feels like everything’s fine but everything’s not fine..
have you ever heard a rumor about yourself and just sat there like ‘who the fuck comes up with this dumb shit?’ because same
do you miss me? or do you just miss who you were with me?
a tight hug for your heart
i keep imagining how our lives would be like together
what happens under the stars stays under the stars
come scream at the moon with me
"i’ve had enough pain in my life, more than enough. now i just need some happiness"
that person you think about when you look at the sky
"because if i talk to you about my past, it’s for you to understand why i am like this, not to judge or feel pity for me"
i need the beach and you on my lap right now
"sure everyone deserves help, just not always yours"
"stop waiting for things to get better, simpler, or easier. life will always be fucked up, learn how to cope and stand tall. otherwise you will only run out of time"
i am getting closer to myself
"meanwhile, we could’ve been sitting in Amsterdam getting high and having coffee in Starbucks"
you don’t deserve to be in my thoughts anymore
"i just want to take away all her pain, all the sadness in her heart, and plant flowers instead of emptiness"
tell me all the things you never tell anyone
don’t talk to me until i have my coffee
let's get high as fuck and sit on the rooftop and stare at the stars
you let go because you know they’re better off without you
because knowing yourself helps you understand others
"oh if only what i want, what i need, and what i get could ever be the same"
"believe me, if i’m in love with you, i can promise you wholeheartedly that you will be loved with so much passion and intensity that you’ll forget what life felt like before i came along. maybe i’m not the best at being loved but i like to think i’m pretty good at loving"
eventually every story has an end
"no, that’s not enough to satiate my thirst and want for you. i want to kiss every inch of you, i want to write poems on your skin with my fingertips and place my hands on your thighs and not think about the sadness i will feel on my way home from loving you this much"
"love me for me, with gentle hands &amp; soft words, and i’ll do the same"
"yes i would very much like to hold you in my arms, to feel your softness, your warm skin, and to know how delicate love is to touch"
"one day you’re going to wake up and realize just how very beautiful you are, and that will be the day you stop running after people who don’t see your worth. that will be such a good day"
i know a place where nobody would find us
i wasn’t looking to be lost in someone until i found you
i want to find a way to tell you everything by saying nothing
i still don’t understand why some people waste their time and energy getting hurt by someone when there’s someone else waiting to make them happy but ok
"something so lonely in me reaches for any chance of connection. aches run so deep it feels as if i was born with them. in fact, it's not an ache. it's the absence of an ache i should have if i had anyone to ache for. It's the emptiness that scratches whenever i look too far ahead"
to wake up to your face every morning
"call it a dream, but all i desire is a world where we can all smile freely, just one world where a hug isn't a risk, but the sweetest therapy and warmest comfort. a place to call home in another's embrace. a world where nothing else matters"
"someone who is willing to grow with you, who chooses to love you through the good and bad, old and grey, laughter and sadness; is someone who loves you"
"here’s a reminder that progress is different for everyone, stop making comparisons and just focus on your path"
you get so used to their absence that their presence no longer makes a difference
"oh trust me, you will notice once i stop caring"
"yes, they may not have loved you. but at least they taught you, they made you see things differently, they changed you"
it doesn’t always have to make sense
"stay soft, warm, and gentle"
"some people are just memories, and some are mistakes"
i can’t wait for the day where i get to sleep and wake up with a smile on my face
we could have been watching the moon together now
what do you do when you can’t find the words to describe how you’re feeling?
i don’t know where it hurts anymore
"‘everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are married or own a house; as if life was some kind of grocery list. but nobody ever asks if you are happy.’ - Heath Ledger"
something i wanted to get off my chest
stop saying things you don’t really mean to people you actually care about
"bro, fuck them, focus on you and your goals"
"yes, you will be too much for some people. those aren’t your people"
i know i am fucking insane but i swear my heart is so fucking pure
"i like it more when nobody knows anything about me, and i don’t plan on changing that"
they fuck up then play innocent
and when i’m gone i hope you would still remember how your heart beats and how the butterflies in your stomach felt like when you were with me
even waking up is exhausting
can we just kiss and forget everything?
i want her to wear my favorite shirt and sit on the kitchen counter while i cook her favorite meal and talk about everything
"sometimes it’s just between you, the moon and the stars, and sometimes you’ll find it okay to kiss your own scars till you feel loved"
i find it very difficult not to miss you
"learn how to walk away.  when a connection starts to fade, learn how to let it go. when a person mistreats you, learn how to move on to something or someone better.  but learn how to walk away"
"it’s the little things, like moments when you look into their eyes and feel okay, even if it’s just for a moment because you know that with them you’re safe"
my heart hurts from all this damage that has been happening nonstop
"my heart is with you, Beirut"
"when your days are grey &amp; your heart is broken and empty i’ll be there to color your days and write poems on your lips. when your heart is full of joy &amp; love, i’ll talk to the sky so the stars can smile back at you"
"tomorrow will be better, right?"
caring means you choose to stick around even when everything seems impossible
"don’t test me, i will erase you and all the memories from my mind like you never existed"
you left when i needed you the most then you came back when i don’t need you anymore
"because when i said i’d always be here, i fucking meant it"
i already know how it ends
"i immediately stop trying when i feel unwanted, i will not reach out to you if my feelings are not reciprocated"
"even though i hate myself sometimes, i will still love you"
"and those who are hard to love, need it the most"
will you stay up all night with me?
a mind so full you get lost in there and a heart so void you lose yourself
"although i know my heart will shatter into pieces when you leave, i still choose to spend every possible second with you until we have to say goodbye"
"yes, i want to be the first and last thought that comes to your mind"
"when you actually matter to a person, they’ll make time for you, not give you excuses or lies"
i often think it’s getting better  and then it gets much worse
"if you for a second feel alone in a relationship, just for a second, you’re with the wrong person"
"don’t you ever make someone your priority while allowing yourself to be one of their options, ever"
it's like someone pressed pause to my life and forgot to press play again
they only remember you when they feel lonely
"hey, it’s always okay if your heart needs a little more time to accept what your mind already knows"
i can’t wait to leave all of this behind and never look back at it
i just really need someone to look at me and understand without me having to explain everything
i didn't listen to the voices in my head so now they don't talk anymore. i want to write my thoughts but my mind keeps telling me why i shouldn’t. how is it possible to be a void when there is so much swirling inside me?
"sometimes you just need silence, a break, and a deep breath from your mind"
i have no energy left to deal with negativity
"empty, very empty. that’s the only word. no other word encompasses, as broadly as this term does. you’d rather bitterly ebb into singularity, than suffocate in the chalices of labels. you feel as if you those complex names and classifications, are unfit for someone like you"
"i’ve went through everything alone, so i’m sorry if i act like i don’t need anyone"
i’m just so tired of feeling this way
does the sadness ever leave?
i look at her and i’m like fuck
i apologize for giving you a lot more than what you deserve
sucks to be there for everyone but nobody is there for you
"her touch, delicate, fleeting,  like a whisper  in a foreign tongue, a language that i  have become desperate to learn"
"sometimes i find myself staring at your pictures, i’m always wondering how you’re feeling, if you’re taking care of yourself, and if you are still thinking of me the way i am writing about you right now"
because music has healed me more than anybody ever could
"i’m sad, horny, and tired as fuck"
i don’t even know what to feel anymore
what could have been
i'm high as fuck and all my mind could think about is you
"i don’t say much, but when i do, it’s a fucking disaster"
you don’t see it like i see it
"don’t worry, i’m okay i’m not trying to run away from you, from me,  from anybody who cares about me, i’m not.  i never run, i never give up, i just lay down  let it wash over me let it drown me in my own mind and choke me"
"swallow it up, and move the fuck on"
"don’t trust someone who takes hours to text back and when you’re with them, they always have their phone in their hand"
i’m really good at not letting people love me
can i give you a book where i highlighted everything that reminds me of you?
one of the best things i’ve learned was to stop fighting for someone who is okay with losing me
"because when i love someone, everything they go through affects my mood in some way"
"yes, i know i’m going to get my feelings hurt, but i also know that i’ve spent years so numb that my world has turned into a grey ache that never subsided. so i’ll take my chances and play hungry and fast and get hurt running than be stuck here just watching"
"i don’t want a perfect love, because to love all their flaws and mistakes is to love a person wholely and truly.  i want to feel at ease beside you, and you feel the same with me"
"and the hardest thing i’ve ever done was stand there, speechless, as the world burned around me. my mind raced with intensity like a storm on the ocean, a call for help sat on my tongue, and no tears for mercy came out. it was like a scream so deafening it was silent"
"you’re learning, healing, growing and discovering yourself all at once. give yourself a break and smile, you got this"
i miss you
"as i looked into your eyes i could see how much you were struggling, you don’t look happy even though you’re smiling back at me. our hands touched and i felt how much pain you were in, you kept repressing your emotions just to tell everyone that you’re okay when you weren’t"
she broke down my walls and planted flowers in my chest
i woke up with you on my mind again
i just want to take care of her and keep her safe
"don’t turn me off then expect me to stay interested, that’s really not how it works dear"
i don’t have the energy to keep repeating myself over and over again
you can’t undo what you’ve already done
i hug loneliness back so it doesn’t feel lonely
maybe there's a place for us somewhere
i’m at the point in life where i just literally have no idea what the fuck is going on or how to deal with it anymore
"memories, people, and feelings. they come and go, in no particular order, i remember this, i remember that, i remember her, places, faces, situations; they come and go"
i have too many thoughts about so much things and no words to make them seem tangible
maybe it’s best to just keep everything to myself
"i don’t want anymore temporary people, i want someone who, even when i’m an unloveable mess, moody, and too hard to handle, will look at me with love in their eyes and stay. i don’t want people that only need and want me for something, i’m tired of temporary people"
i don’t ever want you to look at anyone else the same way you look at me
there are too many what ifs on my mind right now
"no, i’m not here to do reality, i’m here to escape it"
"i’m sorry they made you feel like you’re not enough, you won’t feel that way, not with me"
what is wrong with this world..
"so much to do today kill memory, kill pain, turn heart into a stone, and yet prepare to live again - Anna Akhmatova"
whenever i get hurt something inside me just shuts off
watch me bloom with or without you
i just want to put her to sleep and play with her hair
you don’t know how hard it is to get the words out of me
i still taste the past sometimes
"July, i’ve had enough, show me some kindness"
"do you know what’s fucked up?  people coming in and out of your life thinking they could just pretend they haven’t done anything and expect you to treat them like nothing ever happened. but no, fuck you, and fuck off"
"i don’t cry anymore, i bleed on paper"
i often feel like my heart has spilled all over the floor and the more i try to clean it up the messier it gets. it’s like my emotions spill everywhere and get in the way of everyone else
we need more people that look at the stars more often
i'm stealing your heart now
i didn’t know which one to post so here’s all of them
"let’s move somewhere and take endless walks anywhere. we can dance in the streets, pretend it’s just you and me. we’ll buy a bottle of wine and have romantic dates on the rooftop, we can laugh until the sunrise or we can talk about the things we don’t tell anyone. we can be free"
i'm going to need more than just a cup of coffee
"i want you here, now and always"
she’s everything that’s beautiful in this world
"i’ll write you letters, leave you random notes on the kitchen counter, kiss your hands, slow dance to your favorite songs, and lay down with you on the grass while we listen to our favorite songs. because this is how i love"
"how exhausting it is to live a life where every few days i fall down this hole with absolutely no energy to escape and the foreboding arms of sadness reach out to grab me and as usual, i have nowhere to run"
your head on my chest and your eyes on me
"here i sink, in my thoughts it’simmeasurable, it’s immense here i sink, into oblivion beyond the point of no return no longer fixed by sanity no longer aware of my identity i go on, spiraling, sinking, disintegrating"
you’ve got wounds you don’t know how to heal so you try hard not to feel
fuck this fuck him fuck her fuck them fuck it all
stop trying to change someone who simply doesn’t see an issue in their actions
i’ll just write poems to cry to
we can share this cigarette together
because i'm either oversharing everything about my life or being super secretive for no reason
i hope one day i make sense
my mind really needs to shut the fuck up
"yes i know i’m always moody and get sad really easily. but if you choose to love me despite all this, i promise, even if i’m broken, i will still give you my whole heart and all the love i have left in me"
i’m so tired and i want you in my arms
it’s ironic isn’t it? why people feel the need to hide behind layers in order to protect their vulnerability. it isn’t until you share yourself with others that you remember why you hid those pieces from the world to begin with
i’ve seen your worst and stayed
i’ve been carrying everything on my own
"you’ll wish you did me different one day, remember that"
can we stay in bed and get high all day?
you get used to their absence that their presence no longer makes a difference to you
why don’t you just come here and let me take care of you
you’re all my mind thinks about
and maybe loving yourself is hard because you’re finding it difficult to forgive yourself
"have you ever missed someone so much, the bare glimpse of a thought about them hurts more than anything else?"
i hope you know how very special you are to me
do you just want to sit on the rooftop and talk all night? because i do
i just want to hug you and give you all the love that you deserve
"but you fucking know what? that’s ok. not everyone is meant to read books, some are meant to inspire them. and not everyone is meant to stay in your life, but only to take a peek of what it's like"
i need more coffee and your lips all over me
"“you’re too much to handle.” “you’ll never settle.” “let’s not go too far.” “you’re amazing, but your lifestyle is too complicated.” oh how much i've heard these lines. we enjoy life. we end up writing about it but never truly experience it"
"when you live a life that is dangerous, fearless, adventurous, daring and exciting, it’s nearly impossible to find someone who will share that lust for life with you; love will come and go. never stay too long. you’ll get used to hearing “i can’t keep up with you.”"
"the reason why i and many others will never find traditional love is quite simple. we are so used to messiness, uniqueness, flaws, drama, irony and most of all we are used to finding indie strings playing in the desert"
i can't wait to leave all of this behind
my stupid heart doesn’t know when to stop
"no, you don’t fucking know me, now stop acting like you do"
"hey, you are allowed to decide that you want nothing to do with them, literally. you don’t owe anyone a fucking thing, not even an explanation"
my mornings would be a lot better with you here
it was my mistake for thinking you were any different
"bro, imagine how my life would be like if i was in a different country. fuck"
"i’ve lost all interest in this world. i am disappointed and discouraged, i’ve went to a different world and i’m living a different kind of life there. in a world inside myself"
"you don’t have to explain anything, i understand"
"i hate myself for what i am sometimes, that’s why i need you to love me"
"i wasn't kind to you and i wasn't kind to myself, and for that i apologize to you, and me"
what am i even doing here
"she has the strangest soul you will ever get to meet. she speaks but no one hears her, she holds onto the smallest things to make her feel alive again.  she has those tearful eyes that never leave her face and that same feeling of emptiness that never leaves her heart"
but would you come with me when i decide to leave everything behind?
maybe i’m just different
i just need someone who would be all about me as much as i am all about them
"i don’t care who the fuck you are in this world, i will treat you based on how you treat me, it’s that simple"
“what’s yours will find you”
stop trying to find those you’ve lost inside those you meet
loneliness can be too heavy sometimes
i hope i’m always on your mind as much as you’re on mine
lol and i thought 2019 was bad
i don’t look at you the same anymore
"go where you’re wanted, loved, and appreciated. anywhere else is a waste of time"
the world is too fucked up and my heart is too heavy
how long do i have to be patient for?
"the people who left will know how much they lost, trust me"
there will always be things about myself i can’t explain to anyone and there are things i don’t even understand yet
tell me i'm what you need tell me i'm what you want
love is telling them to go back to sleep because it’s late and you know they need it. even if you want them to be awake with you. it’s realizing it won’t always be easy but still choose them everyday and wanting to be the very best for them
"this pandemic is helping us realize that there is a lot we can live without, including certain people"
- don't stop talking - why? - i don't want to stop listening to your voice
i am so mad at the world right now
i just want to give you everything
just come over and nap here
"yes, i want all your words to be about me"
you can really feel your energy being drained when you’re surrounded by the wrong people
"come here, lay your head on my chest and let me play with your hair"
"i know, i miss you terribly"
"sorry, i’m keeping my heart to myself now"
"although the world right now is full of suffering and chaos, it also has you. and that's enough"
how do you heal from what you no longer want to feel?
"i hope you never get tired of me, because i get tired of me all the time"
i’ve built my walls this high for a reason
take me to your heart and leave me there
"sometimes i wish i understood what it’s like to not be constantly confused, torn, unwilling, or unable to make unwavering decisions.  sometimes i wish i knew what it’s like to be free from the burden of complacency"
i’m so tired of all this non-existent bullshit my mind makes up
i almost believed you when you said you'd stay
i know things i really shouldn’t know
"there’s something sharp in my chest, it might be glass but it might also be my heart, it turned into stone from the pressure in my lungs built up over the years, filled up with emotions unable to escape and tears that were not allowed to be shed"
"how about we laugh, cuddle and talk about everything until 3 am"
"no dear, just because you have scars, moles, and stretch marks doesn’t make you flawed. you are perfect and lovable just as you are. stop comparing yourself because the only person that truly matters is you"
tell me when
"people just want to hear what they fucking want to hear, they will ignore everything you say just because it doesn’t make any sense to them"
i want to wipe your lipstick with my lips
"i am really clingy and annoying, distant and loyal, and not easy to get rid of. i am a walking contradiction"
stop pouring your feelings to people who don’t feel the same
"sometimes the only way i can breathe is by taking my mind to another place and time where i can be whoever i want to be, and then my fear and sadness just aren’t with me anymore"
"tell me your story, i want to know everything that made you into who you are today"
we should be alone together
"give them time, let them miss you"
"no, i am not looking for a person, or a feeling or a place. i just want to feel safe in my own head"
i can’t feel anything
"you can’t make everyone think and feel what you do, because you understand them but they don’t understand you"
you wouldn’t understand anyway
emptiness that feels so heavy
"i always feel like i’m drifting, just a body floating through time and space observing everything around me. i sometimes even check to see if i’m breathing correctly.  the world just feels so dry and barren. like nothing and everything is happening at the same time"
"i need the beach, and i need it now"
"tell me, i want to know it all, what keeps you up night and what goes through that pretty mind of yours"
"i don’t know who needs to hear this, but they don’t care and neither should you"
it’s important to understand the difference between communicating and arguing
at this point i just have nothing to say
"i want to run my fingers through your hair, pull you into a tight hug, brush the eyelash from your cheeks and ask you to stay"
it has never been quiet in my head
i hope i’m the first thought that comes to your mind when you wake up
let’s go somewhere where nothing can hurt us
"stop, i can hear your thoughts"
i am always angry at myself
"i know, i like disappearing"
i have too many questions i don't have the answers for
"we don’t talk anymore, and you didn’t seem to care"
"it’s okay, just lay your head on my chest and let me read you something to sleep"
sometimes you just wish you could disappear like you never existed
"i just always want you here, that’s all"
you’re the only good news i wake up to
"i just love direct people, like yes, tell me what you want"
she smiles all the time so that nobody notices how sad and lonely she really is
sometimes it just takes one look and you know exactly what they want to say
late night talks under the moonlight where you tell me all about the memories you have made without me and how i’ve made you reveal the darkest parts of your soul
"you, the sky, and nothing else"
"a lot of people tend to hide how much they miss you or need you or love you and sometimes they’re just too scared or too certain that it’s the wrong thing to say or the wrong timing, but really, it’s not. it never is, tell them, for all we know tomorrow may not even exist anymore"
"i know, i’m tired too"
"there will be times where you can’t seem to face whatever life is throwing at you and when you just can’t pluck up the motivation to do anything. but it’s okay, you need to forgive yourself for the days when everything feels too heavy to hold up"
"no, stop waiting for someone who's not even sure what they want out of you. be with someone who finds something new every day to love about you, even the simplest annoying things"
she’s the type of girl you would want around when you want to be alone
"remain soft, even after all the damage"
"people who are meant to stay in your life will see you change over the years and understand it for what it is; growth. you don't have to explain your reasons, you don't have to apologize, they will understand and hold your hand on the darker days without any questions asked"
"you’re so beautiful, god, look at you"
"fuck it, let’s just get high and watch the apocalypse"
"if at anytime, and i mean ANYTIME you decide to leave my life and walk out that door, please note that there is absolutely no fucking way am i ever opening that door again. it will be shut, and it will stay shut"
"sitting on your bedroom floor, tell me everything that’s bothering you"
distance has a great way of fucking things up
i still remember all the things you’ve said to me
"one day, love. one day i will tell you how i feel, where you and i are together thoughtlessly. where you are not terrified and i was not numb, where things are the way we wished they could be and not the way they are right now"
it still breaks my heart every day that your eyes aren’t the first thing i see when i wake up
"you're my favorite sunrise, you know that?"
i want nothing but to kiss you and sleep next to you right now
"listen to me, it’s not your job to rebuild a bond you didn’t break, okay?"
"in the most subtle ways, we never truly get over our traumas, sometimes we become unkind, even to those who love us. you see, trauma reminds us of something we have already known since birth... that we were brought into this world alone, and we will leave this world alone"
sometimes you run away just to see who will come looking for you
you find out a lot of things about people by what they read
i just want to sit by the ocean with you and hold hands
i can stay if you want me to
"when you find someone who makes you laugh, grow, want, makes you go mad but also makes you happy, keep them. keep them because they are extreamly rare to find now"
"you’re allowed to make mistakes, but don’t you dare fucking hurt me on purpose"
"yes, tell me all about your music and show me all your favorite outfits"
"felt myself today, so i took some selfies"
i don’t see you in my dreams anymore
your thighs would be nice around my neck
do you always sleep just to avoid how you feel?
so when will i actually get to sleep at night?
"April, do your thing"
"bro, my girl can wear anything she wants. i can fight"
do this thing where you love me unconditionally and don't stop
i was never good around people anyways
"i don’t know, but fuck"
i need coffee and your lips in my mouth
tested positive for not giving a fuck
i don’t know who needs to hear this but don’t lose yourself loving someone else
the older i get the more i realize there are things not worth fighting for anymore
i don't know how to feel enough
i want a ‘mentally obsessed with each other but in a healthy way’ kind of relationship
‘everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves’  - C.G Jung
"love me, i’m tired"
let me just lay my head on your lap and forget everything for a while
i need you to be there for me when i need someone
touch me everywhere
"pain is no longer there where it used to be. the only thing pain has left me with is emptiness, and i don't know which hurts more"
"live in private, love in private, be happy in private, take your losses in private, rebuild yourself in private. people don’t need to know your shit, nobody really gives a fuck what you do, trust me"
"no, i don't ever want you to let go of my hands"
do you ever just feel like someone is slowly slipping away from your life and you don’t know what to do about it?
i’m only asking for a clear mind and a happy heart
"hey, stop judging yourself through the eyes of others.  they won’t see all your struggles, all your scars, all the parts that are still healing.  through your own eyes, see your effort in becoming better; explore yourself, nobody knows you better than you"
i hate how much you pop in my head but not in my bed
"just put me to sleep, i’m really tired of all of this"
"people quarantining for a week and already complaining about being home, bitch i’ve been in quarantine my whole life, sit down"
i’d let you read my thoughts but i fear you might get lost for it’s awfully dark in there
"come home, my arms are waiting"
love me today and always
"my emotions have been all over the place lately, i haven’t been feeling happy or sad, i’ve just been kind of existing and i don’t really know how to feel about it"
"her eyes wrote poetry without words, sang songs without music, and all i wanted to do was get closer and listen to the silence that said it all"
bro do you even know how to love her properly?
"you have no idea how much i think about you, do you"
"crying is not a failure, breaking down is not a failure, admitting you have problems is not a failure, relapsing is not a failure, not every aspect of your life going to be happy. that’s a boring story nobody wants to read. you’re going to be okay"
let’s fuck this loneliness away
everything you do makes me smile
"it’s worse, not letting yourself be loved just because you’re too afraid of giving yourself to someone you might lose. take the chance, take the risk, you never know who is dying to make you smile"
i keep too much inside
"sometimes sleep eludes you, when all you need is escape, when you want to quell every thought in your mind by just not being awake. your heart beats too fast &amp; every ticking noice is stress. even though it’s silence that makes you feel like death"
maybe because i’m so drawn to damage i can barely recognize the nice things
can i be the first thought that comes to your mind when you wake up?
she said i am unforgettable and that made me smile
i am tired of waking up everyday feeling this way
"you may have been through hell in your life but i’ve lived there. don’t pretend to know what i’ve gone through, i don’t want your sympathy, i don’t want your pity, i just want to be left alone"
you’re affecting my mood and i don’t like it
tell me you can’t sleep without my arms around your waist
steal me away in your arms and take me to places i couldn’t  dream of
"whatever is meant to be will inevitably be, there are no rules for life. so i’m going to do whatever feels right, and you feel right to me"
"no, you don’t fucking know how it feels like"
i really don’t feel like participating in life for a while
"don't tell me how much you care, just show me"
i put all my loneliness into writing
"and every time i look at you, i find something new and exciting and i fall in love with you all over again"
i heard you like hands
"yes, i will fucking question everything"
crying herself to sleep became her daily routine
"you will get better, and everything you thought would kill you, will be nothing but a memory"
"come lay your head on my chest, i want to feel something again"
"yes, i will sit in silence with you and not say a word when you don’t have the words to describe what you’re feeling"
"‘i am not what happened to me, i am who i choose to become.’ - C.G. Jung"
"people don’t really last in my life, but i honestly hope you do"
i can tell so much about someone by what they choose to see in me
i wonder what you see when you look at me
"i spent my life trying to reach out, i need to feel it, i have to find it.  there’s a girl, kindness and optimism and so open, she says she isn’t, but i can see her heart; it’s on her sleeve. broken, bruised, but my god, it’s still so very beautiful"
"whatever you do, do it with all your fucking heart"
she broke down my walls and i let her
"i’ll stand by your side, even with broken legs and a heavy heart"
i want to wake up to your body next to mine and a cup of coffee by my side
am i everything you want yet?
you’ve touched my heart in ways nobody else could
stop wasting sunsets with people who won’t even make it to sunrise
i hope you never have to feel this way ever again
i’ve forgotten how to write i’ve forgotten how to feel i remember all the nights i have spent trying to heal i’m too tired to write i’m too numb to feel i still hold my pen despite  having nothing to reveal  i still know how to write but i don’t know how to feel
"come here, ruin me"
i really need a good cup of coffee and you on my lap right now
maybe i just don’t want to be found
"let it go, we don’t live there anymore"
"my problem is that i don’t know how to love less, it’s ether i love you all the way or simply not at all"
"because whenever i’m interested in someone, everyone else is dead to me"
the struggle of waking up everyday
"i hope in time you learn that you are able to love yourself, and in that same time you learn that you're worth the world, i hope you understand that when you take steps to retain happiness, you take steps in the places your love resides. smile, you’re stronger than you think"
she asked why i was looking at her like that so i told her i admire art
"sometimes i can’t choose what i love about you the most; your eyes are like books that tell stories i could never imagine, your heart beats like the gentlest of songs my ears could ever hear, and your lips lift like the softest poems i could never recite"
"goddamnit woman, what are you doing to my heart"
"and when i stopped loving you, i started loving myself"
my mind is exhausted from thinking
i want to make her feel alive again
lock your legs around my face
she’s a flower disguised as a woman
"trust me, you will never find me in anybody else"
let’s get lost here
"you feel it too, don’t you"
"hold those who are there when your soul feels heavy, the ones who put aside their problems &amp; issues for even a brief moment to check in on you and try to make you feel lighter. hold those who resist from weighing you down but instead holds your hands in silence and doesn’t let go"
fill my mouth with you and coffee
"yes, you can hide your face in my chest anytime you want"
"you deserve roses, kisses, a good cup of coffee and good thoughts every morning"
be with someone who understands how important your mental health is.  there are people who will make you feel terrible for things you can’t or don’t know how to control yet and they just don’t care
you weren’t certain about me until i left
i like staring at your lips while you talk
"you’re smiling but you want to cry, you’re talking but you want to be quiet you’re pretending to be happy when you aren’t"
"be honest, and keep it real with me, i don’t ask for much"
i know things take time but what the fuck
"all she wants is a good book, loyalty, laughter and sunsets"
"you know that feeling when you lay in bed listening to music while tears fall down your face because you can’t stop thinking about how you seem to feel numb all the time? and you’re thinking, fuck; this is just how it is now. a lonely suffocating silence"
"alone always felt like an actual place to me, a place i could go to, hide in, be myself"
"i still choose to heal every single day, even though sometimes it’s such a tough decision to make, it is okay to struggle"
a cry for help lost in a smile
i just need someone who doesn’t make me question my decisions
"people don’t have to see the sunlight in your heart for them to fall in love with you. but perhaps bring them coffee, kiss their forehead, and give them tight hugs. you can’t force anyone to have feelings for you but you can treat them with kindness"
to see the world with you
i genuinely hope nobody makes you feel like you’re not worthy of love
"remember to be gentle with yourself, take some time to go outside and smile at the sky"
"sleep was never my escape, you were"
"i sincerely appreciate empathy, i appreciate it when someone checks up on me just to see how i feel, when someone listens to what i have to say without having to criticize &amp; judge me.  i appreciate it when someone goes out of their way to make me smile. i appreciate you"
go where your silence is understood
paying attention to the details is really the only love language that matters
my mind is such a miserable place
don’t be with someone who acts so reckless towards your feelings
i guess it’s okay to be lost sometimes
i just want to hold you while you rest your head on top of mine
perhaps one day we will be enough for someone
can i have your heart all to myself?
but will you be by my side when everyone else is against me?
every goodbye teaches you something
my hands are aching to be on your skin
"carry on, love, carry on.  don’t stop now, or ever"
"no matter how much i want to take a person’s attention, to take their love, care, and finally their heart. be it in love or friendship. all i can do is reach out to give to another but what i would always wish to receive"
"there’s heartache in wanting something and knowing i can’t take it, because it’s not something to take, it doesn’t belong to me. and no matter how much it hurts in that moment, i have no right to take that which is not my own;"
"sometimes i can’t seem to find the energy to get out of bed or have a conversation, nobody notices the way i feel. i need silence. i need a break.  i don’t know how much longer it will be until i fall off the edge"
friends who defend your name when you’re not around are friends you want to keep
"it’s quite scary, overwhelming, really.  you fall in love with someone because of who they are, but you also fall out of love for the same reason"
"things have seemed off recently, and i don’t know why. i don’t feel the same way i did last week or last month or last year. i can’t explain the way i feel because everything just feels a little odd. everyday is a struggle to finish even if it’s just a normal routine"
nothing scares her more than the feeling of being unloveable and spending her entire life waiting for someone to love her the way she deserves
eye contact gets more intense when it ends up smiling at each other
"accept the fact that you will grow apart from people who meant everything to you, understand that when someone no longer positively affects your life, let them go. stop hindering your growth"
"don’t worry, i’ll hold your hand the whole way through"
don’t we already die a little every day?
how many times do i need to break till i no longer exist?
"i need long hugs, night walks and late night coffee"
i did not ask for this life
"maybe there are more lifetimes for us to live, more chances to have, more wishes we could make, and more love we could give. but whenever it is, whatever life i choose, i always want you to be in mine"
"i absolutely hate it when people try to ruin my illusion of the world. if i want to believe that i can live my life writing poetry, travelling, taking pictures and falling in love then fucking let me"
i still get excited when i see you as if it’s the first time meeting
if only it was easy to say what i’m thinking
"it’s okay to not always know what to say, sometimes you get so caught up in your own head that forming a sentence can get quite exhausting"
"if you have the chance to make it right, make it right"
i’m the kind of person who waits for you to tie your shoes while everyone else keeps going
"with you by my side, i have everything"
"i want to love myself more this year. i want to clean the mess inside my head,  i want to breathe without hesitation or sighing, i want to stop creating scenarios about what could go wrong but rather think of all the possibilities of what could go right"
all she wanted was to feel like you saw a future with her
"i have said too much, shared too much, cared too much, and now i want my energy back. i no longer want to get close to anyone"
i disappear so i could find myself again
but you can share everything and anything with me
no one will ever see what i see in you
"i’ll love you when you’re sad, i’ll love you when you feel like the world is against you, i’ll love you when you feel like nothing is worth it anymore, i’ll love you when you feel like you are unlovable  i’ll love you even when i don’t love me"
"January, here we go again"
don’t spend another year repeating the same shit
look at the moon with me
before this year ends
you will never find a heart like mine
"when someone wants you, nothing can keep them away, but if they don’t want you then nothing can make them stay"
"oh, you know nothing"
when you feel so utterly alone and nobody’s company makes you feel less alone and you just want to bury yourself in bed and not do anything
"you used to be her world, but now she got her own"
"forgive me, i am not very good at interacting with people"
my mind takes me to places i really don’t want to be at
"if you leave, then leave. but please, if you do leave, don’t come back, just stay gone"
i look at her eyes and i forget everything
"i become too sensitive when i’m attached to someone, i will detect the slightest change in their tone and wonder all day what went wrong"
"no, you’re not hard to love nor are you easy to leave"
don’t miss out on a good person that can make your life better just because they’re difficult
she deserves endless happiness
"i mean, honestly, who would love such a wreckage like me"
you’re the only thing that feels right
"‘being alone never felt right. sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right’ - Charles Bukowski"
"if you have to tell them to love you, then they don’t love you, at least not in the way that you deserve to be loved"
she was pointing at the stars while i was looking at her eyes
there will come a time where talking about it doesn’t make you feel better anymore. a time where you just live with your mouth closed and your walls up and your heart hidden; that’s when i want you to know that i will hold you in silence until nothing hurts anymore
how people react to your sadness says a lot about how long they’re going to be in your life
there are words i should have never left unsaid
"my hobbies include staying home a lot, listen to music and think too much"
i only ever knew i had a heart when i felt it breaking
"you have no idea what you’re getting yourself into, do you"
sometimes i wake up and nothing makes sense
i like noticing all the details that nobody else sees
because the smallest things take up all the room in my heart
rest your head on my shoulders and forget everything that hurts
how do you fight what’s killing you inside?
"i love how her eyes spark when we talk or when she tells me something she wants me to know, the way she looks at me as if there’s only me, as if she can see right through me, the one i don’t even see myself"
i would much rather be alone than accept anything less than a fairytale
"don’t let silence get between us, talk to me, tell me everything, i care, my god do i care more than you will ever know"
i see the way you look at me and i don’t ever want you to stop
"you’re a piece of art not everyone will acknowledge, but the ones who do will never want to look at anything else"
"i’m not going to get enough of you, am i"
"i don’t want you to be just a dream, i want you to be my reality"
please don’t ask how i am because i honestly don’t know the answer to that
i just want to be the person you can’t get enough of
let me make you love everything you hate about yourself
"don’t you get it? don’t you understand? more than anything, i wanted the pain to stop. but how do i tell you when i don’t know where the hurt comes from?  i only know that it hurts"
"you don't know what goes on inside,  and i don't know how to explain it"
"hold my heart for me, i’m tired"
do they know that your words are about me?
"take me somewhere quiet, and love me there"
"oh how reckless, we risk our hearts when we forget how hard they are to fix"
i like the idea of my fingers in your mouth
if i’m childish around you that means i’m comfortable around you
i have so much of me i still want to show you
if you love them you’ll be completely honest about everything no matter what
i want to hug you until my shirt smells like you
i don't dream anymore but you're the first thing my heart aches for when i wake up
sometimes my words don’t make sense
the only two things i want to see is your smile and the way you look at me
"don't, i'll ruin you"
i have no energy left to deal with anyone
she goes through the day smiling at people and talking as if everything is okay while she’s carrying the weight of the world inside her
"this year is almost finished. not all your friends and family made it, be nice to people, be thankful for today because it could all change in a blink of an eye. make someone smile and don’t take anyone for granted"
but i always want to wake up to your face
sometimes you’re just so angry with yourself because you’re you
you're going to regret it and i'm going to forget you ever existed
"fuck it, i’ve had enough of being inside my mind. making a secret out of myself and what i can or can’t do, i feel like it’s finally time for my mind to fly after all this time trapped in misery. it has come to my attention that this is where i stand up"
i miss the feeling of being home
let’s go see the stars together
"come here, let me play with your hair while i read to you"
she’s the only one who saw the sadness in my smile
i really don’t want to exist for a while
hold my hands when everything feels heavy
"fall in love with your life, tell people how you feel about them, smile at random strangers, do everything you’re scared of. fuck it, because so many of us die and nobody remembers anything we did. take your life and make it a story worth telling, don’t waste that shit"
it feels better when you have someone who wants you as much as you want them and proves it everyday
"but bro, she’s the whole goddamn poem"
hi
want to come over and disappear together?
i hope you never have to see me the way i see myself
"i know i need to try harder, but you have no idea how hard it is trying to care when you have no motivation to do anything anymore"
you know it’s bad when you start questioning who you are
"don’t apologize for being sad, you’re allowed to feel everything, it’s not a weakness"
"i could write and write and write till my heart runs out of ink, but it would never be enough to portray the way i think, or what my heart proclaims when it hears your name"
but what if one day you notice all my flaws and don’t look at me the same way as you do today?
"the worst part is not the feeling of loneliness or the darkness that fills you despite the looming pain of emptiness, the worst part is the realization that you have completely lost yourself"
"it’s okay, you can tell me what you don’t tell anyone"
it takes an enormous amount of courage to remain soft and kind after being torn apart several times. build that courage.  be soft. be kind. be the example
i want my bed to always smell like you
"hey, focus on yourself. please.  don’t do everything for them, do things for you, don’t wait around waiting for them, live for yourself, do your own things; have your own likes and for gods sake, love yourself"
"maybe, maybe i’m just tired of all the giving and  never having anything to take, and maybe for once i’d like to be the  one that someone writes love poems about"
my hands and your neck and all the poetry
fast replies are sexy
my days are full of thinking about you
some people just won’t care and you will have to be okay with that
i’m always stuck between trying to live my life and trying to run away from it
maybe if i stare at the stars long enough i could become one of them
"dear self; i’m sorry you had to shrink into hatred, i’m sorry you had to bleed yourself dry and nobody cared, i’m sorry i didn’t take good care of you, i’m sorry that i too, am not sure how to fully love you just yet"
"if i have you, i have everything"
i read something today that said ‘those who overthink are also those who overlove’ and i felt that
i've been keeping everything to myself lately
i miss waking up being excited about something
"sometimes you just need to be alone for a while, till you feel yourself again"
"love her, love her the way you loved her the first time she held your hands. the first time you heard “i love you” come from her mouth, love her so when she doesn’t love herself she knows you do"
sometimes silence is all i have
i started a new chapter in my book about love and it’s going to break my heart writing it
"you will never find a love like mine, no matter where you look and no matter who you meet, you have my word"
can i make you fall in love with yourself all over again?
"call me in the middle of the night,  tell me what you’re thinking about"
i’m still learning how to slowly love myself
"i’m here with too many thoughts, i want to express myself but i always feel short on time, i’m here though.  thinking, but i’m also here smoking, i don’t know if i’m sinking or slowly reaching the top, maybe i’m swimming upwards; but with a chain to my ankle"
i want you here now and always
"distance is a killer. that’s it, that’s the tweet"
you’re going to hurt yourself loving me
"if you could read my thoughts, would you still love me or would you feel different about me? i just wonder, would you smile on your way to see me or would you avert your lying eyes? would you hold me on nights i cry or would you stand idly by?"
"come here, let me show you how you should be loved"
i’d lick the blood from your lips after biting them
i’m only soft for you
and you know what the worst part about anything destructive is? you get so close with your addictions &amp; illnesses that letting them go feels like killing the part of yourself that taught you how to survive all of this
"you’re not going to give up today, are you? no, you’re going to push through it"
"i don’t put anymore expectations, i just go with the flow and whatever happens, happens"
i want to take her away from this world and keep her all to myself
don’t get mad when i treat you the same way you treat me
i woke up wanting your hair on my face and your smell all over my bed
"something about you intrigues me. but i don’t want to learn too much too quickly, fall too hard too fast. i’ve made this mistake of recklessness before, i don’t want to posses you, i don’t want anything from you except to know you, to know all the parts you want to keep hidden"
i’m here to make you feel something
can i smell your hair?
"you don’t get it, and maybe you never will"
"sometimes i can’t feel anything, sometimes i just feel empty"
"let me tell you a secret, i’ve never loved myself fully. my heart is heavy with self loathing  but i’ve always been a fighter. most would run for cover  if they had the fortuity to live in my skin. but today, i refuse to be conquered and tomorrow i will love myself despite myself"
i had to learn to make a home for myself in places i didn’t belong
"i miss you today, just like i did yesterday, and just like i will tomorrow"
how?
you will never know loneliness until you stay up every night thinking about things you should never think of and you can’t tell anyone because you don’t even know where to begin or how
i’m too complicated to be loved
i’d wake up in the middle of the night just to kiss you
"when you love someone, don’t make them your only source of happiness. they are not your sun, your plane ticket or glue, put together your own fucking broken pieces. you begin this life by yourself, and you will leave it that way"
i don’t think i’ll ever get over how your whole face lights up when you laugh
"despite having my own heaviness to carry, i would still give you my hands and lift up yours too"
"November, don’t disappoint me"
"October, you can go fuck yourself. sincerely, Rahm"
we can disappear together if you’d like
"remember when you thought you wouldn’t survive? you did, and now you can do it again"
sometimes i wish there was a stairway to the moon just so i could carry you up there
can i make your arms the place i call home?
i want to be the one who picks you up when you’re down and laughs along when you’re at your highest
give me a love where we acknowledge our flaws and still love each other for who we are
"let me kiss the tips  of your fingers and  the corner of your mouth,  for i have never met a  lovelier pair of eyes"
"hey, being nice and kind isn’t flirting, okay?"
"be the kiss on my forehead that no one sees, the fingers that brush your hair in the quietest moments, and the breath on  your neck that stops time"
i don’t let anyone in because i’ve got too much to protect
i’m just so very tired
i've gotten too many scars this year
"what else, October. tell me, what else do you want from me"
"but really though, from the bottom of my heart, i hope 2020 is a better mental health year for everyone"
"i like it when you say my name, when i’m angry or silly or just in casual conversations. but most of all, when you’re in my arms and you gently whisper it mid kiss. it chills down my back and puts a pause to my thoughts and i don’t want anyone else to say it"
"i just need a few more chapters, then i'm done"
"tell me, how does it feel to be away from yourself?"
"sometimes everything doesn't make sense, but then there's you"
"whatever comes next, i want you with me"
"i know the chaos has been too long and tiring, but here you are, still here. you’re brave for not giving up even when it seemed to be the easiest choice, you’re strong for standing up again. you will see it one day. but today, just allow yourself to love again"
i hope your neck misses how my lips felt on them
"i honestly couldn’t care less about losing anybody who doesn’t want to be part of my life anymore, i’ve already lost people who meant the world to me and i’m still doing just fine"
"come here, let me read to you with your head on my lap and my fingers in your hair till you fall asleep"
"yes love, if i tell you i want you, that means your demons can come too"
"here’s to all the empaths out there, i see you. people that can’t express their thoughts with words, people who feel the stress of others, people who understand others without knowing them. you’re not alone, it’s not bad to be sensitive. i’m here"
words are useless sometimes
there will come a time when all you want to do is to pick up your heavy heart and disappear. because things change and people grow apart and all the love you thought you had isn’t enough to make you want to stay
this year is such a fucking disappointment
"i want you to feel something whenever you hear my name anywhere, and smile"
"if someone REALLY wants to be a part of your life, then they will REALLY do anything to be in it"
"i'm hungry, open your legs"
"i hope today your coffee tastes like magic, i hope your playlist makes you dance, i hope strangers make you smile, and i hope the night sky touches your soul with a little bit of rain to wash away everything that hurts, i hope you know it’s going to be okay"
you’re not the people that have hurt you
"you wouldn't understand how hard it is to be myself sometimes, to accept myself"
"i want to do so many different things, or perhaps nothing at all. just stay where i am, in my room, and absorb every hour, every day, and be alone; and read and think and write and wait.. and wait"
"i notice, i notice everything"
"one day you’re going to look back at this time of your life and you’re going to realize all this sadness and grief were only the beginning of it. your life is changing, and so are you"
"i’m the sadness i’ve spent all my life trying to escape from, and there’s nowhere left to run"
her eyes were full of sadness when she spoke about you
sometimes i wake up feeling like i left a part of me inside a dream
how do some people date like 6 people in a year? like it takes me a fucking year to find someone i even like
the spark in your eyes could light up an entire room or set my heart on fire
i'm still getting used to the fact that people won't always be there for you
"i'm not telling you the wait is easy,  i'm telling you it's going to be worth it"
i’m tired of doing life without you next to me
i want you. it’s just that simple and that complicated
every morning i have my coffee in a quiet corner of my mind
i want my lips on every inch of your body
"when you don’t know what to say, i want you to tell me everything"
soon you will be in my arms and none of this will matter
tell me to stay
whatever you don’t say is what you cant stop hearing inside of you
"""she says my name and i like how that sounds"""
"come here now, i want to talk about nothing with someone that means something"
i’m sure my hoodie would look so much better on you
i’m two completely different people when i care and when i don’t
"i’m like that, i try my best to see the good parts of people, what they can provide to the world, to search for what makes them unique and outstanding. i give all my love and patience to the world. does this make me fucking weak? because sometimes it just feels too much"
"it’s hard to keep anyone near me, it’s difficult to let someone in"
because i would love mornings more if i got to wake up next to you
"fuck, i woke up again"
"i am desperate to feel something other than emptiness. i am desperate to step outside of myself for a moment, i dread being seen by the world, yet so many eyes surround me; it is inescapable"
your face was the prettiest poem i've read
"there is still so much you don't know. so much about me that might scare you away, so much chaos that could negatively effect you. what if i turn out to be exactly what you want? what then?"
what if the storm doesn't pass this time?
but i can ruin your life if i wanted to
i want her in my mouth
i lose interest faster than you expect
one day my heart is going to bloom again and you won’t be the reason
seeing her happy is enough
"sometimes all i want to do is lay under the stars and try to connect the dots, at least the ones i can. to make a meaning out of anything; a difference, but there are none"
"i have lost sense of my body, i’m only aware of and cornered by my heartache. i cannot explain the many depths of grief that i have drowned in, i am scarcely able to gather my thoughts. nothing can penetrate my despair, not even love or faith or a glimpse of light"
maybe the moon feels less lonely when we look at it
"here, take my heart, have it all to yourself"
"i want you in my arms, always"
"no, i don’t hate you, you’ve helped me realize that i deserve so much more"
maybe i want to spend the rest of my sunrises and sunsets with you
"yes, i promise to keep my hands in your hair till you fall asleep"
"the heart knows what it knows, and it feels what it feels"
her smell on my clothes
"if i don’t make a difference in your life, then you don’t need me in your life"
"it scares me how i would let myself go for certain people, and yet, i don’t know if they would do the same"
yes i want to be the reason you stay up at night for hours thinking about me
oh how much things this year has taught me
i woke up thinking about you again
"i know, sometimes talking doesn’t change things, but sometimes it’s necessary, to tell someone, to escape those feelings, to escape yourself"
can we go on the rooftop and get high and watch the moon together?
"anyways, come here, i miss you"
"oh trust me, i pay attention to things you wouldn't even think i'm paying attention to"
i just hate how my instincts always turn out to be right
"and when you feel lost, out of place not knowing where to go, you will find me, you will know how and where to find me. and i hope you don't hesitate to come closer and let me hold you"
they care when it's too late
"yes love, i keep things to myself in order for me not to hurt anyone else"
your lips is the only thing i want to get addicted to
"i’m so thankful for the people i currently have in my life, i couldn’t ask for more, so this one is for you. thank you, and i just want you to know how much you mean to me and that you have such a special place in my heart, you’re amazing"
i need you to come put me to sleep and make me forget about everything that hurts
"you will love again, and you will heal"
"everything hurts, just hold me and don't let go"
"not a good start, October, not a fucking good start"
how do you want me to explain to you that i get sad for no reason? that i just wake up in the middle of the night not being able to go back to sleep because i just can’t get my head straight?
i think my hands would look prettier around your neck
it’s sad how sometimes the people who are far away from you can make you feel better than those who are right next to you
"October, you know what to do"
skinny girls with long hair will be the end of me
"i don’t want to think, i just want to sleep"
"i’m sorry love, but i tend to keep everything to myself because it’s extreamly difficult to find someone who understands"
it’s been a long time since i’ve felt anything at all
i miss you and i want your head on my lap and my fingers in your hair
what am i going to do with you
"maybe i'm wrong, maybe i'm always wrong.  but let me fall anyways, let me fail and break into pieces, let me learn from my mistakes, let me acknowledge the truth, even if it hurts. but watch me raise back up and fight again"
why are you still there and not here?
"you won’t change what has happened already, stop wasting your time thinking about it and just let it go, move on"
you never really realize how fast you can fall apart until you do
you said you were fine but we both knew that was a lie
"no, don’t go, come back and look at me a little bit more"
deep conversations and a bottle of wine
"look, it’s okay, feeling a little pain now is a good thing, it’s how you know you still care. it’s how you know there is still something out there worth being hurt for"
can i be the reason you smile when you have nothing to smile about?
"what else, i wonder"
maybe we’ll just keep wishing
"she’s beautiful, everything about her is beautiful"
"come here and love me, but don’t stop"
i’m tired and i’m exhausted and i just need to be taken care of
"find someone who knows your favorite songs and asks you why they mean so much to you, someone who asks how you like your coffee, someone who sits in silence with you and not get bored, and when you finally find that someone, hold on to them, god, don’t even think twice"
i just need to sleep for a decade or two
i know things
i’m slowly trying to accept the fact that love is extreamly rare and it probably won’t ever happen the way i want it to and that slowly kills a part of me
"i don’t know, something just doesn’t feel right"
you reach the point where you just feel like you’re not as important as they are to you and it just fucks you up
i can replay it all in my head all over again and again and again
i want to be the reason you want to wake up everyday
"yes, you might still be broken but i somehow still saw the beauty in you"
"yes, you are allowed to recreate yourself, you are allowed to reinvent your character, you are allowed to change your goals, your values and your vision towards anything. never apologize for not being the same"
"when i was younger i was told to be polite,  now i’m told to speak my mind i was told to be humble, now i’m told to be confident i was told to not be complicated, now i’m told to communicate i was told to be mature, but now i’m told to live a little  it’s never enough, is it?"
"you can have all of me, but don’t leave me with nothing"
"they can’t be the poison and the antidote at the same time, dear"
make her feel good about herself
pick the one who looks at you like you’re the best thing that has ever happened to them
come count the stars with me
"yeah, losing someone hurts.  but losing yourself for someone hurts even deeper"
"hey, you have survived every difficult day until this point in your life, you have survived every hardship you thought was hindering you, you have healed every heartbreak even when you think you weren’t healing, and you turned your losses into lessons. smile, you got this"
"well hello there, i’ve missed you too"
"i’ll be gone, but my words will live on"
"i don't expect you to understand, i don't expect anything from anyone, anymore"
i can’t wait till i meet someone who makes me feel the way music does
"Love, by Gaspar Noe"
let’s leave and not return
"she’s dangerous, she knows a lot"
missing you is the hardest thing i get to deal with everyday
i don’t want to be here either
"she just wants someone to hold her hand, caress her neck and tell her that everything’s going to be okay"
"better days will come. but for now, breathe"
"i want to hear all the secrets you keep hidden from the world, i want to talk about your childhood memories that pulls tears out of your eyes, i want to explore every inch of you, i want you, every part of you"
"you deserve to be loved,  you deserve to have someone  who notices the emptiness  in the air when you’re not around"
"i hide this side because there’s so much more to me than what you see, and i’m not sure you would like the rest. i know that because sometimes i don’t like the rest"
"i hate waiting, but if it’s you i’m waiting for then i’ll wait"
i spoke to the moon about you
how will i heal if i don’t write about it?
enough people for a while
"i just want to get lost in a world made of books, coffee, and you, lots of you"
"i don’t care what you say, kindness makes you the most beautiful person in the world, no matter what you look like"
i didn’t want to stop looking at you
"because when you fall for someone’s personality, everything else about them becomes beautiful"
what do you do when you wake up with a heart this heavy
"be with someone when you’re ready, not when you’re lonely"
"the truth hurts, but so does everything else"
"no, i don’t want to text you, and i don’t want to call you either. i want you to be in my arms,  holding your hand,  feeling your breath on my neck,  hearing your heart beat against my chest, you know, i just want to be with you"
just slap her ass and tell her how pretty she is bro
"who knows, who knows what happens next"
i want you to fill your mouth with my name
remember that hurting others will not heal your pain
wait for that someone who will be brave enough to enter your storm and respects you enough to love the size of every wave.  someone who is eager to set sail on the expanse of your mind. someone who can’t escape the love they have for you
"stop carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders alone, i’m here now"
"i’d love to wait for the right person and the right time, but if we wait, we wait for entire lives. i’d rather risk being hated for who i am in a couple months than loved for years for who i’m not"
take this cigarette out of my mouth and kiss me
"what are my mood swings like? some days we’ll talk the entire night. some days, i’m just blocked.  some days i just need you here. and other days it’s just ‘goodmorning’ and ‘goodnight’ texts"
why don’t you come here and ruin me?
"being able to touch her, without actually touching her, really touches her"
i miss waking up excited about life
"it must be nice, to be loved so surely without any sense of doubt or hesitation"
"you're not going to leave my mind anytime soon, are you"
"incase nobody has told you today, you’re beautiful and you’re the kind of soul anybody would be lucky to have"
look at what you've done now
i woke up empty again
"i’m not going to break your heart, i’m going to break down your walls and plant a garden inside you and watch it bloom"
i hate this mood where i have no reason to be annoyed but i just am and everything pisses me off
"and out of all the poems in the world, you would be my favorite"
i am many things all at once
today i want you to forget how you feel and remember what you deserve
"come here, let me rest my head on your lap and fall asleep into eternity"
"i'm sorry if i sometimes pretend that i don't care, i care more than anyone else ever will"
"don't share our songs, i don't want them to know parts of us, parts i hide away from everyone else, parts only you saw and heard"
where do i go when sleep doesn’t want me?
"rest now, love. tomorrow is a new beginning"
there’s nothing more beautiful than seeing you happy
"if i delete our conversation, you're basically dead to me"
can i take you away from everyone and keep you all to myself?
"i have too many thoughts inside my head that i want to say but i’m not sure where to begin or how to say them, so i just keep them bottled inside and hope one day they don’t spill out and create a holocaust"
can i apologize in advance for everything i will do to you?
"i’m too much, but love me anyways"
"it’s what i do best, ruin everything"
"i want to kiss the hell out of you, literally"
"there are days when i get tired of life and i just want to be held tightly, to be at peace, to let go of all my thoughts, to be with you"
i stayed quiet even when it hurt
"no, i am enough. i am enough and it’s not my fault that you don’t see it, but i am fucking enough"
"i just want something i can’t replace.  something i don’t have to chase, something that will find me wherever i go because it’s real"
and less of everything else
"silence is sometimes madness, too"
i just want rainy days with a cup of coffee
"what can i say, i spend too much time inside my head"
"take it easy on me, September"
"let us do nothing, not a single thing at all, but sit here in silence, together"
"thinking about you isn’t even optional anymore. you’re on my mind while i make my coffee, while i make my favorite sandwich, while reading, while cuddled up in bed with my cat, you’re on my mind all the time.  what kind of habit is this?"
it’s completely fine to say ‘this isn’t making me happy’ and walk away
i just need my mind to shut the fuck up
"i don’t care about your appearance, i care about what you say, how you say it, words touch my heart, not how you look"
"we’ve all been there love, scared because we don’t know what’s waiting, asking what if it gets worse, afraid to lose what we have. but then we’ll only know when we visit places we’ve never seen, we’ve got so much to learn, so much to grow, don’t lose hope now, we’ll get through"
"you’re disrespecting yourself every time you say yes to something you want to say no to, you might call it loyalty, love, friendship but really you’re just hoping someone could see how amazing you are and choose you"
i hope i don’t become just another memory you look back on
"you don’t realize how much i’m going to love you, do you"
i lose interest when i don't get the same attention i give
"they’re out there, i promise they exist, somewhere.  someone who wants to know every happy memory, every painful thought, and every crazy story.  someone who’s going to love you so much to the point that you forget what it was like to feel empty"
"i love it when i click with someone and we talk all day, everyday. with no forced conversations, no fake smiling and no forced attention, it’s rare as fuck though"
sext:
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide and sit in silence waiting for a sign
5 am selfies
"i take promises very seriously, so please reconsider your promises and take your time thinking because once it’s broken, it’s very hard to believe anything you say afterwards"
how many times have you forgave them just because you didn’t want to lose them?
"don’t tell her she wasn’t good enough, those words will haunt her,  don’t cause her to spend every night questioning what she could’ve done, she doesn’t deserve that.  and don’t diminish her worth just because you no longer know how to love her"
"you’re going to make it.  it will be hard, but you’re going to make it"
"well if you’re going to break my heart, at least do it gently"
"no, you’re not a bad person for the ways you tried killing your sadness"
"are we still looking at the same moon, love?"
"do you ever just get turned off by how people think? like yeah, you’re a no for me"
"it’s weird, when i think about this exact same time last year, how things were so much different. i never would have thought a year could change a person this much, i wonder what next August will be like"
promise me you won't belong to anybody else but me
sleeping would be easier with you here
"in a room full of people, i’ll still only see you"
"i hope you miss me when a song i told you about comes on, not because i want you to be in pain, but because i hope you realize i was everything"
i love how small my circle currently is
let me just lay my head on your lap and watch the sunrise
her silence is so loud i could almost hear her screams
"yes, i have feelings, yes, they make me insane"
show me all the parts you hate about yourself and let me kiss them
please don’t forget the good things about me
"i’m not easy to love, i have standards because i know what i want, what i deserve, and what i can offer; i’m not perfect and i don’t expect you to be either but i do know my worth"
i look at you and i would rather look at you than all the paintings in this world
"sorry, i only know how to ruin everything"
i think about your hands a lot
"if i ever decide it was time to give up on you, understand how much time and introspection that took out of me. when the rest of the world doesn’t want you, i will.  understand that it took EVERYTHING i had left inside of me to leave"
"i want so much more than just a physical connection, i want words and depth. who you are and where you come from, your dreams and nightmares, your fears and desires in life, i yearn to know every inch of you"
i’m losing interest in everything again
"i’ve never been good at talking about myself or how i feel, but hand me a pen and a paper and the words will only stop once the ink runs out"
my mess would be too much for you anyways
"i was afraid you wouldn’t love me for this or that, that i forgot how to love myself for this or that"
you should see how beautiful you are when you talk about the things you love
but does he write about you like i do?
"keep me in your heart, always"
i’m constantly stuck between “i don’t want to feel this pain again” but “i want to feel that type of love again”
"don’t you dare force anything to happen, ever. let every piece fall into its place, don’t try to rush anything, if it’s meant to be, it’ll happen. let things happen naturally, you will notice how much happier you become when they happen unexpectedly"
making someone a cup of coffee as a love language
"can’t sleep, so i took some selfies instead"
"i’m an overthinker and i hate it, i make a big deal out of the smallest things, create problems, get angry at people for it, and it just makes everything worse than it actually is"
wake me up when it’s October
"look at you, all beautiful and shit"
remind me why i’m here again
"stay with me tonight,  and every night"
"i’m a “look how pretty the sky is”, “look at the sunset”, “look at the moon”,  let’s stay in the car and just listen to music type of person"
"because when i’m attracted to someone, i get attracted to their details, their kindness, their eyes, the fact that they can get me to laugh and smile when i need it the most"
you should read what i hesitate to write
"please, just hold my hands and don’t let go"
she wants someone to love her and hold her like there’s no one else that they would ever want
bro how the fuck do people wake up and start talking? like i need to have my coffee first and just sit in silence for at least an hour before i start communicating
how long will we keep wasting our time on people who don’t even care about us?
emptiness
"you don’t see me the way i am, you can’t understand what i’ve been through and i know there’s so much to explain but how can i show you this side of me when i myself can’t even recognize it?"
only this time i need you to listen
i don’t ever want you to stop looking at me like that
will you still love my mess?
"try to forget your sad, distract yourself create bad habits, procrastinate everything, lose your motivation, lay in bed, don’t sleep, make coffee, spend hours on your phone, pass out from exhaustion, wake up, now repeat"
"almost too late, put a smile on your face, find something to talk about any sort of bullshit that your brain can conjure up. but don’t talk about yourself, you can’t let them know who you are leave as soon as possible, find a place to be alone,  sit in your lonely and open a book"
"don’t forget your keys remember to lock the door lock your mind as well, grab your wallet also, don’t forget your headphones put them in &amp; start walking walk with purpose avoid eye contact like it’s a plague, arrive at your destination early earlier than everyone else or late"
"we all want to be held for a while, to feel safe and wanted, even if it was just for a moment"
you think you know them but then they surprise you
it's pointless if it doesn't make me feel anything
that one person that changes your mood as soon as they start talking to you
"you don’t know how exhausting it is, living inside my mind"
only a few people understand that my sadness is part of who i am
coffee so strong that makes you forget eveything that hurts
"i forgive you, but that doesn’t mean we can still go back to how things were, that doesn’t mean we can talk as if nothing happened, no"
do you ever just want to bury yourself in someone’s chest and stay there? because i do
"you look like trouble, come here"
"it’s okay love, it’s okay to feel lost sometimes. it doesn’t mean that you failed, no. it just means that you’re looking for more than what’s in front of you and there’s nothing wrong with that"
i’m going to write pretty words all over your heart
eye contact with the right person is everything
i don’t really understand me either
don't sacrifice your sleep for just anyone
she looks like somebody who could fuck up my entire life and i would gladly let her
some people are just so fucking toxic
"i’m sorry if i daydream in the middle of the conversation, i often get lost in my own thoughts trying to rearrange them together in hopes of making any sense at all"
some people really need to understand that just because i know a lot of people doesn’t mean i talk to each and every person i know.
"i gave her my phone for an hour, told her if you see a text or a phone call, let me know, the worst part was she literally kept staring at my phone for a good 5 minutes and my god that felt good."
"this girl told me today “you must have a lot of people talking to you, why are you interested in talking with me” so i told her nobody texts me and i’m nearly alone 90% of my time. she laughed and thought i was lying"
sitting by the sea waiting for the sunrise is another form of love
why are you so far?
i hope i become the first person you run to tell the good and bad news to
sometimes it’s just best to let it be
so i took some pictures of the sunset today and it looked so pretty
stop what you’re doing and look at the moon
"i’m sorry, i’ve lived inside my imagination for too long that i have forgotten what reality looks like"
it’s just me and the sea tonight
"i want you to love me the same way i’m going to love you, if that’s even possible"
"sunsets, poetry and you"
listening to their favorite song is like holding their hands but mentally
"that’s the thing, you’re putting your happiness in their hands and forget how temporary people are, and then you wonder why your happiness never lasts"
"i know what it feels like for your heart to ache and your soul to cry, i know what it feels like when nothing seems steady, i know what it feels like to have someone after another cause you pain, i know"
will you understand what i can’t explain?
"effort, that shit is attractive"
"i wish there were better ways to tell you how i feel, but there isn’t.  to write it and fill the sky with words or cut my chest wide open, i don’t know.  all i know is that i wake up every morning hoping today is worth waking up for"
"stop stalking them,  they don’t care"
"listen to her, listen to her heart when you tilt your head on her chest, listen to her mind when she speaks about the things she loves, listen to her body when her hands wander yours, just make sure you listen to her"
she spent so much time thinking she wasn’t good enough for you but maybe it’s always been you who doesn’t deserve her
people with kind hearts and good intentions are my favorite
i like it when people are themselves around me
"- waiter: what would you like for dessert, sir? - me: her, please"
"i lost count on how many times i’ve tried understanding myself, i always ended up lost not knowing where to begin"
"you don’t understand how my mind works, it’s like an endless maze with dead ends at every corner"
"i’m not asking for more, i’m asking for different"
my mind is slowly killing me tonight
i don’t need my phone when you’re around
"i have came to realize that it’s better to feel than not feel anything at all. conversations are meant to be honest, even when your mind is at war and you cannot say a single word. you can be in love at 2 am or 3 pm, remember to not stay bitter for too long, learn and move on"
"i will let you be who you are because that’s the person i fell in love with, i’m only going to hold your hands while you become a better version of yourself"
i really hate how fast i lose interest sometimes
remember the time you thought you couldn’t survive through it? you did.  and now you can do it again
it's no longer about you anymore
"it’s a risky thing.  to open up, and tell them everything, to trust them enough to know they won’t just take a part of you and leave. because of how easily they can break your trust, you’re lucky if you find someone who appreciates you"
can i spend the rest of my sunrises with you?
tell me you’ll still be there when i wake up
"whatever you do, just don’t take my love for granted"
"come here, you don't have to figure it out all on your own now, i'm here, and you can always tell me what keeps you up every night"
i will love you more than your demons ever could
can you still love me with all my sadness and hate towards the world?
"i woke up with a heavy heart, can you hold it for me?"
"you're not going to fuck me up, are you?"
i still sleep better when you’re the last person i talk to
"i know sometimes you feel like your best isn’t enough, i know you feel like you’ve wasted so much time already, i know you’re disappointed in yourself. but i know you’re capable of standing back up, i believe in you. and ill tell you that every day until you believe it too"
i would stay away from me too
"i know sometimes it hurts to lose people, but maybe they just weren't suppose to stay"
there's nothing sexier than seeing the softer side of someone only shown to you
oh you have no idea
i love it when everyone is asleep and i have this silence all to myself
"yes dear, this world was never good to me either"
the world will keep moving with or without you
"stop thinking for a minute, close your eyes and breathe, because you exist. and people do care about you, whether you know it now or don’t, you have so much to offer this world"
sometimes you need to let them miss you
"show kindness to your heart, be gentle with yourself and forgive yourself, even on your worst days"
i want to lose myself in your arms
you haven’t really felt pain until you lay there next to them and they’re thinking about someone else
"will it be selfish to say that i want you all the fucking time?  i want you in my head, i want you in my bed, i want my hands all over you, give me your tightest grip. let me exhale all my loneliness and sadness to you, i want to breathe you in, swallow you whole. i want you"
i always leave a mark
sunrises are not appreciated enough
it’s so much easier to just smile and pretend it’s okay you know
"this is what happens, when someone breaks your heart you tell yourself no one will ever be allowed inside again, but then someone comes along with a beautiful smile and eyes made of poems and suddenly your heart starts beating again"
"not everybody will understand your silence, remember that"
"if only the moon could talk back, i always wonder what it would say"
"here’s just a tweet for everybody who is struggling, it will pass, and it will get better, stop and breathe for a second. close your eyes. it passes, believe me"
i wonder how many goodbyes you’ve said and if mine was the only one you can’t get out of your head
"when you find someone who uncovers all your flaws, listens to who you are and embraces you rather than judges you, hold on to them and never let go"
stop forgiving people for the same mistakes just because you can’t imagine not having them in your life
you deserve something that you don’t have to question everyday
love is holding their hands and feel like you’re holding the whole world
loyalty &amp; honesty are everything
"this side of you, this side of you that you don’t show to anybody, is what i want"
"and when you love me, i hope it’s true, i hope you truly do. because i’m not too keen for anyone to falsely take my heart and not take care of it"
"“don’t text back right away, if you like them, pretend you don’t, and don’t you dare say i love you first.” yeah, well, fuck that. i will text you back 2 seconds later, i will tell you that i like you the first chance i get. we’re too old for mind games"
there are times when you have to fight for what you love and care about and there are times when you have to find the strength and courage to let go
"because, when you care about someone, you just do. and nothing can change that"
put your ears on my chest and hear my heart scream
"you deserve better, i know you’ve been through a lot, whether it’s a bad breakup, family issues, friends, whatever it may be, you pulled through. you made it this far and i’m proud of you"
i let it hurt until i no longer feel anything
forehead kisses are a form of art too
"stop being so hard on yourself, there’s nothing wrong with making mistakes while trying to figure things out. we’re all meant to make mistakes to know what works best for us"
"sunsets, poetry &amp; your face"
you wouldn't handle a day inside my head
"don't fall in love with me, i'm not going to stop writing about you"
i feel sorry for whoever is going to fall in love with me already
one day i’m going to be proud of what this pain has created
"intimacy isn’t who you let touch you.  intimacy is who texts you at 2 am asking about your dreams and how you feel. intimacy is giving somebody your attention when other people are begging for it, intimacy is that one person always in the back of your mind"
"people with weird personalities often make the best friends, being able to be openly weird actually relieves stress and anxiety"
lie once to me and watch how fast i lose interest
why are you not in my arms yet?
"no, my goal is to make you feel better about yourself"
tell me you’ve been thinking about me too
"i will always love everything about you, even the things i yet don’t understand"
"don’t let your mind convince you that you’re too clingy, you simply just care too much. you love too hard but everything else about you is soft.  you overcompensate just to give them a reason to stay. but you aren’t as bad and intolerable as you think you are"
but who will hear me when my mind screams
give me a song or you
"my mind overanalyzes everything, one wrong message, a conversation where i wonder if i said too much, an unanswered text that sends my mind wandering, it’s exhausting.  it’s the wait for people to leave, it’s ruining something before it even begins"
"day by day, piece by piece, i promise i’ll find myself"
remember the first day we started talking to each other? do you also remember the way your eyes would spark every time mine caught them staring?
some feelings are just very difficult to express with words
"i hope i never get bored of looking at the moon every night, of watching milk make galaxies in my cup or coffee.  i hope i never grow to be somebody who can no longer see the beauty in things"
"be gentle with my heart, i think it has had enough pain"
i always wonder how many people you’ve talked about me with
"i hope every time life disappoints you, you persevere and overcome it. learn more about yourself and your abilities, and if you’re lucky, you will notice that you’re even more than you ever thought you could be"
keep yourself busy to stay away from feelings
you’re pretending not to care and she’s pretending like she doesn’t miss you. your ego will destroy everything
the irony in how you can go on for such a long period of time not needing anyone and then you meet someone and you suddenly want them all the time
at least we will get to see the same moon tonight
"when you lose something valuable to you, you no longer care about losing anything anymore"
"i wanted you to fight for me, but you didn’t even try"
the world seems different from her eyes
it’s a horror movie inside my head
"no, it’s not selfish that i have changed because i realized that i am the only person i can depend on"
her arms smell like home
"those nights when you just break down, realizing how lonely you are and that nobody even notices"
"i want all of you to myself, is that too much to ask for?"
"you and me, we were  something else, but my soul  longed for solitude.  understand that i need to find myself before i can find  somebody else"
"look me in the eyes and tell me that we got this, tell me tomorrow will be lighter, brighter, and worth waking up for"
"i still think of you from time to time; your name has not left my lips, no gentle kisses over morning coffee, no tearful thoughts in the middle of the night, but i often think about you.  you were with me in every poem i wrote, every decision i made, but where are you now?"
happy birthday to my favorite person on here @VVanGone
do you ever go through a day smiling at people and talking as if everything’s normal and okay while the entire time you have this weight of unhappiness inside you?
"a reminder to not make promises when you’re happy, don’t reply when you’re angry, and don’t make decisions when you’re sad"
"nevermind, she flirts with everyone"
good luck trying to find someone who understands you better than i do
i’m going to push everyone away and start all over again
"hey love, i made us a playlist to slow dance on"
"distance yourself for a while,  you will realize a lot"
"one day, i will wake up at 4 am unable to sleep, i will look next to me, and you will be there. sleeping peacefully  beside me and suddenly,  the world won’t be so empty and lonely"
hold my hand when we’re crossing the street
fill my empty heart with love and kisses
how much of it was real?
let’s go somewhere far from here and never look back
and what if the person you were meant to be with could never be yours?
always
sometimes the only way for people to appreciate you is to lose you
i feel sick to my stomach every time i remember how i opened up to you
you ever be losing your fucking mind but at the same time you’re chilling
i distance myself when i sense that my presence isn’t valid
"yes, i want to see your sleepy face every morning"
let me hold your hand when i eat you out
"the problem is when you don’t matter to someone, you begin to wonder if you matter to anyone at all"
and the sad thing is that you believed me when i said i was fine when i really wasn’t
"GOOD NEWS, my book is almost finished"
"no, i don’t want late night phone calls or endless texting, i want you here"
"i’m no longer putting unappreciated effort into anyone. if you want me to put my energy and effort into you, then you’re going to have to give me a reason to. i’m tired of trying and putting so much into unworthy people"
"but dear, you are the stars"
don’t use people to fill your emptiness
i highly suggest you not to talk to me when i’m moody
and the best thing you could do now is let go of anything that hurts your heart
sunrises are always beautiful and quiet
"look at the moon, and smile"
we belong to nobody but ourselves
"you smile, i melt"
but even my words wanted to cry
forgive me for not holding you in my arms long enough
i see your face in my head a million times a day
"people like me don’t belong with others,  people like me belong alone"
"that’s what real love means.. letting a person be what they really are. most people love you for who you pretend to be. to keep their love, you keep pretending, performing. people get so used to their images, they grow attached to their masks and forget who they are"
"here’s to everyone who has seen me get too emotional and insanely sensitive but has stuck around anyway, you’re appreciated and remembered"
those random memories that make you smile no matter where you are in life or what you’re doing are the best
i’ll kiss your forehead and call it a day
"i have so much to say, so much that i don’t know where or how to begin"
call me in the middle of the night and tell me how much you’ve missed me
stranger things has broken my fucking heart
can i read you instead?
stop using the words ‘i promise’ lightly
"yes, i had the same song on repeat because it reminds me of you"
"now i’m seeking truth, not desire"
i’d create such a masterpiece writing about you
"we wont forget each other, right? tell me we won’t forget each other"
"i want long hugs, night walks, and late night talks"
you wouldn’t be able to handle all my moods
maybe it’s all in my head
conversations that make you smile for a good couple of minutes are a blessing
"yes, tell me about your day and how you're feeling, i care"
hold my heart while i finish this battle
"maybe i just want to feel your body against mine and have you rest your head under my chin, maybe i just want to sit in silence. just exist next to you"
most people don’t understand how stressful it is to explain what you’re thinking about
i don't see myself writing about anyone else but you
share your soul with me
can you not ask what’s wrong and let me break down in your arms?
you touched every tender part of me
we break our own hearts so that someone else doesn’t
"and when they want to leave, open the door for them"
"i’m always at war with who i am and who i want to be, between the things that catch my attention and the things i want to focus on and it’s very exhausting"
"careful, she’s brutally soft"
"you’re loved and valid, remember that"
i want to build a garden with someone i love
"i hope i haven’t turned your life upside down, i hope you stay the same person i first laid my eyes on, but i do hope you still remember my 3 am texts while i was drunk and lonely. i hope you still smile every time you look at the mirror for who you’ve become"
"i don’t want to care too much, in fear that the other person doesn’t care at all"
‘write hard and clear about what hurts’ - Ernest Hemingway
one day i will redecorate the holes around my heart and make this place a home for you
i’m full of bad decisions too
"it's okay, we can be sleepless together"
i’m always thinking about you &amp; the empty spaces between our hands
i hope you think of me when you see the moonlight on the beach with your favorite song playing in the background
find someone that doesn’t lose appreciation once they are used to you
"it’s difficult to wait for something you know might never happen, i know. but it’s a lot worse to give up knowing it’s everything you want"
don’t pretend because we both know you felt it too. went through it all just like i did. even when it happened all too quickly. too quickly. the falling in love. the falling out of it
"if i disappear from your life, it’s for your own good"
"it’s late, but it’s never too late to stop thinking about you"
you belong in arms that hold you tightly yet secure enough to respect your freedomn
"only with you, i become speechless"
"and the saddest part was even after she let him go, she sat up all night staring at her phone wondering if he misses her"
don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached don’t get attached
you will never see her the same way i do unless you see her soul
feelings fade when people change
all i know is that i’m filled with wounds and i’m still standing on my feet
"i just want to sleep and wake up when life is more doable.  when this heartache is just a bad dream, when i no longer have to deal with these thoughts in my head.  when everything just looks a little bit brighter"
i’m so tired of people pretending to want to talk to me and want me in their life but make absolutely no effort at all
‘we’ve died so many times now that we can only wonder why we still care’ - Charles Bukowski
i just love seeing you smile
don’t forget to smile at people who look like they’re having a bad day
she said sorry when she should’ve said goodbye
my mind is tired of thinking
"i dare you to make me feel something, anything"
you will always notice my worth when i'm no longer there
i respect those who could’ve turned cold after what they’ve been through but still choose to love anyways. there’s strength and courage in that
some eyes will touch you more than hands ever could
let’s travel and fuck in every city we go to
"i’d ruin any day, all my days, just to spend more long nights with you"
"i don’t know, nothing seems to keep me interested anymore"
my hands feel lost when they’re not between your thighs
can your face be the first thing i see every morning?
let’s spend our days at libraries and our nights cuddled under the stars
i still remember every word you’ve ever said to me
"YOU DON’T NEED A REASON TO HELP PEOPLE, YOU DON’T NEED A REASON TO BE NICE"
"do it for you, twenty years from now nobody is going to remember the choices you made but yourself"
"it’s not difficult to impress me, just be a good friend and have a kind heart"
"i love those who enlighten me with knowledge in any form, it’s so appealing"
i hope you’re staring at the moon tonight
"and every time i feel the need to talk to you, i write.  i write as if you’re staring at my lips waiting for a word to utter, i write all my anger down and hope you could understand my reasons, despite how wrong they may sound.  i write"
"there isn’t enough time to explain every feeling i’m daily feeling, it’s exhausting. it’s fucking draining"
it’s already over once you realize that you’re not afraid of losing each other
"she’s beautiful. not just in looks no, but her personality, her voice, her demeanor, her heart, her soul, her very essence, her vibes. she’s just... beautiful"
"sorry, i think too much"
"and the worst part is knowing there’s no reason why you feel that way, you just do"
"fuck, i woke up without you in my arms again"
"if i ever disappeared, know that i’m okay"
well are you going to kiss me or are you going to keep staring at my lips like that?
"what if no one understands that you’re standing at the edge, waiting for someone to push you?  what if no one understands what’s it like to have a war inside your head?  what if no one understands what it feels like to wake up every morning with an aching heart?"
as soon as you forget about their existence:
understanding people is such a blessing and a curse
i need a 2 hour hug and a goodnight sleep
"no, it’s not a hug until i feel your heartbeat"
"hi, excuse me, but can i just lay my head on your lap and close my eyes while you read your book out loud?"
i lost the energy to socialize with people
don’t wait for me to talk
‘she’s a mess of gorgeous chaos and you can see it in her eyes’ - Charles Bukowski
can you love me even when you hate me the most?
my mind is so full of you i can hardly call it my own
i want to touch you inappropriately in public and watch your face change
"people don’t have to like you,  and you don’t have to care"
"2020 is in 6 months, stop letting anyone waste your time"
my words will make sense when i leave
"once again, just like that, i have changed"
"i miss the days when i use to sleep with no worries, not thinking about what will happen tomorrow, when i didn’t wake up from nightmares every night, when sleeping was the only escape i needed"
"i know you feel lost right now, but you can get through anything. patience. you’re stronger than you think"
"i don’t want to think about you with him, his arms slung over your shoulders, his face in the crook of your neck; all the secrets &amp; stolen kisses, no. i don’t want to think anymore, about anything"
"maybe this loneliness is fate, i don’t have any choices but to embrace it, cherish it, and learn to live with it.  maybe i’m better like this"
a reminder that the reason you’re doing this is to make your life better
the best revenge is showing them that life is better after they left
i know things i’m not suppose to know
my words never mean what i want them to mean
i wouldn't recognize myself without this pain
"i’m not jealous of who they are or that you might like them more than me, i’m jealous about the fact that they might make you happier than i ever can"
"if you see this, i love you.  take care of yourself and smile often"
"no, the music has to be louder than my thoughts"
go where you feel the most alive and stay there
"no darling, you don’t need to explain yourself and tell people everything, you don’t owe people any explanation of any decisions you make"
i just want to support your goals and make you the happiest you’ve ever been
"i lost interest, again"
i hope you wake up tomorrow with a happier heart
"don’t be sorry for leaving someone who made you doubt yourself, love. don’t be sorry for not letting anyone in, for not letting your guard down.  don’t be sorry for not settling with someone who’s not trying to make you the best version of yourself"
"choose me or lose me, i’m not your second fucking choice"
"may the struggles you face today be gentle on you, smile now. it gets better"
she is someone who bears her worries alone
i just don’t want you to look at me and feel nothing
i still check your profile from time to time just to make sure you’re okay
"i just like being home, in my own space, comfortable. not surrounded by people"
"i’m always a little too much to handle, a little too sad, and a little too overbearing"
"- what’s wrong? - i don’t know, i just miss you"
"how weird is it to stand in a room full of people and be alone. watching people joke, laugh, and smile around you, you feel like the world is just going on without you and your presence is not needed or wanted"
"i mean, i could look into your eyes until the sun comes up"
"my god, that smile could end wars"
i’m such an idiot for not kissing her
"people fuck up, they kiss the wrong person and pretend to be okay. people will do anything just to distract their heart from falling, they will do anything to distract it from missing anyone"
"hey, notice the people who stick around at your worst"
"she’s a little cynical if you ask me, love scares her more than the idea of being committed to a person"
it only feels right in your arms
"fuck, we should kiss"
"she’s a scorpio, you wouldn’t last"
"stop talking, your mouth is full of lies"
"yeah, you loved a person who didn’t appreciate you and it fucked you up, i know"
really heart? we’re going to go through that again?
"‘i’ve had too many knives stuck into me. when they hand me a flower, i can’t quite make out what it is. it takes time’ - Charles Bukowski"
"your smile fucking melts my heart, holy shit"
to know i was beautiful in her eyes made me feel beautiful
wear my shirts and hold my hand
"it’s not everyday you find someone who can put up with your shit, hold on to them. seriously"
hiding your pain is another pain
"come now, love. we’ll be okay"
"be with someone who wants to invest their time in you, learn from you, see you win, supports your visions and accepts you for who you are"
give yourself some room to breathe
"i’m starting to think that maybe it’s not about how much you love someone anymore, maybe what really matters is who you are when you’re with them"
i need a good book and the beach right now
it’s time to choose yourself
can i have you in my arms for a few lifetimes?
i don’t want to be this sad sometimes but this pain is the closest to home
i don’t know what’s wrong but it’s a lot
stop denying how you feel about them when on the inside you know what your heart is telling you
"i only want to be around people that actually love me and want me around, not people that pretend they do"
"just don’t go telling people i lost you, because trust me, i didn’t lose shit"
"and even if we no longer talk, i’ll always wish you the best"
"and when she smiles, her eyelids go bright i almost expect flowers to bloom with how lovely she looks"
your biggest mistake was walking away from the one person who actually stood there and waited for you
Eid Mubarak you beautiful people
i’m sorry i’m so complicated and mess everything up
Emilia Clarke is just something else
"she’s cute and everything, but can she make good coffee?"
your sorry doesn’t mean shit to me
we got so close that the only way to breathe was to push each other away
for anyone who needs to hear it; don’t check up on that toxic person you cut off
"i’ve always believed in myself, no matter the difficulty of any obstacles that came my way. i know what i’m capable of, i know what it feels like to have absolutely nothing but yourself. and that was such an important lesson life has taught me well"
"i’ve always wondered what is it like to be fully loved for who you are without someone trying to change something, like yeah, how does it feel?"
i need to sleep for an entire week
"i’m tired, that is all"
"you really can’t see it, can you.  the way she looks at you isn’t the same way she looks at anybody else"
she has a broken heart but yet she has flowers growing in her lungs
"i know you wanted me to love you, and i tried, you know i tried. right?"
"yes, you’re allowed to be alive, you’re allowed to be somebody different, you’re allowed to to make your own choices without the need to explain a single thing to anyone, ever"
be with someone who sees you as too important to lose
your late night thoughts could fill a library and i would love to read every book
"tell me everything, you can go on for hours, i wouldn’t mind"
be the reason my heart beats this fast
you’re no longer welcomed in my dreams
"June, be tender"
"i will never understand how people can just stop talking to someone like it’s nothing. you go from texting the minute you wake up till you fall asleep to absolutely nothing at all, it’s quite horrifying how you can’t get close to anyone anymore without second guessing your worth"
a love like hers is like no other
"i’m sorry he didn’t treat you the way you need to be treated, love"
i don’t think it ever did either
it’s really hard growing up in a world where you never feel good enough
yes i want you to call me whenever something happens and be the first one to tell the news to however bad/good it is. i want to be the first one to know everything; to be your number one priority
"because when it’s just me and this silence, i often wonder if you wish you could be with me right now"
i want to know what goes through your mind when you look at me
"just because someone flirts with you doesn’t mean they like you,  just because someone likes you doesn’t mean they want to go out with you,  just because they want to go out with you doesn’t mean they love you. people lie, people chance, people would kill just to see you fall"
we shouldn’t complicate everything
i’m suppose to be asleep but here i am thinking about you
have you ever just been so attracted to someone you can actually feel it driving you crazy?
i’m horrible sometimes but love me anyways
"no, you don’t fucking deserve my heart"
let your mind be the most beautiful thing about you
"hey, i love you, be safe and smile often today"
"there are people who are just like you. lonely.  they’re missing someone,  they’re in love with someone they probably shouldn’t be in love with.  they have secrets you wouldn’t imagine. they wish, dream, hope, and they look at the sky every chance they get.  you’re never alone"
maybe you’re just not ready to fall in love
"don’t, not for a second, ever think you deserve that pain"
my thoughts are always destroying me
"shower her with undistracted attention,  kiss her neck and mouth deeply and unexpected, consume her. tease her. gentler. harder. whisper her your deepest desires, challenge her.  make a fucking universe out of her"
"yes, i will kiss your scars and always remind you how beautiful you are"
i’ll always have a big hug waiting for you anytime you need one
reminder; your feelings are always valid
"i want to be lost in your arms, away from everything &amp; everyone"
but would you understand my silence when i don’t have anything to say?
"don’t hide your feelings from me, i can see it right through your eyes"
i’ve been making you a playlist to tell you how i feel
we’re officially in hell
keep me inside your heart and lock me up
"don’t you dare give up, not tonight, not tomorrow, not ever"
understand me before you love me
you’re the type of person i would make coffee for every morning
"i don’t feel anything, i just feel empty"
"she wants to be loved, to be held, to be mended, to be whole"
"you promise certain people to stay in touch with but it doesn’t work out, It never does. and you forget about what the friendship used to be like, why you liked that person and i hate it"
do you ever want to listen to music but every song is just not the right song?
not everyone deserves your forgiveness
"i’m good at walking away,  rejection teaches you that"
do you believe it’s possible that maybe some people were born to give more love than they will ever receive?
can you stop being so far away?
"sorry, i got lost looking at your eyes, you were saying?"
‘it wasn’t my day. my week. my month. my year. my life. god damn it.’ - Charles Bukowski
"it’s killing you, isn’t it?"
by Anastasiya Ostrovskaya
her heart always bled flowers instead of blood
"when someone leaves, just remember that they’re only making space for someone else to enter"
why can’t anything good just stay?
"the sooner you know that it will never go back to the way it was, the faster it is to move on"
"stop feeling sorry for yourself, work fucking harder"
"with her by my side, i win at life"
"i know i can’t expect others to care the same way i do, but at least i just hope they care at all"
she would have gave up her whole world just to be a part of yours
my feelings change when your actions show me the opposite of what you say
"yeah, we all caught feelings for someone we wish we haven’t"
people who smile when you’re making eye contact
excuse me while i romanticize everything
"how lonely are you? how sad are you? how much emptiness will you fill yourself with? how much negativity do you bottle up to not effect those around you? how much sadness do you hide behind your watery eyes before bed every night? this isn’t a poem, this is sadness"
i smile just from the thought of you
"i mean, surely there has to be a language to tell you how i feel"
i know that loving me can be exhausting sometimes
wait for someone that would do anything to be your everything
her silence is better than anyone else’s words
"if i get jealous then yes, i really like you"
teach yourself to fight alone
you would be lucky to have someone like me in your life
open a book every time life turns into shit
do you ever look at someone’s face and just wanted to keep looking at them forever?
"to be honest, i’m not going to give you a bunch of words to make you feel better, but i can offer you my arms to give you a hug, hands to hold and squeeze, and ears to listen to whatever you want to talk about, anything to see you smile again"
do you know how much it hurts to have small talk with someone you once told everything?
you look like someone i would definitely get lost in
"‘disappointed, but not surprised’ has been my moto this year"
here’s a reminder to be gentle with each other’s hearts
"go on, tell them how you feel, i dare you"
she’s trying to look her best even though inside she’s such a mess
"this time, i’m not losing myself for anybody, not anymore. this time is mine, and mine alone"
we’re all lonely for something or someone
"sometimes you just can’t turn off the noise in your head, no matter how hard you try to"
"it’s always nice to take some time and just not think about anything, at all"
"i think the worst part about a break up is where you have to end things with someone you’re still in love with. as bizarre and thrilling as it sounds, being in love doesn’t always mean that you’re happy"
"i can be your poet,  i can be more to you  than to any of the rest"
"for you, literally anything"
"i notice you, even when nobody else does. i will"
"even when things are going well, i always seem to find ways to fuck it up"
"someone always ends up getting hurt, always"
"don’t tell me to stop looking at you like that, i can’t. when i see something this beautiful it’s very hard to"
"she’s slowly stealing my heart,  and i’m going to let her"
nothing’s easier than saying you’re over someone. look at them in the eyes and see their smile and hear their voice and say ‘this isn’t what i want anymore’
making others happy and seeing a smile on their faces just from a simple act of kindness or gratitude never fails to warm my heart
Ramadan Kareem you beautiful people
and let’s go where we feel most alive and forget about everything else
do you ever just wonder how many people have loved you and never got the chance to tell you?
my heart has so many questions
just because you miss how they made you feel doesn’t mean that you miss them
"i knew exactly who you were, and i loved you anyway"
can people like stop entering my life just to waste it?
you should’ve seen the way i talked about you
"i’m just really fucking tired to give a shit anymore, about anything"
"i know i probably no longer cross your mind but i know someday you will see something that will remind you of me and the things we shared, then your throat will get tighter and your heart will skip a beat and then you’ll finally remember me"
"words may hurt your feelings, or even break your heart; but silence will always tear you apart"
"let it go, the way they smelled, they way they would hold you close and look in your eyes and promise they wouldn’t leave. the way their hands would tremble the second you let them go.  let it go, thinking about it won’t do you any good"
"mornings with you,  nights with you,  everything with you"
let me sleep on your lap a little longer
"i don’t know about you people, but having a friendship with your family and actually open up and talk about things you don’t usually talk about is very relaxing and it takes so much off of your mind"
"incase no one has told you today, you’re beautiful and you’re doing your best and we’re going to be okay"
i have issues that prevent me from having people close to me
i want a place in your heart no one else could have
sext: let’s be enough for each other
nothing will wear you and drain you out like caring about the wrong people
isn’t your home in my arms though?
it’ll hurt if we talk about it
i’ve told you things that nobody knows about me and you made me feel like it meant nothing at all
i can’t love you and myself at the same time
can i be selfish and have you all to myself?
Original Sin (2001)
the more i annoy you the more i like you
but i’m the bad one in every story
"‘i take much pleasure in being alone, but there is also a strange warm grace in not being alone’ - Charles Bukowski"
let me face your nightmares with you
it’s weird how we sometimes think we can’t live without them again then you blink and you don’t even miss them anymore
i appreciate fast replies
"i don’t want anyone’s attention, yours is more than enough"
never hold on to something that doesn’t hold on to you
"i swear to you,  you will never find a heart like mine"
sometimes you need to disappear just to see who will come searching for you
"i would still love you in all your shapes, in all worlds, &amp; all your past. never doubt that"
nothing personal but i’m just done investing my time in you
you haven’t seen a war till you see me talk to myself
will i ever sleep properly and actually get a good 8 hour sleep and not this 2-3 hour bullshit?
you will never know how i feel
"stop making people your everything, because the second they leave, you will be left with nothing"
you will find happiness when you stop trying to be someone else’s description of beautiful and started being your own
"i wanted to kiss your sadness and insecurities away, but you left before giving me that chance"
you won’t find me in anybody else
"yes, you’re the reason i smile a lot"
"i remember telling you how pretty your eyes were even though it was too dark that night, but the next day i looked at your eyes and i was mistaken. your eyes aren’t just pretty; they’re so fucking goddamn beautiful"
"i’ll be honest. i think about you a lot, all the time matter of fact. in the morning, in the middle of the day, at night, it’s you. it’s been always you from the very beginning"
i hate how addicted i get to anything that makes me feel anything
"it hurts, it hurts a lot.  so she keeps it to herself so it doesn’t hurt anybody else"
i was suddenly left with nothing in my mind but thoughts and a handful of words about you
"i don’t want to get close to people, it hurts too much thinking about them. ones who matter and don’t feel the same, ones who you think about but never got to be with. i sometimes like people but when i get too close, it fucks me up"
teach your heart how to accept what can’t be changed
"i like people with depth, people with emotion, people with strong and interesting minds, but also people who can make me smile"
"no, i will not be your sometimes"
do you also feel like every person you care about cares about someone else more?
i want to be the person that makes your bad days better
i want you to want me the same way i want you
she said my voice is the first thing she wants to hear when she wakes up
"i crave feeling desired, but more importantly, valued.  we’re usually more considerate, more careful, and respectful towards what we value"
i keep everything to myself because i got tired of pouring everything to the wrong people
"i never really learned how to just like something, i have this bad habit of letting it consume me"
they always know your worth when it’s too late
don’t talk to me if you’re not actually planning to keep the conversation going
a concept; i want to be in love but i don’t want it to hurt
"it’s okay to lose people, but it’s not okay to lose yourself for them"
sometimes they just won’t understand no matter how much you want them to
i look at you &amp; i know how i want to live the rest of my life
‘love breaks my bones and i laugh’ - Charles Bukowski
"just because they don’t love you the way you want them to, doesn’t mean nobody will, nor does it mean you’re not worthy of love"
at one point or another you will have to understand that some people are only meant to stay in your mind not your life
this took a while
me flirting; don’t sleep
i’ll hold your hands and tell you that everything is going to be okay
"there are nights where she puts her head in the pillow so nobody would hear her cry, and there are nights where she doesn’t feel anything at all. but there are nights where i don’t leave her mind, and those are my favorite"
"there’s so much more to life than finding someone who wants you, or being sad over someone who doesn’t. stop dwelling over people &amp; start spending time discovering yourself"
having someone who understands your silence is so much better than a bunch of meaningless words
"good things are going to happen, i can feel it"
"you wake up everyday with a chance to be different, a chance to change, a chance to be better, a chance to make someone smile, a chance to leave your past behind and leave it there. you have that chance everyday"
i honestly just wish everyone had good hearts &amp; good intentions for others
your mindset and vibes will attract me more than your physical appearance
"and as soon you realize that maybe everyone was right, you fall too hard, too fast and put all your love in people who don’t deserve it, you see the good in everyone and that’s the thing that destroys every piece of you"
neck kisses are really fucking hot though
keep your fake love away from me
"oh, but i’m so good at disappointing myself i won’t need your help at all"
"i know i overanalyze everything, i don’t want to.. i know i shouldn’t, but i do.  i’ve hated this part of me for quite sometime; so maybe if i feel you leaving before you do, i’ll be able to protect myself and disappear before you get the chance to hurt me"
we’ll watch the sunrise and sunsets holding hands and tomorrow will be a better day
i’m... speechless? do girls like this even exist anymore?
"i get it, i’m a hard person to deal with, but also a person that would do absolutely anything just to see that smile on your face"
"you won’t fail me, will you darling?"
"i like it when someone remembers the small details about me and addresses me by my name at the end of a sentence, i don’t know why but i just really, really find it attractive, i do"
"here, wear my shirt, it’ll look prettier on you"
the amount of people with trust issues just because someone promised ‘i’m here for you’ and then leave when things start to fall apart is just ridiculous
it’s getting so hard to sleep and even harder to wake up
you never fail to put a smile on my face
"yes, i do know how much it hurts, you suddenly forget to breathe and you can’t even cry, all you can do is feel a knife being pushed in your chest over and over again"
but why are you  so obsessed with destroying  your own happiness?
i can’t help but think of all the ways to hold you gently and love you tenderly
"either come closer or stay away from me, having you in between is very exhausting"
"and if they’re not willing to step into hell and walk with you, then they’re not the ones worth taking to heaven"
anything worth having is something worth waiting for
i have abilities like crying quietly and putting a smile on my face everyday
your smile makes the flowers in my heart grow
"you know sometimes when you look at someone and you just lose words? you just instantly connect &amp; only the two of you catches it? like a little secret, a place you escape when everything is irrelevant and you need a semblance of reality"
"it’s weird to go from being everything to nothing from an ignored message, how you can talk for months about everything and know more about each other than anyone has ever known then just one day one of you decides it’s enough and you stop replying and trying and it’s just over"
"it still feels nice being wanted, even if it was by the wrong person"
"you can never tell when the last time is, you often think that there will be more time, that you have forever, but you really don’t. you can’t expect that from people"
i can share my hoodies and music with you
you lost me when i would’ve left the entire world for you
"i genuinely just want someone to come into my life and actually stay, i’m tired of all the time and effort spent on people who just end up leaving"
you never realize how attached you are to someone until you don’t talk to them for a while
"when you find someone who tries to stay beside you regardless of how difficult you might be, keep them. because finding someone who could potentially look past your flaws and stays is very rare"
i tend to be quite needy and i require a lot of attention but i also like my space and i enjoy being alone so i don’t know what to tell you
let me take you to an art museum and kiss you between every painting
i detect the slightest change in someone’s attitude and actions and suddenly i spend the rest of the day trying to figure out what went wrong
dear self; stop stressing over things you’re in no control over
or perhaps i should say how high or drunk was i when i actually believed a word you said to me
how stupid was i to think you were any different
this somehow warmed my heart up
"when i said i was busy i meant it; but not in the way people understand. i was busy taking deeper breaths, i was busy silencing my thoughts, i was busy calming my racing heart, i was busy pretending to be okay, i was busy faking a smile to make sure nobody notices this mess"
she wishes you could apologize for what you did to her
a good conversation and a sky full of stars with you could heal all my wounds
"i’ve put my trust in the wrong hands, again"
"you won’t look good making someone else look bad, remember that"
you don’t have to accept things you’re not okay with
take your drama and negativity and get the fuck out of my life
she said i was her favorite mess
"i hope you notice what you’re getting into because i am not all kindness &amp; gentleness; lately i’ve been a mess and all over the place, i don’t flow rationally. i hurt others, often myself but i do know what love is"
"be with someone who will be there at 3 am when you’re breaking down, but also at 3 pm when you’re in love with life and they make you love it even more"
can i be the only ocean you want to drown in &amp; the only air you want to breathe?
stop putting effort into people that simply just don’t care
take your time to make your soul happy
"i know how hard it is to unable to tell anyone what’s going on in your head, i do"
so many things can change in such a short amount of time it’s scary
touch me gently with your words
do you ever just want to hold someone in your arms for about 10 years?
"eyes on me, i always want your eyes on me"
i’m sorry i can’t stand seeing you happy without me
she said i was gentle with words
and i hate dreaming of people i no longer talk with
"i can offer you my world and hand you my heart, will that be enough?"
"if you’re mad tell me, if i pissed you off tell me &amp; tell me how i can fix it. tell me everything, talk to me"
nobody will understand how much it hurts but yourself
you should read what i don’t post
i’ll endure all the pain again and hibernate in the void of emptiness just for you
"i’m soft for you, i’m as soft as i can ever get; missing you aches my heart, love. i hope someday you could understand how fragile i am when it comes to you"
she spends so much time in her own company but yet she doesn’t seem to know herself very well
"you’re important, stop running after people to prove that you matter"
your eyes are my favorite book to read
"at this point if you’re not good for my mental health, i will cut you the fuck out of my life"
please just understand how messy it gets inside my head sometimes
going for a walk alone is therapeutic
to sit with someone and talk for hours about anything and everything is so attractive
i hate how observant i am sometimes because i notice every little thing in every action and i get sad over the smallest things
i hope the thought of losing me terrifies you because you will never find me in anybody else
"i want to be the reason you don’t sleep at night, your mouth trying to find mine, and searching for air that is not found in your lungs"
one sided expectations will mentally destroy you
do you ever just suddenly feel utterly alone?
"i often wonder if you think of me as much as i think of you, if you talk about me as much as i talk about you, if you miss me as much as i miss you"
"she doesn’t know how beautiful she is, if only i could just lend her my eyes to see herself, sigh"
your face is the first thing my eyes want to see when i wake up
11:11; her
i just want to bury my face in her chest and forget about everything else
what can i say?  i want you all to myself
"don’t touch my heart if you’re not planning on staying, people wasted enough of my time already"
"she’s just tired of being used as an object, thrown aside when she’s no longer convenient, lied to about being wanted, and stabbed in the back when they got the chance. she has suffered one too many heartbreaks. she’s tired"
"when someone disappoints you again and again and again, thank them for being consistent and walk away, happily"
"do you ever like think about the first time you met them and compare it to where you are now and just think, fuck, who knew this would happen?"
"if you could find someone like that, someone who can hold you and close your eyes with passion and gentleness then you’re lucky. even if it only lasts a second, a minute, a day, you’re lucky"
i have this bad habit of wanting to please people and forgetting about myself
"i felt like bursting into tears, i wanted to scream my lungs out, i wanted to punch my wall, i wanted to kill myself. but all i could do was stare at the ceiling in silence"
"when she’s silent, she’s either blowing up or needs a hug or falling apart or crying inside, or all of the above"
my heart screamed but you weren’t here to hear it
but i have so much of you in my heart
"fuck nudes, show me your hands"
surround yourself with people who try make you a better person
another cup of coffee is never a bad idea
"it’s okay, there’s nothing wrong with not understanding yourself"
let this sink in. you’re not obligated to stay with someone who does nothing but make you question your worth
"yes, you. you deserve to be someone’s only choice"
"it’s heartwarming how someone can just enter your life out of nowhere and make it soft, it’s what makes life interesting. there’s always this hope for the future because you never know what diversions could come your way next"
and lately ‘i don’t know’ has become my only answer to everything
i’ve showed you parts of me that i wasn’t sure still existed
and maybe they leave because they see me the way i see myself
stop making promises you can’t keep
"yes, i don’t love myself. i don’t think i ever learned how to, but that doesn’t mean i am this empty of a person with apathy flowing through their veins, no.  i am so full of love and it hurts from bursting at the seams with how much love i can hold"
you deserve someone that is willing to risk everything for you
my sadness has taught me so much
can i come over and hold you and maybe put everything back together?
remember to smile and love yourself today when nobody else will
crawl inside my heart and find what hurts the most and love me there
"i fuck everything up, it’s my nature"
"you won’t handle my fucked up, nobody does"
"i know that everything can be quite exhausting no matter how much sleep or how much coffee you drink or how long you lay down in bed, i know. deep breath now, it’s going to be okay"
"yes, that’s exactly what i want. someone who smiles whenever they talk about me, someone who just won’t shut the fuck up about me"
"of all the things my hands have held, your face is by far my favorite thing"
i just wish i could hold you and end all your sufferings
"i was never good at small talk,  i’m always curious to know where all of these scars come from"
"sorry, i don’t mean to overthink and feel this sad, it just happens"
"no, i don’t want to spend an hour or a day or a week or a month or a year with you, i want to spend an entire fucking lifetime with you"
"nobody is always busy, it just really depends on what priority you are in their life"
she’s caught somewhere between wanting to live her life and trying to run away from it
to be held tightly by your arms every morning
sext: let’s go buy new books together
"‘some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are those remarkably rare, addictive ones who just bring out the most. of everything. they make you feel so alive that you’d follow them straight into hell..’ - Karen Marie Moning"
i see hidden beauty in her flaws
"come here, let me put flowers in your heart"
"i would like to go somewhere far away, away from everyone and everything, but i’d like you to be with me"
"no, you’re not allowed to just come into my life and start to matter and just walk away leaving me wondering what happened or if i had done something wrong, no"
"more coffee and less humans, please"
i’m sorry that i might be giving you everything without making sure you even want it
i’m slowly accepting that nobody will ever know me or love me entirely and that i only have myself
"don’t tell me to listen to my heart, mine doesn’t talk, it fucking bleeds and screams"
"to all the suicidal people out there; this is a sign to not kill yourself, you’re loved and the world is lucky to have you in it. don’t give up and keep holding on"
"i know i bottle everything up, i even hide my emotions and pretend to be okay, it’s not healthy, i know. but feeling like a burden or having others worry about me isn’t my forte, it never has been"
"is it selfish to want all of you? not just part of you or who you show others, no, utterly you"
"whatever you do,  just don’t hurt me  with your absence"
"just because you’re struggling right now doesn’t mean you’re failing, no, you don’t climb five steps all at once, you take one at a time and if you fall, well, you fucking stand up and keep going"
"it’s possible, but only if you want it bad enough"
and just like that you became a huge part of my life
"no, i don’t want to be your sometimes, i want to your goddamn everything"
combine your mess with mine and let’s form a beautiful disaster
"people leave, learn to be okay with that"
"god, this mind of mine is such a mess"
don’t give up on something that could be great just because it could also be difficult
"i sincerely apologize for being too hard on my self, i can’t seem to take things lightly anymore, carrying the weight on my shoulders became something natural to me"
"i’m in no position to tell you what you can and can’t do, i’m here to guide you not control you. if you want to put yourself in a position that could potentially ruin us, then so be it. what i can tell you is what i like and dislike; this is how i compromise"
some people come in your life to make it better. be one of those people
"tonight is heavy.  tonight is where i miss you terribly, tonight is where i want to die gently in your arms"
"and just because you don’t see the pain in my eyes, doesn’t mean that it’s not there"
perhaps you will never see the good in yourself if you stay fixated on what everyone thinks and says rather than giving yourself credit for who you’ve become
"no, i don’t want you to save me nor fix me, i want you to hold my hands and don’t let it go"
wrap your arms around me and make me feel something again
"relax now love, you’re going to look back and be glad you never gave up"
i need a hug. one of those hugs that are so tight you can literally feel their heartbeat and for a second everything just feels warm and safe
i just genuinely hate how my heart aches and feels like there’s a hole that i don’t know what to fill it with
i’ll pour you a cup of coffee and you’ll cook me breakfast and we’ll look into each other’s eyes and fall in love all over again
no amount of sleep will ever cure this tiredness
"don’t test me, you’ll lose me in a blink of an eye"
you get sick and tired of going through the same shit over and over again
do you ever just feel like you don’t connect with anyone anymore?
why are you still there and not here?
you could be my favorite book to read every morning
"‘feelings don’t just walk away, people do’"
and the greatest risk i ever took was break my walls for someone who wasn’t capable of rebuilding them with me
"how much longer are we going to pretend that everything is getting better, when it’s not"
"but hey, at least your face makes me smile"
"the sadness never really left, i just got better at fake smiling"
i could start a war with what i feel for you
she showed me the good in myself
"waiting for someone is putting yourself on hold, and that’s unfair to the person you’re trying to become"
"despite all the things i have going on in my life, you’re still the first thing i think about every morning"
"i don’t think i’ll ever get over her smile. to be honest, i don’t want to"
she’s still trying to be alone without feeling lonely
i miss looking in your eyes the most
"you would be amazed at how easily it is to part ways with people forever, and that is why if you want to keep someone you have to do something about it"
"fuck, i found myself thinking about you again"
she wrote about him as if he put stars in the sky
"ok March. i’m ready. i’m ready to feel good things, make me feel good things"
everyone’s a mess but i like your mess the most
and when someone treats me right you're going to realize how wrong you were to me
why do i overthink too much and still make the wrong decisions
i'm isolating myself again
"holding hands is never about showing off or possessiveness, it’s about speaking without words, it’s about i want you with me and don’t let go"
‘don’t think about what can happen in a month. don’t think about what can happen in a year. just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be’ - Eric Thomas
i’m sorry if i ran out of energy and tendency to deal with people
but writing about someone is another form of showing your love to them
be with someone who tells you that they love you and know they goddamn mean it
i just want to get high and watch the moon with you
"love me tonight, or maybe forever"
but do you ever listen to a song and picture her right there looking in your eyes bro?
she’s somewhere stuck between not wanting to let go and not wanting to get hurt
"and no matter how much a person can mean to you, sometimes it doesn’t seem to make the slightest difference to them"
it’s sad right? how someone can effect you that much that you have to write about them
the sadness is too much sometimes
but do you kiss her forehead every night and remind her what she means to you motherfucker?
"what about all the music i shared with them, fuck"
"i saw it coming, i just didn’t want to believe it"
i scare people away to save them from all the pain i could put them through
sometimes it's just so hard to let go of something that makes you smile often
when nothing makes sense just breathe and let it happen on its own
i like my weirdness sometimes though
she called my mess beautiful and became a part of it
she made me bite my lips a lot
i try to feel better but it never takes long enough before i hit another wall and fall back again
i could feel you in a whisper but you couldn’t even hear me screaming your name
here’s a reminder that you don’t need people who don’t need you
i hope you listen to the songs i sent you and think of me sometimes
i need more of you and less of this world
words may never be enough to describe her
she told me to not look them in the eyes because she thought i'd look at them the same way i look at her
"i don’t want to just touch you, no, i want to make you feel things"
mornings don’t make sense without you
it terrifies me what i would do for you and how far i would go
i love the conversations our eyes had
you deserve the kind of love you would give to someone else
i just want to take away your sadness and make you feel alright
perhaps she just wants to be understood
"this time i won’t wait and look at my screen for your text, i won’t text you to remind you that i exist, if you want me you will have to show me"
"‘look, let me put it this way; with me, you’re number one and there isn’t even a number two’  - Charles Bukowski"
her laugh is contagious; i couldn’t help but stare at her lips and smile
i saw heaven in her eyes
"i can’t make you understand what’s happening inside me, i can barely even explain it to myself"
i just wanted you to miss me the same way that i miss you
it’s difficult for me to gain any feelings towards anyone but when i do.. oh fuck
stop wasting time looking back on memories that hurt you and start making new ones that make you smile
not everybody you want deserves what you do for them
i want to hold her and make her feel alive again
"i want my words back. every single one of them, i’ve said too much to the wrong people and now i feel a part of me just no longer fits there"
"i don’t know what kills more, talking to you or not talking to you"
i’m jealous of everyone that gets to see you everyday
what’s poetry if it isn’t about her?
her hate towards me is attractive
accept the fact that some people just aren’t good for you and stop trying to see the good that isn’t there
sometimes letting go is the only choice you have
there were so many reasons for me to leave but yet i stayed
a shity personality always ruins a pretty face
can i hide between your arms tonight?
be careful who you put your walls down for
i want to be found and at the same time i don’t
i just want to be that one person you’re scared to lose
i want nothing if it’s not true
she might just be the only flower left that i want to keep watering
"show me your worst side,  show me the real you,  show me how vulnerable you become, i want to see all of it"
and why stick around someone who causes nothing but pain to your heart?
"get it out, unburden yourself and say what you feel"
stop investing your energy and time into toxic people
just because we’re not talking all the time doesn’t mean i don’t miss you all the time
this heart needs a hug
and where do sad people belong in this world?
3 am;
tell me how you feel because the way you act is confusing me
look at her and tell me love doesn’t exist
i always wonder if she would ever get lost in me the way she gets lost in books
"but i wouldn’t think of myself as enough for anybody, i’m either too much or i’m too hard to handle and i got stuck somewhere in between"
i write so that maybe one day you could read about yourself
she brightens up any dark day
this is torture  this distance between us
"open up, i promise to be gentle"
"everything has beauty, it just takes the right person to see it"
my mind turns into a mess when it comes to you
stop wasting your time thinking about how they spend theirs
remember to be good to yourself when nobody else is
i just really don’t like talking about how i feel
drink more coffee and smile more often
"some things are too heavy to feel, they don’t let you breathe, they won’t let you forget, your heart may cry in pain, beg for forgiveness, and no matter how hard you try, they slowly eat you alive"
"don’t use your problems and issues as a reason to hurt others, you don’t know what that person is going through"
"no, you don’t miss them, you just miss having someone there for you"
you don’t need them to say it you just feel it
i’m just waiting for that someone who holds me and makes me feel good about myself
"my mind fucks me up more than anything in this world, the scenarios it makes and how much i think about them exhausts me, i’m too much and i can’t help but think of the worst"
and when i finally knew what to say you weren’t here to listen
your biggest mistake is making someone a priority in your life when you’re simply not one of them
attachments are so fucking draining
i know that loving me could be easier if i wasn’t this numb
they eventually get tired of your sadness
how can you keep asking to be loved when all you do is push people away?
me flirting: want to stare at the ceiling together?
be the kind of person that makes others feel warm and safe
‘sometimes you are going to miss a person who was an almost to you. and feel sad because there is no name for that feeling. you just feel it in a way that makes you tired to your very bones’ - Nikita Gill
i guess being nice just doesn’t work with some people
i don’t think you’re ready to hear my thoughts yet
there are poems and then there is you
i write because nobody understands me better than words
you gave her issues and now i’m stuck with dealing with them
sometimes it hurts to lose people but what if they didn’t want to stay?
"we’re under the same moon, remember?"
you know what fucking hurts? is putting aside your issues for the wrong person
"you weren’t there when i needed you, why should i?"
i’ve been talking to the stars about you lately
i no longer put any expectations
"i want assurance, my trust issues are slowly killing me"
"it’s okay, i’m good at blaming myself for everything"
her mess is the greatest art i’ve seen
i’m always struggling between wanting to go out and having fun with people and avoiding any human contact at the same time
being the reason someone else is smiling always makes me happy
i’ve been romanticizing pain for too long that i have forgotten how to greet happiness when it comes knocking on my door
"open your heart, i need to have a conversation with it"
"i don’t want you to battle my wars, i want you to stand beside me"
it’s important to talk to yourself
i shouldn’t have given you the chance to do this to me but i did anyways
i hate myself for opening up to the wrong people
it’s a beautiful day to leave me the fuck alone
for once i want something unexpected to happen without already seeing it coming
let’s talk about how we choose to not acknowledge what we feel because it’s so much easier than to let it kill us
stop confusing lust with love please
"i need to be nicer to myself, i can’t keep draining myself like this"
i’ve lost my heart and now i’m losing my mind thinking about you
when will i hear this?
sometimes it’s okay if you end up never talking to someone who meant everything to you
but how many times have you held back what you really want to say and just kept it all inside you?
"i have no intentions in loving you by halves, it’s not my nature, i either give it my everything or i just immediately step out"
"i’m not a choice, it’s either all or nothing at all"
my mind isn’t letting me sleep
will you be the sunrise i stay up all night for?
but i want to be with you everywhere
i need one of those long silent hugs
i lost my thoughts looking at you
we’re just strangers who know each other very well
remember to love yourself as much as you want someone else to love you
i don’t think you know the impact you have over me
write me a love letter saying how much you miss me
"you gave them so much of you, you gave them everything you could offer and yet they treated you like it was never good enough"
"no matter how useless you are feeling right now, you’re someone’s reason they’re happy"
"i want to know everything, i just don’t know what to ask"
you’re the last thing i want to let go of and the first thing i want to hold on to
"don’t ever convince somebody to love you or stay with you, if they don’t see what’s special about you then they don’t deserve your time"
her eyes were the only thing i wanted to look at
"i’ll let my mind take over for a while, my heart is tired"
"this is exhausting, thinking too much about something i’m unsure about"
what am i doing to myself?
being lonely with you sounds better
‘i am overflowing with words i do not have’  - Adam Falkner
"february, be nice"
i’ve always liked this idea of not being what people expect me to be
"drugs aren’t enough, i need you too"
she hates it when people see her cry because she wants to appear strong and at the same time she hates how nobody notices how torn apart she is
do you ever just get tired of repeating yourself to everyone you meet?
i’m happier when you’re around
a good relationship doesn’t necessarily mean you both love the exact same things but rather someone who’s willing to try new things for the sake of his partner even if they have no interest in doing it
at some point it becomes a struggle to explain yourself
stop blaming yourself for everything
your name sounds different said by someone who loves you
"‘well, the rain had stopped but the pain was still there’  - Charles Bukowski"
put effort into the things that only matter
fast replies are hot
i’m coming to your funeral dressed like this
"if you have the chance to treat them how they treated you, i hope you choose to walk away"
"i smile, i talk, i act like everything is completely fine while carrying an enormous weight of unhappiness inside me"
her favorite book says a lot about her
come sit in silence with me
"i’m beyond repair, i’m craving affection yet i don’t want it, my heart aches but i let it, i crave your soft touch yet it scares me"
"please don’t disappoint me, i’ve had too many disappointments in my life already"
she called me beautiful and it melted my heart
i thought you knew me better then this
sext: so what songs made you cry the most?
"i’m always quiet, i’m always having conversations with myself"
"attachments no longer scare me, losing someone who was once a big part of my life isn’t surprising"
but i’m still here and you’re not
i want your hands on me more often
how far are you inside your head?
my thoughts are too loud for words
"the music isn't loud enough, i need speakers in my head, my thoughts are too loud tonight and i can't control them"
"no matter what i feel, i’ll keep it inside me, if i have to cry i’ll cry on the inside, if i bleed, i’ll bruise, and if my heart aches i’ll let it"
"‘i grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others’  - Edgar Allan Poe"
"don’t test my patience, you could mean the world to me today and by tomorrow you’re considered dead to me"
i usually don’t know what to say so i just distance myself from everybody and stay in my own bubble
let me bury myself in your hands and forget the world even existed
stop running away from everything that’s trying to put you back together
some people just don’t have a place in your life anymore and you have to accept that
"i'm selfish, i want you all to myself"
"i hate sounding weak, i hate wanting someone"
what is enough? how do you stop wanting more? how do you get enough of a person
you're the only light left in my life
the sky knows all my secrets
i think a lot about the distance between us and i don’t like it
you’ll hurt yourself thinking this much
"effort, consistency, and dedication, what’s sexier than that?"
i hope the day comes where you realize what i did for you  wasn’t easy
the moon and i are having conversations tonight
can i play with your hair and call you pretty tonight?
my favorite poem was my lips on your forehead
11:11 you’re my every second wish
"even at your worst, you are fucking beautiful"
i hate this world because you’re not here
you get tired of explaining yourself over the same things
i’m lost between not knowing what i feel and what i want to feel
stop being silent about the things that matter
lately even words aren’t expressing my thoughts very well
"you are enough, remember that"
"focus on your goals, these people want nothing but to waste your time"
it’s just so hard not to look at her
she’ve lost control over all the hurt and sadness buried inside of her
don’t apologize for feeling too much
"i’m no longer asking anybody to stay in my life, if you want to leave i’ll hold the door open for you"
after a while losing people no longer affects you the same way it once did
she said she wasn’t perfect but i didn’t see anything that i disliked about her
i like touching other people’s soul
"smile at me more often, it warms my heart"
but is it okay to like this sadness?
treat those who are still try to make you laugh while they’re going through difficulty in their lives with kindness
"with you, everythig feels alright"
"i can be a very forgiving person, just not with anybody"
once i lose interest there’s no going back
always remind yourself that you don’t have to do what everyone else is doing
you knew she was fragile but you dropped her anyways
such a nice feeling when someone genuinely checks up on you and wants to know how your life is going
*whispers to my cup of coffee help me*
"i don’t care if it’s a relationship or a job or a life style, if it doesn’t make you happy then let it fucking go"
"no thanks, i’ll use sex as my cardio"
"that’s the thing, i’ve taught myself how to survive alone"
know the difference between someone who only talks to you in their free time and someone who actually makes time for you
you will walk among people unaware of their sufferings but yet you will judge them based on what? their outer lives? fuck off
you know what’s attractive? an actual conversation
but every broken heart has screamed at least once or twice
she tends to distance herself because she feels that everybody is just eventually going to leave
let me just hop on this real quick #10yearscallenge
"remember that you were a piece of art before they started admiring you, and you’ll continue to be art when they’re gone"
"don’t ‘what’s wrong’ me, that doesn’t work anymore"
respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that doesn’t make you happy
"she told me that her healing began when she stopped praying for them to come back, and started praying to find herself again"
"i don't like the fact that you're so far away, come here, come closer, i need your touch, i need your warmth"
i'm a sucker for soft hands and warm souls
i don't see you in my dreams anymore
it just doesn’t feel right when you’re not around
"i'm not sure where life will take me, but i just hope it's somewhere nice"
"i’m still trying to stop the smallest things from ruining my day, i’m still trying to stop lingering over all the could have, should have and would haves, i’m still trying to stop thinking of how much better i could have done, i’m still learning"
don’t take it personally but i literally don’t talk to anyone unless they talk to me first
i’ll still love you even when you’re struggling to love yourself
she’s not getting over it she’s getting used to it
"take the first step, tell people how you truly feel about them, stop fearing rejection, stop feeling so engulfed with thoughts that aren’t even true, and stop wasting your fucking time"
you’re killing yourself to find a person that’ll kill for you
"stop longing for things that are out of your reach, wake up in the morning with a smile on your face and let yourself be happy, you deserve that much"
i’ve touched too many hearts but never my own
"show me all the parts of you that you’re afraid of, let me kiss every single part of them"
"break, break in my arms and i’ll try not to fix you but mend you back together for all there is, you’ll be in my arms"
attachments
i want to lay next to you and listen to the beat of your heart i want to close my eyes and fall asleep in your arms
"don't compare me with anybody else, i'm not them, and i never will be"
"love me, and don't stop"
it's easier to love yourself when someone else is in love with you
it’s a quiet morning filled with love and coffee
"she’s not good at expressing her feelings, she likes to bottle everything up"
here’s a reminder that you’re worthy of the most beautiful things in life
the mere words ‘i miss you’ sometimes has much more depth than we realize
"sometimes things don’t work out no matter how badly you want them to, sometimes you just have to let go no matter how badly you want to hold on"
"our eyes met, i haven’t stopped thinking about them ever since"
"BAD GRAMMAR IS A HUGE TURN OFF, I REPEAT, BAD GRAMMAR IS A HUGE TURN OFF, that’s it, that’s the tweet"
she had this bad habit of forgiving people who aren’t even sorry
i'm not always this sad
"stay, even if it hurts, but stay"
my brain needs to stop having too many tabs open
you just don’t forget unspoken feelings
looking at her makes me feel things
"the person you’re becoming will cost you people, relationships, heartbreaks, spaces and materials; choose yourself over everything"
"well well well, if it isn’t the thoughts i’ve been trying to avoid"
missing someone can sometimes be the best poem ever written
"they will hate because they have nothing better to do, but you on the other hand just keep focusing on improving yourself"
"i won’t be sorry for not being the person you wanted me to be, i was meant to be someone who i’m always dreaming of to be"
sometimes two cold hearts is how warmth is formed
i have so much warmth and love i want to give you
"just us, nothing else"
is the cold matching your heart dear?
she’s the only notification that puts a smile on my face
"i’ve always craved knowledge, i’ve always been full of questions"
she enjoys making a mess out of me
"i want to do things to you nobody has ever done before, i want to leave a permanent sign of me in your heart"
"i know you saw the pain on my face, and you did nothing about it"
"but when you love someone, you love the whole person, just as they are, and not how you would like them to be"
people who share music with you are important
"accept your own aloneness, and then accept the time when the gap is filled, but they have to come, you can’t force them"
a victim of her own insecurities
"share everything with me, i want all of it"
"share your pain with me, let me absorb it all out of you"
don’t come into my life expecting me to stay when you won’t do the same
"i’ll make you proud of me one day, father"
but how is anyone suppose to know how she feels when she has nobody to talk to?
"i’m not always nice, you know"
i just need you to care more on days that i feel like slipping away
my biggest mistake was when i put someone else before me
the weather needs to calm the fuck down
my soul has been calling your name to hold me tightly
i can still taste her lips in my mouth
she’s just so beautiful..
if you keep burying your sadness under your skin then what else can it do but grow in your veins?
sext: show me your book collection
and where were you when everything fell apart?
"she was unsure which pain was worse, letting go or the ache of what could have been"
it takes bravery to be soft too
friends who understand what you're trying to say without even saying it &gt;&gt;
"you’re the one i want to write about, the one i want to love endlessly, the one i want to hold and not stop looking at"
"you never truly understand a person until you consider things from their point of view, until you dig deep inside their skin and walk around it"
i’m not so good at loving myself
people who still enjoy just going out for walks are my favorite
"but don’t you already know better? hearts are breakable and even when you heal, you’re never the same again"
"it's crazy what words can do sometimes, just shreds your insides a part"
by breakfast i meant open your legs
it’s so attractive when someone is all about you and isn’t afraid to show it
a walk in this rain holding hands and not a single word
"i apologize that i couldn’t see the pain in your eyes, i was too caught up in my own"
you’re a disaster and i love it
"i’m not quite sure i even fit anywhere, dear"
"give me a reason to stay, pull me closer and give me a sign to show me that you care"
i hate mornings that begin with loneliness
"put your smile on, it suits you"
"i mean, look at that face and tell me you can’t fall in love"
"but if you could choose to be anybody, would you choose yourself?"
i just like the idea of being there with people but actually being somewhere else in my mind
you know i'm no good yet you choose to stay
finishing whats left unsaid
some people just don't deserve all the effort you put into them
i don't want negative people in my life this year
you’re never too much for someone who can’t get enough of you
let 2019 be full of love and softness
this morning try to let go of everything you didn't do right and all the negative things people have said and put all that focus into yourself
i’m still learning to walk away from things that are not meant for me
but this kindness in me sometimes leaves and that’s the reason why some days i have to be alone
do i get jealous? yes do i hate myself for it? definitely
her words are the reason why you want to wake up everyday
she has this way that makes my heart melt in the palm of her hands
"sigh, those thoughts again"
share your darkest secrets with me so i know it’s real
you’re scared and i don’t blame you
no you don’t fucking just come and go from somebody’s life and think that it’s okay
do you ever wonder who’s mind you cross while they’re laying down in bed at 3 am or as soon as they open their eyes in the morning or even sitting in the middle of the class?
"stay close, always"
but if you don’t get it off your chest you may never breathe again
"that’s okay, we’ll get through this"
"you can live inside my head, i wouldn’t mind"
you never stop trying for the ones you love
the moon knows all my secrets
"i was raised to be nice first, because you can always be an ass later, but once you’ve been an ass to someone they won’t believe the nice anymore, so be nice until it’s time to stop being nice then destroy them"
"but that’s my favorite part of the day, when it’s just the two of us"
imagine seeing their soul instead of their bodies
the smell of freshly brewed coffee in the morning and how our hands should touch more often
"maybe it’s okay to say ‘this really hurts so i’m going to stop trying’ it sets a dangerous precedent, not just for avoiding pain but avoiding life itself"
but i’ve always been dead inside and nobody really noticed
don’t you get it? i never allow anyone close enough to hurt me
if they won’t listen to what you have to say then don’t waste your time and just walk away
“You” is my new favorite series
wear my hands around your neck like it’s your favorite necklace
i will take it personal because i wouldn’t have ever done the same to you
i never understood how i can be this empty all the fucking time
i’m sorry my jealousy fucks me up
"either take me as i am or leave me as a i am, but don’t try to change something about me because you have no idea what it took to reach this state"
as much as i want to share my love i don’t have anything left in me to give
i melt every time
"don't bring drama into my life, i've had enough of it thank you"
i miss the conversations that our eyes made
"but i don’t just want to have an impact on your heart, no, i want to have an impact on your whole existence"
don’t forget that different eyes see different things
she brings out the tenderness in me
what’s mine is only mine
the type of kisses where you feel their soul colliding with yours
talking to people can be very exhausting
the smaller your circle the better it is
teach me how to feel and i'll teach you how to love all over again
isn’t that what you really need? just one person that understands?
i’m tired of wanting to sleep and not getting any sleep
i’m attracted to kindness and softness
"but i want you raw, naked, vulnerable, and in your softest form possible"
tell me you’ll stay through it all
i need to look in your eyes and know if it’s true
insomnia and the urge to drink more coffee don’t mix well
fighting for a person can be so exhausting
"i know, sometimes i don’t stand me too"
i know too many secrets i shouldn't know
but not everyone sees the warmness in you
we have a lot to discuss starting with how can someone be that beautiful
perhaps having you in my arms could help me sleep faster
thinking about coffee and all the ways to make you smile
"fall down, but just make sure to raise back again"
with all these flaws  you're still very lovable
i want nothing but to dissolve myself in your arms
she was everything but then she became nothing but a fading memory
"i never usually say anything about the future or my upcoming year, but 2018 was by far the worst year of my life so 2019 will be nothing but happiness for me"
i decided that 2019 will be my happy year
nothing but fake people nowadays it’s fucking ridiculous
i fall in love with the little things
i just want to love you in ways you've never been loved in
she won't wait forever
she has sadness living in places sadness shouldn't live in
"i'm sorry if you get offended, i meant every word"
"i'm not heartless, but my happiness will no longer depend on others, not anymore"
"i don’t have a type, but she’s the example"
"that’s nice, but does she read poetry?"
but what kind of drug are you?
everything is different with headphones
it’s sad to think that we went through it all just to be strangers again
"it’s not my fault you got attached, i told you i was no good for anybody"
"dear whoever reads my tweets, they’re not about anybody, i simply write whatever comes in mind, but if the shoe fits be my guest, thank you in advance"
"poetry is the only thing left soft in the world, please don’t ruin it"
i highly advice you not to come near me when i’m moody
"i’m here watching from afar, but i’m here"
"late replies are literally the biggest turn off anybody could do, it’s like a person goes from 200 all the way to -0"
sorry but i’m not interested in someone who wants everyone
we looked at each other with nothing but love
she tastes like heaven but god knows she was made for sinning
maybe i’m just lost in my mind with my thoughts
"it's like when you don't know someone, they're more interesting, they can be anything you want them to be, but when you get to know them there's limits to them"
i told myself i wouldn't but i fucking did
just do what you can today and stop worrying about tomorrow okay?
come in my arms when everything falls apart
you’re so warm sometimes my heart hurts
i’m still convinced that i don’t fit in relationships
my demons follow me everywhere
let’s spend tonight curled up in each others arms
and if i told you that i destroy everything i put my hands on would you still love me?
"it was good for a while, being empty, i didn’t hurt anyone. but as time went by it was like i could hear myself begging for permission to come back"
loneliness has taught me how to survive alone
i enjoy listening to you
people who have actually been really sad in their life can tell you that there’s nothing beautiful about depression
sometimes i just really hate waking up
how many broken hearts have you survived?
"it’s better this way, maybe a bit lonelier but better"
how just your presence changes everything
"i mean, i can’t, i can’t keep holding my hands back from wanting to touch you"
my hands between your thighs with your eyes staring right through me
"come here, i want to show you all the love you have been waiting for"
our biggest lies are the ones we tell ourselves
her eyes told me everything she tried hiding
"i know love, we all have our scars from loving someone too deeply"
coffee and you in my arms is all i can think about right now
my battles were never yours to fight
i don’t want anyone else to have you
but you have no idea how glad i am for your existence
"i don’t leave, i just distance myself"
sometimes i need time for myself to recharge
her arms make me feel whole again
i’m always haunted by the idea that i’m wasting my life on something not worthy in the end
i’m still trying to put words together and form a proper sentence but i can’t
"some girls are like the stars, but prettier"
she spent too much time in my head that she forgot to live in her own
the weather is so lovely today
they'll only point out your flaws to make you feel weak
"it’s very frustrating to not be understood in this world, you say one thing and you keep getting told that you mean something else is just too much sometimes"
people who ask how your parents are always have a place in my heart
long hugs can do so much
i just want more of you and less of the world
december and it’s charm
"your arms, they're the safest place to be in"
"i don’t want to think right now, if i do, i’ll go crazy and i’ll most likely think about it tomorrow too"
you do realize that the more you think about it the more you keep it a part of your life right?
"try listening to your own voice, your instincts, a lot of people listen to the world instead of themselves and wonder what they’re doing wrong"
why stress over people who don't even text to see how you're doing?
i'm powerless when it comes to dealing with myself
"Christmas and new years, i like December"
"i have good news, November is finally finishing today"
let's fix each other first
"her fingers in my beard and my hands on her thighs, i dare you not to call that poetry"
"i don't feel sad, i don't feel anything anymore"
"whether it ends well or not, it was an experience"
sometimes all you need is a little bit of time
everyday you try to convince yourself that tomorrow is going to be different but it never does
how do you expect me to trust your feelings when they can just disappear like that?
celebrate your own personal victories because nobody else seems to understand what it took to accomplish them
i can't afford to lose anymore time of my life with people who do nothing but waste it
don't let them consume you
"i know that sometimes you feel that your heart will never the same ever again but believe me when i tell you that it heals, you will be whole again, i promise"
i look in her eyes and i just know
my cat sleeps in my arms every night and that is probably the warmest feeling i get before i sleep
"it’s okay, i know being alive can be so lonely"
but you are my late night thoughts
the smell of fresh coffee and your lips for breakfast
but where does all this sadness come from?
"if i do something i hate for you, then this is what it means to be in love"
listening to her heartbeat gives me inspiration
"sometimes you just want to be happy, even if it's not real"
our hands should be holding each other more often
sometimes we burn and other times  we heal
woke up to the sound of rain and i couldn’t be happier
sext:
all the memories of you are slowly fading away
you’d be surprised how many people are dead inside and still manage to wake up everyday and have no idea who they are
"sometimes people don’t come back, and sometimes it’s for the better"
my words aren’t about you anymore
car rides with my dad are my favorites
but will you take care of my heart?
i'm teaching myself how to love all over again
god i needed this peace of mind
"RAMI MALEK NAILED BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, LITERALLY NAILED IT"
"she had you, and that’s all she needed"
i like the way she talks to the moon
how she handles me says a lot about her
"someday your heart is going to stop beating, and none of your fears or insecurities will matter, the only thing that will matter is how you lived your life"
my worst struggle is being hungry and not knowing what to eat
it's scary how your life depends on how well you do as a teenager
yes i'd love to wipe that red lipstick off of your lips with my lips
"and i will write, i will write till i can't write anymore, i will write till my fingers bleed poetry and all i have is you on my mind"
she holds me and i feel whole again
i look in her eyes and i forget everything else
you’re doing well if you lose interest in looking back
at some point you have to accept that others don't see what you do
don’t let love blind you from how toxic a person can be to you
i can feel the loneliness in your eyes and i hope someday you can understand that everything that hurt you was everything that made you who you are today
"i either care too much or your existence doesn’t matter to me, there’s no in between"
it gets lonely among people too
"you're trying, and that's enough"
stop fearing losing what needs to be lost
meditate and drink a lot of water
stop destroying yourself in order to please everyone else
"‘something else is hurting you, that’s why you need pot or whiskey, or whips and rubber suits, or screaming music turned so fucking loud you can’t think’  - Charles Bukowski, Tales of Ordinary Madness"
don’t get surprised by how fast people can change
this time i’m only choosing me
people only remember the sacrifices you wouldn't make
stop leaving pieces of yourself to people and wonder why you feel so empty
you know what’s really fun right now? making others feel loved and valued
"i need more, i want more of you"
life is too fucking short to be angry at yourself for being human
wrap yourself around my heart and stay there
"trust me, this too will pass"
"if you think i’m rude, you’re wrong, i’m just brutally honest"
do you ever wonder what would people think if you just utterly disappeared
i just want to lay my head on your chest and listen to your heartbeat
you should help me get my soul back
i have so much i want to say but i just don't know where to start
now i can finally breathe once again
how small this world is sometimes
"i have my headphones on, that means you don’t fucking talk to me"
but i want you here and always
"'you have to die a few times first, till you can really live' - Charles Bukowski"
don’t get sucked in my sadness
how can someones eyes have this much beauty
let's just hug without saying a word
help me feel something
"if it hurts you that much, what kind of that love was that?"
i'm slowly turning into a morning person
"the pain passes, it always does"
don't let them take the light behind your eyes and the smile behind your tears
"it's okay, the sadness helps me write"
at this point i’ve got nothing to offer anybody
not too many people last this long in my life
nothing feels better than having company that appreciates your presence
good or bad i want to be the first to know everything
everything is just so different in my head
"of course i changed, i realized that i deserve so much better"
"expectations isn’t always about what people expect of you, sometimes it’s about what you expect of yourself"
how heavy does it get at night?
all the words i didn’t write are all the words i really mean
every small detail about her is beautiful
but the sun will keep rising no matter what
i have a lot to say
take my heart and turn it into art
i never fucking stop trying
your value doesn’t decrease based on someone’s inability to see your worth
you’re never going to find yourself if you’re lost in somebody else
"i'm still young, i'm still learning, i'm still processing what life really is, i make mistakes and i fuck up, but i'm still me"
people who still just go on walks and talk for hours will always be my favorite
but do you know how long i’ve been waiting for things to get better?   they still haven’t
"honestly though, i’d rather be home alone than in a room full of people who don’t even care about my well being"
"you’re the only person responsible for your happiness, stop expecting others to give it to you"
i hate remembering the good times i spent with people who ended up disappointing me
i need people who never stop showing me how important i am to them
we expect too much from people who don’t even know themselves
i've always preferred loneliness over fake company
but does he wipe your tears and hug you tightly?
i think of love whenever i look at you
"incase nobody told you today, you’re doing great and everything’s going to be okay"
i want you in my arms just like how your lips should be in my mouth
it’s just sad that nothing happens like you imagine it will
but they do everything they said they wouldn't
stop faking your interests just to make someone like you
home is her arms wrapped around me at my worst
"if they wanted to, they would’ve"
"i mean, why aren’t you in my arms right now"
let's get high and talk about how we really feel
knowing someone who thinks you’re interesting enough to talk to everyday is one of the best feelings ever
"thinking of you keeps me awake, and being with you keeps me going"
"if someone makes you feel, let them"
but the moon is so beautiful right now
i remember the first time i held your hands and how much it was going to hurt if i ever let it go
last year was so different that it made me realize what a year can do to a person
i need you beside me more often
where did i go wrong in loving you with my whole heart?
"people are shit, dear"
"life only happens once, make sure you spend it doing what you want and with people who put a smile on your face"
you’re going to bring out a side of me that i really don’t like
"i had so much to say to them, i had so much inside me but i’d rather choke on my own words than allow anybody to see me in any state of vulnerability"
you don’t want to be like me you don’t want to see the things i’ve seen
let’s just go somewhere and never come back
"i need you to be stop being so far away, i need you in my arms"
surround yourself with people who push you to be a better person
i followed the moon and it led me to you
sext: i hope you read good books and kiss someone who thinks you’re beautiful
you’ve been always my favorite kind of night
but yours is a library full of secrets
nothing feels better than seeing the softer side of someone only shown to you
i can’t look at you and not want to kiss you
"yes change is scary, but what’s even scarier is letting fear stop you from growing, evolving and progressing"
just because your heart is heavy doesn’t mean you’re weak
i was never enough and i never will be
why is it that we only believe the negative things people say about us?
6 am coffee and a good book
my loneliness is killing me
be with someone who doesn’t have to leave to realize that they should’ve stayed
you deserve the love you keep trying to give everyone else
"i’m either full of emotions or no emotions at all, there’s no in between"
if i share music with you just know that you really mean a lot to me
i only wanted to hear her voice
i'll still love you at your worst
because that smile you see on my face has always been caused by you
"a lot of people feel like they don’t deserve love, they quietly walk away into empty spaces trying to close gaps of the past"
"i have a lot to say, but i’ve lost the desire to"
"i just need freedom from my own thoughts, is that so hard to ask for"
after a while you just get used to everything
don't wear the mask you wear with everyone else with me
words sometimes never mean what we want them to mean
do you ever just get in the mood where you want to listen to really loud music
sometimes i just can’t stop staring at you
"2:11 am, you, me and the sea"
stop saying yes to shit you hate
i’ve spent so much time letting people go that i’ve forgotten how to let new ones in
she says it doesn't bother her but her eyes tell a different story
"i don't chase people, if they want to spend time with me they will do so, if not, i'm content with my own company"
i hope your life turns out to be ‘i can’t believe i did this’ rather than ‘i should’ve done it’
i just want to let go of every negative thought that goes through my mind
it's just that i don't mind waking up to your face every morning
"be soft, kind and loving, but don’t take shit from anybody"
"never see yourself through the eyes of people who don’t value you, know your worth even if they don’t"
sometimes i just wake up and not feel a thing
some days are better off not talking to anybody
don’t forget the people who were there for you when nobody else was
sigh..
i woke up wanting to be in your arms
"according to poets, girls like you only belong in books"
pretty eyes makes this world worth living in
i don't like me when i'm mad either
"being ""raised right"" doesn't mean you don't drink, smoke or have sex before marriage, being raised right is about how you treat people, your manners and respect are keys"
"you're my favorite, and i don't plan on losing you"
"love in her eyes, love everywhere"
i’m still trying to process this whole adulthood thing
kisses on your body as if it was a map to heaven
she’s the brightest flower of them all
but i'm only good to you
i just want you to know how lucky i am to have someone like you in my life
and now i just sit in silence hoping you could understand me
you’re better off alone than being with someone who makes you feel alone
i will never understand what the fuck is wrong with people
no offense but if your friend is excited about something and you make them feel stupid for being excited about it then you’re by far the worst friend anybody could have
you give too many chances and you'll end up very disappointed
do you ever wish you could see the same exact moment someone who hurt you realizes that they fucked up?
i can’t wait till i wake up one day and just smile knowing there’s something worth waking up to
"life will teach you to never depend on anybody, ever"
"i'm not sad anymore, i'm just tired of this place"
"october, be gentle now"
"come here, i'll play with your hair and watch you fall asleep"
i hate it when i run out of words
i know what it's like to be scared of your own thoughts
be a good person but stop wasting time proving it
'everybody has a chapter they don't read out loud'
"eye contact, how souls fall in love"
watching her sleep is priceless
"your eyes were full of wander and life, that’s why i picked you"
a morning spent thinking about coffee and you
"first, you care, then you get hurt"
"i'm just watching, from far away"
i only wanted to be a part of you that you refuse to give to anybody
"you don’t need the perfect relationship, having someone who loves your weirdness and wants to spend time with you and respects you beats anything else"
it hurts my eyes to see you in pain
"maybe it won't work out, but maybe seeing if it does warms my heart"
such a terrible feeling to see someone you love filled with nothing but sadness
why is wanting you with me all the time so goddamn fucking hard?
but i see something in you that i can’t explain
"remember, i never forget how people made me feel"
i just want to touch your warm body with my cold hands
such a pretty face with a dirty mouth
she makes me want to enjoy life again
i'm hoping that whatever is coming is better than what's gone
those eyes melt all the ice around my heart
try loving yourself as much as you want other people to
"you're a survivor, remember that"
red lipstick will always be a weakness
it's not my fault that i wake up everyday
you sometimes wish they could be in your place to know how you feel
friends you've had for years could change in days
"don’t test me, my words could cut right through you"
i forgive the world because you're in it
i have so much things going on right now but you’re always the first thing i think about when i wake up
it's a world full of feelings that i don't have the words for
how long do i have to be patient for
i just want to give you everything
"you never grow when you're comfortable around someone, they always bring out your inner child without hesitation"
‘the best thing my heart ever did was to love you’
i often distance myself from everybody to have enough space to deal with myself
i never thought i'd get this attached too
"it's okay, i'm full of mistakes too"
are we fucking or loving or both
some things just never change
5 am coffee and my arms around your waist
she puts this stupid smile on my face without any effort
if you’re happy doing something don’t allow others to make you stop doing it just because they don’t like it
i have a completely different war zone inside my head
you can't love someone who doesn't want to be loved
maybe we’re just creating words out of sadness
how do you survive being yourself
people just no longer matter to me like they used to
love is the reason i have all of these words bottled up in my head
too much coffee and water and so little sleep
"you eventually start losing control over everything, even the thoughts in your head"
i just want to love you enough for you to love yourself
she’s all a person really needs
but can you love them as much as you miss them?
"i hate it when i can't hold in my loneliness, what do normal people do when they get this sad i wonder"
i'm such a coward when it comes to hurting you
"what am i doing wrong, what am i missing"
sometimes you just can't pretend anymore
those eyes could easily break a heart
stop letting people make you feel like you don’t deserve what you want
"come closer, we still have a lot to discuss"
we live in a world where they ask for your best but expect better
let me wrap my loneliness around you
'people empty me. i have to get away to refill.' - Charles Bukowski
learning to pick yourself up after going through shit is something that nobody teaches you
i’m turning 22 in a month and i don’t like this aging thing
there isn’t much left in me
"there's not much i can say with words now, for they always fail me when i need them the most"
"fall, just don't let them ruin you"
"nothing changes, you go home you get bored, you'll be ignored no one will listen to you you're too quiet for them to understand and they didn't even get your name right"
you’re doing good if you lose interest in looking back
"come here, let me hold you tonight"
my luck in love has always been so terrible until i met you
i’m just tired and you’re not here
it's almost time for cloudy days and wearing hoodies all day long
smoke has never been more poetic till i've seen it come out of your lips
she's a good girl sometimes
can we stop and talk about how your hands always warm up my heart?
"i don’t really get hurt easily, but when i do, fuck it gets ugly"
i'm not sure if i need a shoulder to cry on or a bullet in the head
she's right and i don't blame her
she said people like me belong alone
or any other day
"you reach a point that when someone tries to offer what you deserve, you have no fucking idea what to say"
i can be very persistent when it comes to what i want
the pleasure you get when you hear something that you already know
"i have survived. i'm here, confused, fucked up, but here"
tonight we’ll look at the stars and hope that one day we could hold them
my mistake was not telling enough people to fuck off
but she likes the pain too..
sext: our sadness has a lot in common
"i lost who i was back then, through choices that are no longer mine, i know i made them but they’re disconnected, i use to be someone who might have made them but i’ve lost the threads of why and what ifs"
"my thoughts destroyed me, and trying not to think almost made me forget that silence is also a killer"
carry my pain for it is too heavy on me
sending my love to everyone who’s trying to heal from things they don’t discuss
my words come out as knives without my intentions
i'm not sure how is anybody able to handle me when i can't even handle myself and these thoughts keep running out of hand
if i go insane blame this life of mine
i have so much anger and rage in me i don’t even know where to start
"i know how hard it is to get out of bed sometimes, just thinking and worrying about your how your day is going and whether you’re going to be able to deal with it or not, i know"
enter my world and take me in your arms
"imagine waking up happy, how does that feel"
"fuck your zodiac sign, do you smile when you see her?"
you have no idea who i am until you've stayed up with me till 4 am
i just want to make you happy that you forget every bit of sadness left in you
every second i spend with you is a closer step to happiness
this mind of mine has a terrible habit of making me feel like shit
poetry is when our lips are sealed together
"i don’t want the world’s attention, i just want yours"
"i like simple things, a good conversation, being alone, or with somebody who understands"
i often don’t even know what the fuck i’m doing
i see you
in my arms is where you belong in my heart is where you stay
11:11 you're everything
some parents have no idea what’s it like growing up in this generation
i’ve lived years with pain that i wouldn’t recognize myself without it
we still have some history together that hasn’t happened yet
a reminder that you can always be stronger than your sadness
left or right?
"don’t listen to what people say, just watch what they do"
"but if we bury our sadness under our skin instead of letting it out, what else can it do but grow in our veins?"
i’m really happy with how small my circle is now
i can’t go to sleep not thinking of you
but i can tell you’re not like the others
she brings out the side of me that i haven't seen in a very long time
"you're mine, and you're only mine"
"stay soft, it suits you"
i know too many secrets of people i don’t even know
flaws make everything interesting
so am i loyal or pathetic for loving you this much?
don't ever stop looking at me like that
keep me in your arms for tonight
one look at her and i knew that i’d spend far too much time trying to write something as beautiful as her
"sometimes you forget who you are, you slide back into old habits like a raindrop off an umbrella; close your eyes, take a deep breath and remember"
"oh dear, we grew up"
if you're not willing to sacrifice a lot of things to make a relationship work then you definitely don't even belong in one
"i want to be the person you remember when you see the sunrise, when you see a person in the corner of a coffee shop reading a book, not distracted by anything"
"to have her here beside me breathing on me, her hair on my face, i count that as happiness"
she’s brave and strong and broken all at once
"oh i’d love to, but only with you"
don’t fall in love with someone just because they pay a little bit of attention to you
*sees a cat* god i hope she likes me
but don't you know how much i love hearing my name coming out of your lips?
i’ll let my eyes say what my lips couldn’t
"it takes time to understand a person, so if they’re really worth it, you’ll take the time to try and figure them out"
"god, she’s so fucking beautiful"
a friendly reminder: you still have so much time to make yourself be what you want
her heart was missing something but she didn't know what it was
"i look at you and i know what love is, it terrifies me what i’d do for you"
do you feel lost inside yourself too?
"but i tried, didn’t i?"
you get used to the pain that it no longer hurts you anymore
if only you knew how much space you occupy my mind with
it's tiring wanting to go away and not going anywhere
everyone's busy with something but i'm only busy for you
she smiles and a poem writes itself
some parts of you just never heal
you do know that you don't have to accept things you're not okay with right?
kisses with soft moans in between
she’s my favorite mess
i wasn’t myself for years and yet nobody noticed
but how many memories have you killed to survive?
we should look at the sky more often
"love doesn't hurt, someone who doesn't know how to love hurt you, don't confuse the two"
a break from reality is needed
i hate everything that doesn’t include you
"dear mind: stop fucking overthinking, you keep creating problems that don’t even exist"
i’ll weave a blanket of words around you so you might not feel so cold
"i don’t need something to say, i just want you next to me"
it’s sad that we’re in a generation where capturing the moment using our phones is more important than actually living those moments with whoever is with us
the kind of love that makes you forget all the pain that was caused by others
i’m still trying to be okay with the fact that you’re not always in my arms
"what can i say, you’re everything i wanted in a human form"
"i don’t want to be around people who judge others and laugh about it, i want to be around people that dream and support and actually do things"
you’ll never have to lose yourself in order to win me over
"you’re beautiful, you’re worth it and you deserve it, don’t ever let anyone tell you otherwise"
2 hours of sleep is the new 9 hours of sleep
"books are dangerous, they contain all the words our hearts hide"
how can i get enough of that face when you keep looking at me like that
nobody will know what you feel inside unless you tell them
i automatically smile when i see your face
i hate having questions i don't want to know the answer to
i really need to stop overthinking and creating scenarios in my head about literally everything i do in my life
we spend too much time pretending to be okay
"it's crazy what music can do to people sometimes, hurt and feel so good all at once"
a house in the middle of nowhere with just us in it
we're not always going to survive
sometimes all you can feel is tiredness
"it's okay, we can be clueless together"
"nice walls, now let me break them in pieces and crawl inside in your heart"
words mean nothing when they’re not about you
i wonder if you wake up in the middle of the night and think of me
i’m honestly thankful some things didn’t work out the way i once wanted them to
i hope August treats everyone well
i wrote something
5 am coffee is the best coffee
"oh trust me, you’ve been mine ever since i first met you"
poetry can fuck you up but so can i
if only you’d realize how beautiful you are
"i think about you at midnight, and also always"
"i'm here, and i'm not going anywhere"
it's okay we all want to be better than we already are
the hardest thing you can do is walk away from a person not knowing if they’re going to run after you or just let you go
"i mean, we could hold hands and watch the stars all night"
i love it when your words are about me
i have a thing for long empty roads
i’d like you to be a part of everything i do
the moon is so beautiful tonight but so is your face
they don’t know anything about me and i plan on keeping it that way
all of the sudden i just felt all the emptiness inside me
i hope i get to be the reason you wake up smiling tomorrow
we’re going to make such a great story one day
there is so much art in the way you look at me sometimes
you know what?  there’s so much to be grateful for
the art of eye contact between our eyes
what a terrible feeling to love someone  and not see a smile on their face
it’s so quiet i can hear the sound of nothing and i hate that you’re not here
my mind is full of you
it's hard to say no to a face like that
i haven’t been in the mood to participate in life lately
but if i tell you my sins would you promise to stay?
are you okay? i’m trying to be
"and you continue to exist, after it ended with them you’re breathing, hoping, living, haven’t you noticed a heartbreak was not the end of you? it was a reminder that you’re still standing strong with or without them"
words haven’t expressed my thoughts in a while
"kissing you isn’t enough, i want to swallow you whole"
"cups of coffee that last a while, i live for these"
i hate waking up having no words to say
art is my hands between her thighs
i’m sorry that sometimes i know you’re looking for something that isn’t me
"you don’t own anybody, no matter how much of themselves they are willing to give you"
whenever i catch you smiling flowers bloom within my heart
"i strongly believe that not everything you do needs an explanation, if you want to read a book, read a book, if you’d rather stay home and miss that party tonight it’s fine, you don’t owe anybody an explanation for your choices nor preferences"
im ready for mornings where you put on my shirt and pour coffee in your favorite mug and sit by the window watching the sunrise
"i trust you, but i don’t trust them"
can’t you see it in my eyes? how much you mean to me
but how far would they go for you?
when you’re in my arms i know things will get better
your feelings won’t fade as long as you’re feeding them with memories
another sleepless night wishing you were in my arms
oh you have no idea how beautiful you are
"the moment you stop chasing the wrong people, you’re giving the right ones a chance to catch you"
"hey you, don’t give up okay?"
"but first, don’t forget to love yourself"
i rarely find anything interesting anymore
thanks but i prefer keeping everything to myself
the loneliness of her hands and the emptiness of mine
i sleep better when you’re next to me
how can i not get jealous when i see them look at you the way i did when i first saw you?
"okay so the world cup is finished, can my timeline go back to normal now?"
"and if you love me, there’s nothing else i want or need"
and words left unsaid
i don’t know what i’d do without you sometimes
but i just want to make her the happiest person alive
we start healing when we say how we really feel
"no, only people i like can touch my hair"
i just look at you and know that i want to be with you
"you make me want sleepy nights, a hot cup of coffee and soft kisses"
i spend most of my nights thinking about all the things we could do together
the older you get the faster things get on your nerves
hold on to those who want to hear about all the things that go on in your head
when someone puts their happiness before you that’s another form of love
it’s like my heart was missing something i didn’t know what it was
i can’t explain how piercingly and endlessly i think about you sometimes
i don’t want to waste anymore of my life without you in it
"touch me, feel me, do something, anything.."
"i'm nowhere near what i want to be,  but i'm more than i was  and i'm still learning"
she was tired of saying sorry so she said goodbye
that heart of yours needs a hug
just looking at you makes me smile
"a lot of people need to realize that no matter how good you are to people, it won’t make them good to you"
happiness always comes incomplete
sometimes you just don’t get enough  of them
her face is art itself
looking at the stars is so peaceful
open my heart and search for all the hidden words
how much i hate feeling misunderstood
"tell me what you’ve been through to become the person you are today, tell me all the mistakes you’ve made and what you learned from them, tell me the reason behind your tears and what keeps you up all night, make me fall harder for you by telling me what kind of person you are"
"sometimes you don’t get closure, you just turn the page and move on"
sometimes all we really need is just someone who listens and understands
every night i try to keep it down so that they don’t hear my thoughts and feel my pain
"i’m still searching for answers to questions that come too easily, i’m still sinking in dreams where the world goes so quickly, i’m still looking at the sky waiting for a sign, but there’s flame still burning and i remain a human still yearning"
"go for a walk and pay very close attention to things and people you see, take notes or pictures of anything that stands out to you then go home and write all about it"
please understand that the world doesn’t give a fuck
"the thing is, i'm thinking about you all the time"
don't use people to fill your emptiness
just because i'm quiet doesn't mean i'm blind
"i like people that talk to me about the universe, expend my mind and fill it with positivity. share your dreams with me, take me on a mental trip rather than talking to me about your problems and what ifs"
drakes new album got me feeling some kind of way
"god, that smile"
people aren't always going to be there for you so learn how to handle things on your own
"‘i was born when she kissed me, i died when she left me, and i lived a few weeks while she loved me’"
"this country will kill your dreams, bury it, and pretend you didn’t even exist"
how i wish i could hold you right now
"i’m not heartless, i’m just smart enough to not depend on others to make me happy"
they don’t understand so i stare into their eyes hoping they would
"i’m trying to stay positive, but everything around me just keeps draining me with negativity"
i still have fun sitting in silence with you
"somewhere, somehow i'll find myself again"
eyes like these are the reason why love exists
"i like to be left alone but i don’t, you know?"
the little things fucking matter
start loving yourself instead of waiting for someone else to love you
i’m just here to watch you sleep and play with your hair
i can never get enough from staring at your face
disappointed but never surprised
"it’s a terrible thing, to not always have you in my arms"
parts of you reminds me of myself
i go through pain alone and i overcome it alone
sometimes i just look around and wonder what the fuck am i doing here
stab my heart with a knife and call it love
time tells you what kind of person they are
"'if I give you my heart, would you hold that? would you put it on safe or would you fold that?'"
do you guys feel like what the fuck too?
how can i ever stop overthinking when you exist
you haven’t felt pain till you see a smile on their face and you’re no longer the reason behind it
you haven’t felt pain till you see someone you love happy without you
do you call it love when you’re invisible to them?
"love isn't suppose to hurt, love is suppose to make you feel alive again"
why would you be with someone who does nothing but cause you pain?
"you matter, more than you think"
but when i look at you i forget what i wanted to say
they’ll tell you ‘i love you’ to your face and show you the complete opposite
"i'm either sad, lonely or nothing at all"
"the sun rises everyday, and that should be a sign to try again"
"trust me, you don't want to feel what i feel"
after a while you start realizing that it’s all just talk
the war between my heart and mind just never seems to end
i like it more when your hands are curled up inside mine
i always want what they didn’t have
i saw tenderness in her eyes again
their true identity shows when you need them
skin to skin so i can hear your heartbeat out of your chest
let’s get high and talk about all the things that bother us
is that really happiness in your eyes or is it all the sadness bottled up
if they don’t like you who the fuck cares?
writing about you is the only thing that brings me closer to you when you’re not around
"it's okay, you can take all the love i have left"
keep in mind that it hurts her every time you act like you don’t care even though you do
‘and i’ll wait for you because i don’t want anyone else’
coffee tastes different in the morning
waking up is getting harder everyday
"you know that feeling i get when i see you? yeah, i want to always feel that"
this country makes you want to kill yourself
my heart longs for happiness
sitting in silence is what i do best
here’s to the people that walked in my life and made it better and thanks to the ones who walked out and made it amazing
you’re the reason i want to wake up every morning just to look at your face
a lot of people seem attractive until you see the way they think
"i’ve noticed that the more you know yourself, the more patience you have with others"
there shouldn’t be any space between our hands
it's okay to feel lost sometimes
"i’m not mad at anyone for anything they ever did to me, you showed me who you are, and i needed that"
"look closely, only very few will give a fuck"
how am i suppose to open up and tell you how i feel when this sheet of paper is still empty?
she wasn't herself and nobody noticed
disappearance is self meditating
love isn’t suppose to make you feel this way
"people change, and they end up having nothing to say to each other even if they were best friends the year before"
there will be times you’ll think you won’t survive and then you survive
how much i wish i haven’t wasted that much time on people who didn’t even deserve a minute of my life
let it hurt till it can’t hurt anymore
sext: i’ll buy you a coffee mug
"if you’re capable of making choices knowingly it hurts other people, that’s not love"
our generation is addicted to attention
"don’t forget to make someone smile today, the world needs more of it"
in my heart you will always belong
"wake up, i’m not done loving you yet"
the struggle between every minute without you is real
some days i just sit there and wonder if you really know me
the problem is that we let people say stuff and they say it too much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us
"no matter how strong a person can be, there's always a weak point, remember that"
of course i plan to stay on your mind
it’s been a while
"it’s okay, i don’t make any sense either"
you keep storing up all that anger and eventually it breaks you
imagine minding your own business
"don't test my patience, i can wait years just for one thing to happen"
it's 5:48 am and i can't help but think of ways to make you smile next time our eyes meet
"just you next to me, i won’t ask for anything else"
"it will take some time, but these wounds will heal"
"it’s okay if they don’t need you, you’re not living for them"
i don’t mind spending the entire night listening to your heartbeat
i think about my hands on your thighs a lot more often then i should
words understood me before anybody else ever did
always remind her how much she means to you
holding on to something that isn't real is a lot harder than letting go
i'm going to take this pain and turn it into beautiful words
the music isn't loud enough
but how am i suppose to say how i feel when i don’t even know what i feel
"i'll soon find myself again, but when that happens it's over for you"
"i sat down to write how i felt but instead i stared at this blank sheet of paper and somehow it looked exactly the same as if it was full, empty"
this emptiness inside me just keeps getting wider and wider everyday
the thing about being alone is that you really notice everything
"here's a piece of advice, don't let people control your emotions"
"i don’t know, talking makes no difference anymore"
"incase you missed it, i’m still fucked up"
i hope you still think of me every time you hug your pillow and stare blankly at your black screen
skills: overthinking
stop waiting for approval from other people and start doing what you want
"sometimes giving up on a person doesn’t necessarily mean that you don’t care, it’s because you realize they don’t"
people just love ruining anything beautiful
"it’s happening again, i can’t stop thinking about you"
i love making you smile
"a gentle reminder, smile more often"
oh shut up and come here
"i don't write poetry, she takes my words and turns them into poetry"
maybe i just want to play with your hair and kiss your neck
it’s a pity you’re not in my arms right now
"i miss you, still"
when will you realize that being good to people won't make them good to you?
"i don't want texting or phone calls, i just want you here"
everything nowadays is just meh okay
i'm so tired of feeling this way
nobody said it would be easy
"and with my arms wide open, i'll be there to catch you"
the desire to hide and never be seen
"it's a scary place, this mind of mine"
shoot me in the head with a gun full of kisses
don't let anyone ever make you feel like you don't deserve what you want
i want your eyes to be on me and only me
"i care, and a lot more than i probably should"
"out of all the books i want to read, i only want you"
and love the parts everyone else took for granted
do you look at the sky at 4 am and remember me?
i have a lot to say and i also prefer not to
"repeat after me, everything you feel is okay"
i want all your words to be about me
"there are certain songs you just can't listen to in public, you need your headphones and it's just you and that song"
but you have no idea how much it takes for me to say 'i'm done'
"i tried not thinking about you, and i completely failed"
i love those random conversations where you lose time over
cigarettes are a lot less harmful than humans
but how can i fucking look at that face and not fall in love?
i’m getting better at pretending to be alive
people fail to realize that words can be art too
every mood has its own playlist
"a soft kiss on your forehead, gentle enough to make you forget what's it like to be alone"
don't attach your strings to someone who hasn't yet attached theirs to you
the way you smiled at me had me believe that love still exists
some days just last too long you know
sleepless nights with a mind full of you
it’s okay we can sit and have a silence conversation
pro tip: drink a lot of water
"i miss you, let’s go back to bed"
i miss writing
"it's okay, i'm very hard to talk to as well"
show me your softest side
the first coffee of the day always feels like the communion
maybe in a parallel universe we're next to each other in bed holding hands
"sometimes we don't need someone to fix everything, we just need someone who listens"
she’s a lot more fragile than you think
"i don’t fall, and even if i did i know my way back up"
perhaps i try too hard to hide behind my words
"my lips pressed on your neck, just where they belong"
but how can loneliness exist when you’re here?
because one cup of coffee in the morning is simply never enough
Blue Velvet (1986)
"she wouldn't just lose him, she'd lose herself too"
you still have yourself to love
certain thoughts just get stuck on your mind and you can't do anything about it
finding new music makes me happy
why does everyone look the same nowadays?
but the downfall for caring about someone is that their mistakes never change your feelings
it's hard to imagine a world without you in it
i wake up moody by default
did i mention how beautiful you are today?
i'm not sure i'd know who i am without being sad
and i'm going to stay high till i get higher
we need more people with good intentions
sad songs and chill
this world needs more softness and love
i'm kinda happy but i also want to get hit by a train at the same time
you can share your emptiness with me and fill it with mine
"i'm just tired, you know"
this world makes you want to commit suicide with a smile on your face
"don’t get me wrong, i just lost interest in everything to the point that i just lost myself in the process"
maybe i just want to lay in bed all day and hate everything
loving you is the only language i speak
horoscope: sad
that's how simple it is to make me happy sometimes
my cat following me everywhere in the house just makes me happy
i guess you came to me after i stopped searching
it's not your fault they weren't strong enough to keep holding on
i've created my own world inside my head to shelter myself from how i feel
it's wednesday and i need all the love you can possibly offer
"but there's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself, it's okay to not have it all figured out"
thing's aren't the same anymore
oh the amount of love i have saved up for you
thunderstorms make me smile
do you still think of me when your favorite song comes on?
i know very little about love but i know so much about how to love
"fuck, i woke up again"
you can't keep holding onto things that keep pushing you away
but aren't you suppose to notice things others don't?
sometimes coffee is your best friend
you’re waiting for them to talk and they’re waiting for you to talk
being broke is so depressing
i’m always stuck between loving too much or not enough
i hate how empty my bed feels like without you
but do you know what it means to be someone’s everything?
at this point i’m just thankful for everything
"i love writing, specially when it’s about you"
"i love writing, and specially when it’s about you"
sad songs with you in my arms
but don’t you know that i’m fucked up too?
just what are you hiding behind that smile of yours
at least i’m heading towards something i want
"i imagined a world without you, and i didn’t like one bit of it"
i'm still searching for more words to love you with
your beauty never fails to distract me
god that beautiful mind of yours though
"i’ll fight longer than you think, i’m too stubborn to just give up what i want"
i don't see a reason why you shouldn't be in my arms right now
i tend to get jealous of the pillow she hugs every night before she sleeps
we need something good to happen every now and then
i hope me staying on your mind might make you smile once or twice
i'm sorry that nothing's alive about me anymore
"when our eyes first met, i knew that was love"
she just wants her heart to be okay again
thighs are important
maybe my reality is just different than yours
sadness seems to never leave her side and i'm jealous of how close they are
i love the way your eyes look at me
“tired” doesn’t even come close to how i feel
people never fail to give me reasons not to trust them
but how can you ever say no to 6 am morning walks?
another cup of coffee please
i’ll always be convinced that i’m unfit to be loved
maybe she just doesn't want to feel like she's competing for your attention
you can’t change what already happened so stop wasting your time thinking about it
and i promise to be there for you when nobody else is
"and with all the beautiful words in this world, not a single one could describe you"
today just feels weird
people who say that coffee mugs don't change the taste don't even deserve to drink coffee
no matter how much it hurts you just have to keep going
"play with my beard, not my feelings"
excuse me while i love you a little too much
i’m tired of waking up with zero energy and tolerance to deal with anything
put all your thoughts in one place and let it fuck you up
tell your heart i'm planning on staying there
her smile keeps me going sometimes
i don't want to waste too much time hoping for something that may never happen
my words are often formed from my deepest sorrow
help me see myself through your eyes
a lot can happen in one day
"don't sacrifice your own mental health for others, stop giving in and put yourself first for a change, you matter too"
what happens when you run out of positive thoughts?
"if you can’t get someone off your mind, maybe they're just supposed to be there"
just remember that when they stop talking to you they start talking about you
it's the same shit everyday
reality is so painful sometimes
i keep waking up and it’s not getting any easier
beware of who you give your heart to
we’ll be okay again someday
does she listen to the weeknd?
you simply can’t break a writers heart and get away with it
"if you lose someone but found yourself in the process, you won"
it’s 5 am and i can’t stop thinking about you
in a room full of paintings i'd still stare at you
"but then it passed, just like everything else does"
"a house full of cats is a lot better than a house full of humans, just saying"
but how can i fall asleep without you in my arms
i'd always put my pride aside for you
sleepless nights with a mind full of you
candlelight and coffee
sometimes words aren’t enough to describe what you want to say
i wonder if you can see the amount of love i have for you
i take things personal because i wouldn't do the same to you
perhaps a door closes for a better one to open
"don't fool yourself by thinking you truly know someone, you'd be surprised with the secrets they're hiding from you"
sext: let's take polaroid pictures of us having sex
and i'll still give you my shoulder to lean on although i'm the one who needs a shoulder to lean on
coffee and cigarettes type of night
i didn't come this far to only come this far and just stop
do you sometimes feel like you were only born to disappoint people because same
life just keeps knocking me down from every way possible and i'm not sure how long i can still hold on
waking up from a nap to take another nap
i get tired of being in the middle of giving up and how much more i can take
i want to write but at the same time i can't even form two words together that would make sense to what i actually feel
"i can't ""people"" anymore, you know"
"aim to destroy, not break"
i fear losing myself in the process of putting your pieces back together
i apologize for not being an easy person to be with
patience has always been my strategy
"nah, don't look back, not now, not ever"
soft hands and warm eyes always got to me
"yeah i still have the weeknd's album on repeat, wyd"
nothing good comes with too many people knowing your shit
i’m that permanent scar that will always leave a mark
i love the way you say my name
more fridays like this please
"finally some good music, i’ve been waiting for so fucking long!!"
"WASTED TIMES THOUGH, HOLY SHIT"
"my dear melancholy, the name though"
not to sound selfish or anything but i hate that you can be happy without me
i usually fall for people i never expect
"open your arms, i'm planning on staying there for a while"
"i’m not asking for happiness, i’m just asking for it to hurt less"
you look prettiest when you’re not thinking about being pretty
please use your words wisely
you still manage to make me smile even when you’re the main reason i’m sad
i don’t think that i’d ever be ready to lose you
you can't forget someone while waiting for them to come back
i just want to lay my head on your lap and feel your thighs with my fingers
it’s okay that you’re not who you thought you would be
"let's get lost in a world full of dim lights, coffee and books"
and what if you're the thing that's going to actually make me the happiest yet the saddest?
missing you is part of my day now dear
you get tired of saying that you're fine when nothing is really fine
another day another disappointment
but have you noticed the change of music taste since you met me?
maybe i just can’t get enough of you
you should’ve ran when you had the chance
i hope you're missing me as much as i do when you're not around
i hope my words aren't too sad to scare you away
"and for once just try and see things in my point of view, and only then you might get a glimpse of what i go through"
i told her i end up hurting everybody she told me she wouldn't mind dying for me
"to gain my heart and trust, damn you’re lucky"
what is left
stop being afraid of who you are and start cherishing who you've become
you look like you could split my heart into two pieces
and sober enough to say it
silly you thought loving me was easy
let’s agree on not killing each other okay?
"i don't know man, i just don't connect with anyone anymore"
thank you for seeing the treasury in me while i saw empty hallways
"you're always going to be perfect in someones eyes, don't forget that"
let's sit and count all the things that we could lose
but who i am with you differs then who i am with everybody else
how many times are you planning on accepting the same apology? how many times are you planning on letting people step on you over and over again?
i'm a slave for your kind words and warm kisses across my forehead
as long as you're trying your best then i'm staying with my best
"i mean, what's success without failing at least once or twice?"
what’s life without taking risks though
a good cup of coffee would be so nice right now
is it just me that forgot how to socialize with people?
i’m just waiting for a breeze of air that might never arrive
perhaps i'm just paying for my sins
she's all the poetry i want and need
"stay a mystery to them, it's better that way"
my mind has been too occupied to function correctly about anything
"have you ever met someone and got so attached to them and thought ""it's going to hurt like fuck"" if they left?"
"but can you see me? and i mean really see me? probably not, nobody ever does"
"i mean, she can sit on my face anytime she wants, just saying"
"don't try me, i'll cut you off without thinking twice about it"
silence has always been her loudest scream
and for how long can we handle this much pain inside us?
i somehow always feel better when you're around
everything changed yet i'm more myself than i've ever been
sorry but i'm into broken people more
the fact that the world will soon come to an end and you're not in my arms kills me
i just want you to know that i'm thankful for your existence
but i can be your favorite poetry book too
i could use a kiss or two or whatever
it's weird how losing people no longer effects me in any way
and here i am giving you something you can never give back
it's crazy how much i care about you
hazelnut coffee ft you
i'm tired and i miss you too much
but sadly madness still lives inside me
"people who make effort, i like that"
maybe she just wants to be held and told that everything's going to be okay
"you don't choose who you fall in love with, but you do choose who stay in love with"
"that's the thing, i'll always have a thing for your eyes"
today couldn't get any worse but yet you still managed to put a smile on my face
sext: we should nap together
people will eventually kill you over time and often with words like “i love you”
"i know, i would hate me too"
everyday
"you're always priceless to someone, stop spending time with those who don't value you"
"we grew up man, we fucking grew up"
but i could swear her arms felt like home
"dear whoever is reading this, you're beautiful and you deserve a life full of happiness and positivity"
remember that not everybody in your life is meant to stay
we started off like strangers who knew each other very well
and when you’re in my arms nothing else matters
woke up in the middle of the night just to think of you
fill my emptiness with kisses
"i dislike people who get offended when i’m moody, like no i’m not mad at you, i’m mad at the world so just leave me be"
people who say angels don’t exist clearly haven’t met you
but how can such beauty exist
i’m just not really good with people
i hate how easily mad i get
what friends? oh you mean those who only talk to me when they just want something?
friday mornings and hot coffee
i was never afraid to walk this road alone
"my problem is when i get attached to someone, leaving isn't an option for me, i fucking attach everything to that person you know?"
i didn't want to wake up without you by my side and my arms around your waist
so that's how crazy people get when they're in love
"be nice, March"
"a gentle reminder, spread love as much as you can"
"i know, i barely handle myself too"
i’ll let this silence eat me alive tonight
ok but does he brush your hair and call you babygirl?
nothing feels better than wanting someone who wants you in return
hearing a girl moan is like listening to birds chirping outside your window every morning
she's a vision of perfection bro
and here’s a reminder that i’m here to stay
"i haven’t been expecting anything lately, and i couldn’t be more satisfied, i no longer think of what could’ve beens and what ifs"
"and once you fall in love with them, everything changes"
sudden rain and my arms around your waist
kisses on your forehead every morning to remind you that you're beautiful
when she wears your clothes and her smell is all over it
coffee and sleepless nights always lead me to thinking about you
i'm such a sucker for your smile
"i can't get bored of you, i'm not sure if that's even possible"
we should be taking a walk holding hands and talking about the moon right now
it’s so hard to get words out of me now
the world is just sad now
in the mood to just lay in bed and stare the ceiling for the rest of the night
i haven't been writing in a while and it's making me sad
sext: i wouldn’t mind going to hell for you
"baby wake up, the sun is shining"
emptiness is taking over again
when you get used to something it just doesn’t effect you as much anymore
"today just doesn't feel right, you know"
it's quite hard existing in a world where you're not accepted
it's so hard fighting your brain everyday it's exhausting
and somehow your presence always seems to comfort me
i waited for the sunrise and thought of you
11:11 i love you
don’t let them ruin your favorite songs or your favorite movies
"it's you i think about all the time, it's always you"
as long as you’re a part of my day i know it’s a good day
people still continue to disappoint me
"if you could look into my heart and understand what people have done to it, i think you would stop trying to break it every time you get a hold of it"
and i’m going to love you because that’s what i do best
bring me coffee and tuck me in your arms
"i don’t know what’s harder, not knowing what you are and be happy or becoming someone you always wanted and feel alone"
i have you and that’s all that matters right?
"note to self: you can start over, every morning"
people with kind hearts and good intentions deserve the world
disappearing is more like my favorite game now
i can disappear from your life just as fast as i appeared in it
hold that one person that makes you happy as soon as they start talking to you and don’t let them go
and coffee no longer tastes like coffee without your lips touching the edges of my cup
"i need to feel alive again, just this once"
tonight i just want you beside me
sometimes we just need freedom from ourselves
i lost interest in the world a long time ago dear
"if he doesn't make you feel like everyday is valentines day, he's not the one"
"wake up, i’m trying to love you"
sleepless nights ft thoughts about you
the rain is beautiful and i love you
sometimes happiness is too much to ask for
"i love seeing that smile on your face, but i love it even more when i’m the reason"
i tend to forget myself when i'm with you
i turn soft when i’m in love
"the smaller the circle, the happier you will be"
a cigarette and a glass full of you
*spends the entire day thinking about you*
you get tired of looking back wondering what would’ve happened if you took the other way
i’ll someday find the words to describe this but in the meantime here’s my heart
"hey, i love you and it’s going to be alright okay?"
i want to watch the sunrise with you and talk about how beautiful you are
i'm too selfish when it comes to you
do flowers bloom when you open your legs too?
i’m growing up and it isn’t funny anymore
and here’s a reminder that you’re beautiful
5:13 am drinking coffee and looking at the sky hoping you’d be looking too
it's scary how much you can love someone
i spend too much time trying to figure out who i really am
but darling don't you know how much pain i've been through to reach this point in my life?
you owe yourself the same love you gave others who couldn't love you with the same intensity and passion
poetry is the art of saying what can’t be said in other languages
they usually care when it’s too late
"words are not just words, no, words are everything and nothing at the same time"
bring me coffee so i know it’s real
i just realized how many years i’ve wasted in my life on people who absolutely mean nothing to me anymore and it’s just sad
i’m not quite sure how many years i have left in this life but i’ll make sure i leave something behind to make you remember me
i'd run away with you
every night is a tragedy that you're not in my arms
sext: we should watch the ceiling together holding hands
"i’m no poet, but i’ll make sure my words touch every part of your body"
this morning i woke up loving you more then yesterday
i'm afraid my name might not make you smile anymore
but have you ever seen something so precious that you didn’t know what to do with it?
"no, you’re not alone nor will you ever be, as long as there’s still air entering my lungs and energy to walk on my legs i’ll be here"
do you look at the moon every night and think of me like i do?
there’s nothing more attractive than someone who doesn’t hide their broken parts but instead wears them proudly
"before you give advises to people, make sure you give it to yourself first"
"""take my pain from me, save my soul from me cause i'm alone you see"""
"fuck jealousy, and fuck what it does to me"
NO IT’S NOT FUCKING OKAY TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE SHIT ABOUT THEMSELVES
maybe one day i'll be perfect in someones eyes
"trust me darling, nothing really makes any sense without you"
being sad as a hobby
maybe i just love you a little too much
"poets can fuck you mentally too, not just physically"
i will write i will write my heart out till there’s nothing left to say i will write beautiful words to match that smile of yours i will write until the sun comes out and birds sing your name i will write
"another hopeless, sleepless, and lonely night"
a lot of me was lost along the years
"mistakes are for learning, not repeating"
it seems like no matter what i do it's just not enough
your eyes stole all my words away the second mine met them
"humans are trash, males and females"
"i will never understand people who abandon their pets under any circumstances, pets are part of the family the second they step in the house, you simply don’t fucking let them go just like that"
"i know, i’m fucked up too"
flowers as bookmarks
"i’m not worried about what happens anymore, but i’m certain that nothing is capable of stopping me from what i set my mind to"
i’m afraid you might lose yourself in the process of putting me back together
i will one day look back and i’ll be glad i never gave up
"i noticed that the older you get, the more you appreciate just chilling at home doing absolutely nothing"
a thought is sometimes hard to control
we could spend all night arguing or you can simply get your ass here and let me love you
whatever causes the darkness inside us may leave stars within us
don't waste time proving what kind of person you are
"what can i say, i adore that fragile heart of yours"
this clumsy heart of mine just doesn’t know when to stop falling everytime i look at you does it
how many sleepless nights have you spent wishing someone would stay?
but does she read?
i'm probably going to lose my mind thinking about you
cats will forever own my heart
i like to listen to my own silence sometimes
some days just aren’t worth it anymore and i’d rather go straight on to tomorrow
"i kind of hate myself, don’t you?"
lonely mornings and black coffee
"i'm in constant need of attention, but only from you"
we often expect more from others because we're willing to do that much for them
not being okay is part of my personality now dear
sad songs to match my sad soul
"if i could wake up at a different time in a different place, could i also wake up as a different person?"
i hope i could make you want to enjoy your life once again
nobody’s perfect but then there’s you
song lyrics and you
jealousy fucks me up and i can’t do anything about it
sext: are you dead inside too?
"they lied, time doesn’t heal, it only makes it worse"
a lot of people won’t understand no matter how much you wish they could
stop saying nothing when it’s something
"no matter how many people are around me, loneliness just never leaves"
"wake up, drink some coffee, then get back to sleep"
her heart spoke to mine
"today was nice, your eyes spoke to me and your lips were dripping honey"
it was unexpected to fall in love with you like this
"i can apologize for doing something wrong, but i won’t fucking apologize for being myself"
i’m not even sure there’s a word to describe what phase i’m in
i need a cup of coffee and a few hundred kisses from you
it’s sometimes hard accepting the fact that love is not enough
"careful now, my sadness is contagious"
don’t be the one stabbing then act as if you’re the one who’s bleeding
"i’m a needy person, a part of me always wants more i can’t resist"
"i miss writing my heart out, i think it’s just my mind finally came to a realization that i don’t even have a heart"
"if you ever started feeling lost and lonely, look at the moon, i’ll be looking at it every night too"
woke up at 6 am just to overthink
i fell in love with her misery because it matched with my own
come to bed and have coffee with me
you’d be surprised at how many people are really dead inside walking through life with no idea who they even are
"i know, i was there, i saw all the pain in your eyes and you saw mine"
but have you ever fallen in love all over again with the same person?
i’ll make sure you never forget how my lips felt on your neck
"you don't need to be accepted by others to feel beautiful, you are beautiful"
but i never felt this warmth in someone else’s arms
how kind words never fail to put a smile on my face
maybe i should make a playlist of songs that i’d eat you out to
you’re that artwork i could admire every morning when i wake up
my problem was that i always tried to understand others but never myself
she’s a tea person but we still get along
"twitter is not twitter if it's not depressing, just saying"
"sorry i can't tweet happy tweets anymore, i forgot how"
i want to be able to trust people again but they just keep giving me reasons not to
"whatever you end up doing, just make sure you're happy doing it"
stop destroying what's left of you by thinking about the things that have broken you
"that’s life, you start finding out who you really are and what you want, but then you realize that the people you’ve known don’t see things the way you do"
soft hearts make this world worth living in
sometimes all it takes is just one look
"i tend to close my eyes and allow my thoughts to wander in places i don’t talk about, places where my silence makes sense"
"i may not be strong enough to face myself yet, but i’m definitely strong enough to keep going"
i’d like to think you think about me before you sleep like i do
i’m trying to get my life together but life isn’t helping
"the reason i would ever hate the word ‘love’ is because it means too much to me, far more than you could ever understand"
the problem is i usually know but i still do it anyways
is it just me or is it really hard to make friends nowadays?
out of all the ways to die i’d choose to love you
i forgot how to communicate with people due to the silence i live in
but i wanted to play with her hair till i fall asleep
i'm just hoping it all makes sense later on
i adore her even on days she hates herself
every beautiful word always begins with her name
i hope you don’t mind me stealing a kiss in public every now and then
do you ever hear the pain coming out of every word that someone’s saying?
i'd write love poems to every part you hate about yourself
i wouldn't mind shattering myself into pieces just to see you smile
how empty and quiet everything is
i need you in my arms a littler longer tonight
it's going to take me a few weeks to realize that we're in 2018
"i hope this year turns gentle for all of us, yes i’m trying to spread positive energy"
"i want to write, i really do, but i just don't know where to start"
"fuck, it's almost 2018"
i miss you the second we stop talking and it’s pissing me off
you know it's fucked up when strangers see the pain in your eyes that your loved ones don't
"just for your information, i always get what i want"
my mind is currently too tired to function correctly
or maybe i could just bury myself under my bed and pretend it’s all okay and i’ll wake up with a smile on my face
maybe i could finish the ink of this pen writing about the things i wish i had said when i had the chance
love is stronger than anything you could possibly imagine
you are good enough and will always be you deserve to be loved you are worth it
perhaps we deserve a lot better than this heartache and pain we're receiving
"if you ever leave, make sure to take my longing away with you; for i have no use for it without you by my side"
she's the type of girl that can be so hurt and still look at you with a smile on her face
"no i don’t want to be your boyfriend, i want to be your entire fucking life"
quality time with your books
she's more delicate than she looks
stop defining things based on how you've experienced it
but then i became someone i said i wouldn't be
it's like one day i flipped this switch and became someone i've always hated
"i've been quiet for far too long, it's about time i share my silence with someone"
your first mistake is putting them above you
"you’re not alone sweetheart, we’re all in this shit hole together"
"i was suppose to publish my book this year, but shit got in the way, but i haven’t given up on it yet, i’ll even make it better"
"i'm not angry or mad, i'm just not good with people"
woke up without you by my side and that’s when i felt that a part of me was missing
i'm just wondering what places i have already visited for the last time
"i can promise you coffee, books and all my heart"
for christmas i just want you in my arms and a good cup of coffee
missing you comes in levels and i think i've reached the max
"i’m a mess, what’d you expect?"
can 2017 end already?
"stay, just this once"
i woke up wanting you in my arms
i don’t know what’s going on in my head anymore but it’s a lot
i dare you to stay
"i can’t help it, she brings out the soft side of me"
"i adore her, how can you not?"
i’m not even sure if i’m a morning person or a night person or even a person at all
"you’re beautiful, whoever wherever you are"
do you have any idea how hard it is to force myself to stop thinking about you?
"i know, i’m a little too much to handle sometimes"
"poetry is always there, people aren't"
"i act accordingly to the way i have experienced my life, if you could understand my experiences then you can perhaps understand my behavior"
"it seems like i can no longer write unless i’m sad, high or depressed"
we should love each other more often
friday mornings are all about laying in bed and having refilled coffee
religious people scare me
i hate the fact that somethings are just better left unsaid
i’m afraid that if we keep waiting until we’re ready we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives
achieving goals in silence
i like that mysterious side you don’t show to anybody
her smile is always priceless
small boobs are cute ok?
"communicate, even if it’s hard. one of the best ways to heal is simply getting everything out"
"if you have the ability to make others happy do it, the world needs it right now"
"they’re not you, and that’s your power"
maybe we’re just stuck in a battle between what we know and what we feel
"go to a coffee shop alone, sit by the glass window and look outside, look at all the people who walk by, look at the couples holding hands and how too in love to care they are, you'll see a bit of yourself in everyone and then you'll realize sitting alone had never felt as better"
tender hearts make this world worth living in
i should've taken off your clothes when i had the chance
the idea of bringing a child to this world terrifies me; the very thought of them feeling the way i do would break me into so many pieces i would lose count trying to gather them all together
coffee never disappoints you
she doesn’t want to stay where she’s not wanted
just because you’re so in love with them doesn’t mean you should ignore how badly you’re treated
there are a lot of things that you don't know about yourself until you let someone into the most intimate places of your heart
the desire to see your face asleep on the pillow beside my face and to see your eyes open every morning when i lie next to you
but are you good enough?
i spoke to the moon about you tonight
jealousy fucks me up every single time
"well you know, i’m just waiting for more disappointments"
"everyone says you'll find the perfect one for you and how much they're going to love you and take care of you, but they never say how much of a liar a person can be and how much time gets wasted waiting for a slight change"
promises no longer mean anything to me
i don't even know
"pay close attention to those who are happy for your happiness and sad for your sadness, they’re the ones who deserve everything"
you’re searching for me in the wrong places
people will fall in love with me then they will hate me when i fall in love with them
the amount of warmness she brings to my heart though
"december, be nice"
"doing what is good for you is not selfish, but when someone calls you selfish for doing what is right for your life is when they show you how selfish they truly are"
when you realize you didn’t matter to a specific person you begin to wonder if you even matter to anyone at all
"no, i won’t apologize for caring too much, but i will apologize that i cared for the wrong people"
"yeah i overthink, but i also over love"
the ability to sit down with someone and open up about everything is just more attractive to me than anything else
times like this i just want to bury my head under a pillow and not exist for a while
loneliness runs in us all
"my heart stopped beating a long time ago, it wasn’t dead, just terribly wounded"
she did what others failed to do
"it should say ""a complete mess"" in my cv"
the curves of your lips wrote poetry in a language only us could understand
"and then i realized that no matter where i am, whether in a room full of people, or in this endless universe of despair and agony, it’s all in my head"
"i want to know, but i just don't want to ask"
"it's okay, it only hurts a lot"
i just want to be the person you run to when everything hurts
be nice to each other at my funeral
there's always struggle. you just have to pick who to struggle with
"come into my world of sadness and take me away from it, take me somewhere i could rest my head gently and forget every painful moment"
"didn't you know?my feelings have always had an on and off button"
and the sad thing is good times never last forever
"here's an appreciation tweet to the people who notice our pain, scars, fear and joy, you're beautiful and rare"
"if you're capable of making choices knowing it hurts other people, it's not called love"
it's raining love today
i need you in my arms if you don't mind
i'm tired
my life will end and so will yours so let's love each other while there's still air entering our lungs
"i know it'll pass, but it's sucking the rest of life i have in me"
but perhaps this suffering will end one day and we'll be able to smile with our hearts
maybe i was never meant to be happy and that's okay
you call this a life?
"at this point, even breathing is depressing"
i'm letting sadness take over me tonight
i keep forgiving everyone but myself
comparison will destroy you
"handle me with care, please"
"angels exist, i mean, look at her face"
"i want to apologize to myself for constantly pressuring myself, for allowing myself to self destruct, i know a part of me at least deserves a bit of kindness every now and then"
times like this i just wish i could stop thinking about everything
tonight the moon is holding me captive with thoughts about you
but my name sounds a lot better coming out of her mouth
i miss her the moment she steps out of that door
the amount of loneliness i feel in a crowded room sometimes gets to me
"as saddening as it sounds, by the end of the day no matter how close of a person is to you, you only have yourself"
i miss you terribly
"this world i’m in just doesn’t seem to understand my silence, every word, every breath, every move just doesn’t make any sense"
open your heart in empathy and let me fill it with kindness
a girl with galaxies in her eyes and flowers in her chest
"let’s get out of here let’s go somewhere where only you and I exist  let’s pack our bags and just leave let’s not tell anybody where we’re going let’s get lost, together let’s explore new places and sit under beautiful trees and talk about anything, is that too much to ask for?"
unspoken words and feelings are unforgettable
"the only thing i’ve found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other"
she’s not good with words but that’s okay because her eyes speak every word the pen couldn’t
"that’s how i live with my insomnia, i read or write my heart out; those late hours when the world is completely silent, when the only sound is the wind visiting and loneliness tucked tightly around your arms"
"but then you realize that there doesn’t have to be someone who understands you, just someone who wants to"
"rest your head now love, tomorrow’s a new day and today will be nothing but a memory"
words can kill too
i’m having problems between my own fantasy and reality
i’m probably going to love you with every piece of me
you don’t know how very lovely you are
"i haven’t wrote anything in a while, i feel missing; i feel like a part of me is still stitched by words i’ve never said"
"have a great day, because if not now, then when?"
stop thinking about all the things that destroyed you and start thinking about what they’ve taught you
nothing can break me unless i let it
sometimes being under the same sky is enough
"you’re enough, in case you felt that you weren’t"
"come here, let me shower you with kisses"
mornings would be better with you in bed
"it feels nice, taken care of"
winter nights ft you
if only you could see yourself through my eyes
i write about you in ways words could never describe
it’s been too long since i’ve felt anything
the way she gets excited over something small never fails to put a smile on my face
"if this isn't the hardest decision, i don't know what is"
at this point i really don't want anything else but her
"god, she’s so fucking beautiful"
"put me to sleep, i’m tired, i’m tired of everything"
she has a way of comforting me by just existing
"incase nobody’s told you already, you’re beautiful"
"i learned a lot today, i realized so much"
just because you don’t tell me doesn’t mean i won’t find out
"i opened up today, nothing felt better"
i will fucking bury every memory attached to you
"i’ve been at war with myself for the past 6 years, what’s your excuse?"
sometimes your all just isn’t enough for them
"if you start to realize that you’re not appreciated enough, run, fucking run as fast as you can"
you get tired of explaining to people on how you should be treated
listen to my heart speak your name
my trust issues fuck me up every single time
are you with me or against me
you gave me enough reasons for me to believe that i don’t mean anything to you
i have a bad habit of repeating the same mistake over and over again
disappointment led me to this
tell me something nice like you can’t sleep without my hands around your waist
october should’ve been kinder
you fucked up
bury your face in my chest and tell me you miss me
"you can pretend all you want, you and I both know that I can see right through you"
a cup of coffee dark enough to reflect my thoughts on
god how does smiling look that good on her
nothing good lasts anymore
"i mean, you can be my breakfast"
"come here, those lips aren’t going to bite themselves"
i’m still breathing
i need coffee and a pair of arms around me
i’m not sure my hands belong anywhere but between your thighs
and i hope every sip of your coffee reminds you of me
i filled my emptiness with sadness
don’t make me doubt your loyalty
i always wake up to something more disappointing than the previous day
it’s always better if you don’t think about it
"i try, i really do try my hardest to be nice, but people just always disappoint me and give me reasons why i shouldn’t"
i don’t really feel like being apart of this world anymore
slow kisses on your neck all the way down to your thighs for breakfast
"there’s no next time, it’s either now or never"
not so loveable today are you
"you’re always replaceable, remember that"
October 24
"i’m sorry if i changed, but so did you"
"there are no words for the way your heart explodes silently between your lungs, there are no words for this kind of pain"
"come now, wrap your body around mine"
sorry but could you fuck off with your negativity?
"overthinking will ruin everything, just breathe and let it go"
"if you don’t, someone else will"
sad songs and chill
fill this void of mine fill this emptiness inside me
"you’re still on my mind, just not in my heart"
"i need to get out of here, that’s the plan"
i need new friends with the same mentality
i need more coffee and more cuddles
don’t be so hard on yourself
thursdays don’t feel like thursdays anymore
cold hands and eyes that don’t sparkle but i still get lost in them
can you smell the sadness in the atmosphere?
yes i will look at the moon with you tonight
give her flowers and soft kisses on her cheeks
plot twist: you’re their first choice
i blasted her favorite songs and wrote about how she reminds me of happiness
men need tenderness too
"her petals maybe soft, but she has a heart braver than anyone i’ve ever met"
you can see the way her eyes scream ‘help’
"let it in, let it hurt you and destroy everything till you’re left with nothing, and only then, you’ll be free"
people don’t usually say what they feel so allow me
"i’d take a bullet for you, i just hope you don’t turn out to be the one who pulls the trigger"
but i’ve never seen anything so delicate and sweet as you
will you still want me when you no longer need me?
"i know that pain is part of the process, but i find myself in the middle of the night wondering if people only left the bad parts in me"
stop giving too much to people who won’t do the same in return
here’s a reminder that your smile is lovely
he made her hate herself that she forgot how to love someone else
through her eyes i was someone else
i’m happy
stop expecting anything from anyone
"i enjoy observing people, i like looking at things and appreciate their details"
i’ll write more
i know it’s inappropriate but the very thought of my hands between your thighs gives me goosebumps
is this the phase where everything just doesn’t matter anymore?
Egypt is sucking the life out of me
but can he make your entire body smile?
a walk in this weather talking about absolutely anything is needed
asking someone to stay seems so much nowadays
i always wonder why i can never find the right words to say when i’m talking to you
we don’t really fit anywhere do we
i hate nothing more than not being able to stay mad at you
but has it ever occurred to you that maybe the person you’re trying to love perhaps doesn’t deserve to be loved?
this winter is going to be very interesting
“cause fucked up is my new sober”
sext: toast with melted cheese
"i’ll stop writing when i stop breathing, then you can read what i wrote for you"
"i just love the fact that nobody truly knows me, it gives me this inner satisfaction that i couldn’t describe"
"you’re not alone, i don’t know what i’m doing either"
i’ve been writing a lot lately
she put her head on my hands and nothing felt warmer
"i’m trying, i swear i am"
why do people get mad when you treat them the same way they’re treating you?
destroy me but do it slowly
i need something to fill this hole of mine
let’s plan an escape
"i’m not good with people, i’m not really good with anything"
be patient with people who are trying to fix themselves
bring it back to me bring life back into me
i can promise deep conversations and long walks with all my heart along the side
but are you happy?
do you still taste the past every time you lick your lips and bite it whenever a memory hits you?
spread more love and spread more legs
i’ll always do what i love and nobody can ever stop me
OCTOBER BABY
"i don’t even have the energy to keep a conversation going with anybody, literally"
i push everyone away because they’re better off without me
the urge of covering your body in poems
suck the words out of me and swallow all it’s meanings
1 am
it feels nice sometimes  to not think about anything at all
cuddling in complete silence is my kinda thing
what’s better than a morning joint with a cup of coffee filled with your love in it?
but how could you love such a mess like me
my coffee is filled with thoughts about you
you get tired of putting effort into something useless
but being sad is part of my personality now sweetie
people tend to casually say ‘i love you’ but have no idea what that even means
i have so much love to offer to others but never to myself and that’s just sad
"don’t bring out that side of me, just don’t"
tired eyes are the saddest eyes you could ever look at
i promised but then i lied
"i get jealous, don’t do this"
it feels like every year is more challenging than the previous one
"ache and hunger, how long can one survive eating nothing but pain"
"be gentle with her, she's sensitive"
"i've been thinking a lot lately, and things are going to be ugly for a lot of people"
goodmorning
put life back into me
decided to turn my wall into poetry
we built our love upon silence
i will touch many hearts but mine will always belong to you
this morning i decided to miss you a little more
her eyes
spread poetry everywhere you go
a rooftop convention about how beautiful this weather is
"i don't mind giving you everything, but what is everything when you’ve given all your pieces away?"
"hey guess what, some people actually give a fuck"
"enough about that, i need more coffee and your face to stare at"
i need you in my arms right now
"her eyes got me, they weren't normal eyes, no; they were the kind eyes you fall on your face every time you look at them"
how our hands together make the finest art
spoil me with affection
you deserve the best so don't settle for less
her presence makes me happy
"it feels nice, to enjoy your own silence"
what do i do when the night comes and i break into shattered pieces
such a lovely day to bury my face in your chest and forget about everything else
tell me lies like you miss my hands between your thighs
i started liking sunflowers a lot more when i saw your face
"she didn't need to speak, her eyes said everything her mouth couldn't"
we're everything and nothing at the same time
does nothing consider a feeling?
"breathe just a little bit longer, we'll get past this i promise"
"that's the thing, i never say anything i don't mean"
a morning joint to start forgetting reality was even a thing
i'm still trying my best to not act how i feel
"i can't repeat the same mistake, not this time"
distance ruins so many possibilities
everyday*
i feel like writing my heart out but forgot that it doesn't even exist
my thoughts were too loud i couldn't hear anybody's voice
pestle and mortar your way out of life
i should have kissed you when i had the chance
mornings are useless if our lips aren't touching
drowning in a state of perpetual dehydration
"i want to be happy, but this society just makes me want to drown in my own sorrow"
i don't know anything at this point
this world was never for us
saying you need someone is probably the hardest thing to do
her eyes took me to places i thought never existed
this might sound cheesy but all i want is to wake up to your face every morning
tell me when you're ready to kill yourself and we'll talk about it tomorrow for coffee
do not fucking use my past against me
"the love you gave to others will always come back to you, but you won't always receive it from the people you gave it to"
sometimes silence is the only way we could communicate with one another
you're in the midst of chaos and tidiness but it'll pass
you're stuck between wanting it all and not wanting anything and that's also fine
you're stuck between emotional and emotionless and that's completely fine
my words only have meanings when they're about you
i'm jealous of your bed and all the things you do on it
a girl who comes on time is a keeper
someone take me to London
"days like these don't come with a warning sign, they just happen"
i need a joint
soft hands and what they do
"jealousy is going to fuck me up, i just know it"
you're drowning in your own thoughts seeking peace within yourself
"you're probably alone with the lights off and music blasting in your ears with your mind jumping from thought to thought, yeah same"
"i've been trying not to write about you lately, but all the words in this world seem to fit you perfectly"
i like a woman who wears a smile on her face
"careful, she's fragile"
but sadness runs in my blood darling
be proud of yourself for making it this far
knowing too much often scares people
"let's kiss first, we'll talk about it later"
talking to you makes me happy
the part of me that used to miss you no longer exists
she has the type of eyes you get lost looking at
what is sleep and how do you do  it
my everything is fucked
"this time i'm not writing about it, i'll leave the page empty"
waiting for something that may or may not happen is by far the worst feeling you could ever have
patience is the only word i could describe my phase with
"you can't push everyone away and expect them to chase you, some like the chase, others don't"
this is only the beginning of your end dear
just because i write about love doesn't mean i'm actually in love
"hi, i need a drink"
don't try to fix someone and break yourself in the process
does your heart still feel heavy when their names come up?
coffee ft thoughts about you
insomnia please stay the fuck away from me
some things are beautiful but then there's her
wednesday
words and what they do to us
some people just don't know how beautiful they really are
something tells me this is going to last a while
and the day in which we stop writing about each other is perhaps the day we stop existing
when was the last time your heart smiled?
are you going to make me feel or are you going to make me write?
does home really feel like home to you?
i have a bad habit of ignoring the bad in people and only seeing the good in them
i'm in a desperate need of cuddles and affection
but does her words make you feel alive?
"i mean, why can't happy people be attractive to me, why do i always fall for those sad eyes looking straight into me as if they know me"
"what is it with sadness always finding a way to enter my life, even if that means through a person"
why do i always get attracted to sad girls like what the fuck
despair
"don't kill yourself yet, let's have a drink first"
you reach a certain limit where you just no longer give a fuck you know
"fuck, the memories"
let's tell each other pretty words since that's all we're good at
you seem like someone who would be incredible to be loved by
"shame on me for not always being happy and always moody, i'm what they call misunderstood"
i've been living in my own bubble lately and everything around me just doesn't matter anymore
we're a sucker for words you and i and that's how we usually fall in love
god i hate how parents never understand how depression is fucking their kids and they do absolutely nothing about it
tonight let me write a poem on your neck and whisper it in your ears
how her eyes still said fuck me but gently
you will always be too much for someone
i wish i could explain but i just can't find the words to
let's end this night together
2:44 am
let's stare at the sky together tonight
we're just simply trying to figure out who we are
and i got addicted
i'll love you because it's not something hard to do
i would close my eyes and feel it all over again
your absence no longer makes me feel anything
you don't forget the lips that taught you how to kiss though
insomnia has been my best friend lately
"thighs, always the thighs, sigh"
if this isn't me i don't know what is
your lips wanted to speak words your mind didn't
let's run while there's still time
share your writings with me so i know it's real
"do you ever just look at someone and be like ""i could be good to you"""
"god it was so smooth i almost knew everything about that girl from just staring at her eyes, it was absolutely priceless"
so last night this girl and i had eye contact for literally 10 minutes and i could swear i felt the world spinning around us
disappointments no longer surprise me
everybody wants something but everybody doesn't want to do anything about it
"i have zero energy and motivation to do anything lately, everything is just shallow"
dancing is attractive
how is there so much tenderness and warmth in her eyes
in an urgent need of a long tight hug
i miss writing about you
"smile more often, it looks nice on you"
this too shall pass
"keep moving, no matter what"
there's a huge difference between wanting and needing someone
i never intended to use you to fill my emptiness
but this time i'm fixing myself
i've been having conversations with myself a lot lately
a girl who can roll is a girl you keep
she's the type of girl who takes long walks and longer kisses
some people are not appreciated enough
kill them with kindness and bury them with a smile
may i?#MiddleEasternsBreakTheInternet
you get tired of all the negativity around you
i hope you don't get tired of me being sad
don't you just love how religious people get when someone dies then a week later they're back to their normal routine of being hypocrites
having a crush on someone can be painful sometimes
i sense warmth in her eyes and that's something very rare to find
did you know that people are fragile and you could easily hurt them?
"be better for yourself, not for someone"
can you make coffee?
my mind is consumed by the thought of you
mornings are so peaceful
my morning coffee would taste a lot better if we were sharing it
she pours so much passion into words it drives me crazy
i could hug you for hours
YOU DON'T NEED PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE TO BE HAPPY
for how long are we going to keep escaping reality hoping something would change?
sharing coffee is actually a big deal to me
i need more coffee and joints and less stress and people in my life
i daydream about kissing you more than i should
my heart keeps longing for a reason
don't make a home out of people
girls who wear black ripped jeans always have my heart
"the vibe was weird, very weird"
it all starts with one sad song leading to the next
people like us write to survive
people usually wake up when it's already too late
it's sad when you can no longer have any sort of attachment towards another person from how much trust issues you got
it's funny because i'm sure 10 years from now i'm going to be in bed with some girl staring at the ceiling thinking what happens next
"sorry dear, i've wasted all my energy on the wrong people"
do you ever just don't feel like talking to anybody so you don't reply to them and they get mad for no reason? cause same
making someone change cigarette brands and quitting coffee is a satisfaction on it's own
"don't take my honesty for flirting, please"
good grammar turns me on
"no, i didn't miss you, i was just too horny"
let's hold hands on rough days and pretend that nothing happened
"it's a matter of time and patience, we're all itching for something mutual"
just wait for the comeback
coffee after every orgasm sounds a lot like i love you whispered softly into my ears
let's get high enough to not know our way down
but i've got nothing to offer anybody
poetry is jealous of your lips
"so i slept for 14 hours and my dad thought i died, sigh"
it always ends up with someone feeling empty
PLEASE
people never change man
but i said i was tired of writing the same words every time
"somethings are either dead or deadly, and i'm lost somewhere between the two"
"to be loved, not only missing you in my arms"
we felt the stars inside us slowly pulling in a way words never could
and write what i don't say
you know what breaks my heart? slow fucking internet
a home like your chest
"then it hits you; you are entirely and completely alone, in every sense possible"
i would do us in a way words never could
"when I dream of you tonight, I will hold myself back"
she's in love with the way i make her feel
it's so wrong but feels so good
"but when it comes to writing, she's the first thing that comes in mind"
let me pour this emptiness down for you
i can't sit next to you without wanting to kiss you
7:19 am
is it too early for such a mess?
i wonder how the moon feels like when you look at it
"she reminded me of sugarless coffee and cheap cigarettes, both of which I found utterly addictive"
at this point love will lose it's meaning
i have too many fantasies that make me sad
going with the flow sometimes means doing something you don't want to do
it's funny how people appreciate something when it's dead or gone
i appreciate people with a good mindset
angels like you don't belong here
careful not to catch feelings now
a cup of coffee with good music
i'm tired of fixing others when i can't fix myself
and i'm obsessed with anything that has to do with you
"something about this month is weird, just doesn't feel right, at all"
do you mind if i keep my head on your shoulders for the night?
i should write about the way flowers bloom when they see that face of yours
such a beautiful smile you have there
trust myself? i don't even know myself
you should see the way i look at you when you're not paying attention
i wanted coffee but she gave me her lips instead
"we can be alone, together"
"is ""waste my time"" written on my forehead?"
you told me that nights like these make you feel some type of way
her arms somehow became my comfort zone
i still taste your lips on every cigarette i smoke
"god, she's so fragile it gives me the tendency to hold myself back"
inflicting pain became my favorite addiction
I wonder what you think of me when someone mentions my name
*holds your ass as a friend*
but you can't smoke or drink your way out of love
"it's killing me, slowly"
god short replies do know how to turn me the fuck off
curiosity always kills me
sunday morning
she has that 'fuck me' eyes and i can't stop staring
but can i kiss her already?
i still feel your presence near every now and then
some coffee would be heavenly right now thank you
"""just friends"" doesn't always work you know"
same
my stubborn heart just doesn't know when is enough
but how long have you been dying for?
I have a thing for aquarius and gemini women
I despise people who think they could come and go in your life whenever they please
what is sleep?
"i don't know man, weird people attract me"
but who do I go to when I need a shoulder to lay my head on?
I don't even know how to keep a conversation going anymore
the fact that I don't get along with people sometimes scares me
sigh
smile when you pretend that i'm there next to you
it's no longer a phase babe
"I've lived my entire life with disappointments, another one won't even make me clinch"
"random thought, you're beautiful"
when do we skip the introduction and go straight for coffee?
someone talk to me about how lonely this morning is
I need to stop fantasizing about mutual love
it's funny how you lose people in a blink of an eye
"oh, August how i've missed you"
maybe we're from the same hell
can I airplane mode my life?
break me into pieces and call it love
so many attractive faces with dull personalities it's a shame
what a tragedy this is
"if I can only write when i'm high or sad, am I really writing or just venting?"
I don't need anything but your presence
we made out to car radio and it silenced our thoughts
"the memories to this song is just too hard to overcome, the amount of people i've lost and gained in that period of time is ridiculous"
am I the only one that feels like 2017 ran by like a car?
it's a harsh world dear
coffee after every orgasm sounds good
but my music taste changes at night
"by looking at the stars the other day, I was looking for the one that would tell me about you"
it could be worse you know
"have a seat dear, it's a long night"
i've spent too much time in my head that I forgot what reality looks like
"oh, but have you seen her smile?"
coffee is always a good idea
i'm just waiting for that day to come where it all makes sense
maybe somebody we'll go to bed together every night
I hoped for things to be different but I guess it's all the same
perhaps I only fall in love at night
words are rushing on my paper but not to your lips
"no, but you can be my cup of coffee"
insomnia
do you ever just sit there and think of all the things that could've been different if one small thing changed?
as her tears keep pouring she's slowly freeing herself from pain
I know this isn't right but I actually love with all my heart
perhaps silence connects us in a way words never could
you make me feel like poetry does on a lonely night
"is it time for me to hurt you, yet?"
I need dahab right now
coffee no longer tastes like coffee without your lips on them
"everyone you meet is a star in the sky, until one of them becomes the brightest"
can I just turn off my thoughts for one night?
"love isn't suppose to be this sour, she said"
some things just don't make sense anymore
I somehow can't get you out of my mind and it's slowly killing me
smile everytime you cry
"you haven't seen my worst yet, love"
"I have a thing for people telling me ""I've got your back"" it always just touches me"
I miss the soft sighs your lips made when they were locked in mine
i'm sorry i'm not good at keeping people in my life
"I always survive, that's the thing"
"I admit, I fall for broken people"
you always hope for the unexpected to happen but fail to realize that everything happens for a reason
she's a piece of art waiting to be discovered by someone who appreciates details
sometimes you just can't find the right words for how you're feeling
it's terrifying
I want to believe you but I can't
her flaws are beautiful
and I was told that time heals pain
can I stay here forever? it's nice and warm
"wait, are these feelings?"
talk to me about horoscopes and tell me yours matches mine
be tender
long walks on the seashore
I run out of words every time you look at me
the night is only missing you in my arms
"why now, insomnia, why now"
but this is different
I wish I had more eyes to see you from different angles
bend over and let our words collide
I looked at the sky and your name was the brightest
I never liked me either
"there's always a way to do something if you really want it, always"
I finally feel like there's a place I fit in
I hate how difficult it is to communicate with people who just don't even try
cigarettes after sex on the beach
the moon is beautiful tonight
the waves and I are having a serious conversation tonight
"i'm losing interest, again"
I get tired of writing the same words every time
but animals don't break your heart
we'll be getting high under the stars tonight
"her face, sigh"
"thats the thing with eyes man, they can always tell what words can't"
your eyes always said it but I tried my hardest not to believe it
her thoughts woke me up in the middle of the night just to drown me in the mysteries that roamed her mind
it was nothing more than a short sad story
nails are so fucking attractive
small talk will always be my biggest turn off
"I actually take things seriously, maybe that's also why I don't get along with anybody"
me
"have coffee with me, let's talk about how coffee reacts to your lips"
"we've all been hurt by words before, but how many have died from words?"
"I know I get too attached, you don't need to remind me"
sarcasm is literally the biggest turn off
maybe laying my head on your lap and falling asleep could cure this loneliness
"everybody's broken, nobody's happy"
late night sighs coming out of her mouth hoping i'd still be here in the morning
it's tragic how love changes people
read my fingertips roaming your body instead
I just can't stay sober for this
I have a thing for these photos
"but I never searched for words, they somehow found me"
what a lovely night to bury myself between your legs and hope for a better tomorrow
I can't even people anymore
"it never ends, does it"
"as cheesy as it sounds, I never stopped thinking about you since the day you looked at me"
you can rest your head on my shoulders while you cry
is it too much love for you to handle?
my hands found comfort between your legs
but every song begins with her heartbeat
how is your life going?
you just don't know how lovely you are
"hold my heart with tenderness, it has suffered enough"
"pushing people away? oh, it's what I do best"
I like it when you roam my mind
but didn't you know?  coffee heals too
tell me kind words like let's stare at each others face
reality is just a chaotic place for your eyes to experience
excitement made you stay after he first looked you in eyes and said he loved you
caffine tasted better on your lips
I saw the stars shine in your eyes
"we don't have to talk, our eyes pretty much said everything they wanted us to know"
let me add a little bit of tenderness and warmth on your lips
nap dates should be a thing
second language: overthinking
smiling between kisses will always be my favorite
I just can't find the words anymore
woke up craving the taste of coffee on your lips
we should take a walk to nowhere
"oh look, the stars are calling your name tonight"
I saw a blurry piece of heaven in her eyes
it's a full moon tonight and everything looks like little broken pieces
and hope that basket doesn't fall
and suddenly everybody remembers you when they have nobody
talk to me and tell me you miss me even if you haven't
"my excuse will always be ""i'm too high for this"""
at this point either be nice or leave me alone
it's not love if your body doesn't ache when they leave
sit next to me when I write about how beautiful that smile is
when did I become a morning person..
she has the type of hands you would feel lost without holding them
a pretty face won't hide an ugly personality
all she does is live in memories she's trying to forget
but I always thought that you can escape pain if you force yourself not to feel hurt
"it's a lonely morning, the birds aren't singing"
stare at me like you stare at words
sleep needs to find me before I go insane
"I tend to talk to myself a lot, what about you?"
god this coffee needs you right now
is this possible?
"you define love the way you experience it, but that doesn't mean your way is correct"
two cups of coffee a broken heart chapped lips  and flowers growing  between her legs
I no longer know how to reply to someone asking how I am
and some hours feel like years
i'm tired and I don't know how to make it sound like poetry anymore
more coffee please
let's sit by the seashore and listen to the waves sing to your heartbeat
can't you smell the loneliness in the air tonight?
"we either hold hands and stargaze in silence or fuck our pain away, there's no in between"
fuck my trust issues into little pieces and make me swallow it
"it's quite interesting really, getting to know everything about a person without having to talk to them"
you're somehow different and I like that
let's gather all the sadness in this world and cuddle with it
i'd pick your storm over anyone else's sunshine
but even pretty words would get jealous of your beauty
keep those who care
"loneliness is a howling, empty cavern inside me that just keeps growing"
let's listen to sad songs together
I saw all the poetry in her eyes
more sleep is needed
"but you, you're something else, you're that something that never loses it's taste no matter how sour people try to make it"
flashbacks and what they do to you
I don't believe in happy endings
"pardon me for staring, but I admire art"
"a girl with a cat, is a girl you should marry"
oh but what a beauty she is
attention whoring disgusts me
"hey, I wrote something"
show me your softest side and let me pinch it
and tonight we write
it's always better when nobody knows anything about you
"I just no longer feel like it, putting effort and making conversations with anybody, I even lost interest in that"
she has stars on her skin brighter than a sky full of stars
let's take romantic walks to your bed
"I need new people in my life, people who wouldn't give me excuses and people who are just as crazy as I am, is that too much to ask for?"
"you're weird, i'm weird, why not be weird together?"
i'm aching for tenderness and warmth in a world full of coldness and bitterness
"it's quite saddening, specially when writing is the only thing that puts a smile on my face"
"i'm blocked, and I no longer can find words to describe how i'm feeling about anything in my life"
"I need to write, I need to let it all out, but I just can't"
let me show you all the beautiful things in this world by pressing my lips softly on your neck
"I guess some people really like it when you treat them like shit, it's disgusting"
"but it's always my fault, and it always will be"
i'm sorry that nothing seems to interest me anymore
tell her you love her before somebody else does
we could play mommy and daddy but you want to play friends so just be it
tomorrow might be better
no page could carry the weight of the words that I have for you
but I changed myself so that I could survive this cruel world you created for me
my hands will always be empty for you to hold when you feel lonely
"she's good with words, but she's better in bed"
something about this month just feels weird
my thoughts spilled words over a blank piece of paper to tell you that I no longer know you
there's nothing more intimate enough than being understood
and my words are only beautiful because they're about you
is it just me that loves the new twitter update?
her face was poetic enough for poetry to feel jealous
"people are changing, they're growing up, but i'm sill just me"
"I may have forgotten how to love, but i'll always remember how to write it"
we all fear rejection but fail to understand that our own acceptance is more important
you can't keep holding the devils hands and expect him to lead you to paradise
looking at the beauty of the sky this morning reminded me of your face
chinese food is bae
will you inhale the same air I do even if it was toxic?
"I saw you in my nightmares, again"
"we could have coffee first, the bed could wait"
the melody of your heartbeat scared my demons away with how softening and tender they are
she said my name in her softest sighs and thats when I knew her voice was going to be my favorite song
she sexualized my fingers between her thighs
"revenge is just an illusion, it's the art of killing someones soul and still letting them breathe"
my fingers roam her body as if they're searching for home
these feelings that never subside
she was never into poetry until our hands met and made love to each others tenderness
i've been having some me time and I couldn't be happier
she wrote poems about how my fingers roamed her body
sext: read to me out loud
"she told me I was her first, so I told her i'm not her last either"
let me spill poison on your tongue and tell me it tastes good
you still got a lot to learn
it's a full moon tonight and babe all I could think about is how your face still lights up the night
"I don't need an escape from reality, I need an escape from humans"
not in the mood for any nice words
you just have to pick who you want to struggle with
and today was beautiful
"but first, coffee"
love doesn't make any sense but that's okay
she moaned my name like it was her favorite lullaby
i'm all ears for words like yours
I found comfort inside her ribcage
"patience, I need more of it"
"ruin my life, i'm okay with that"
"remember, nobody really gives a fuck"
"few words, a thousand meanings"
I miss the conversations our eyes made
i've been running out of words lately
fifty shades of coffee and overthinking
no appetite for anything but her love
"it's sunday, we're suppose to be at church but instead we're in bed staring at each other"
I tried to find words to describe how I feel but it just turned out that I didn't have any feelings to begin with
let's create a religion and name it after you
curiosity and what it does
and by death it basically means you
my hands formed poetry on her neck
let's just hope he doesn't use my words to make you fall for him
"make every word count, otherwise you're wasting your time"
someday someone will listen
but emptiness still follows me everywhere
you bring out the side everyone else failed to bring out
a cup of loneliness and depression in the morning
"she's not god, but in my dreams she walks on water"
she makes love sound unique
"june, be tender"
"the thing is, i'll always survive whatever comes at me"
the birds woke up to your beauty this morning
"look at me while you do it, I want to see if you mean it"
the closer I get the more destructible I feel
I like it better with my hands around your throat
but when is too much coffee ever too much
everything is dull without her
Bassel Khayat appreciation tweet
"we just wanted to be okay, again"
"because you see, we often yearn for things we have no control over"
teach your daughters that their bodies aren't objects and teach your sons that their feelings matter
she had the smell of cigarettes on her lips which I lit up
how a humans brain can be easily played with is a tragedy
if you can't handle my assholeness then how are you going to handle my gentleness
fill the emptiness in my soul with a cup of coffee and a touch of your hands
it gets dark inside
"i'd never go back, that's the thing"
look at the sunset and how the sun is dazzled from looking at your face
"I didn't need her to say it, I just saw it in her eyes"
my warmth gave her assurance
our quiet hearts disengage the day absence of laughter like unraveled ends
I break my own heart before I allow anyone else to break it
I drew her name on every star my eyes laid on
"the moon is bright tonight, but her smile's brighter"
she helps me write poetry on her body in the softest moans
writing a poem inside her mouth with my fingertips was like dipping salt in honey
i'm a selfish prick when it comes to what's mine
this unbearable headache and moodiness is just too much
my coffee is sour without your lips on them
we get addicted to words hoping they were only said to us
taking selfies is goals?..
send halal nudes
"I didn't say anything, I walked away just like that"
i'm sorry you have to deal with me at all
"words can break hearts, but they could also mend shattered pieces"
she would curl into a ball and pretend to be asleep just to feel you waking her up
a part of me left with her
the road is not lonely anymore
nothing keeps you up all night like a storm of rage and an occupied mind
we look at each other like it's the last time we're ever going to experience happiness
the fact that we breathe the same air is enough for me
my trust issues are telling me that this is all just a dream
you're that masterpiece in an art gallery everyone stops and takes pictures of
let me kiss your insecurities and fuck your fears
who thought it would be like this
I envy my lips when they're on your neck; and I pity my arms when they aren't around your waist
I plan to leave marks on your body to know my way back
god this coffee is so good
it's almost 4 am and you're not in my bed
let's count the stars tonight
calling her beautiful like it's her first name
"her heart's heavy, the world's pressure is on her back"
"can you feel it, yet?"
let my hands be the last hands to ever touch your skin
"i'm being way too romantic lately, someone stop me"
how sweet my name sounds when it's coming out of her lips
we forget what we want to say when we look at each other
I would eye contact the fuck out of you
it aches to not have you in my arms
I would stare at you all day if I could
who do we call when we don't find our way back?
where do we run to when we're lost?
cover me with affection tonight
let's sit in silence and let our eyes talk
rest your head on my chest and let my hands wander your skin like it does best
a cup of coffee with your love stirred in it
because they always want it when it's gone
let our demons hold hands tonight
a cup of coffee by the beach with candlelight is all I really need
sitting in silence with you calms the storm inside me
touch the side of me that nobody ever has
we could lay our heads on the sand by the seashore and count the stars
"allow me to be in your dreams tonight, I promise to be worth it"
maybe the sky hears our whispers of sadness
"I don't really participate in ""life"" anymore"
can I write a poem on your lips?
teach your kids that life can break your heart too
it's heavy tonight
how would I be capable of loving someone when I don't know how to love myself
i'm physically and mentally drained
I fell in love with the way she looks at me
is there enough emptiness in you for me to fit in?
let's breakdown together
claim your worth and you'll find yourself thinking less of the person that left you in pieces
from nice to a complete dick because people will only use how nice I am to get what they want
"i'm sorry I woke up again, I wasn't planning to"
details attract me
she falls for guys who get her coffee
I got lost in words that only your lips could spell
end my life gently
"stop being this beautiful in public, it makes me jealous that other people get to see that beauty"
"she doesn't write poetry, she is poetry itself"
we're only going to get better at destroying ourselves
do you remember?
plot twist: you like me
stress after stress after stress after stress after stress after stress after stress after stress after stress after stress after stress
sext: let's write something together
it's been too heavy on my chest lately
I forgot how to love someone
we'd make such a beautiful mess together
i'm still trying
blinking is a sin when it comes to looking at you
"you didn't love me, you loved the way I loved you"
"3 am, she misses him and he misses her"
her lips
nobody warned me that my hands would miss you this much
I don't need to see daylight in the morning if your face is the first thing I see when my eyes open
"let's go for a long walk, to a place we are yet to discover"
let's be angry at the world together
the struggle between wanting and needing
"I no longer know how to say nice things to someone, it's terrifying"
it's one of these nights again where I just want to close my eyes and pretend it never happened
those soft lips of yours could end the war that's going on in my head
lay down next to me and tell me everything's going to be okay
"where will my mind take me tonight, I wonder"
I want to kiss her music taste
"pride made me lose a lot of people, but it also made me realize that those people weren't even worth my time"
I should get a scholarship in pretending
I can still feel loneliness from a mile away
"her eyes, prt 2"
"she has this thing called a heart, it's quite nice"
her eyes
it doesn't have to be this way you know
I didn't mean to use you to fill my emptiness
it felt like a scene out of a movie
there's so much sadness and loneliness on my shoulders
I need someone who stays up with me all night
it's usually the ones who give everything are the ones who deserve everything
this isn't poetic anymore
I enjoy having conversations with myself
her face is the only poetry I need
I love randomness
insomnia
you'd be surprised
I saw the stars in your eyes and got lost looking at them
the moon is bright as her smile tonight
"don't get too close, there's nothing but darkness here"
I ask myself questions I have no answers for
plot twist: let's not stop talking
"I should tattoo ""waste my time"" on my forehead to attract more attention"
we're not okay but that's okay
for once I want to feel people are worthy of putting my pride down for
how empty the street is reminds me of the emptiness that's inside of me
there was a maze in your head which people never found the exit but me
passion
let's hold the moon together tonight
it's a tragedy that you're not in my arms yet
let's go for a long walk and not say a single word to each other
"you can just lay your head on my chest, it'll be okay"
i'll look for every excuse to touch you
"but this isn't poetry, this is self destruction"
"nothing hurts anymore, it's weird"
strangers kiss too
let my words fill your loneliness and give you a little bit of warmth
nostalgia
"she's sensitive and insecure and ruins everything she touches, I like her"
are we sinning or praying tonight?
my grandmother would've liked you
your skin over mine might cure the ache our bodies crave right before we sleep
do flowers get jealous when they see you with someone else too?
staring at strangers as a hobby
I need to be cheered up 24/7 to be honest
"choices have consequences that affect other people, so choose wisely"
"and maybe in the morning when the sky is still young and alluring, we'll smile again"
but maybe sleeping next to you could cure my insomnia
let's do loneliness together
let's make bad decisions together
"she's a big girl now, she can take care of herself"
i'll glance at your imperfections and still think you're perfect
my chest is filled with empty holes so it drowns in the depths of your words
stop chasing after people and start chasing your own happiness
stop putting so much effort into temporary people
stop giving too much of yourself to the wrong people
you in my arms while the weeknd is playing in the background
she looked at me with eyes of curiosity
what's holding you back?
"we're suppose to stand together through hard times, isn't that what love is?"
"here's a reminder that your opinion is still irrelevant to my life, so just keep it to yourself"
let's sit at a coffee shop and stare at each other
from nothing into something
"they can keep trying, they'll never be me"
but I bet you didn't know that you were in my drafts
"i'll love you gently tonight, like a rose kissed by sun light"
"I heard you heard about my miserable past, would you still look at me the same after all that you've heard?"
maybe i'm not trying hard enough or maybe i'm just not that interested to try harder
and you became like coffee my new addiction
*holds my cat and asks her if she loves me*
"just because I know a lot of people doesn't mean they're all my friends, no; I only have 2 or 3 friends and that's all I really need"
my heart is too heavy for a night like this
tonight
"touch me, touch me in places nobody ever touched me in"
"I love talking to you, even if we have nothing to talk about"
"we weren't suppose to part ways, but thats what happens when someone catches feelings"
"you know, i'm just getting pretty tired of everybody"
we're writers writing our way to escape
what she does to me
I watch them go one by one
if I didn't say it then fuck what you heard
tell me you're mine even if you're not
i'll drink to that
"May, be nice"
sometimes all it takes is just one look
she still blooms
i'm always going to wonder how it would be like if I had taken the other road
coffee? coffee
"if you have a piece of me, take good care of it, I no longer have anything to give"
anywhere but here is good for me
do flowers bloom when they see your face too?
she said sorry for mistakes she never did
how many cups of coffee will it take for me to think straight again
but only time will tell
"this is too boring, I need something that excites me"
they all care when it's too late
"she asked me to be myself with her,   she was out of my life an hour later"
"you hate how i'm always right, you hate that I know everything about you"
we should kiss while there's still time
I lied about loving you but I never lied about what that mouth do
"tell me something, tell me there's still hope for me to have feelings for someone once again"
split open my ribcage and live in it
"I broke too many hearts to not want mine broken, so go ahead"
but there's no shame in breaking your heart tonight
the people that ignore you now will want you later
I want my fingers in your mouth with your eyes looking straight at me
my mind is aching with the thought of you
"love is only the beginning, it's what comes after that counts"
be patient with me
my definition of fun is cuddling naked in bed
"second chances mean correcting your mistakes, not repeating them"
"save your precious tears on someone who loves you, not hurts you"
"I've already lost interest before I even gain it, so just don't"
but I saw the crack in your smile that nobody will ever get to see but me
tonight i'll let my hands speak
*writes a poem on your body with my tongue*
I hope I become the best memory your mind gets to remember
this night is too heavy on my chest
and the sky is gray
the moon
with all this weight on her shoulders she still seems to make it through the night
I was hoping you would save me but you ended up wasting my time
"but will I ever be enough, is the question"
sing me to sleep and i'll read poetry in your ears
lonely people will always have a special place in my heart
but I told her I loved her and next morning I was in a different girls arms
"do I make you proud yet, dad?"
"I mean, we could fuck, but that would be too boring, let's go have coffee on the rooftop instead"
but baby we're only getting high to forget who we are
do my words touch you yet?
"fall in love with me, not who I pretend to be"
if I like you thats rare
"first I drink coffee, then I do life"
and you happened to be the truest lie I convinced myself to believe in
can my fingers wander gently on your back till you fall asleep?
you'd be surprised with the secrets people hide from you
"you can tell yourself all the lies you want, but don't forget that these wounds and tears were real"
I asked for breakfast and she opened her legs
I could taste the bitterness of coffee on your lips and that's when I knew you're about to ruin my life
that smile of yours broke so many hearts
"let this sink in, but you'd never find anyone like me"
I hope my words echo in your ears before you sleep
it's really hard to keep me interested
give me something to look forward to
can my hands accidentally touch your thighs and decide to squeeze it?
we could hold hands while drinking coffee
"you can pretend, but i'll still know what you're hiding behind that smile"
"I never ask anybody to stay, because I know nobody ever will"
"done all four, and i'm still alive"
what do I have to lose after all that i've already lost?
"you exist, and that's enough"
LUST FOR FUCKING LIFE
"talking about my past is like opening wounds that I thought were healed, it's too painful and vivid"
it's funny how I carry so much pain and rage inside me yet I still have the desire to spread love around me
a prisoner in my own thoughts
"words are too easy, but it's all that we have"
let's talk about how lucky my hands would be to wander your body freely
"excuse me sir, but could I barrow your daughter for the rest of my life?"
then eat you out afterwards
"they're all heartbroken, i'll pass"
remember when you write about me that ink is permanent and I don't deserve to live in your words
"she never got over you, her mind is aching with every sheer thought of you"
the problem with wanting to be someone's happiness is when you realize that happiness doesn't involve you
"but in my head there's always someone better, someone worthy my time, and someone kinder, but they stay in my head and never in yours"
does it scare you that while you're loving another person your heart is gradually falling out of love?
bury my face between your legs and play with my hair
I crave your lips as much as I crave coffee
try not to fall too hard this time
"so, what happens next?"
fill my emptiness
she's an angel in the middle of a fire pit
you're trying your best with me but it seems even your best is not enough for me
"but I broke her heart and she broke his for wanting me, sigh"
"i'm not patient when I want something right now, it's either now or never"
here's an appreciation tweet for girls with straight hair
I appreciate details
lovers with no hearts
"I've already lost faith and hope in everything, you won't surprise me nor excite me"
and if heaven truly exists then I hope it's your arms
nights were made for me to write beautiful things about you
"how many more people would it take to utter the words ""I love you"" to me for me to stop associating these words with your name?"
"but I never wanted her body, I only wanted her mind"
her tattoos are halal bro
do you miss me with his lips around your neck?
and every sad song that comes on reminds me of how hard you cried in my arms
reality is a cruel place
"help me gain myself back, i've lost it trying to figure you out"
be the poison in my veins spread like bees who lost their nest kill me gently with a touch of your hands
"have sex with a writer, they'll write about how you made them feel afterwards"
it's too much and not enough at the same time
I need a walk in this weather
she admired my words and I admired her soul
it's a perfect night to hold you close to me
you deserve happiness and I can't offer you that
I like it more when it's weird and makes no sense
"careful now, don't fall for my words, it's a trap"
"you meet a stranger, and all you know is that you need to know everything about them"
"she's not waiting for the ""I miss you"" text, she's waiting for you to show it"
criticism everywhere
"sigh, this is sickening, humans are sickening"
sneak peaks from today's kix photoshoot
tell your neck my lips miss it
the urge to hold you and not let go
she makes me write words that I never knew I was capable of finding
stop running away from the only thing that makes you happy
this might hurt
can we trade hearts? I don't need mine and i'll just break yours so we can be heartless together
"let's be sad together, the kind of sadness that sadness hasn't seen yet"
your lips should be on this cup of coffee
she pulls the lever that ignites my rage
I kept staring at you because I couldn't resist the beauty I saw in your eyes
her face is so numb it needs to be kissed
"she's sorry that you made her happy, that's what hurt her the most"
"point a gun to my head and I won't clench, but falling in love makes me suicidal"
"you will fall in love with car rides, and sooner or later you will realize that nowhere seems like home"
"we should be friends, the kind of friends that won't need words to understand each other"
"you can't change what turned me into who I am right now, but you can accept me and handle me at my worst"
"you can't rewrite my past, but you can just hold me and tell me you'll be there"
"eye contact, I live for that"
distance and I aren't really in good terms
my talent is pushing people away and losing interest
"they come and go you see, but something about her came and never left"
all I see is temporary feelings
don't hate me too much
"insomnia, leave me alone tonight, i'm begging you"
if only you existed to see what I write about you
why do people sleep so early and how do they simply do it?
"it was just about to get interesting, but then I lost interest"
she was reading a book and I was infatuated
she became the glowing flower in the garden
let me undress your body and finger your brains
"she likes cats, gives good head and writes poetry with her tongue, what else can you ask for?"
she's so obsessed with someone to love her because she simply can't love herself
"she's writing about a dead body,   can I be dead too?"
"she looks innocent and kind, let's ruin her life and make it miserable"
I just don't like who I am when i'm sober
oh but the smell of lust and temporary people is spreading
show me the side you don't show to anyone else
I dare you to make me feel again
the amount of things I lost hope and faith in is enormous
we can skip the part where we introduce ourselves and go straight to bed
do you still see a part of me in everyone's eyes?
and maybe one day the moon won't be as lonely as it looks
take my hands and let's explore parts about us that we didn't know existed
I don't put my pride down twice
"she told me she saw a good side of me, I told her don't let illusions fool you"
"but oh god do I love writing about it so much, It gives me inner comfort that somewhere in this universe it still exists"
"I can't imagine myself loving someone anymore, I just don't think it even exists"
"we don't think it even exists from how beautiful love is, so we just try our hardest to find words beautiful enough to describe it"
because we can only write about it beautifully without feeling it
when you know more about someone or something you start to look at them differently
I keep touching her soul thinking I wouldn't like it
"i've found comfort in my own mind, because I know that's something that will live with me forever"
can I leave my hands around your neck tonight?
"it's been a while since I wrote anything, so here's something"
getting high to the sound of your voice like it's my favorite song
it hurts me when I let anyone get close enough to know me
"i'm lost again, even when everyone is beside me"
it's messy in my head right now
"you can't break something that's already been broken a thousand times before, it doesn't work that way"
she's stuck in that stage of desperately wanting to move on but she knows that's the sign that she's still in love with you
"and for as long as I live i'll write beautiful poetry for you, even if i'm not beautiful myself"
i'm trying to avoid me too
she reads my mind like it's her diary
- what plans do you have for today? - you
"I woke up feeling so empty today, fill me with coffee and affection"
"I can be what you need and want, but just be tender with me"
"be tender with me, please"
I should've went to church today but instead you went on your knees and I just prayed
my hands and how it craves you
I've seen your tears come down from your eyes like a waterfall and only god knows how satisfying that was
does every song remind you of me yet?
knowing too much about people scares them away
losing interest in people became a hobby
I fell for her soft sighs against my neck
me flirting
and nobody will ever understand you or know you as much as I do and it kills you
i'm no artist but I drew you in my mind a thousand times
we could've at least stared at each other a little more
I want to sleep and wake up asking you for breakfast and watch you slowly open your legs
so I got her the solar system
feed me your neck and i'll feed you my words
"she hides the soft side of her, she only shows people how tough and unbreakable she is on the outside"
you're searching for the light in the wrong tunnel
the weather feels lonely tonight
"I know too much, I understand people too easily, one look and I just know everything about that person"
she needed arms to hug ger tight and shoulders to cry on
she was just craving the affection others failed to give her
she fell for my words far before she understood that every word had it's own meaning
"bring light into my soul once again, make me feel like I have a second chance at being whole once again"
"I tried being nice, it didn't really get me anywhere but on my knees asking myself why"
could you fill the emptiness inside me with tenderness and affection?
the softness of her skin somehow turns me on
allow me to write poems on every part of your body with my lips
"I'm becoming more of myself everyday, and i'm accepting who i'm becoming but that certainly doesn't give you the right to just judge"
"not that I care what others think, but the whole concept of somebody misunderstanding me just gets on my nerves"
I hate the fact that my personality constantly changes and that usually gives people the wrong impression of me
"she loves how crazy I drive her, but she doesn't know how crazy I am about her"
sext: I found a new way to love you
"""a lie never lasts"" I lied about loving her and till now she still believes that I do"
"the movie ""split"" touched me in ways movies haven't in a really long time"
your neck would look a lot nicer with my lips on them
I got addicted to the way you look at me
I want to do what books do to your imagination
seeing you die inside was my favorite part of it all
coffee and your lips for breakfast
she said I don't read enough poetry so I read her body from head to toe
my mind sometimes takes me to places I don't want to visit
I will notice every single little flaw about you and cherish it like it's one of my own
I would share my cup of coffee with you and I don't share
she reads books like it's her favorite porn movie
tell me when you've had enough so I could start
she fell in love with the feeling of my lips touching her neck
what do you call not afraid of dying but afraid of falling in love?
can I spill coffee on your neck to give you an excuse to lick it?
fill my lungs with flowers and kiss my cheeks with your red lipstick and i'm all yours
the conversations I have with myself are just endless
I just want someone to look me in the eyes and fucking tell me they see who the real me is and accept it
stop giving pieces of yourself that you're not even sure you have
humans are worse than drugs
how do you tell someone that you feel so empty without sounding so desperate or sad?
i'll hold your hands and guide you through bumpy roads but will you stick by my side when I need you?
do you ever tell people about the true depths of your loneliness? how you feel more alienated from people everyday?
sinning would look like heaven with her
distance makes my whole body ache
"the sky looks brighter when you're around, you're that shiny star in the middle"
"why do I always feel relieved when someone leaves my life, it's as if i'm telling them stop taking parts of me and just leave me whole"
if my mind wanders around just know it's on it's way to you
she saw things in me nobody else ever saw
can we just stare at the moon holding hands tonight?
hurting you would mean i'm just nice to you
my religion is our lips locked together
"I didn't want to use you to fill all my emptiness, but I couldn't stop wanting you"
how the smallest things get to me sometimes literally fills me up with so much rage
"I need to stop kissing my cat, I literally feel like i'm going to eat her face one day"
I like her more when her hair's messy
make me interested for more than 5 minutes if you can please
"she was a good girl till she met me, she turned into something she once hated"
"i'll make you proud one day dad, I promise"
i've seen your tears coming out of your eyes and they absolutely meant nothing to me
"so do me and yourself a favor and just let me be, it'll eventually get better on it's own"
"I mean no offense but i've heard the ""i'm suppose to cheer you up"" bullshit about a hundred times a day, it doesn't work with me"
"people really need to understand that when i'm moody, I don't like interacting with human beings, and i'm always moody"
"it disturbs me to hurt someone unintentionally, I want to feel it"
maybe I just need another cup of coffee
I crave your voice softly saying my name in my ears while you're biting your lip
is there a way out of my mind or will I always be stuck here?
"crying was never indicated that you are a weak person, it only shows how strong you are to fail and get back up again"
"I haven't seen my soft side in years, I believed it just vanished with the rest of the kindness I once had"
"I know, that's the problem"
i'm just trying to get you wet without having to use my hands
I think of a million ways to hurt you in my head but I end up only using one or two
"I only fall asleep next to someone I love, and that's why I have insomnia now"
my shirt smelled like her the other day I haven't washed it since then
the sky looks lonely this morning
how am I suppose to believe a word that you're saying when I hear the same words from different people everyday?
"these are just my thoughts, I respect everybody's beliefs and whatnot, so don't misunderstand me or put words in my mouth"
dear god
this hit hard
"I tattooed ""strength"" on my neck to remind you that nothing can break me"
show me your weirdest side and i'll show you mine
the way you think about a person isn't always the way they actually are
I need someone who sends me a new song everyday
i'm craving your hair on my face with your lips locked in my mouth
"i'd love to see her face right now, I would kill to see it"
"my middle school crush who told me ""im too ugly for girls to even look at you"" just liked my picture on facebook"
"she doesn't care where you've been, she cares about where you are now"
and perhaps the fact that she chased someone who ripped her apart says a lot more about her than it did about them
"I hate this, I hate knowing what's right and wrong and always choosing what's wrong for me"
time passes by so slow when she's not around
and for some odd reason your voice keeps repeating itself in my head
I found myself thinking about you again
i'll probably be her next heart break and i'll sleep as if it was nothing once again
"hurt me and make me feel again, I haven't felt anything in such a long time"
teach me to love again
and by tomorrow morning you'll probably hate me
intelligence turns me on
can I break your heart and blame how fucked up my head is?
she stops the war in my head when she's here
I gave her the feeling that i'm about to mess up her entire life and she didn't mind
"sometimes someone hurts you so bad it stops hurting, and thats what I did to her"
listen to me
put my face between your legs and close your eyes
"the less she needed, the better she felt"
I might need to make your whole neck marked by my mouth incase they're wondering who you belong to
"I don't think there's any truth, there's only point of views"
I want to be the reason you drink coffee every morning
and you're telling me love doesn't exist
all this technology and they still can't fix peoples feelings
I talk to myself more than I talk with people
"I know too much, and knowing things I don't want to know isn't what I want"
can I be the reason you stay up till 3 AM every night?
I could write about how good my fingers look between your lips
and nobody will ever understand you better than I do
good music with a cup of coffee and candlelight is all I really need
"that's the problem with putting others first, you've taught them that you come second"
reality continues to ruin my life
"you meet someone today, and the next day they're your addiction"
"I miss this feeling, the feeling of not knowing anything or thinking about anything, I truly did"
she desperately wanted someone to hold her waist and pull her closer
my imagination is beyond your expectations tonight
"I had a wet dream the other night, it was about us having coffee in bed together"
"I need to write down all the things that I love about you, but it just seems like even all the words in the world still won't describe it"
"echoes of silence ,wanderlust, montreal"
a coffee or a library date is needed
sext: let's read books together
can I open up and pour all my thoughts in your mouth?
I wonder where my mind is taking me tonight
"I want to write about how you fucked me up then make you read all my writings and make your heart ache, I want to see it torn"
"break my heart, I want to write about you"
"will I ever find you, or will I forever stay lost trying to find you?"
....
i'm just saying
I don't think we'll need any words when we're together
I can't stop staring at your lips when you're talking
*accidentally starts making out with you*
a single word can sometimes become a story - her
"the first conversation you have with someone is most likely the best one you'll ever have, so make sure it actually lasts"
sometimes it's nice to spend the entire day in bed
"I can't leave you, you're the only person I love on Wednesdays and I fucking hate everyone on Wednesdays"
"the love we think doesn't exist actually exists, if you are capable of loving that deep and wanting it, then so are others"
I never share my cup of coffee with anybody but I would gladly share mine with you
"instant replies, I love that shit"
do my tattoos turn you on yet?
you're writing about them and they don't even know you exist
I woke up this morning asking myself why
I miss going to bed with absolutely nothing on my mind
unsaid things
let's lose each others mind thinking about each other
people who keep conversations going are keepers
tell me which part of your skin you want me to place my lips
people who actually try to be in your life are the ones who deserve to be in it
you're going to hurt yourself trying to learn the difference between whats good for you and what you want
I will always have a thing for girls who know how to write
the fact that I need constant attention or else I lose interest really provokes me
I think of you in my cups of coffee
she looks like a bad idea and I love bad ideas
"she felt something, and that's what scared her"
"I don't know how to love without using my whole heart or without giving my all, I just can't"
can I handcuff you to my bed so I don't miss you too much?
she's so tough on the outside but so delicate and tender on the inside
"you wouldn't handle a day with me, nobody does"
lie to my face and tell me how much you miss my hands around your waist
"I mentioned you in one of my writings, and you've been there ever since"
sext: bring coffee on your way to my bed
"- why are you looking at me like that - i'm sorry, but I admire beauty and you seem to be a masterpiece"
she's emotionally detached
"I need to stop loving things outside writing, poetry, and romance; I think it'll help me with knowing how to live more"
"maybe I just need more coffee, and i'll be okay"
"you expect the same in return, but forget that not everybody is you"
"I need a crush I can be interested in for more than 5 minutes, this is getting out of hand"
jealousy is a disease I just can't seem to find the cure for
poetry  will always start with love and love will always start with  you
I always wonder what goes through your head when my name comes up in any situation
"it's okay to crave affection and the touch of their hands, don't feel ashamed to admit it"
"they think it's okay to do whatever they want but when it comes to you doing what you want, they blame you for everything"
stop expecting loyalty from people who can't even give you honesty
6 AM
"and I woke up feeling different today, it was like the world had tilted on it's axis while I was sleeping, and everything just... shifted"
tell me exactly how much of your mind do I touch everyday
how many times have you typed something and deleted it thinking the other person doesn't give a fuck and you'd be wasting your time?
I couldn't even get enough of that voice of yours so I kept it on repeat in my head
"being with him made her brain quiet, she didn't have to invent anything"
"I could've looked beyond her, but I could swear that she was the only thing blocking away the demons that haunt me every night"
"we must learn who's gold and who's just gold plated, people are so good at pretending nowadays"
"I lose interest before it even begins, it's scary sometimes"
"I think the majority of my brain just consists of her, everything else that goes on is only secondary"
reflections of passion  I held in your scars admiring your body a welt of incandescent stars
it's all about the one face you look for in a room full of people
patience
the house is full of air but yet it feels so empty
she craved my lips bruising hers with my fingers between her thighs and I liked it
"there are some people you'll never see again, or perhaps I should say not in the same way"
i'm so good at avoiding people I can probably do it with my eyes closed
I only have space for caffeine and nicotine in my blood
"if I don't reply it basically means I don't want to talk right now, how is that so hard to understand?"
sext: I would like to take a tour in that mind of yours
"today I saw you in the colors of the sunset, you had always resembled such beauty"
"how and why do people still use facebook, like jesus christ everytime I just open it I get cancer in my eyes, sigh.."
"but yet it doesn't matter, because they know their lane, and thats where they'll always be"
"a perfect example is someone who tells me something and I have to find out they did the complete opposite, it's shameful"
"I realized the more I distance myself from people, the more I know their real intentions"
"you're going to be so much more than ""enough"" for someone one day"
"she appears to be an angel, or a saint perhaps, but even satan was once an angel"
intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone and finding that fine with them
"it's not how many years she knew me for, it's how she always understood me without me having to say a single word"
and one of my biggest fears is that one day you'll eventually see me the way I see myself
I started hearing the clock ticking and thats when I knew I completely lost my mind
"their minds are so fixated on what they knew to be real, unable to create something new"
"if I write what I feel, it's to reduce the fever of feeling"
sext: show me your writings and i'll write about how you perfectly put words together
I get jealous of your coffee cup that gets to touch your lips every morning before I do
"I like you, your eyes are full of different languages that i'd love to learn"
"the feeling of your hands encaging my fingers, it's inexplicable"
maybe we're just souls crawling our way through life in hopes of surviving and discovering better
"I should never be left alone with my mind for too long, i'll end up making the worst scenarios there could possibly be"
it's hard watching someone you once cared about turn into everything they said they wouldn't
"come closer, let me hold you till you fall asleep"
"sometimes it just feels better not to talk, at all, about anything, to anyone"
"and for no reason at all, she started crying; she lost her mind and you weren't there to hold her, but he was"
*drinks 12 cups of coffee a day and complains about being temperamental*
"i've been in that ""lazy to do anything"" kind of mood for about two weeks now"
"well if they can't keep a conversation going, what makes you think they can keep a relationship going?"
the gap between thinking and feeling
mistakes changed you
in a world full of  temporary things and feelings and I still gave you my all
sext: fuck my sleeping pattern
she has sadness living in places sadness shouldn't live
I had a dream about how good you'd look sleeping next to me
"there's something about her eyes, eyes don't breathe I know that much; but hers looked breathless"
"loving me will not be easy, you will hold the gun and I will hand you the bullets, so take a deep breath"
"writing was how she coped, but you even took that away from her when you left, she can't write a sentence without your name following it"
she's filled with so much emotions and feelings but she wishes she had someone to express that to
"it is a tragic feeling to like someone and for them to not like you back, but it's equally innovative"
I made you smile and that's all that mattered to me
even the stars get jealous at the way I look at you
I like the way you've been looking at me lately
i'm disappointed because still I can't understand that feeling they sing about in love songs
"I had a decision to make, and that is probably the hardest things I have ever encountered"
maybe I love too much and show too little
"I don't need a purpose to live, you're pretty much the only good reason"
"I mean, I can probably be the nice guy too but where's the fun in that?"
"my imaginary life is a lot better than this bullshit, honestly"
"the words I write are the ones you read in bed, stretched out under the sheets with one hand between your legs"
take me somewhere where humans don't exist and just leave me there
and maybe one day she'll find someone who will love her just as much as she loved me
I have four moods
so when do we kiss?
"please don't interrupt my alone time, sometimes I just don't feel like interacting with humans"
they will never appreciate you
"come here, we have a lot to talk about, but let's begin with how beautiful your face looks like when my hands are between your legs"
"I fell apart many times, so what does it say about me besides that i've lived through wars?"
"it was always like that for me, after I open myself to someone, I need a few minutes to close down again; to restore my sense of privacy"
I can't wait for summer nights
"everyone you meet is fighting a battle of his own, be kind to others, you really have no idea what someone could hide behind a smile"
"don't worry sweetie, we're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed"
she knows my words are her weakness yet she begs for more
"she carries a cross around her neck, she's Jesus's babygirl and I got jealous"
can I be your favorite therapist for only one night?
"and this time I have nothing left to say, no words left to write and no poems to be heard"
can I write poetry with my tongue on your thighs tonight?
i'd learn how to read arabic just to read the Egyptian part of your brain
it's a never ending cycle of what if
"i've seen her look at me, her eyes are either full of love or full of lust or both, and I can't decide which I love more"
what if?..
the rage in me
"we suffer because of mistakes others once made but still we walk into the same traps, just like they did before us"
"stop over analyzing stuff, otherwise you just get stuck worrying about everything because it's been blown out of proportion by your mind"
I spent my entire life learning to feel less
is it weird that I just haven't been wanting to go out for the past week and I just want to sit at home alone?
"I wish I could give you my eyes for one day, so you could see what I see in you"
"you may think about it often, but that doesn't mean you miss it"
she's still waiting
some people fill the gaps but others emphasize my loneliness
"sometimes all you can do is lie in bed, and hope  to fall asleep before your mind starts eating you alive"
"sorry I wasn't in the mood to be a person today, sorry I forgot to keep a conversation going, my soul just needs ironing"
let my comforting arms silence the demons that surround you
"my heart aches for all the unrequited lovers, i'm sorry it has to be like this"
distance is always needed to see things clearly
I lose interest when your actions stop correlating with your words
"let me steal you away from all your worries, let me fill you with love"
I can feel the sadness of wednesday around the corner
"the more painful it was the louder her laugh was, but only I could see that"
give yourself something to look forward to that isn't a person
"beauty is lost nowadays, you get caught between the struggle of finding someone based on appearance or intelligence"
too many high hopes too many disappointments
I always wonder whose arms I would run and fall into if I was drunk in a room with everyone I have ever loved
"show me the most damaged parts of your soul, and I will show you how it still shines like gold"
"don't confuse my silence with my pride, perhaps i'm just busy fighting with myself"
you can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep rereading the last one
"I enjoy observing people, it gives me satisfaction to know everything about someone"
"if they don't know you personally, don't take it personal"
*traces my fingers on your spinal cord while you're falling asleep*
"you're complicated, and you need someone who gets that about you"
will you be the one that saves me from this never ending nightmare that I seem to be stuck in?
"I was soft once, but time has made me a bitter sculptor out of me, that spark of desire in the eyes, that tender touch of love in the heart"
but isn't that what love is all about? a biochemical addiction that turns us into narcissistic beings with foolish hope?
"but most of all, I like to wach people; I like to look at them, listen to what they have to say, and figure out who and what they are"
the conversation between my fingers and your thighs were the best conversations we've ever had
it would be a sin to not admire your beauty
could a nightmare make your whole body ache and make you feel like dying once you wake up?
how amazing is it to find someone who wants to hear about all the things that go on in you head
you deserve more
clouds collide when our hands touch
"you're soft, soft like spring flowers and sunsets and the white feathers inside your pillow"
why can't you see what I see in you?
"it's important to realize that you can miss something, but not want it back"
"I don't have any energy to deal with humans today, so i'll just sit in bed all day"
what is sleep and where do I find it
losing someone doesn't hit you until you have to do things without them that you used to do with them
she was the nightsky and I was the stars that filled her soul
"why is her name in your bio and her nudes in my gallery, I don't understand.."
"the curves of her lips, the sound of her sighs, the way she leans on me like i'm her home; I felt tender, soft specially for someone like me"
beauty becomes the most beautiful when it's undefined and unexpected
the feeling of your lips against mine feels like gaseous particles colliding emerging in the genesis of dancing lights
"loneliness is different than sadness, sadness passes but with loneliness you're empty forever"
she threw your heart in the smoke so that it may lay with the ashes from the fire you started
she's flagitious and I like that
would you mind if I called you beautiful as if it's your first name?
I don't want to write about now
"thoughts destroy me, but silence kills me"
"I think I could, I think I could make you smile and that makes my life more than worthwhile"
sit on my lap and tell me how much you love me
"i've made a lot of people achieve what they want, but I will no longer give my hand out to help others when all they do is turn their back"
god is mad at us today
how do I trust my feelings when they just disappear like that?
"someone get her flowers, she wants to feel pretty and lovely tonight"
let go of everything that doesn't want to stay
come find me
sin with me and tell me you'll worship the same god
"meh, why doesn't this shit happen with me? #WeMetOnTwitter"
sometimes we have to prove to others that we're strong even when we're not
your DNA is stuck on my lips
we kill so much time overthinking and imagining different scenarios in life
I have a phd in making myself feel like shit every night
I should probably give you hickeys in inappropriate places
"what part of ""don't talk to me when i'm moody"" don't people understand?"
"I can't explain what I mean and even if I could, i'm not sure i'd feel like it"
"she tries to hide it all, but it only gets worse"
"I think that’s what happens when you’ve lived a lonely childhood, you get too attached to people as you get older"
I ran out of feelings for you to hurt
we're too young to hate the world this much
I was told that love was a waste of time and i'm actually starting to believe why
"the closer you got the harder it was for me, I don't allow people get close to me, it gets ugly"
"sigh, she's too angelic for me"
you stunned me
she's been stuck in silence for so long to the point that she's scared of saying anything that might turn wrong
"for every hundred crimes committed in the name of love, only one is committed in the name of sex"
what sleep? I can't even close my eyes for 1 minute straight
"you should bring that body a little closer, i'd like to see how heaven looks like on earth"
stop filling the emptiness I left in you with temporary people
god is going to hate me for how many hearts i've broken
her lips on my neck felt as if birds were singing in my ears
"chase dreams, not people"
for too long i've been fixated on temporary fixes that barely last long enough for me to breathe
"we assume that others show their love the same way we do and if they don't follow that equation, we worry that the love is not there"
i'm sorry my wall is too hard to climb sometimes
I guess i'm still human
listen to the lyrics of our bodies that sing when they're collaborating
i'm not really sure if I should feel sorry for you or just laugh at how stupid you are
"come here, i've got a lot to tell you that my lips would turn numb when i'm done"
you gave me a chilly feeling everytime I placed my hands on your body
her panties got wet the moment I laid my hands on her thighs
I feel a chill down my spine as I watch the veins in your neck thump to the melody on your heartbeat
you should've seen the look on my eyes the first day I saw her
let's create a world that only you and me would fit in
the most powerful thing i've ever experienced is the realization that I don't have to follow anyone else's rules
"your hands touching mine, thats the beginning of love"
I am pressed so hard by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk
"I want nothing, I just want the emptiness to mean something"
I finally learned how to bleed
"I love her stubbornness, her heart has an argument with her mind everytime it wants to beat"
she was loving without being loved
but what if tomorrow comes and you notice my flaws and imperfections and don't look at me the same way ever again?
let's grab some pizza right now and watch our favorite movies
art is looking at her while she's doing something she loves
"don't look at me and tell me it's going to be okay, when everything is falling apart, just sit with me and help me get back up"
"her leather jacket had weird spikes on them and made me relive an entire minute of ""fifty shades of grey"" moment"
"she literally looked 19 or 20 but her husband basically looked 30, so It was a sad 2 minutes"
I fell in love with a girl at a cafe today for literally 2 minutes then her husband came out of the bathroom and there I was heartbroken
"i'm not worried about impressing you, i'm just worried about you impressing me"
i'm on my way
my fingers would look better with your lips around them
the details that I have fed you are only tiny bits of light that would not even form constellations of me as a whole
pardon me ma'am but my heart's rusted
she's writing her pain out hoping one day she could stop feeling the way she does
sometimes silence really means the voice of someone you so long waited because it at last brings peaceful silence to the dullest thoughts
"I keep falling in love with other people's broken parts, but why can't I love my own?"
i'd enjoy my coffee a lot more with you beside me
I promise to write good things about you one day and tell everyone how amazing the memories we shared together were
"physical attraction was not what stimulated her, she craved someone who could undress her mind with words and found her mind sexy"
she has the softest sigh and god did I fall in love
it's like there's always something missing when you're not here  beside me
"when you want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done"
i'm trapped in an endless loop of loving others more than I love myself
"with every soft touch of yours the pain you caused goes away, and with every tender move of yours I fall in love with your mistakes"
if my thoughts are chipped can you still drink my words?
can I read every part of your body like it's a poem written by my favorite author?
and I fell in love with the fact her words had so much effect on me
can I adopt your demons and raise them as scars of my own?
"I don't want to be friends, I want to hold your thighs and pull you a little closer"
"hands are strange things tracing skin, they wonder is this a masterpiece or a battlefield"
take off your mask and see who will dare to love you truly
i'm so random sometimes it scares me
is it just me thay really hates phone calls?
"people will do anything to distract their heart, they'll do anything to distract it from missing someone"
"if you're cold you hurt people, but if you're sensitive they hurt you"
I drifted between imagination and reality
your sadness is not a sun
"your soft words are choking me with their malignancy, or maybe it's just my hands around your throat"
"and on my worst days I just want you next to me, as I feel your hair across my fingers, I realize that i'm home"
you not wanting her was the beginning of her loving herself
fill my cup of my coffee with love and your lips all over the edges
I started knowing my worth when I was left alone with nobody by my side
she smells like love
"more sleep, and less stress is what I really need"
"depression and anxiety are lovers who ruin everything when they come together, but they can't bear being separated"
nowadays I walk over things I used to trip over
can I run my lips all the way down between your legs?
seeing her sitting there unresponsive makes me realize that silence has a sound
"my bestfriend is not allowed to stop being my bestfriend, bitch knows entirely too much about me"
she said goodbye but her heart was breaking
stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be
confidence is attractive
why is there a certain beauty in a woman who's facing such cruelty in life but still manages to kiss it goodnight?
"we didn't need words, we just looked at each other and smiled"
"I know things are rough for you right now but I know this, when your cloud lifts, you're going to be someone's greatest gift"
"peope often mistake flirting with being nice, and that's a major problem dealing with people"
"she was a part of your book, just a pitstop along your way, but you were her whole book, until you took all of that away"
"when she laughed she was beautiful, when she cried she was beautiful, but when she was determined, god she was sexy"
spent a long time loving her and now she's probably using my lines to make another dude feel loved
"i'm trying to be happy and pay attention to the world around me, but I don't know if it's possible to do both at the same time"
sext: tell me new music
"I can't allow you to see me like this, I hate looking weak in front of anybody"
"one day it will all make sense, one day you'll get so used to the fact that you are you and it's okay to be a little mad"
it terrifies her how she no longer recognizes her reflection in the mirror anymore
"you'll be ""too much"" for some people, too loud, too soft, too this and that but you'll always be perfect for people who need you"
would you mind if I just held on and never let go?
the ones who hear the silence in your voice and the heaviness in your heart are the ones you need to let in
how?
I want you to come to me when sleep doesn't fix you
I just love how your eyes always steal my words away
sad for no reason at all
but what if I stare at you everytime you look away?
she had a way of seeing the beauty in others when they couldn't see it themselves
you either say how you feel and fuck it up or say nothing and let it fuck you up instead
and we were in bed together laughing and didn't care about anything
I fell asleep dreaming about your eyes and woke up wishing that my lips were kissing your sleepy face
"and with the right music, you either forget everything or remember everything"
i'm sorry you were not truly loved and that it made you cruel
don't feel stupid if you don't like what everyone else pretends to love
"your body isn't wrong, or ugly, too big or too thin, too pale or too dark, too broken or too strong, it's beautiful, trust me"
she was quite fond of the things that had hurt her so much that she held on even when they let go
"there's no difference between her and a flower, they're both so delicate and soft but easily torn"
I want to know you're thinking about me when you're surrounded by people who throw themselves at you
"she's right in front of me, but at the same time she's a thousand miles away"
I could've looked beyond her but I swear there were more stars in her eyes than the sky combined
"take me to a place where my heart can heal, where my mind can rest, where my body could relax and where i'm not a mess"
"I wasn't meant to fall this hard, but your soul is just too good for me to stay away"
among every word the softness of your skin said to me yours was my favorite
loving her made me a better writer
he flooded her thoughts every second of everyday and she didn't know how to swim but that was okay
- what awful place is this? - it's reality sweetheart
"I don't want to fix you, I just want to hold your hands while you fix yourself"
she stopped looking for her other half
there are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds
she's a saint with the lips of a sinner and god do I love to sin
"I used to walk into a room full of people and wonder if they liked me, now I just look around and wonder if I like them"
killed my old self but the new me is a lot worse
"I wish I had someone who would observe me silently, who would capture all my habits and quirks and still love me"
"watching someone leave is hard, but it's harder remembering that time they promised they wouldn't"
say you'll be there waiting for me when I need you
she loved him not only in spite of but because he himself was incapable of love
can I kiss your neck as a friend?
i'm tired of giving parts of me to the wrong people
"how many times have you typed ""i'm fine"" with shaky fingertips and tears coming down?"
"loneliness is addicting, once you see how peaceful it is, you don't want to deal with people anymore"
in your hesitation I found the answer I was looking for
"I have always liked quiet people, you never know if they're simply dancing in a daydream or carrying the weight of the world"
"if it happened, it was for a reason"
and of course there's no better satisfaction in someone telling me I can't do this and I prove them wrong
"I don't remember the last time I actually wanted something and didn't achieve, consistency taught me things I never imagined I could achieve"
"the thing is, when I say something I do it, it doesn't matter how difficult or hard or impossible it may be, I do it"
I left home a long time ago to the point that I might get lost on my way back
let me bury my face in your arms tonight
I want to be the reason behind your tears but also your smile
god is going to hate me for this
"no amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of anxiety can change the future, just remember that"
are we really living or are we pretending?
if they ask about me tell them she was the only person that loved me with honesty and I broke her
does my name pass through your mind when it's 3 am and you're wide awake?
I love the fact that I get lost everytime I look in those eyes of yours
"she wants you to get the nerve to say how you feel about her, that way when you look at her she'd stop second guessing what you really mean"
"love doesn't hurt, expectations do"
- goodmorning - no
your lips would match mine perfectly
"I sometimes look at myself and I see nothing that I like, crowds don't make me happy and I don't feel right when i'm alone"
here you are worried that i'll leave when I see your real self when that's the part of you that's letting me stay
"don't let the pain make you hate, and don't let the bitterness steal your sweetness"
she can fake it very well but I can see right through it
"you have eyes yet you don't see, for they are clouded with the fog, or distant memories, they consume your thoughts and dull your shine"
"I don't pay attention to the world ending, it has ended for me many times and began again the next morning"
"stop thinking about it, erase it from your mind, open a new book, get yourself a fresh pen and start"
"and just a friendly advice, when they talk about you it only means they know you're better than they could ever be"
"focus on whats ahead and stop thinking about what happened or why it happened, it'll only slow you down from achieving what you want"
"they're talking behind your back because that's where they belong, you shouldn't turn your head and look back, keep moving forward"
"please don't expect me to always be kind and loving, there are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand"
jealousy is a disease I need a cure for
"sigh, I hate waking up moody"
caring too much is so exhausting sometimes
you've got this
"I listen to music until I can't hear my own sinful thoughts, it's cleansing in a suffocating way, sigh"
"what a shame, silly girl believed in fairytales and magic and had to be struck by reality with demons in her mind"
this cage we built for ourselves seems to be the perfect fit
"it's not the face, but the expressions on it, it's not the voice but what you say, it's not how your body looks, but what you do with it"
saddest thing is when you're no longer surprised when someone does the complete opposite of what they said
it was best to part ways
"she wasn't heartless, she wasn't arrogant, she wasn't even stupid, all she wanted was her mind back"
"words are only used when you expect a certain thing to happen, but life turns into another direction, and you're just stuck there wishing"
I'm sick of all this non-existent bullshit my mind makes up
stay close to anything that makes you glad you're alive
"if words is all you have for me, you'd better go"
"""is our love stronger than your pride"" is by far the only question that I got no answer for"
"keep your feelings and self worth in different places, because when feelings get hurt it shouldn't change how you view yourself"
I would stare at those lips all day if I could
"I sit back and observe every person in my life, I know who supports me, who's down for me, and who's not, might not say anything, but I know"
we're too busy killing each other to do anything else
"it's amazing how 3 minutes with the wrong person feels like 3 days, yet 3 hours with the right one feels like 3 minutes"
"I want to feel complete, the kind of completion where I  don't look at myself and think that i'm missing a part of me"
two damaged people trying to heal each other is love
don't waste your emotional energy on something you can't change
"you can never completely know anyone, no matter how well you think you do; there'll always be some truth about them you'll never get to know"
"maybe I didn't lose you, maybe you weren't really there, maybe what we were was simply  an illusion confused as love"
her body is made of poetry that i'd love to read before I fall asleep
"you don't have Selena's ass, that's what the fuck.."
why aren't breakfast dates a thing? I mean.. let's go out and and eat some eggs with toast
I could show you the complete opposite of how I feel towards you but that doesn't mean I don't feel it
"like girls who take care of their body, know how to dress themselves, overall just knows what they're doing"
why do I find girls who take care of themselves very attractive?
starting to accept the fact that maybe people only come in your life just to teach you lessons and leave
she created a magnificent world for him in her dreams
my eyes have seen more than they should
can we go on a rooftop and watch the sun raise now?
and here it comes creeping back into your bed under your skin only for you to realize that it never really left
"she looked exhausted, not the kind of exhaustion that can be healed by a good night's sleep, no, something bone deep and indelible"
"all we need in life is acceptance and virtue, with that you'll learn that nothing else matters"
"if flowers can teach themselves how to bloom after winter passes, so can you"
I really fucking love this girl @MirnaAly_
"you'd look a lot prettier wearing my shirt under my blanket, just saying"
stop getting attracted to guys who treat you like shit then complain why they left you
oh how much I wish mornings were a little warmer
it's one of these nights where you just want to put your head under hot water and forget everything else
memories
"i'm still here sitting in my bed, losing my mind finding new threads, following new paths inside my head, but I don't let myself sleep"
everyday you'll slowly realize how selfish the world is becoming
can I run my fingers through your hair while staring at you? I admire beauty
"whatever comes, let it come, what stays let it stay, and what goes let it go"
and hard to hate
is it just me that finds it very attractive when someone uses my name in a sentence?
"i'll probably die laughing, thats for sure"
"i'm tired of seeing people depressed and can't even live their own fucking life because of their parents, it's so overwhelming"
"they need to be their bestfriend and understanding, they can't just force them to do something they're not obligated to do"
"parents need to communicate with their children, they need to understand that not everything they're doing is the right thing"
i'm yet to find someone whose insanity complements mine
ed sheeran // shape of you
because one cup of coffee is simply never enough
"and that's where the whole trouble is, we're too much alike to understand each other because we don't even understand our own selves"
"if you kiss her mind, her body will follow"
never let anyone be a big part of your life so that when they leave they don't take everything else with them
I felt so much that I started to feel nothing at all
"when you're attracted to people it's because of the details, their kindness, their eyes, and the fact that they can make you laugh"
the hardest thing you could ever do is forgive someone who was never sorry
I just hate how i'm never sure about what I want but i'm always sure about what i don't want
"don't underestimate my ability to make you feel like you never existed in my life, just don't"
can summer hurry the fuck up?..
when a girl asks you a question she usually knows the answer but she's just acting stupid
you get used to it
the problem is that your happiness depends too much on other people
"when you look into my eyes, don't get lost and hope for me to find you, because I might be doing the same thing too"
"they say you look like love; chiseled, golden, meteoric, and me? i'm the thing that loves love, despite looking a lot like something else"
"you can't always be nice, that's how people take advantage of you"
"I used to imagine adventures for myself, I invented a life, so that I could at least exist somehow"
"stop trying to put pieces together and create your own pieces; don't spend your life trying to find yourself, but create it"
"I question everything, literally"
"""do you listen to the weeknd?""  friendship achieved"
"all the hardest, coldest, people you're ever going to meet were once soft as water; and that's the true tragedy of living"
"I always regret sharing too much, caring too much, doing too much, and feeling too much; I always end up disappointed"
at some point you have to realize that some people can stay in your heart but not in your life
she didn't know who would leave or stay so instead she pushed them all away
i'll use my words
"you'll realize a lot, believe me"
"do it well, just pour it all down then just stare at it and think twice about what you wrote"
write your sadness away
maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are
"endless conversations that lead nowhere, just how I like it"
why am I not feeling anything..
"I love that moment when you're on a long car ride listening to music and you just completely zone out, you forget everything it's beautiful"
and now she cries in the middle of the night for the same damn thing
"I felt it coming, but i'd rather wait and see what happens"
I am overwhelmed with things I ought to have written about and never found the proper words to
eye contact is way more intimate than words will ever be
"it's unacceptable, you either stay or leave, there's no in between"
"you can't just come into my life and start to matter and become an important part of it, then just walk away like it's nothing"
I hate how you hurt yourself on the outside just to kill the things on the inside
"maybe you've met the right person, but you're just not ready to fall in love"
why do I still feel like it's 2016?
I couldn't get out of bed knowing I wouldn't start the day off without you
"your kisses sink through my skin like honey and molasses or something else slow and tender, waiting snd hungry"
perhaps her eyes need to be washed away by her tears every once in a while to see life with a clearer view
my heart is tired of aching from your absence
you only want her when she's the only girl in the room
"the moment you stop trying to find it, is the same moment it will find you"
my pack of cigarettes is almost finished and I won't have anything to smoke while thinking of how good you'd look naked in my bed
her apology was an empty box that she tried to persuade me was full of roses and unforgettable love
she sins beautifully
"this year take some risks, open the doors that make you scared, and close the doors that lead nowhere"
"I spent it with people I love and I didn't need any alcohol or drugs to have a good time, I'm thankful"
"this is the first new years eve I did not get drunk or high or go to a party and i'm going to be honest, it has been the far one of the best"
we only feel the need to be defensive when we second guess our own truth
"when you're trying to sleep but then you remember what happened in 2009 on a Wednesday at 8:43 PM and you're like ""ok"""
"I barely find anybody attractive and I barely feel affection towards anybody, but when I do, oh god how hard I fall"
you smiled and I became obsessed with how good it looked on you
"I hate the idea of lonely, and I hate the reality of attachment"
it's one of these mornings when you just don't want to leave your bed
"but when you burn, it marks your skin, it marks you; therefore you experience it"
I guess you really don't get it until you make your own mistakes because when someone else is burning you can only see the light
"no matter how many wise people tell you anything, you won't learn anything until you experience it yourself"
"you don't have to be someone to do something, you're either infinite or ephemeral, so what's the point on defining you?"
"all these movies and books with heroes and heroines that keep wondering who they truly are, that's bullshit"
"stop wondering who you are, stop looking for yourself like you are some mere kind of treasure"
I still remember
i'm just not feeling it lately you know
"what made her strong was despite the million things that hurt her, she spoke of nothing but happiness"
tattoo my words on your chest and tell me how much you miss me
nightmares all over again
"if i'm not the person you want, don't try to change me, leave and find someone that suits you"
my idea of a perfect morning is waking up next to you with some coffee
I don't really have a problem with trends or anything but why do ya'll have to look alike?
being taken for granted was just another thing she got used to
I wonder..
don't ever let somebody tell you that you can't do something
I think I already lost myself the moment our eyes collided
why should I apologize for being this way? no one ever apologized for making me this way
my words will either attract mature minds or offend immature ones
but sweetheart there's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure
I just want coffee and you for Christmas
can I read poetry in your mouth?
"you can get addicted to smoking, money, working out, and drinking, but I never realized you could get addicted to someone before I met you"
it's sad to think that most of my teenage years were spent trying to survive in this society rather than actually enjoying life
I want to read that chapter of your soul that you don't read out to the world
can I handcuff our hands together so that you don't leave my sight for a second?
I woke up wanting to kiss you this morning
i'm not very good at telling people how I feel
nobody asked me if I was okay when I was too busy making everyone else happy
it makes me wonder sometimes how many times I forgave people for the same mistake even if they never deserved it
she hid her feelings so well she forgot where she placed them
can I be your warmth that fills the space in your bed? I want your sleepy confused look when you wake up every morning
"it's just sad that as humans we ruin everything we touch, including each other"
I have a deeply hidden and inarticulate desire for something beyond my daily life
I've wanted more hours in the day ever since I met you
I hate thinking too much but I guess it's the only thing i'm actually good at
"when I say I want you that doesn't mean I only want you sexually, it literally means I want everything; your body, heart, and soul"
"if a person could show you heaven, they could also show you hell"
"I don't even want to live on this planet anymore, honestly"
pistanthorphobia; the fear of trusting people due to past experiences with relationships gone bad
"the first sign you notice when you gain feelings towards a person, is how easily you get jealous when they give others attention you crave"
"close some doors, not because of pride, ego, incapacity, but simply because they no longer lead somewhere"
"frozen lips interlocked like veins, flowers are growing in your heart so long as I give them a reason to grow"
different doesn't mean wrong
"art isn't suppose to look nice; it's suppose to make you feel something, and that's what she is to me"
"people fill their brains with harsh thoughts and it brings the body down, but chances are no one thinks as bad about you than you"
"let yourself move to the next chapter in life when the time comes, don't remain stuck on the same page"
"close your eyes and imagine the best version of yourself; that's who you really are, let go of any other part of you that don't believe it"
I stare at you like people do when they see fireworks
"you should be kissed often, and by someone who knows how"
I don't get enough of her
"once you realize you deserve better, losing people won't even matter"
it's too early to be this bored
"just be yourself, everyone else is already taken"
I wish I had an easier answer for why i'm feeling the way I am sometimes
this weather just needs hot chocolate and a warm bed with cuddles and a good movie to watch
a thought is a hard thing to control sometimes
the bravest thing you could ever do is let someone hurt you and still talk beautiful about them
I guess it wasn't my time to die just yet
behind those locked walls there is someone waiting to be held and told that everything's going to be okay
I fear giving everything to someone and get nothing but pain in the end
"you're different, and people are going to hate you for that"
some things just don't make sense anymore
can I eat you slowly with kisses?
"I have a habit of falling in love with souls who have yet to be at peace with their bodies, minds and weaknesses"
I tremble at the thought of falling in love with a tiny part of someone and mistaking it for the whole
tell me things you haven't told anyone before
"look at the stars, look at how they shine for you"
"she likes to sleep, it makes her forget about everything easier"
"take my hand, and we'll make it, I promise"
stop blaming yourself for things you have no control over
the hardest part in waking up is remembering what you were trying to forget last night
the more she thought about it the more she was worried she wasn't good enough
kindly suffocate me with your kisses
"I wonder how many people don't get the one they want, but end up with the one they're suppose to be with"
"I want to feel that you're here with me even when you're not, I want to feel a constant connection of love"
because you speak to her in words and she looks at you with feelings
kind words cost nothing
is it ever going to get better or are we only going to get better at pretending?
he made your heart expand so wide that your ribs cracked and your lungs got crushed
what does it mean for you?
let's drink some coffee and pretend we know what we're doing
I hate how fast time passes when you're with me
tonight i'm craving physical affection
ran out of words to describe how beautiful you are
"i'm not sure what's worse; intense feeling, or the absence of it"
"the problem we have is that we think we need to be somebody, but fail to realize that we are somebody"
"she was hopelessly in love with a boy who couldn't see her worth, and who would not acknowledge her efforts"
I wonder if you ever talk about missing me to anyone
don't blame yourself for something you don't have control over
people put so much effort into starting a relationship and so little into ending one
love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own
"we all need a hand to hold, ears to listen and a mouth to tell us stories"
I have too many romantic fantasies and they make me sad
"some people are just beautiful, not in looks, not in what they say, but just in what they are"
I want to be the first thing you touch in the morning and the last thing you taste at night
"people only bring up your past when they are intimidated by your present, it's quite sad if you think about it"
"the problem with me is that I can't decide what I want most, so my motion is circular, helpless and confoundedly discouraging"
"don't get attached to moments, good or bad they all pass"
"you give them a taste of their own medicine, then they tell everyone you poisoned them"
"""an empty boy holding a cigarette kissed a confused girl with a paper heart"""
"it's about who you miss at 2 in the afternoon when you're busy, not 2 in the morning when you're lonely"
some people come in your life just to teach you how to let go
it's like she wants to take care of everyone but nobody wants to take care of her
no amount of physical beauty will ever be as valuable as a beautiful heart
I understand
"her eyes, they tell beautiful stories"
"once a door closes, another one opens, it's just that simple"
kingdoms are falling through pages of history as you hold my hand
for months she couldn't breathe; she was convinced that this was love
"they told me to find happiness, so I found you"
don't let someone get comfortable with disrespecting you
don't allow your heart to be broken by the same person twice
if she acts like a baby with you it just means that she's comfortable around you
have you ever craved someone's presence that you literally ache?
I envy the cup of coffee that gets to touch your sleepy lips awake every cold and bitter morning
"say it, even if their response isn't the one you want, you never know when is the last time you're ever going to see them"
i'm still unwritten
they'll realize how good you were and how much they've lost the moment they're with someone who doesn't do half of what you did
"look at someone's past to understand them, not to define them, there's a difference"
"every time she opens her eyes, she unleashes a million untold stories"
her hug is my happy place
she died everyday waiting for you
"we are like parallel lines, traveling our own ways yet always next to each other"
can I participate?🌚 #dubchallenge
let my words mark every part of your skin
on the inside she felt like screaming
politeness has become so rare that people often mistake it for flirtation
"the true tragedy is not in the people who have loved us or hurt us, but it's in the people who we'll never meet, who could've loved us back"
sometimes the silence I feel inside becomes tangible enough to choke my smile
those who support you are those you want to keep in your life
"soft lips and eyes that glisten with a heart made of gold, what's not to love about her"
todays photoshoot
you can't be fixed by the same person who broke you
the only reason it makes it a part of your life is that you keep thinking about it
you know it's bad when you wake up in the morning and the only thing you look forward to is going back to sleep
"my hands between your thighs and my lips on your neck, this is how I want to spend my night"
November vibes
"the memories won't die, but you will, so make sure to make good ones"
she's just not sure if it's just a living dream or reality
she loves teasing him and driving him insane then kisses him and tells him that she's just kidding
she loves how mad he drives her yet she'd still drown him in an ocean full of kisses
she wants to always make sure he's happy because his happiness is also hers
she wants to wake him up in the middle of the night just to tell him how much she misses him
she wants to sit on the kitchen counter and watch him cook for her as she takes pictures of him
she wants afternoon naps putting her head on his chest while he plays with her hair to make her feel better
she wants a walk with someone she loves at 3 AM and talk about anything that comes in mind while holding hands
she wants to be proud of her partners achievements and cheer them on every chance she gets
she wants to be supported by someone who cares in the darkest moments and always there for her when she needs it
she wants cute dates by the shore at midnight and not just drink together at a bar
"she wants to feel desired, to be a hot sweaty mess with someone she loves"
"she wants to feel wanted, romanticized, loved and passion once again"
here's a cute thread about her
be with someone who's good for your mental health
don't let someone else's opinion of you change who you truly are
i've been making love to you in my dreams for quite some time now
she has eatable lips and i'm probably going to stare at them every time I see her like an idiot
"if they don't care, then why should you?"
"maybe i'm the worst person in the world, but I always try my best for you"
I love it when your name is the first thing that shows up on my phone when I wake up
our eyes made love the moment they looked at each other
love yourself
I need to know if you see me holding your hands with your head on my shoulders when you close your eyes at night
put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain
someday their name will be nothing more than an unfamiliar word and that's when you know you're over them
words can break hearts and make panties wet
I can detect the slightest change in the tone of your voice and spend the rest of the day trying to figure out what I did wrong
I love the smell of your skin on my white bedsheets and how I wish I could bury my face between your legs
I know it's a sin but the very thought of my hands reaching up under your skirt makes me blush
*accidentally makes out with you*
"what we need right now is hope, except I think that's what we rejected"
during these lonely days when the world feels like falling apart my love for you remains even if it can't take away the pain
she's the kind of girl that loves to stretch out under the sheets while eating pizza and fucks on rainy mornings
press your thighs tighter around my hands
and tonight i'll write about the sparkle in your eyes when you look at me
sometimes simplicity is the most captivating beauty
I can't help but wonder if I was born to be sad
you thought you couldn't live without them
"I don't need it to last forever, I just don't want to regret it when it's all over and think that i've wasted all that time"
"her insecurities are what makes her beautiful, she just doesn't know it yet"
if we live a life in sadness i'll wait a thousand years to see you smile once again
"something happened  last night, everything we knew faded almost poetically  to black"
"apparently knowing how to treat a girl right and knowing what to do means you're a fuckboy, might as well bury me alive"
and every time I see you looking at me I feel the universe smiling right at me with little birds on top of my head
"If you care about someone, you should want them to be happy, even if it means sacrificing your own happiness sometimes"
but pretending to be happy isn't happiness
"everyone has a different way of showing their love to you, so if someone can do something that others can't that doesn't mean they don't"
worst part of everyday is that I have to wake up
I can still taste the savory of your lips inside my mouth and how perfect it was
call me at 4 AM and tell me how much you miss me beside you in bed
how can someone with such a beautiful face and smile have ruptured eyes with tears coming out?
insomnia and I are back together
so much rage and anger inside of me that I might even go insane if I don't do something about it very soon
I currently can't even find the right words to exactly describe it from how fucked up it makes me feel
"it makes me feel so fucking weak it makes me angry, because I know sometimes I need help or comfort yet it makes me feel weak, sigh"
I still don't know why till now I feel so weak when I tell someone I love that I need them or that I need help
the way the wind blows her hair over my face and covers it with love makes me delightful
can I hold you till I fall asleep tonight? it's a lonely out here
there's nothing wrong with you
I should really stop giving people more than they deserve
I still remember how painful it was every time I think about it
"it's a long lonely night, so let's pretend for a second that you're here in my arms"
a walk on the beach with some good music right now would be heaven
why I love the dark
"silly girl, thought he actually loved you"
"don't hold on to someone who's leaving, otherwise you won't meet the one who's coming"
"an ensemble of thoughts escaped her lips, but there was always the element of interpretation, which was the opposite of what she wanted"
"despite all the things I want to ask, I won't; i'm only afraid I won't hear the words I want to hear"
"i've been called a lot of names, but not worth the risk has to be the worst"
"it's not selfish to put yourself first, to cut out people who always try to put you down"
"I had a dream the other night, it starts with we had the best sex ever"
and yet here I am 2:39 AM wishing you were here in my arms as I watch you sleep
"- what are you thinking about? - you, always you"
"""I would break my own heart to keep yours safe"""
"it's a blessing to have someone who doesn't get tired of your sadness or moodiness, and knows how isolating it can be"
"trust me, this is not me living, this is me just killing time"
my face between your thighs was the sweetest sin i've ever done
talking to her about nothing meant so much to me
her broken pieces are too sharp that anybody who tries to touch her would get hurt
she only needed a hug
"and I can't stand the thought of someone else looking at you the way I do, it's terrifying"
handwritten letters are everything
even when you hate her you still love her
and I sometimes still taste the words I didn't say to you
do you ever just sit there and think who you are in somebody's life? where you belong in their life and where you stand?
can we just skip to where I get to see you everyday?
"it all comes down to the connection you have with that person, because once it's lost you also lost the person along with it"
she's so afraid of losing something she loves that she refuses to love anything
"the more you open up the more you get hurt, maybe i'm just riddled with scars and don't know what to do with them"
"it's different for everyone, some people are just better off alone and some can't stand the thought of being alone, but it's always a choice"
once a wound is open it never goes back to it's original form
woke up in her arms today and couldn't feel any better
you left a hole in her heart that only your love could fill
all you see is your reflection
no matter how much I write all the words in the world wouldn't come close on how I feel about everything
"it scares me that I don't know how our story is going to end, a year from now we could be together or complete strangers once again"
no one in the world has a voice powerful enough to stop you from being yourself
the conversation between my fingers and your skin is the most important discussion I have ever had
did you tell him how good you scream my name or should I?
these thoughts
You're the first thing that comes in my mind every time I see something beautiful
"oh, it's going to hurt, it's going to hurt because it matters"
and by breakfast I mean you
you would learn from your mistakes only if you're not too busy denying them
"your thoughts can hurt more than reality, don't live inside your mind before you go insane"
one day we're going to find people that enjoy us without needing to be convinced
"she's like coffee to me, I simply can't wake up without hearing her voice"
I crave the taste of your lips more than smokers crave a cigarette once they wake up
"when you know they're yours, be persistent; when they fight it, even though they know there's no point, be patient"
"I honestly hate how people think it's okay for them to do something that pisses me off but it's not okay for me, that's not how it works"
"I know your body like the back of my hand, every curve and every scar yet every time I look at it I get lost"
those soft hands of yours will be the end of me
"I can hear the pain inside your voice, but my pain was much louder and you didn't seem to care"
you're only going to have one shot at this
"your kisses have both, a sweet flavor and a soporific effect, like morphine"
your arms look like a comfortable place to sleep on tonight
"your voice still echoes in my head and in these halls, the halls that were once our world"
"i'm sorry that i've given you only pieces of me, but it's all that's left in me"
late night is all the intoxication I need to send me stumbling into your arms
"you say you're no good, yet i'm no better, that just may as well be why we work as well together"
"even though love covers everything, fear is what keeps us silent and keeps words unsaid, fear keeps us standing in one place"
"silence is beautiful, not awkward; the human tendency to be afraid of something beautiful is awkward"
"this is how i've learned to cope, by spilling myself into my screen in hopes that somewhere there i'll find myself"
the mysterious house
and sometimes I wonder how much I really mean to you
we drank 3 bottles of wine and decided to fuck our mess away
"I wronged a lot of people, hurt a lot of people, but believe me when I say that i'm usually not myself when it comes to that"
can I have you for breakfast this morning?
"and right when people say they know me I secretly tell myself ""oh, they have no idea do they"""
"""all my life i've been so understanding with everyone, but when it's my turn to be understood, no one seems to try"""
my lungs burn from smoking but my heart aches every time you leave
"her eyes, one look and I was silenced and stunned by the gaze of an angel staring"
you don't have to apologize for the things you didn't become
"she knows what's it like to give everything she has for someone, she just doesn't know what it's like to feel the same"
"my eyes are so heavy from lack of sleep over you that I can barely see anything but you, this is nice"
she fears that if she let's him in he'll know the real her and reject her
"she's combined, a mean angel and a kind devil, and that's what I love about her"
let me kiss you goodnight and hope you'd wake up with a smile on your face
"and if I can't explain it with words, i'll prove it by loving you till you can see it in my eyes"
I called you mine the moment I laid my eyes on you
showing cleavage won't fix your face though
"once you find that one person that makes you happy in a way that no one else can, don't ever let them go"
"try explaining the diffence between ""talking"" and ""dating"" is to a parent and you will realize just how dumb our generation is"
woke up this morning staring at the ceiling thinking what could be different if you were here beside me
sext: write my words on your skin
"there's a reason it didn't workout with anyone else, especially whom you set your mind on choosing"
"her heart resides, where echoes are silent and words are loud"
"I still remember the look on your face the first time you saw me, sigh, it was priceless"
she broke her own heart before anyone else could so she would know where the shards would fall
"memories of him struck her like a meteor, so she took a pen and collected the debris on a sheet of paper and called it poetry"
"so tell me, are you really XO?"
"you don't need someone to fix you, you just need someone who's brokenness fits with yours and keep you together from falling apart"
fall in love with heart before falling in love with her skin
let's crawl under a blanket with hot chocolate and watch horror movies
I will write you a million words with my lips on your neck
let me hold your hand gently and briefly so you could feel everything that I love about you
"I love flaws, they just make the person or object more real, perfection is boring in my opinion"
I listen to the songs you told me about whenever we don't talk or whenever you're sleeping to remind myself that you're still here beside me
"we choose those who want life to be easy and perfect, rather than choosing someone who is willing to grow together"
we choose people we want to change rather than choosing someone who will inspire us to be better
"we tend to choose people we want to heal, rather than choosing someone who can help us mend"
and suddenly you start thinking about all the what ifs and could've beens and it eats your brain till you can no longer function correctly
"you think you're in love, but you just want to be loved and taken care of"
"even if we're a tangled mess, I wouldn't love you any less"
"she deserves that much, she deserves someone who doesn't put the relationship at risk for someone stupid reason"
"but she wants someone who knows how to love her, she wants someone to scream they love her, someone who would be devastated if she left"
"she's tired of being on the losing end of the bad decisions people make, she's tired of being hurt"
"she wants you to be afraid of losing her, she wants the thought of losing her engraved in every decision you make"
"we fought yesterday, tonight we're fucking"
"arguing with someone who doesn't admit that they're wrong is like talking to a brick, pointless"
I saw true happiness in her eyes
I want my arms around your waist tonight
know the difference between a man who just desires you and values you
never pressure anyone to treat you right because there's so much people out there willing to give you the world without having to ask
"I mean, I don't choose to be moody or upset, it just happens on it's own, so i'm sorry for being me?.."
why don't people understand that my mood can literally change every 5 mins and that's something I have no control over..
"sext: if I die today, would you continue my journey on becoming a better version of myself?"
"I could not ask for better friends and family, this day will forever be unforgettable"
and one day i'll take your hands and cover your eyes and take you somewhere beautiful as you are
I seriously haven't been this happy in such a long time
i'd proudly give you what's left in me without any second doubts
I want to come home and see you in bed with your favorite lingerie on
"you didn't come here just to chill, and those clothes aren't going to take themselves off"
"she's laughing now, but she'll cry tonight"
a little something for you
"and when someone talks to you, you just push them away because they simply won't understand what's your current situation like"
where you don't even want to communicate or see anyone whatsoever and you just lock your mind on one thing only; silence
"I know that's choosing the easy way out and that's usually not me at all, but sometimes you just seriously reach that point"
why can't I just sleep for a couple of years straight and wake up when life gets better?
and I love the fact that every song reminds me of you and how you just keep running through my head for the rest of the day
people are so good at faking feelings that they became fake themselves
my lips on the bottle with you on my mind wondering how i'd see you sober
"I forgive and I forget, not because you mean anything to me, no, because you simply won't ever find someone like me"
and if I ever had the chance to do it all over again I would proudly do it with my eyes closed
it's never a loss if it was not making you happy
how fast time flies scares me sometimes
but you simply can't expect someone to hold on to you and fight for you when all you're doing is pushing them away
I was dying but her lips were the only medicine that could heal me
and behind every tear was you on her mind
hearing her voice in the middle of the night just makes me want to put it on repeat as if it's my favorite song
we saved each other from going completely insane
and I sat there watching her as if she's the only star in the galaxy and that's when I knew I fell in love with her
and when I look at you I forget everything else around me like nothing else exists but you
sext: you look more beautiful everyday
- why are you looking at me like that? - i'm admiring what's mine
"get you someone who motivates you to become a better person, not someone who just wants you to be like them"
she gave me a feeling that i've never felt before
as long as you're in my arms we got this
and you just sat there watching her heart crumble right in front of you
her beauty is the reason I still believe in god
let me just drown between your legs
one day you're going taste me in every lips that you will kiss and not be quite satisfied
plot twist; he wanted to make love and she just wanted a fuck buddy
I didn't need a paragraph to tell you how beautiful you are
"press your hands against mine, palm to palm you'll find me there and if my words deceive you, please look for the truth inside my lies"
can I place my hands on your mind before reaching for your waist and leaning in for the kiss?
"you'll find yourself when you lose everything, just don't let others blind you from seeing your true potential"
maybe you were just a dream I confused with reality
don't allow heartbreaks turn you into a person you're not
do people even know the difference between liking someone and being in love with them nowadays?
I get jealous of the pillow you get to hold and cuddle to every night before you sleep
"apparently being an asshole and cold hearted became the new ""cool"" kinda feel sorry for these people to be honest"
I have this thing for long empty roads I don't know why
"I don't know where i'm going yet, but i'm on my way"
"and if he doesn't look at you the way he looks at brownies covered with nutella, he's not the one for you"
"the iphone 7 is waterproof, that means you don't fucking ""be right back I gotta go take a shower"" me"
"I only have two moods, either lets go to the gym and work our ass off or let's just lay in bed all day and forget the world exists"
"I feel like a part of my soul has loved you since the beginning of everything, maybe we're from the same book"
"not everyone will understand what you're doing in your life, but that's okay, you're here to live your life, not to explain to everyone"
an unsend letter
maybe she's chaos to your thoughts and you're poison to her heart
your eyes stole all my words away
"I was the only one who knew that despite her sharp ways, her heart was more tender than a flower skin and she loved me beyond reason"
and I love how my bed still smells like you after you leave
"I can't stand anything; despair and pain, even sharp pity"
can we talk about how holding hands is 100x better when they do that thing when they rub their thumb on yours?
"because with the right person, kissing can sometimes feel like healing"
it's a lot easier not to let anyone know what's wrong
you can't hurt someone who's been living in pain all his life
"you have a cute smile, let's get married"
"people who keep running back to their toxic/problematic relationship and then complain about how they never changed, the fuck you doing?"
"I just hate seeing anyone upset or sad and just sitting all alone, like no come here give me a hug it's going to be okay"
"I respect people who communicate, tell me why I pissed you off, and tell me how I can fix it, tell me everything, talk"
I want to fill your mouth with my love
how long has it been since someone touched part of you other than your body?
"i've learned that as long as you have people who love you beside you, you're unstoppable"
i've learned how to raise myself up without any help from others
i've learned that what goes around comes back around to you but 10x harder and rougher
i've learned that good things take a lot of patience to come and can easily be taken away from you in a split second
"i've learned that you don't always get what you ask for whenever you want it, the world doesn't spin around you"
i've learned that someone can be a huge part of your life and a second later you're complete strangers
i've learned that people can easily replace you once they've found better
"i've learned that some broken things stay broken, and that you can get through bad times and keep looking for better ones"
there are things that go wrong that don't always get fixed or get put back together the way they were before
things don't always turn out the way you plan it or the way you think they should
"a thread of ""things i've learned"" this year"
"you ever just want to literally grab someone and be like ""yo let me fucking love you with all my heart"""
a walk on the beach right now with some music and coffee sounds perfect
"the more sexual and inappropriate you are with me, the better we'll get along"
don't let people's opinion of you define the choices you make in life
"for once I just don't want to worry about anything, is that too much to ask for?"
"""people wait all week for friday, all year for summer and all their life for happiness"""
know the difference between learning from the past and letting it wreck you
"it's caring about everything then caring about nothing at all, it's feeling everything at once then feeling paralyzingly numb"
"it's wanting friends but hate socializing, it's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely"
"having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time, it's the fear of failure but no urge to be productive"
"your smile has fear now, you look like a leaf that's not quite ready for spring to end and for fall to arrive"
"he smiles at her but she sees his hesitance, she can read him like her favorite book"
"I don't know, but something has me convinced that i'll end up utterly alone in life with no one to blame but myself"
"she doesn't want to miss him but every morning he's the first thing she thinks about, his name slips off her tongue in casual conversations"
when words can't even describe how you're feeling
you're with the wrong person if you don't feel butterflies in your stomach whenever they hug you
"your neck, I want to kiss it"
"any absence of you is too much for me, small or big, I need you constantly"
she's good at hiding feelings that need to be shown and replaces them with ones people expect to see
is it just me that has a thing for candles? like I could literally live on candles with no lights whatsoever
"it's okay, you can blame me for the mess you're in"
*accidentally cares* opps my bad
i'll probably love you in the morning
and for once I tried putting something into words
sorry but i'm too lazy to take part in life right now
"love is homeless until it meets you, it finds comfort in your body, makes bedroom in your heart, and plants flowers in your veins"
"there's no wrong kind of love, but there are wrong kind of people, wrong kind of hearts, wrong kind of words, wrong kind of promises"
you kept pouring a little of yourself to every person you loved and now you wonder why you're so empty
and I love everything you hate about yourself
"then it'll finally hit you, it was her, it was always her all along but you were just too dumb to realize it"
"at the stupid jokes he makes, and it will burn your heart seeing that beautiful smile on her face and realizing that you're not the reason"
"one day you're going to see her holding hands with someone who took your chance, she won't even notice because she's too busy laughing"
"maybe its just me, but i'd rather be educated by experiences with cultures than sitting on a desk for 9 hours a day"
maybe if she cried loud enough you would hear her thoughts
me
sext: let me tie you up in bed and just stare at how beautiful you are
talents: taking shit from people and not doing anything about it
your name should've been pinned with a warning sign beside it
"I liked it more when we were strangers, we still had to explore each other like it was maze"
I had a nightmare the other day; it started with I miss you
"I have a big hug waiting for you anytime you need it, just in case you're wondering"
I actually forgot when was the last time I ever had a goodnight sleep
"people always lie to save themselves, or they'll do it thinking that they're saving you"
"I don't want mediocrity, no, I want more, I want passion, pain I want something that will make my heart race and my brain lose control"
I really don't have the energy to deal with stupidity and stubbornness nowadays
the hardest thing that i've had to experience is that people are allowed to not want me anymore
"eventually you’ll end up where you need to be, with who you’re meant to be with, and doing what you should be doing"
because beautiful things don't ask for attention
"I left a poem in your mouth last night, I hope you can still hear it every time you breathe"
i'm always interested in things that people try to hide
I can't get you out of my mind
date a girl when you're ready to hand her your phone without freaking out
grab the booty when she's moody
"she wants to be your always, not your sometimes"
buy her cute underwears so she could wear them with you
"if your heart hurts, just remember that long nights end"
"the cigarette tasted like alcohol from her lips and I got drunk, but she was the first thing that came in mind, oh how I miss that"
but tonight all I want is to drown in your arms and not wake up
a few drinks and she was already naked in bed waiting for me
she called out your name but you were never there for her
let me hold you tightly in my arms tonight and watch the stars together
"I never really share my feelings with anyone at all, so if I share them with you, you better feel fucking special"
take your clothes off and let's talk about it
"when people want to leave, let them go, because it hurts more to pretend you're anything other than two strangers trying to make it"
let's drink our coffee together and pretend not to look at each other
"sometimes I find myself thinking about you like you're still here with me, I imagine the way your hand felt in mine and how beautiful it was"
it's sad that someone right next to you could be completely broken and you wouldn't even know a single thing about them
"maybe ""i don't know"" will be our always"
don't give them the power to hurt you
"""don't hang around negative people"" simply said by a negative person"
"I love the thought of great things coming my way, no matter what you are going through, there is so much to look forward to in life"
maybe we could just fuck our stress away and hope for a better tomorrow
ask her for the recipe to my happiness
"but oh god the way she smiles at me, gets me on my knees every time, sigh"
"she only wanted you to be happy, so she bit her lips and hoped you understood her silence"
"she looked at you while you were too busy looking at someone else, leaving her speechless whether she's good enough or not"
I can still see the pain in that smile of yours
"oh, but please no clothes allowed, thank you"
some popcorn and you in my arms cuddling while watching a movie is what I want right now
"please, do explain and tell me how someone can be that beautiful with stitches around her heart"
I always wonder
"little do you know, i've already made plans for us the moment I laid my eyes on you"
can I let my tongue start with your neck and let it maneuver every part of your body?
"if you're unappreciated leave, dont put so much effort into making someone happy only to seem like a bother, it's useless"
"and I hate how much I miss you the moment you leave my sight, it almost feels like I lost a piece of myself"
I really hate how jealous I get sometimes
"so much negativity in my head to the point that I can no longer even think straight, quite overwhelming"
oh how much i hate sleeping without my arms around your neck
slow kissing till our lips turn numb and your panties turn wet
i think she left her zipper open for me to put my hands inside
she only wanted to be enough for you
allow me to take your clothes off with my mouth first
i crave a world where only the two of us exist in
"on a side note: nobody really gives a fuck except one or two people, so make sure you don't disappoint them"
"specially when someone already put their trust in you, it's quite disappointing"
"stop pretending that you care when you really just don't give a fuck, it's useless"
note to self: you need to stop procrastinating
everything about you is just so addicting
- you hear that? - hear what? there's nothing - thats the amount of fucks given about what you think
"it's okay to admit that you fucked up, we all did, it shouldn't be something you feel ashamed off"
oh tell me about it
sext: you look cute in the morning
me flirting: sleep early with me so we could wake up in the morning together
"if u don’t have good intentions with me then don't bother getting close to me, i'm tired of that shit"
there's no need in bottling up these feelings if they're only going to rot inside of you
she was so good at pretending i hardly noticed any difference
"dear girls, please understand that we don't lift to look ""hot"" or to please your taste"
w h y c a n t I g e t e n o u g h s l e e p?
"pack and get dressed while they're sleeping, let's get the fuck out of here"
"once a girl is sexually attracted to you and comfortable around you, you'll learn how freaky girls can be sometimes"
"the skies are open and so are my arms, so come here and i'll take good care of you"
i can't help it but my lips want to explore every inch of your body tonight
"there are people out there who can't help but smile when they hear your name, you're beautiful and don't forget that"
that complete silence where you think of a million things to say but can't decide which one is the best
the art of being sleepless
- 911 what's your emergency? - i'm hungry and i don't know what to eat
maybe she just needs someone who can listen and not say a single word
"she opened her arms for me like an angel who's about to spread her wings and fly, only this time she took me with her"
"don't test my pride and ego, i could be wanting to talk to you 24/7 and you'd never hear from me, my pride is above humanity"
reminder: people are still trash
well at least the moon is out to keep me company tonight
"her lips tasted like coffee, cigarettes and home"
it just feels weird when you're not around
your smile is what i want to wake up to every morning
a walk on the beach with some good music right now sounds lovely
it hurts that you forgot about her like it was nothing
do you ever just wish you could relive a certain year or a moment in a different country just to experience what would it be like there?
words sometimes are useless when all you need is just hug
can i love you the way you want to love yourself?
we all want to be something better than we already are
your mind is a book i never get tired of reading
you've taken the words right out of my mouth and i haven't even kissed you yet
"oh as much as i'd love that, i could stare at you that even birds will be jealous"
and maybe we'll watch the sun rise together with our morning coffee and your sleepless eyes
"if it makes you feel safe, i'll gladly do it without thinking twice about it"
i don't mind holding you in my arms for the rest of the night
"the thing is.. life goes on, with or without them, it never stops for anyone"
maybe we're just stuck in a world where only the two of us really understand and the rest is all just an illusion
"two bodies, one soul combined"
equals (2015)
i want to cry about my life but i've got more important things to do right now
i don't think there is anything left in me for me to give
they're keepers if they stick by your side when you're at your worst
she misses your skin glued into hers
thinking about you is my favorite part of my night
it's lonely here without you in my arms
"your voice is the first thing i want to hear when i wake up every morning, whispering in my ears that you're still here"
take my hand and place it on your thighs
"people don't even date anymore, they just talk, catch feelings, go out for a few weeks then end up ignoring each other"
let's go on a napping date together sometime
nothing's more annoying than someone who expects you to be okay with something they wouldn't be ok with if you did it
"""i know how you feel"" shut the fuck up you don't know shit lol"
"i always give people chances, so if i give up on you it basically means you really fucked up"
game of thrones and chill?
can i just skip to the part where i get to sleep next to you every night?
and the best part of the day is when I finally get into bed at night and write about how beautiful you are
it's pathetic how we waste so much time and effort on certain people and at the end they prove that they weren't even worth a second of it
why does it always feel like i'm just drifting through reality?
she showed me what happiness feels like
i need sleep but i'd rather have you tonight
i want to cry in your arms tonight she said
buy her pizza and fuck her right
"i want my lips on your collarbones, i want to explore you like your skin is a map that leads to heaven"
"laying next to you in bed, that's what i want to be doing"
"a little girl with full of hopes and dreams, what's not to love about her"
allow me to kiss your cracked lips and slide my fingers in your panties and call it love
"she looks at herself in the mirror hoping she was prettier than others, hoping she could one day satisfy your taste"
"looking in her eyes made me comfortable, gave me a feeling that i've been craving for far too long"
"and if you ever feel lost just find yourself in my words, you're always going to be there"
the way she listens to her favorite song makes me want to listen to her singing it the whole day
"ah yes, late night thoughts have come back home, hi there"
i'm not surprised that you’re the first thing that comes to my mind when I wake up in the middle of the night
"and even when she's broken in half she tries to make you feel better and comforts you, that's how much she cares"
she's trying to make you happy with tears in her eyes
shoutout to my brain for refusing to let go of the memories
i'm sorry but i have no room for bullshit in my life right now
it never ends does it those midnight thoughts and rumbling in your head
i saw the emptiness in your eyes when you looked at him
"her lips taste like heaven, a sweet comfort to my inner hell"
can we just skip to the part where we're all just happy without having to worry about anything?
"she knows i changed, yet she still accepts me"
how are you not exhausted from running through my mind all day i wonder
but first let me kiss the reflection of the sun on that beautiful face of yours
i honestly haven't been this happy in a really long time to the point that it's scary
holding on to the wrong person will only slow you down from reaching the right person
let's spend the whole day eating pizza and listening to music together
"i looked in her eyes and i saw her heart waving at me, only this time mine waved back"
i sometimes wonder what you hide behind that fake smile and lustily eyes
patience is hard to maintain the way it's hard to keep your head above water when the waves get too high
reminder: life doesn't wait for you to put yourself back together
she brings out the soft side of me
"fuck stress, have sex instead"
the sky bled for us and we hardly even noticed anything
hickeys ft you
the way she tilts her head on my shoulders as the wind blows her hair towards me is too beautiful
how she hides herself in my arms hoping i'd never let go scares me sometimes
"please don't waste my time, i wasted enough on people who didn't deserve half of it"
you made sinning look beautiful
you give me a beautiful reason to believe in happiness
"i swore and i lied, i promised and i broke it, i said i won't break your heart but i did, i said i won't let you down but i did"
"that heat between our bodies, the soft touch between your thighs and passionate kisses on your neck"
let's just take a moment and think about how the rain drop feels every time it touches your skin
"do you ever get a really good hug from someone and be like, ""wait no come back and hug me again""?"
i woke up craving your hands on my body this morning
her eyes spoke to me while her lips were sealed
same
my fingers tracing the scars that she hides from everyone
at least i dreamt that i kissed you
at the end of the day all she really wanted was your attention
"time doesn't heal you, you heal yourself"
"babygirl in public, pornstar in private"
"you're just lonely, not sad"
i miss your half asleep morning kisses
"it was her walk that destroyed me, her eyes that stripped me her smile that melted me and her hair that captured me"
my lips crave your kiss
you lost me the moment you put your pride between us
let's just make out till our lips become numb
be with someone who'll have morning sex with you on the kitchen counter while making sandwiches for your kids
and nobody will ever give as much as i gave for people who didnt deserve half of it
you can do 99 good things to someone and they'll only remember that 1 thing you didn't do
she's constantly searching for ways to make you stay
i just wish i could delete the distance between us
"it's just you, my cat and i"
"and i could swear i heard your voice in the morning, among the birds singing our favorite song"
"i always feel like i'm dreaming when i'm with you, as if i'm in a totally different universe"
it would be a blessing to have you all for myself tonight
maybe you're just looking for him in the wrong places
i just want to cuddle with you and watch the stars
how many shooting stars will she waste on you?
i'll never understand why/how people can be so hateful
everyday is a great day to do nothing at all but to stare at the ceiling
i sometimes enjoy keeping the moon company till the sun comes out
"it's the kind of love that scares you, that makes you think whether it's good or bad, but at the same time it's so beautiful"
"i'll always care too much, because that's just me"
"before you talk, let me just kiss those lips of yours real quick"
i got jealous of how the sun kissed your face this morning
mood:
"she only wanted to be enough for you, she only needed your attention and care, and you threw that away just like that"
let's spend the night by the beach with our favorite music on and talk about anything that comes in mind
she gave you the best parts of her and yet you chose to destroy them
don't you just wish you could sometimes send hugs through texts?
and i hope one day you realize what a piece of art you are
she's a maze full of untold secrets
if you kiss my neck you might as well get us both naked
i think i forgot how to sleep
"she said my hands belong in her pants and my lips on her neck, sigh"
"whatever, let's just make out till the sun comes out and we'll make our coffee"
and it all comes down to that last person you think about before you sleep
her breathing on my neck was my favorite part of the day
"if you could read my mind, you'd be in tears"
will i ever stop pretending that i'm okay?
"give me your hands, it's going to be alright i promise"
let me bury my face in your arms for the night
because when i'm with you all the pieces fit perfectly together
i liked it more with your lips all puffy and red in my mouth
"i can just watch you sleep all night and not even get bored, hearing you breathe with your eyes closed, God, i admire beauty"
"stop kissing her for just a second and look into her eyes, then kiss her again, she'll melt, believe me"
"be the reason behind someones happiness, not pain"
sometimes you just need someone to tell you that you're not as bad as you think you are
never stop showing someone how much they mean to you
"what is it with me that is always waiting, willing and eager; lapping up the tiny crumbs of affection that others throw away?"
don't expect your girl to play her role when you have other girls auditioning for her part
your lips on my neck with my hands between your thighs
"perhaps we've been on two different sides, appreciating but not understanding"
make me whole again
"let's fuck, cuddle then fuck again"
you're always hurting her yet she's the one who always apologizes
the way she closes her eyes while listening to her favorite song
"her smile made any song irrelevant, it was almost as beautiful as the kindness in her eyes"
even in my sleep i think of you
the tighter i hugged her the harder she cried
"on her wrists were scars, and in her eyes were tears but over the scars were excuses no one ever questioned"
she has that smile that could bring world peace
"last year i would've died for certain people, this year half of them are considered dead to me"
"i spoke to God today, i asked him to watch over you while i'm not there"
when you feel them smiling during a kiss &gt;
my name fits better in her mouth
"she saw every part of you but couldn't speak, but when you saw every part of her all you did was leave"
"she's tough but delicate, flawed yet beautiful, imperfect but deserving"
"if you numb your heart with too much liquor and lies, you will stay in places you don't belong for far too long"
how many pieces of yourself have you relinquished for the sake of making someone else whole?
strangers all over again
i sometimes wish we didn't have to lose this much to learn these lessons
she has scars on all the places where you used to kiss her
"our eyes kissed, i felt home, a feeling i have been craving for such a long time"
"short girls with nice asses, amen"
"well, damn"
"""why are you so quiet?"" bitch i just met you an hour ago, chill"
cuddling sounds good right now
she needs someone to fill her sadness and emptiness with love and care
"when a guy talks to his guy friends about a girl, he really loves her"
"everything about her is just so beautiful, god"
can i be your morning cigarette?
it's crazy how someone could mean so much to you in such a short time
"i want to lose myself between your legs, i want to make your body shake"
can i leave my fingers in your hair and my lips in your mouth?
look in my eyes when you bite your lips
sometimes distancing yourself from everybody and everything is recommended
my religion is my hands between your thighs
take your time with me but never take your hands off me
tonight i just want you close to me
"i never though anybody could ever understand me, but you do, perfectly"
i felt comfortable the second i looked in your eyes
she's trapped inside her own thoughts hoping someone could understand her
the kinda of lust that you'd forget each others name afterwards
our eyes spoke a language only we understood
tickling and play fighting that turns into sex &gt;
i always go to sleep wanting more of you
i love how my room still smelled like you after you left
there is honestly no point in telling anyone how you feel because they'll never understand either way
sad songs with wet lips on your neck
allow me to hold you until reality fades away and we're the only ones left in this world
let me wrap my words around your neck till you forget what's it like to breathe
sext: make me feel again
hickeys on her thighs
"this is who i am, you either accept it or get the fuck out of my life"
she misses the way you used to love her
you're so much more than just words to me
and maybe one day we'll stop pretending to be happy and actually be happy
she's the kind of girl you never want to introduce to anyone because you want her all for yourself
even your slightest moan turns me the fuck on
"she was once a good girl with full of life and passion for things, now look at her"
the fact that someone else can look at you the same way i do terrifies me
expectations lead to nothing but disappointments
some nights my sadness feels too heavy to the point that i can't fit it into words
you don't know how terrible it is inside my head
you can never love the same way twice
she's the kind of pretty that kills
i appreciate people who always try harder
why can't i fall in love and not think of it as a mistake?
let me hold you until you can no longer cry
i have the tendency of saying mean things instead of saying how i really feel
sext: let's be lazy together
"her voice was softer than her skin, so sweet and innocent, i could hear it all day if i could"
she saw beauty in everything but herself
"even if you hear something bad about me, understand that there was a time where i was good to them"
let me fuck your sadness until you cum all the loneliness away
and sometimes all you can do is beg the words to love you back
she's nothing but a mouthful of maybes and handful of what ifs
our eyes spoke a language we both never understood
she wears sadness in her eyes
"my lips between your legs, my hands in your hair and the whole world passing quietly around us"
i want to bury my face in your neck until everything is okay again
"the silence will kill you, eventually"
i sometimes feel like there's more to everything but we're just too blind to see it you know?
sex is always better when you're physically and mentally attracted to them
"i might forgive you easily, but don't ever think for a second that i'll ever forget what you did to me"
soft moans and sleepy voices
lust looks a lot better than love when it comes to you
"i already know what death feels like, but i thought after this long i'd feel alive again"
"cut the bullshit, get in my bed"
for the love of waves🌊🌊
just friends my fucking ass
thick thighs and curvy butts stay winning
some people just don't know the difference between loving someone and loving how their partner treats them
my blood boils every time i see him looking at you like that
was it worth it? giving them your all and getting nothing but pain in return?
can i fuck you with your morning smile and sleepy eyes?
she needs you to hold her face between your hands and promise her it's all going to alright
can i leave my hands between your thighs tonight?
"i don't sleep, i have an existential crisis at 2 am every night instead"
*thinks about making out with you until i fall asleep*
i don't mind staying in silence as long as you're with me
i keep reading your words hoping i'd find myself in them
i sometimes feel like I need to apologize for waking up
sadness met loneliness and they called it love
some nights i can't help but close my eyes and imagine you in my arms
i really hate misunderstandings and people who misunderstand me
i often fantasize about everything being okay one day
let me lick all the words off your lips until the only one left is my name as a moan
sometimes i get so quiet to the point that i can't even hear myself anymore
a lot of you here are falling in love with each other and it's simultaneously the most beautiful and most painful thing to watch
i just hope there is still enough of me for you to hold when i finally get to you
if she acts like a kid with you it just means that she's comfortable around you
because the weeknd told me only losers go to school
she said she can see right through me and I told her that's probably because there's a hole in my chest where my heart used to be
i love the soft touch of your lips  and my rough grip on your hips pulling you closer
can my hand be your favorite necklace?
"i run my hands through her hair like i do the sand on the beach, both remind of a place i never want to leave"
when someone has cute cheeks
"- dude what the fuck, you have a knife in your back - yeah I know, my friend put it there"
treat her soul beautiful and you'll finally find the key you've been looking for
"you start breathing louder as i touch you slower, i fucking love it"
her thoughts could fill empty wine bottles but instead they're filled with guilt and hate
nowadays asking to be treated right or at least the same treatment back is too much to ask for
"i sometimes wonder if she realizes i'm already slipping away, living a life i was told i wouldn't achieve, making only but myself proud"
"i'm just here waiting for that ""come over and let's nap"" text"
awkward conversations with myself
that shiver you get when they start kissing your neck slowly
"they didn't love you, they only loved the way you made them feel"
i can't string my sadness into anything that makes sense anymore to be honest
there's a future version of me who's proud i was strong enough
"i dislike all the guys that talk to you, so don't ask me why or what they did, i just automatically dislike them"
the cigarette warning label had your name on it
it's sad that the only place you can find love now is in history books and romantic movies
i wanna cry from how tired i am..
"me jealous? oh, fuck yes"
"by mess you mean beautiful, even at your worst"
tell me your favorite colors so i could have something to paint my thoughts with
"i'd give you the world, but it looked a lot better 50 years ago"
not everything i write is beautiful because not everything i write is always about you
sext: i want everything in my house to smell like you
she told me to grab her in the naughtiest place so i mind fucked her
you're always going to be my first priority
"don't bother yourself with useless shit, it's not worth it"
"i want your sleepy smiles, your morning hair and your arms wrapped around my neck"
i think you're beautiful and no amount of anything will ever change that
i love conversations that just flow without struggling to find a subject to talk about
"i love ""you're not going anywhere till we fix this"" type of people"
bury her in your arms and play with her hair till she falls asleep
how the smallest gesture touches her in ways you'll never know or even think about
a small part of me will always be lost between your legs
i get jealous of how the wind flirts with your skirt
and just like that my sadness melts away every time i see your smile
girls..
my mind wanders what her skin will feel like against mine
"this generation thinks it's cool not to care, It's not, effort is cool, caring is cool, staying loyal is cool, try it out sometime"
i like who i am when we let the world fall away and created our own
"it was the softest little sigh, barely noticeable, except for her warm breath on my neck"
late night conversations with myself
sweat pants &gt; jeans
i'm thinking of her today and i wonder if somewhere she's thinking of me too
it's like you're in the next room and we're staring at the same wall hoping we were next to each other
a little patience and understanding is all i really need
being single is cool and shit until you want to cuddle and remember you got nobody
how i wish my heart came with a pause button
my eyes are locked on you and have been this way since we first met
i'm just living the moment hoping i'd spend every second with you
"lack of communication ruins good relationships and friendships, if there's something wrong tell them, talk to each other, fix it"
i sometimes regret every word i've said to you
"people tell you to be yourself but once they realize that you're actually better, they start hating you"
tonight we're touching the stars together
i'd take a deep late night conversation over sleep any day
sadly i'm the type of person that can be screwed over and over again and still always be there for people
i hate how temporarily everything is nowadays
you were mine the moment i laid my eyes on you
she didn't know what love is till you came along and showed her how beautiful it can be
"don't force anything, just let it happen on it's own"
i hope you find the happiness you've been pretending to have
nothing really bothers me anymore
"how they treat you is how they feel about you, simple"
let me undress your mind with my lips on your neck
"any girl can give you head and sex, but how many going to hold you down, motivate you, make sure you're ok care about you, be there for you?"
it's the kinda love that doesn't have an end
"bruh, be obsessed with her, show her off, check on her constantly, and do your best to keep her happy, that's all she really wants"
"humans don't deserve kindness, animals do"
"just hold on a little longer for me, i promise we got this baby girl"
i get really jealous and i hate it
found a quiet place by the sea shore and all i could think about was you with our favorite song on repeat
"she's confused and manipulated, she has no idea what she even wants anymore"
"i hate it when i can't put my feelings into words, it's so frustrating"
don't do something that pisses me off and ask what's wrong when you know what you did
when was the last time you were called beautiful and felt it?
she needed a shoulder to lean on when you were too busy leaning yours on someone else
"placing her head on my chest, she asked if we could take a nap and forget about reality"
a collection of kisses carefully placed on her neck
"nobody is doing this, so let me #BeardsBreakTheInternet"
"i'm just waiting for those long walks along the shore, footsteps leading to nowhere and the smell of the sea staining our love"
It's quite intimidating to think you're the only one putting all the effort in
maybe we're just trapped in someone else's dreams
my body aches for your touch
"if she moans your name, you're doing it right"
"in a relationship you shouldn't have to tell them what you should or shouldn't do, they should know to respect the relationship itself"
nobody likes being treated like everyone else when they've told that they are special
let me explore every inch of your body like i'm about to enter a maze full of flowers
she's not your girl until she starts wearing your shirt with just panties on
i love hearing the sound of your heart
you never realize how poorly you have been treated in the past until someone comes along and treats you the way you should've been treated
"everything's so overwhelming lately, sigh"
you get addicted to how nice they treat you to the point that even others fail to compete against them
"you are neither good or bad, happy or sad, scared or fearless, you're too complicated and mysterious to be either or"
me as a father
i hate the feeling when you really want to get over something but you can't because it replays in your head every second
- why are you destroying yourself? - because i won't allow others to do it for me
i want something stable
morning sex with coffee while listening to the birds sing our favorite song
i hope he makes you feel like there are rainbows on your hair when he touches it
perhaps maybe someday we'll stop apologizing for who we truly are
it's important to understand the difference between someone who talks to you in their free time and someone who makes time for you
"protect your girl like your daughter, love her like your wife and respect her like your mother"
lay your body on my bed as i just stare at it dramatically wondering how can someone be that beautiful
when will i ever sleep knowing there's something good coming the next day
"i felt it from the beginning, i just kept my mouth shut"
can i kiss your forehead and call you babygirl?
let's sit in a tub filled with flowers and champagne and make out till our lips become numb
"you use to be the one she goes to when she feels down, the first one she'd tell her good news to, now look at you"
tell me more about that smile of yours
happiness looks beautiful on you
her lips tasted like cotton candy and i got addicted crawling back everyday for more
"i want your skin against mine, i want to feel the softness of your lips in my mouth while you look in my eyes"
would you mind if i hold on to your thighs as we dance to our favorite song?
i only want it if i'm the only one having it
i want to make you smile even if it means destroying myself
break a writers heart and they'll make your life a living hell everyday for the rest of your life
"listen to her very closely when she's sad, you'll notice things about her that she'd never tell you when she's normal"
"i'll change who I am to love you better, but i won't change who i am to be loved better"
the way she bites her lips when she looks at me makes me want to explore every inch of her body
loneliness always followed me but i knew you'd be waiting for me at the end of the road with your arms wide open
"i'll find sleep eventually, and when i do i'll wish i could dream about you being in my arms"
"mature people, where you at?"
i crave more of you everyday
she wants the same attention and affection you gave her when you were still trying to get her
sleepy voices and the smell of sex with a cigarette on her lips
writing about her is my favorite part of the day
give her the proper attention she deserves because someone out there is ready to give her what you don't
she was jealous of how many cigarettes touch his lips
i miss the way you breathe deeply on my neck while you're in my arms hoping i wouldn't let go
allow me to fall in love with all the things you hate about yourself
sext: let's ignore each other and pretend we never talked
let me kiss your neck while hugging you and whisper in your ears how beautiful you look
"""little things"" are like going out for ice cream or getting her flowers unexpectedly, not a $500 makeup pallete"
"once you're attached, you're fucked"
i need to sleep for a week
- why did you stop talking to me? - i felt like i was bothering you
"nothing says ""you're not special"" more than an unanswered text"
how to properly hug your girl
"run your fingers through her hair and don’t stop until she falls asleep, she'll love you for it"
the way he looked at her when he saw her with someone else made him rethink his existence
"i like maturity, like admitting where you went wrong, where i went wrong, where we went wrong and working on it together"
"how am I supposed to reply to emojis or ""yeah"" or ""yup"" or ""lol"" or ""haha"" you useless piece of shit?"
"my future daughter is never going to cry in bed over somebody who doesn't appreciate her, i'll raise her to know her worth"
"fuck around and lose someone who's always been there for you, and I promise you're going to be more hurt than they are"
let me spread your legs and explore what's it like to be in heaven
plot twist: she uses you for sex
let's write about each other as if we just fell in love
yea i do flirt but once i'm yours i'm only yours it's just that simple really
how do you expect her to open up to you when all you're doing is pushing her away?
i love the flavor of your skin
when she wears your shirt and her smell is all over it &gt;&gt;
being happy was easy once I realized you weren't leaving
she still writes notes of how happy she would've been if you just kept fighting for her a little longer
missing people that i shouldn't be missing
"of all the things i've done wrong in life, I regret not kissing you sooner"
"if you're worried that you'll be a burden or speak your mind, they'll eventually become a burden to you"
"that look in her eyes with that semi smile, they always get to me"
being nice and kind got me nowhere
it's late and your body is all that's on my mind right now
i've always put my pride aside for you but what did you do in return?
"i don't even know what i'm doing sometimes, i just do it for the hell of it and pretend everything's going fine"
she still looks beautiful in that messy bed and messy hair of hers
if you're looking for someone who can't make decisions and always confused about his feelings i'm your guy
"give me your hand, your heart and a chance to let me prove you wrong"
i missed the smell of your perfume on my clothes
"- jealousy is cute - yeah, but it won't be cute when i kill him for you"
please just don't waste my time
she's a keeper if she made you cum fast
"they said it gets easier, they lied"
the fact that i can't be myself around certain people anymore disappoints me
"loneliness is not being alone, it's unable to communicate the things that are actually important"
"if you're lucky enough to have someone who understands you well enough don't fuck it up, just don't"
we forget our worth once we give them everything
not wanting to date someone because you aren't physically attracted to them does not make you an asshole
you miss them but then you feel like a burden so you just stay quiet and let it be
i am tired of waking up in a world where you are not a part of it
let's take a walk on the beach naked like no one's watching
"despite how peaceful and loving you may seem, people can only meet you as they have met themselves"
you're too proud to say that you've made a mistake
girls be like..
don't you just hate that you never know what someone is thinking or feeling towards you and everything that they say could be a massive lie?
"i pay attention to the smallest details, so believe me when i say i've seen everything"
5 years from now you're going to look back at who you are right now and just laugh at how stupid this all is
"the question is, are you really worth it?"
can i just restart my life?
"they didn't care when you were down and lonely, remember that"
i looked at your lips thinking how good they'd look locked in mine
"it doesn't always get better, we just become better at hiding shit"
it's quite mesmerizing how well the misunderstood understands others
"you're that one person i'd never give up on, and i find that quite scary"
i have nightmares about your hands letting go of mine
just because you're hurt doesn't give you the right to hurt others
you make me want more of you every time you look at me like that
i'm always stuck thinking about things i shouldn't be worrying about
pay close attention to those who actually take your feelings into consideration
"stay away from people who make you feel like you're not good enough, know your worth"
i've got places in me only for you to explore
"i lost interest in a lot of things, and you're one of them"
i wish i could just sleep and forget about reality for a while
i tried telling strangers about you and all they said is that you were bad for me
she's a keeper but you didn't know how to keep her
i just hate myself when i'm moody
"you don't have to be perfect, you just have to be real"
todays photoshoot
she's probably just lonely
"if you see pain in my eyes, can you imagine what my heart looks like?"
i let you become my happiness and that’s where i went wrong
"don't you just love hearing ""i saw this and it reminded me of you"" from someone who's special to you?"
"it's sad when you realize the person you used to tell everything to, now has no idea of what’s happening with your life"
i'm really sexual but i'm also really shy which really don't mix well
it's weird how we can be hurt and jealous over somebody that's not even ours
can i be a part of your late night thoughts?
i just don't have the energy to argue about nonsense anymore honestly
"let's just disappear together, leave everything and everyone behind us and go"
"you never really realize what you had till it's gone for good, you start thinking how things could've been different"
couldn't careless what you think to be honest
i though we had something special going on but then i was like nah
i can't stop being myself and it's depressing to be honest
you push them away but then you end up getting more attached to them
i looked in her eyes and i felt like i was in a different universe
if the attention you give me isn't constant i don't want it at all
she's the kind of girl you want to ignore but never will
girls who do this unexpectedly stay winning
sext: let's feel bad for each other
give her all your attention or someone else will fam
you know me well enough to know what upsets me yet you did it
i just need someone who understands me without having to explain everything
people who try their best to keep the conversation going are keepers
she thought she had it all figured out till it hit her that she doesn't even know herself
i find you attractive without clothes on
but where were you when i was at my worst?
sometimes your heart needs more time to accept what your mind already knows
"she accuses you because she's been hurt, she asks the same questions because she needs reassurance, and that's when you know she cares"
she's still beautiful when she's pale
childish people make me sick
she's a mystery that i'd like to explore one day
i don't even think the doors to hell would open to me
"i do get jealous, but i just never show it"
i check your likes to see how you're doing
"i've been in the ""what the fuck"" mood for a while now"
"i get it, you've been through a lot but i'm not here to make it hard on you, i'm just trying to help"
do you ever regret every word you said to someone because you feel like they didnt deserve one single bit of it?
if you relate to me you're probably fucked
"- i miss you  - no, you miss the way i treated you not me"
"if her family likes you, you're lucky"
i started treating people how they treat me and i lost half of them already
endless love
a guy will only change his ways for somebody he really wants to be with
"it's alright, i wouldn't commit to me either"
she's tired of trying because every time she tries to make you happy or satisfied you end up letting her down
everything else is a blur when you're there
don't judge my late night thoughts
i don't know if depression means i am too smart to be engaged by meaningless bullshit or too stupid
you can't hate me more than i hate myself
it's more of ignore at first sight nowadays
"yes, please do fuck with my head harder"
"don't lose someone who's willing to do whatever it takes to win you, just don't"
"i like staring at your face, it makes me smile"
"love is no longer permanent in this generation, it's just an other feeling that fades away like the rest"
i want enough time to be in love with everything
it's quite sad to see a pretty face like yours upset
"you trusted the wrong people, you gave them a part of you which they didn't deserve"
i just need a get-away ticket far away from here
i want to feel your lips all over my body
i need to take my own advice for a change
eventually everyone leaves
"trust, appreciation, affection, attention, effort, encouragement, excitement, these things are what keeps a relationship going"
let me pull you a little closer and remind you how beautiful you look
"you just can't hide your feelings from me, i know you too well"
"girls who smell nice are a huge turn on, seriously"
she pushed everyone away hoping someone could pull her back but they ended up giving up on her
"i can hardly tell anything anymore, it's quite overwhelming"
"""just friends"" don't look at each other like that"
i'm a totally different person when i'm comfortable around you
say hi
can i skip reality for a while?
i just want the real you
late night phone calls are everything
"just make sure the other person deserves what you give them, some people just don't appreciate shit"
the thought of losing her became his nightmare and all he did was stay awake
"you didn't put enough effort, that's the thing"
i can't wait for summer movie nights
letting go of something that means so much to you can sometimes be hard as fuck
let me kiss your scars and tell you how beautiful you look
don't blame people for the shit you got yourself into
how do people sleep knowing someone is actually upset because of them?
i sometimes apologize to myself for not taking care of me
*screams on the inside and puts a wide smile on the outside*
try to act like tomorrow doesn't exist and see how happy you become
"i just want you to be happy, and maybe a little bit naked"
i feel like killing someone today
sometimes it's just better to stay quiet and let things be
"i don't ask for much, i just ask for the same treatment back"
she's pretending that she's okay when it's slowly tearing her apart
"if a girl cares about you she'll get mad over the little things and if you can't handle that, go for someone that doesn't care what you do"
you keep telling yourself to move on but all you're doing is going right back
fuck her right or someone else will
"i like it when someone asks me about everything, it makes me think that they actually care"
it's so hard to trust anybody nowadays
if you think a girl is pretty you should tell her because she'll probably be happy about it for a few days
don't underestimate how good i can pretend that everything's going well
i'd hug myself if i could
it's like they took a part of you and just left without returning it
"i just like keeping shit to myself, it's better this way"
my mood swings be like
once they stop writing about you is when you realize they got over you
"don't get attached, save yourself the trouble and pain"
mind fuck me with your silence
do you ever just feel like you gave too much for something that was useless?
some people just don't deserve all the kind words i once said to them
she looked at me like i was one of her paintings
that feeling when you can actually feel the pain in your chest from hearing something or seeing something that really breaks your heart
i'm sorry my wall is too high for you to climb up
it's all about that one person you go tell your good news to
definitely
her sadness turned into a beautiful mess
"to sleep, or not to sleep  is the hardest decision ever"
"""i don't know"" basically describes my life right now"
it can be so frustrating when you're the only one trying to make things better
"don't think too much, you'll hurt yourself"
"i just hate it when i see someone sitting all alone, like no come here sit with me and tell me what's on your mind"
always put yourself in other peoples shoes before doing/saying anything just incase you fuck things up
"but you were never alone, i was always here watching over you and making sure everything was going fine"
i just hate it when i try to figure things out and i end up getting more confused
forgive yourself for loving the wrong person
the weeknd told me not to fall in love that shit is pointless
"losing people just became a part of my routine, it's like yeah next please"
"you deserve someone who respects you, gives you attention and wants you just as bad as you want them"
we keep repeating our same mistakes without recognizing that we're only hurting ourselves
you fucked up and i said sorry
sometimes making them miss you is necessary
do you ever wish you could just undo some people from your life?
she has that seductive look that'll probably give you a boner
"i do have a lot to say, you just have to ask the right questions"
words are just meaningless
never give someone your everything if they're not giving you anything in return
i lost a lot of people because i'm too lazy to text back and this has to stop
"you should let me in, you should tell me your fears and weak spots, and i'll take good care of them, i promise"
let's overthink things together and try to figure them out
she was tired of everybody stepping on her so she decided to close everything and push everyone away
"he was the only one who had the ability to make her love herself, to see her true beauty in his eyes"
they say opposites attract but they don't say anything about them staying together
"if we date, expect nap dates, expect me to call you at 2 am telling you let's go out because i'm bored and expect cuddling for a whole day"
"i don't care what others say about you, i only care about what i see"
"stop letting social media tell you what is/isn't wrong, do whatever the fuck you want"
call her beautiful like it's her first name
i tried getting you out of my mind but i failed miserably
let's fuck up our lives then fix them together
they lose interest in you once they get to know what they always wanted to know
"if he doesn't hold your ass while hugging, sweet heart you're with the wrong guy"
"show me that you care, i like that shit"
"i don't like boring conversations, either talk about something interesting or don't bother talking"
"she said she didn't want you, but all she really meant was fight for me"
i can see the doubt in those eyes even though you try to hide it
we looked at the stars together hoping we could touch them
"that's the thing about people who mean everything they say, they think everyone else does too"
"that moment when you're attached to someone and you're like ""oh fuck.."""
find what makes you happy and let it fucking destroy you
don't you just hate it when you're talking to someone and they just leave the chat like it's nothing?
"saying ""i'm tired"" doesn't even come close to how i feel sometimes"
It still hurts when your name runs through my head
a boy spends his time looking for different girls to sleep with while a man spends his time looking for that special one worth waking up to
"i honestly need to start treating people the same way they treat me, i've had enough"
"but this is not me leaving, this is you pushing me away"
let's not forget that I was always there when nobody else was
i met you at the worst time of my life
even the stars got jealous of the way he looks at her
"you're slowly becoming like everyone else, quite disappointing really"
"the more you think about it, the more stressful it gets"
She slept hoping you'd call her and tell her how much you've missed her.
Let your thoughts eat you alive.
"I just love stalking strangers, it's interesting to see what others are thinking about."
If you're not receiving the same treatment back why are you still trying?
"It took me sometime to discover that no matter how good you treat others, there will always be someone who fucks you up in the end."
"It's okay, i'll text myself back."
"I know you felt it too, that look in your eyes wasn't just a coincidence."
I still remember the way you looked at me when I called you beautiful for the first time.
I hope the songs I told you to listen to remind you of me whenever you listen to them.
"When a girl tells you to listen to a song focus on the lyrics, she's only pouring her feelings out to you."
Kindly note that not everybody gives a fuck like you do.
"No matter which way you look at it, you're always going to be judged and assumed."
It's weird how your brain works sometimes.
I was wrong to think that you were any different.
Describes my life perfectly.
"Reply 1 hour late and i'll reply 5 hours later, this isn't a single player game."
Be with someone who motivates you to become a better person and show you the potential that you don't see in yourself.
"Not all attractive girls are cocky and not all good looking guys are fuckboys, just letting that out."
Stop giving the wrong people the right pieces of you.
Some things are just not worth the effort anymore.
"God bless people who know how to cheer me up when i'm moody, honestly."
"She wants to be happy, but she doesn't know how to anymore."
She's the kinda girl you'd stop what you're doing and give your full attention to.
Do you ever regret telling someone so much about you because you feel like you gave them too much and got nothing in return?
"Snapchat is not meant for writing your feelings on a black screen and putting them to your story, no."
The best apology is changed behavior.
Is it just me or when someone says your name in the middle of a sentence they just become x10 more attractive?
"It's not that i'm scared of commitment, it's just that i'm scared to get fucked in the end for something I don't deserve."
You killed her with your silence.
I don't even want to think anymore.
"You can't force anyone to want you, it's either they do or not, don't push other people to do something they don't want."
It's really hard not knowing what you want.
"You know you're in love when you look at someone at their worst and be like; damn, how can they still be that beautiful?"
Can I can just skip May and go straight to June?
Nobody will ever know you like I do.
I always wonder if you think about me as much as I think about you.
If I text you at 11:02 you're suppose to text back at 11:01.
Eye language never lies man.
He knows her so well that hiding her feelings from him is pointless.
Look me in the eye and tell me how you feel.
"""You're suppose to put your pride aside for me."""
You want a nice conversation with someone? Text them at 2 AM.
"Let me show you what's it like to be loved and taken care of, I promise to do it nicely."
Touch her and so help me god I will fucking rip your throat out before you even see it coming.
Rules to live by.
"She wants to be pulled back, fought for and feel worthy. Don't fuck it up."
"No matter how much it hurts, i'm putting my pride before anybody else from now on."
"She needed a hug, your hug."
Do you ever wish you could take back what you said because you feel like thing's could've been different?
"I don't need anybody, I just need to figure out myself first, I need to understand what I want and what I need."
"Open up to me and tell me how you feel, tell me what's going on in that messy mind of yours. I'd like to know everything."
You can't blame them for loving you when all you did was pull them closer.
"Music never fails to put me in a different world, a world where I can be myself."
"Life goes on man, it always does."
"I just don't want to fuck this up, I always fuck things up unintentionally."
Do you mind if I just sit next to you and watch you smile?
"God, I lose interest fast as fuck and it's starting to piss me off."
Do you ever just feel like holding someone for hours without even saying a single word?
I just want to kiss your parents and thank them for giving birth to someone so beautiful like you.
"But I do know how it feels like to be all alone thinking that no matter what you do, you'll always blame yourself for everything."
She knew me before I even had the chance to introduce myself.
"Switching my feelings off just became a habit, I could do it so easily it's sad."
She took all my bad memories and turned them into good ones.
Some deep house music on the beach right now just sounds perfect.
"She only liked the idea that somebody could understand her, but not him, she had no clue who he really was."
"*Calls you at 4 AM* - Wake up and come over, I need to cuddle and sleep."
"I stare at peoples eyes, a lot."
Don't put everything in someone else's hands and complain why you're lonely and depressed after they leave you.
Maybe it's better to just back off and let things happen on their own.
"Let's run away for good, write letters to our parents and just pack and leave, we'll go anywhere."
You can't just expect them to keep holding on when all you're doing is letting go.
Deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
"You shouldn't be too hard on yourself, if they care they will come back."
"Stop talking to people who don't want to talk to you, stop investing your heart into someone who mistreats you. You're better than that."
How come dates like these no longer exist?
Let's listen to The Weeknd and make out.
Let me kiss your neck and whisper in your ears how much I love you.
I'd marry myself to be honest.
"If there is a place where attachment and feelings don't exist, sign me up."
"Stop focusing too much on the negativity that's in your life, it'll only make things worse and it won't stop."
"She wants you to hug her without saying a single word, she just wants to let it all out."
We both wrote the same thing but then we were too scared to press send.
"I don't want you to feel like i'm forcing you to stay, be honest with me and I will respect that."
If you truly cared about someone you wouldn't put yourself in a position that you could lose them in the first place.
"I never wanted to be better than anyone else, I just wanted to be a better version of myself."
"One sided friendships/relationships are just useless, it should always be a give and take kinda thing."
Let me bite your lips and give you hickeys.
I just need someone to go out with at 2 AM without giving me excuses.
"I don't want temporary, I want permanent."
Do you ever want to say something but you'd rather just wait for the other person to say it first?
Her sadness turned into a beautiful mess.
Everytime I look at something pretty she is the first thing that comes in mind.
"Tell me something I haven't heard yet, show me how different you truly are."
"""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"""
I have all the patience in the world when it comes to something I really want.
"I don't like small talk, you either keep the conversation going and interesting or don't even talk to me in the first place."
The fact that someone else can hold you or touch you just kills me inside.
Do you ever think of all the possibilities there are if you met a person in a different time?
A girls reaction when you give her flowers or chocolates is just priceless.
She pushed you away because she wanted you to pull her closer and not give up on her.
"I love all the things she hates about herself, all the small details she tries to hide are just beautiful."
"Be a mystery, it's better than everybody knowing everything about you."
Making someone smile is probably the best part of my day.
"It really costs nothing to be nice to someone, specially when they haven't done anything wrong to you."
"I can handle it when things go wrong, but can you?"
"If they're not there for you when you need them, why even bother sticking around?"
"Don't try to be someone you're not just for the sake of others, be yourself and let them accept you for who you are."
All the time.
Eye contact with strangers will always be my favorite thing.
A place full of people yet I still feel lonely.
Do you ever just want to tell a person how you truly feel about them but you fear rejection so you'd rather just keep your mouth shut?
If you can handle my moody days you're rare and I'm going keep you around for a really long time.
The war I got in my mind is unbearable.
Having someone who understands you is so rare nowadays..
I just hope one day you'd understand what it means to give it all up for one person and get nothing in return.
"I think that whoever is meant to be in your life will always gravitate back towards you, regardless of how far they try to run away."
"Being alone is so addicting once you notice how peaceful it is, no problems no bullshit and most importantly, no fucking drama."
"A girls hair that smells good is such a turn on, God."
I swallowed my pride for you but all you did was let me down.
"Eyes full of pain, hatred and rage. Yet so innocent, beautiful and warm."
"You know how to make me want you, you do it so good you can almost do it with your eyes closed."
"You shouldn't just let anybody enter your life just like that, let them show you why and prove to you they're worth it."
"I should have distanced myself in the first place, but I wasn't smart enough."
You can't blame them for leaving when all you did was push them away.
It's sad how we're never satisfied with who we are or what we have.
But we always have someone to write about.
A place where we can be ourselves without being judged by others around us.
We keep saying that we need to focus on ourselves but the moment someone else is down you just forget about yourself and help them.
A walk in this weather is needed.
"He broke her heart the moment he looked at someone else the way he once looked at her. It terrified her, made her feel worthless."
"But you can't fake how you truly feel about someone, it always just shows from the way you look at each other."
Sometimes you need to stop thinking about other people's feelings and think about yourself and what you should be doing instead.
I suck at expressing how I truly feel because I always think that they should already feel it or at least know how I feel.
You know you're fucked when they're making you mad and they're still the only person you wanna talk to.
"- Go pack. - Why, where we going? - Some place far away from here, where only the two of us exist."
Rihanna / Kiss It Better
"You always wonder if they're ever going to take the first step or not, if they're even interested in you the same way you're interested."
Let's ruin our sleeping patterns together.
"Anxiety fucks us up unintentionally, you feel alone even when you're not and sometimes you don't even know what's wrong."
As soon as you take your headphones off you feel like you entered reality all over again. Feels like shit.
"She hates being compared with anybody, she wants to feel like you're the only one who tells her what you say."
"I appreciate those who try their best not to let the conversation die, you guys are the best."
She tries to hide it hoping you might understand what she's going through.
"Beautiful things are on their way, just wait for it."
"But you don't pick who you fall in love with, it just happens."
Your 2 AM thoughts will be the death of you.
"I want to start over, I want to just close everything and leave it behind me like it never even existed."
You keep saying you're fine and that there's nothing wrong with you when you and I know damn well how you're feeling.
"I don't care how bad you think you are, to me you're nothing but a beautiful creature that I could stare at almost all day."
You try your best while all they do is just make it worse on you.
"It's only a matter of priorities, if someone really wants something they will find a way to make it happen."
"""She's often silent but she's screaming inside."""
"I feel like I could tell you anything, it's a very rare feeling. I like it."
"She knew it from the start, but she stayed quiet and hoped it was wrong."
"She wants whats best for him, and he's too blind to see it. It's such a shame."
It's that part of the night where i want to talk to someone that completely understands what i'm saying.
Reply late to me once and you'll go from 10 to 0 real quick.
Kim Kardashian has a sex tape and Kanye still married her while some of you are still scared to date a girl who had a rough past.
I dont think people understand how stressful it is to explain whats going on inside your head.
"It feels good now but it'll hurt tomorrow, but in a few days it'll get back to normal."
"Relationships are not based on how long you've been together, they're based on the foundation you built together."
I wanna go on a road trip was someone who's fun to hang out with.
"I don't like doing everything, i like feeling appreciated and wanted. If you're unable to do that i'd suggest you start doing it."
This duck is prettier than my life.
"She wants to be fought for, women don't like men who give up easily on them. Show her that she's worth it."
"We goin' to make history together, i promise."
She wants someone who could look at her the way he looked at her the first time he ever saw her.
"It's okay to swallow your pride sometimes, but only when you know it's worth it."
- Why do you make it so hard for me to flirt with you? - Because if i made it easy you wouldn't want to flirt with me.
She wants to be a part of something bigger than herself.
If only you could rewind some days that remind you of how happy you once were..
"Who said it's going to be easy?.. There's not one thing that's actually easy, specially when you're trying to reach something you want."
Let's go to places only we know of.
Nobody knows me like you do.
"You don't need to explain yourself to someone who clearly has no time for you, save your words and shit for someone who does."
"Stop thinking, stop wondering, stop doubting, stop going in circles, it's not worth it."
"You've been on her mind a lot lately, she's too distracted with you in her life."
"If only I had the power to fast forward time just to see if it's worth it or not, sigh."
"It's too hard to handle but at the same time i know it'll change, i don't know if i'm losing patience or losing hope, it's chaotic."
Why does everything just happen all at once? Seriously why isn't there a break in between where i can just be happy for just a while?..
"A little jealousy is cute and all, just don't over do it. It gets annoying."
You'll grow up and realize what you're doing is pathetic and it's pointless.
Nothing's more enjoyable than late night texting with that one special person.
In the mood to cuddle for 3 years or so.
"This summer is going to be good, i can just feel it."
"Her flaws are beautiful, all the small details she tries to hide are the things that define her."
Be with someone who thinks your mess is beautiful.
"God the way she sees me, i could love myself through her eyes."
"Always put your family before anything else, they'll always be there when nobody is."
"You were once her everything, now you're nothing but a moving body."
"Just let it be, it'll happen if it's meant to be."
I'm sick and tired of trying for something that might not even work.
My mood changes every two seconds and this has to stop. Like right now.
"I give too much, that's the problem."
"You're weird, that's what i like about you."
You simply can't hurt somebody who has no feelings to begin with.
I already like you if you reply fast.
Your 11:11 won't come true shut the fuck up.
"I could stare at those eyes all day, they're that beautiful."
This is important to understand.
"No, she's not okay, she's just acting as if she is. I know her too well."
"Alone at night thinking about a way to escape, a way to find freedom, a way to relax, a way to let things out."
I seem to know a lot about people but i don't know a thing about me.
"Yeah, we grew up."
Some people are just not worth the pain and struggle.
I should really stop being there for people since they don't seem to know how to even appreciate it.
"No, don't ignore someone and come back complaining why they're ignoring you now."
Stop having high hopes for something you're not even sure about.
Don't try to hide your feelings and forget that your eyes will speak the truth.
"""Make your life a story worth telling."""
"Tired of people pretending they care and pretending they want to talk to you and want you in their life, yet they make no effort to do so."
"And a man needs to feel that he's wanted for who he is, not for his money or his looks."
When someone makes you laugh when you're moody is by far the best feeling ever.
"If you're not happy with someone just leave, don't waste your time, you have better things to think/worry about."
"I'm the worst human being you can ever meet when i get moody, it pisses me off."
Knowing that you don't mean as much to someone that means everything to you is probably the saddest thing ever.
"I just like staring at people when they do things, call me weird but i get satisfied."
"You just have to deal with the fact that people will change whether you like it or not, it'll happen."
"If he leaves his friends and video games to text you back, you should feel special."
A girls shy face is honestly the cutest thing ever.
"I needed that hug, more than you could ever imagine."
Is it just me or is today such a weird day?
"I needed you and you weren't there, why would i think twice about your existence in my world?"
"She's still lonely in crowded places, she still needs you to make her feel that she exists."
Some people just need to be heard.
"But i'm never forgetting those who stood by my side when i needed to let things out, they deserve the whole world."
Be with someone who makes you happy and will do anything to keep it that way.
"The way she talks about something she likes or existed over, it's like you just want to hold her face and literally eat it. Sigh."
"Her lips were torn from the way she keeps on biting on them, hoping you'd make her stop. It's tragic."
"She changed, the way people let her down and gave up on her made her feel useless, as if she no longer exists in this world."
Some people just don't deserve your kind words.
"Friendship is not about who you spend time with, it’s about who you have the best time with and who's actually there for you."
"There's so much to say, i just can't put them in a sentence to describe it."
A walk on the beach right now with good music just sounds amazing.
El wahed mehtag yesafer w ye2fel 3elakto bel nas hna w ye2fel social media men hayato w yebda2 men awel w gedid.
She stopped tweeting when she found someone she can tell her thoughts to.
She took notes of the things you've done for her so she'd re-read them whenever she feels down.
Her eyes were full of pain that even cheering her up wouldn't do a thing.
A cigarette and coffee with you in bed sounds about right.
"A girls ""whatever"" is stronger than you think."
"Don't get someone attached to you if you already know you won't last, you're just wasting their time and they don't deserve that."
"She just needs a hug, thats all."
Stop blaming all guys just because you've had bad experience with a few of them. Not everybody is the same
Don't you just wish you could spend a whole entire day with someone that means everything to you?
They always miss you when they see you happy with someone else.
"I could literally kill someone if they annoy me to wake up, like either be nice and gentle or die."
Boredom and loneliness is not a good combination.
Break ups always start with heart breaks and ends with revenge.
I always wonder what it's like to be treated the same way i treat others.
"Your sadness isn't going to solve shit, believe me."
"I'm honestly never going to let any of my children go to sleep without a smile on their face, just never."
"Dear parents: wake up and realize that your kids are in pain. Comfort them, please."
Let's go out right now and get pizza and ice cream and just walk like idiots in the middle of the street.
"But no, you're not allowed to come into my life and leave whenever you want, i'm not a highway to comfort."
"There's always a difference in being kind and flirting, don't get them mixed up."
"She was flattered when you held her hand, she felt like she was in a different world, a world where only you two exist."
"You know what turns me on? Effort, show me you care, that you really want me. I'm tired of doubting if people are coming or going."
Dont you just hate it when things turn sour between you and someone you thought you'd always be on good terms with?
"The kind of happiness that words can't describe, amen."
She forgot the whole world the moment you talked to her.
I appreciate instant replies.
"No, don't type while i'm typing, let me finish what i got to say then you're free to talk."
She's still trying to figure out why you hurt her the way you did when you knew she was already a mess.
I try to avoid people as much as possible.
"I do get jealous but i never really show it or admit it, i just keep it to myself."
"I always put them before me, in anything i do i make sure it won't upset them, but i was just fooling myself, i deserve more."
"I've been there for everyone and i never cared about myself, i gave up too much for others, i even sacrificed my own happiness. No more."
"It's time to live, it's time to focus on me and what i want, it's time to be selfish."
"If a girl texts you first just know that she put a lot of thought before time, so don't make her feel like shit."
*Wakes up and starts thinking what i'm going to do today* *Puts head under the pillow and goes back to sleep*
Girls fall for guys who ignore them and guys fall for girls who treat them like shit. What a world we live in.
"And you ask why i don't talk, because if i did, you wouldn't understand what i'm trying to say."
"""I thought i was getting better, but living everyday started becoming harder and harder."""
It's just crazy how music can change your mood in just a second without even noticing.
Most exciting part of my day is when i finally go to bed at night and start creating imaginary scenarios in my head.
"Disappearing from everyone is needed sometimes, it makes you think of yourself and how to solve your own problems."
"Don't fall for sweet words, anybody can use them. But who can actually prove them is what counts."
"Everyone needs that someone that'll tell them ""you're doing the right thing, keep going, you're doing great"" kinda thing."
By accepting that they deserve better.
Not everything you want is always good for you.
Apparently being nice just doesn't seem to work on people.
"Cold as ice, lips so beautiful but eyes full of pain and sorrow. Yet you're still beautiful."
Do you ever listen to a song and remember exactly what life was like when you first heard it?
"Internalized sexism because of masculinity is unhealthy. Let it out, man."
Coffee and you for breakfast sounds good to me.
That feeling when you find out you didn't mean as much to someone as you thought you did and you look so stupid for caring too much.
A car ride with good music is needed right now.
Just think before making any decisions because these decisions will haunt you down for the rest of your life.
I hate ending on bad terms or not having proper closure with someone especially knowing there were so many things left unsaid.
Kind people just don't belong here.
Can i just continue sleeping for the rest of the day?
But what if the things we want aren't good for us?
"Late replies are honestly one of the biggest turn offs of all time, it's like no lol don't even bother talking anymore."
The sweetest things you can do for a girl are the little things that let her know she's in your heart and on your mind.
I really hate being the reason someone else is upset or mad because of what i did.
You know you're fucked when your happiness is in someone else's hands.
Emta ha get happy for no reason bas.
Sadly these people no longer exist.
Maybe one day.
"She doesn't want someone who's cool and famous, she just wants someone who can take care of her and makes sure she's alright."
I honestly just lost all interest in people and how this world turned to be.
"I just feel sorry for how stupid you are, that's all."
"Daily tip: don't pay attention to people who say things to piss you off and try to make you feel like shit, just prove them wrong."
Basically.
Stop wasting your time on people who're clearly too stupid to understand what you're all about.
It's just sad how everyone just drifts away at one point in life.
"Ignore those who ignore you, save your precious time only on people who actually matter to you."
"People just want a relationship because they're lonely, not because they actually like/love that person, kinda sad if you ask me."
It's that part of the night where you want to just put your head under the pillow and forget the rest of the world.
Let's cuddle and tell me everything that's on your mind.
The weather has a huge effect on my mood and I hate that.
Tab leh el nas te3asabak w te2olak enta za3lan leh?.. El howa bgd walahy?
"I always give it my all when it comes to something i want, no matter how hard it is or how bad it may effect me."
Your eyes are something else.
Do you ever just feel ok but you're sad at the same time and you want to hug someone but you feel annoying so you just stay unhappy?
"You certainly don't know me if you think i'll abandon you, i don't just leave unless you've done something that effected me."
You know what hurts so much? When someone made you feel special yesterday but makes you feel like you're a nobody today.
She looks at me hoping one day she'll wake up from her nightmare and see me in front of her.
I'll always write stories about how much you changed me to the person i am today.
She says it doesn't bother her but it just kills her inside.
"Never underestimate the power of silence, never."
Fee eh ya 2016? Betegry besor3a kda leh? Ehdy shewaya.
"You're not the only one who's having hard time, others are actually having harder times than you, so be thankful."
Talking too much is such a turn off.
"Never change for anybody, no one is worth that struggle but yourself."

"Things don't just happen on their own, it's in your hands whether you want it or not, otherwise you're just making excuses."
Do you ever wish you could wake up and find yourself happy for no reason? Cause i really want that.
"It doesn't matter how many times i go down, i'll always find a way back up."
"""She comes off as strong, but maybe she fell asleep crying. She acts like nothing is wrong, but maybe she's just really good at lying."""
It's funny how people change the moment they get what they want.
Life's so much easier and better when you don't give a shit what others think or do.
"Mahu mahadesh mertah f hayato walahy, complaining about it isn't going to make it any better either."
"Nobody has a perfect life, everybody has problems, so just deal with it and do the best you can."
"Never chase after anybody, you're just going to waste your time on useless people, focus on yourself and what you want."
I look at food as if i've never eaten before in my life.
The smallest things are the ones that piss me off the most.
Let me write you poems and put them under your door and hope you can wake up from your nightmare and realize that i'm here.
She deserves everything good in this world.
It's too early to be this bored.
Do you ever wish you could sacrifice your own happiness for someone else?
I need some sort of drug that'll just make me stop thinking for a day.
I don't even have enough energy to talk.
"No matter how tough things get, together we can solve it and go through it, and that's how strong we are."
I could write stories about how much i love you and how perfectly perfect you are.
Don't ever waste your precious tears on somebody who's not worth a dime.
She has no idea how much i love her does she..
"Maybe this is weird, but i really enjoy just sitting and talking to myself all night."
Her eyes are full of sadness that can't be described.
"I'm just too numb, i don't know what to think anymore."
How he treats you is how he feels about you.
"Too much to say, too little to comprehend."
"""Not everyone you lose is a loss."""
"Take a good look at yourself, you deserve better, you deserve to be happy, you deserve to be loved."
"Social media is a relationship killer, believe me."
"I may be hard to deal with, but at least i'm always here whenever you need me no matter where we stand. It's just the way i am."
"I've been just going with the flow lately, nothing ever bothers me anymore, i mean it's cool if it happens and it's also cool if it doesn't."
"We live in a world where people tell you to do whatever you want but once you do it, it's unacceptable to them. It's fucked up really."
"Sweet heart, body language never lies."
"Sleeping it off or changing the subject isn't going to solve the problem, you're only postponing it for later. Fix your shit as it happens."
"If you honestly think making someone else feel bad for your own self satisfaction, you have a problem."

Can the weather just stay like this forever?
"- So how's life? - Hold on, i've gotta overthink about it."
If going out means all you do is take pictures and hold your phones the entire time than whats the point of even going out?
Be grateful for what you have because others are dreaming to be in your position.
She needs someone to hold her and make her feel safe and that you'll be there for her whenever she feels down.
"The more shit that happens to you the stronger you become, you don't lose when life drops you on your knees, you get numb."
It's pointless to explain yourself to someone who doesn't give a shit and will do the complete opposite afterwards.
"Read the whole thing, it's worth it trust me."
"Surrond yourself with people who can encourage you, who can stand up next to you and motivate you to become a better version of yourself."
"I wish i could say it's going to get better, or things are going to get easier but the truth is, it's not. It's just getting worst."
"Her smile just makes me feel like everything's alright, that she's there for me, that she won't abandon me."
Call me over protective but i actually give a fuck.
Stop showing more and receiving less.
I find it kind of sad just walking past someone that you knew for a long time and then you act like you guys never knew each other.

"If you can go a few days without talking to me, go a few more, I'm good."
"Dont talk to me if youre entertaining like 6 other people lol it doesn't work like that, either me or them."
"Cuddles are good for your health, trust me."
"You don't look, talk, touch, text whats mine. It's just that simple."
"""You never apologized for hurting me, but I apologized 12 times for being angry about it."""
"It's funny how people believe anything they hear without even knowing what it is or even the reasons behind it, quite sad actually."
"Focus on your goals and yourself before thinking about someone else, they're not going to do it for you or be there forever."
I really envy people with nice smiles.
Waking up moody or tired is the worst thing ever.
"I respect people who try to solve their own problems by themselves, keep going, you're doing great."
"""The hardest things in life are the ones worth the wait."""
"It's hard to decide, specially when you don't have an answer."
"A lot of people don't even understand the meaning of ""love"" but they think they do. They have no idea what it's like."
"And by the end of the night all you have is yourself, your phone and your bed. That's it."
Having someone who truly gives a shit about you is so rare now it's sad.
I've decided that i'm going to stay happy no matter what life throws at me or what people try to do to stop me.
Be with someone who still looks at you as if they just met you.
"It's nice to find someone who you can talk to every day, all day, no forced laughs, conversations, and attention. It's rare though."
I've already made plans for us before i even met you.
They are just beautiful. #Oscars
"I completely lost all interest in people, they're just a copy paste kinda thing."
"Dont look at my twitter to see how my relationship is going, I could tweet ""i'm so done"" and it's because my internet is down."
I pretend that i'm okay a lot.
Why do parents get mad when you sleep all day like i'm staying out of trouble and i'm not spending your money so whats the issue here?...
"Stay away from those ""friends"" who get competitive and jealous of you and your accomplishments instead of being happy for you."
"Just focus on yourself because only you have the power to change yourself, nobody is going to do it for you."
"Never pay attention to those who try to let you down by saying things that piss you off, they know you're better than them."
"There is honestly no reason to lie to me, i'm too understanding, i get it, I know that shit happens. just be straight up with me."
"My fake smile isn't going to be there forever, one day it'll fall off and you'll realize how i really was from the inside."
"Let's be miserable together, let's be in pain together, it's always better doing it together than doing it alone."
Here's to the women who aren't afraid to date a man who's a work in progress and help build him up. Too many women want a finished project.
"I like it when texting someone becomes a routine, like it's not normal if you don't talk all day it just doesn't feel right."
"I fell in love with her smile, it just brings joy to me."
Guys will feel empty as fuck without a certain girl in their lives but they'd rather say she doesn't matter instead of expressing it.
"""To heal a wound you need to stop touching it."""
It's a great feeling when someone genuinely wants to talk to you and know how your life is going they because they actually care.
Someone you met 2 weeks ago can have better intentions than someone you met 2 years ago. Don't let time fool you.
"You can't spend your best years of your life waiting for someone to love you back. Move on, you deserve better."
Twitter has been boring lately.
It terrifies me seeing you upset.
"Every problem has a solution to it, that's true, but not all problems are bad, some problems are there to tell us something."
Eventually you'll learn how to deal with bullshit and just not get upset about it.
It's the part of the day where you just wish you could lay in bed and close your eyes and wish everything would just end right there.
Deal with yourself before dealing with others. The more you try to escape your own prison the longer you're going to stay there.
"""Her touch made him feel like he's in heaven."""
I tend to talk to myself a lot.
Sometimes it's just best to not think about it and just let it be.
"Problems after problems after problems after problems, it has no end."
"This isn't really going to stop, is it? All the hate and misunderstandings just keep getting wider and wider everyday."
Parents will never realize how hard it is on us to be teenagers in this generation. They think everything is the same back in their days.
Applications are getting more updates than my life itself.
It's sad how social media can turn friends into strangers by just a single tweet/picture they didn't agree on.
"Honestly, people who think they just know everything disgust me, specially when they don't know a single thing about life itself."
But every song has a memory attached to it.
"If only you mind your own business and let people choose whatever they want, this world would be a better place."
Doing something that people said i couldn't do brings nothing but satisfaction to me.
Sometimes i look back and wonder how things would've been different now if i went in a different route in life.
Too much thoughts to put in words.
"Flirting with whats mine? Yeah, you probably have a death wish."
"Daily tip: if someone can fall asleep knowing you're crying, knowing you're hurting or didn't get home safe, they don't care about you."
I dislike people who forget their friends the minute they get in a relationship like what the fuck...
Telling someone that the person they're upset over isn't worth it is probably one of that hardest things to do because they don't listen.
"Let me pull you a little closer, let me love you a little more, let me show you what you're worth."
She though she had it all figured out till you came along and ruined it all.
Be with someone who makes you sit in a crowded room and feel like you are the only two people in the world.
"You'll never know and i'll never say, let's just keep it that way."
"I want fries, lots of fries."
"You either make me the happiest or the angriest guy alive, and that's what i love about you."
Your head is a maze and i'm ready to explore it.
I even got bored of going out.
"You think i don't notice the little things you do, but believe me, those are the first things i look at."
Tell her everything's going to be okay and hold her tight.
Why does everything suddenly come all at once?
"Look closely, you'll see that nobody really gives a shit."
The more you keep shit to yourself the better life you have.
"Mind your own business, don't tell people what you're gonna do with your life or what your plans are. Trust me."
I don't mind spending the entire day in bed. I really don't.
Build a good friendship with everybody. You never know who'll be there for you when you need them.
Everything's been messed up lately.
I get so wrapped up in a world that doesn't seem to exist.
You're not going to achieve anything in life if you're not willing to take risks.
"Relationships can be deadly sometimes with the wrong person, make sure you choose wisely."
"Words are nothing but an empty bottle, empty and useless."
I always wonder what you say about me when people mention my name to you.
"If you're going to leave you might as well just leave now, don't waste my time."
I don't know what sadness is when you're with me.
"It's never hard to try being better than you were yesterday, but it is hard to always stay the same."
That shiver you get when listen to a really nice song..
Years are going by fast as fuck and i don't like it.
Boredom is one of the major problems in my life.
Today is just not my day.  Me everyday.
"Daily tip: be good to yourself, you deserve better."
Nefsi mara asha kda 3ala haga 3edla...
Be with someone that doesn't stop going out of their way to make you happy just because they didn't get what they want.
"Ehna lazem neshoflena hal f howar el ekte2ab da, msh kda walahy."
Staying at home is unhealthy.
The road is lonely but it's worth it by the time you reach the end of it.
You're an obsession.
How good is it when you finally get over something and it doesn't have the slightest effect on your emotions anymore?
"I get the weirdest dreams of all times, seriously."
I enjoy being quite while everyone else is just talking.
"When people criticize or talk negatively about you, it is a reflection of them, not you."
"People think great things come easily. No, they dont. Everything takes time and effort, it's the little changes that make a difference."
Right when you think everything's going well something has to pop out and ruin it all.
Sleep all day and ekte2ab all night.
Theres always something missing when you're not around.

Some people can get treated like shit and never want another person but others can have the world and still want another one it's sick.
"Be nice to a girl and get called khawal, treat a girl bad and they tell you 3ala wad3ak ya mesaytar.  Welcome to Egypt."
All this weather needs is a camp fire and cuddles.
I don't know but i enjoy making people happy more than myself.
You never know whose life you're changing with one small act of kindness.
I prefer to distance myself whenever i’m mad because i become the most heartless person you’ll ever meet.
In a place full of darkness and misery.
She's a keeper if she cheers you up and makes you laugh when you're moody.
Ya bakht el nas el betnam badry walahy.
"No matter how many fights we get into, nothing will make me hate you."
I feel like i'm already tired tomorrow.
Why do problems just come all at once?
Overthinking will be the death of me.
"Don't make plans, let things just happen on their own so you won't be disappointed if they didn't happen."
You can't always depend on someone you know it may not workout. That's just a waste of time.
And by the end of the day all you have is yourself and your thoughts. Nobody else.
She wants to feel like she's the best thing that's ever happened to you.
Daily tip: love yourself.
Ehna lsa f awel shahr men 2016 and i've had enough of it.
I seriously need new people to go out with.
You'll end up really disappointed if you think everyone has the same heart as you do.
I care too much but yet i don't give a fuck at the same time.
Do you ever pretend like you didn’t see something so the other person doesn’t feel embarrassed?
Being told that you’re appreciated is one of the simplest yet incredibly uplifting things you can ever hear.
You're that piece of happiness in my life.
"Everything's gonna be alright, eventually."
"I don't care about losing people who don't want to be in my life anymore, I've lost people who meant the world to me and I'm doing just fine"
"People will make fun of things that they can't do or have, so don't mind what they say."
Watching someone speak to their parents in a bad way is such a turn off.
Never convince or beg someone to treat you the way you deserve to be treated.
Choose people who choose you.
"I don't like talking, i'm more of a listener."
It's really hard for me to stay mad at you.
Trusting people is probably the hardest thing i could ever do.
"I don't mind being silent when you're with me, being beside you is pretty much enough."
You're the best thing that has ever happened in my life.
One day this will all be worth it.
I wish things could go back the way it was in the beginning.
Sometimes it's just better to be quite and let things be.
It's sad that nowadays you can be everything someone ever wanted and still get played.
People need to realize that not everything revolves around them.
"You deserve someone who is obsessed with you, anything less than that just isn't worth your time."
Clean fingernails says a lot about a girl.
I wish people could actually listen to what they say before even saying it.
Nothing good comes easy.
"When you have something in mind that you want to achieve, don't ever let anyone tell you that you're not good enough to do it."
Your ego is destroying everyone around you.
I really dislike people who make a character on social media just to gain fame when they're nothing but wannabes in reality.
Love her the same way you love your favorite song.
A walk in this weather sounds great right now.
I'm really tired of the same routine everyday.
I don't like people that talk too much.
"Sometimes there is no next time, no time outs, no second chances. Sometimes it's just now or never."
Happiness is watching yourself transform in front of your own eyes.
I don't need negative people in my life.
Basically.
Do you ever like stalk someone's twitter and think how great of friends you'd be?
"Honestly, my favorite thing is when people remember the little things I told them, like seriously? you actually listened to me, thank you."
"Don't give up on something you really want. It’s difficult to wait, but it's even worse to regret."
Every weekend is a new disappointment.
"This generation has lost the value of romance, the value of trust, and the value of love. Sadly small talk is the new deep nowadays."
Nobody would probably treat you the way i do.
Here's to all the guys who love their girlfriends unconditionally while she’s still learning to love herself.
"Never get attached to someone unless they feel the same towards you, one sided expectations can mentally destroy you."
People always rush through things and i really hate that. Everything takes time. You didnt grow up in a blink of an eye. Be patient.
"It's never about having the perfect relationship with someone, It's about finding someone who will go through everything without giving up."
A guy is only going to change his ways for somebody he really wants to be with.
I hate that i get pissed about an old situation whenever I start thinking about it again.
"Why are breakfast dates not a more popular thing? like forget the 9 PM fancy dinner reservation, let's go eat pancakes at 9 AM in our pjs."
"I have two moods, either let's do something fun and awesome or let's just lay in bed all day and forget the world exists."
Being short tempered is probably the worst thing about my personality.
I get moody at the smallest most simplest things and it's really pissing me off.
"Not everything is about you or what you want, sometimes you have to see what others want and help them out."
You remind me of every sad and happy song i listen to.
It's pretty pointless trying to explain something to someone who hasn't even been in your shoes.
"Not everyone needs to know everything about you, seriously."
"I see how you look at me, and i like it."
We all have our ways to escape reality.
"Let me guess, new year new you right? Yeah.. you're still a bitch no matter how old you get."
"Be the girl everyone wants, not the one everyone's had."
"My choices are mine to make, not yours. It's my life so who are you to tell me how to live it?"
I really can't wait for this years movies.
1 of 365. I'm glad i spent it with you.
I think i may be the only one exited for 2016...
Let's just hope 2016 doesn't turn out to be worst than 2015.
2015 was basically just full of never ever agains.
"""But the only person i cared about seeing was you."""
- Hane3mel eh fel new years? - Ma3rfsh shoof enta. - Mana kaman ma3rfsh.. - Omal meen ya3raf? - Ma3rfsh bardu.  Story of my life.
People are professionals at finding excuses.
You're in the wrong generation to think forever really exists.
"Well if you can't get someone off your mind, maybe they're just supposed to be there?"
That feeling you get seeing old pictures of yourself with certain people and you realize so much has changed...
"If you ever meet someone who makes your life flow easier and makes you laugh a lot, keep them. That's all you really need."
"One thing i've learned from people is that if they did it once, they'll do it twice."
This is when you know the world is coming to an end.
It seems so hard for people to be themselves nowadays.
Life's too short to be at home wishing for a better life while you could be out there making it a better one by simply trying.
Being polite is attractive.
You're my first priority in everything i do.
When you try to calculate how many people fucked you over this year.
I really hate doctors and hospitals more than anything else in my life.
"You shouldn't worry too much, what's meant to be will happen."
Lately you've got me thinking how someone can be that beautiful.
I woke up in a good mood today and that's kinda strange.
I hate how everything suddenly turned boring.
I need more sleep in my life.
Those hugs where you just don't want to let go. &gt;&gt;
One of the worst feelings ever is not knowing if you've pissed someone off and they're being weird or if you're just being paranoid as fuck.
My new hobbies:  - Switching between the same three apps for hours. - Imagining myself in situations that will literally never exist.
You'd probably be surprised about who doesn't speak to you but speaks about you behind your back.
"I will make you proud one day, dad. I promise."
"You meet so many people, and none of them really mean anything to you. Then you meet one person, and your life is changed forever."
I got trust issues because people got lying issues.
"Everything takes time, it's about being consistent that will get you to where you want."
My father is everything to me in this world.
Everything is becoming clearer everyday.
Because being with you is the key to my happiness.
I couldn't stop staring at how beautiful you were.
"Ba3od fel bet bazha2, banzel bazha2 bardu.. tab a3mel eh tani?"
Fridays are made for sleeping.
I really hate Thursdays now.
It's hard to explain yourself when all the people around you don't even understand themselves.
Surrond yourself with people who want you as much as you want them.
Accurate.
"Isn't it funny how when you need something you never find it and when you don't need it, it's always just there?"
That weird feeling you get in your stomach when you read something you didn't wanna see..
"I'm not sure what's worse, knowing or not knowing.."
I really hate how nervous people make me feel like i can’t even walk in the street without feeling judged or stared at.
"Oh wait, i forgot. That shit is only okay when you do it."
Here's to everyone who's trying to get their life together. Working on yourself is the hardest part in life. The rest comes later.
I'm usually disappointed in myself because I know I'm better than some of the choices I make.
I might get pissed for a while but I’ll never abandon you. I don’t leave people. And that's why it hurts when people leave.
People never learn the easy way. They have to go through shit just to see that they were wrong.
I need to put my feet in the microwave for a few hours.
I'm thankful for everything in my life. Even the bad.
You're a blessing in my life.
"Well she's pretending like she doesn't miss you, and you're pretending like you don't care. Kinda sad isn't it?"
"Just picture her with someone else for a second and if that thought kills you, then do everything you can to keep her."
"I've been doing everything on my own since i was a little boy, so i don't need you or anybody telling me what to do."
I love this weather so much..
Too many images running through my mind.
"If someone's not there for you when you need them, what makes you think they'll ever be there in the future?"
"If you fall for someone who's patient, hold on to them tightly because they'll always wait for you no matter the circumstances."
You're not living the life you're suppose to be living.
"People aren't really going to change, so you might as well just deal with it and learn how to talk their language."
People are so dramatic these days.
"We all have our stories, but just keep it to yourself."
Because people hate what they don't understand.
The difference between boys and men.
I like it more when you're closer to me.
But are you yourself when you talk to me?
Twitter became so boring...
"""I'm gonna be better in 2016."" But wasn't that what you said in the beginning of 2015?.."
Hold on to the person who gives you a reason to smile. Hold on to them tightly.
This weather just makes me want to sleep the whole entire day..
You're too focused on making others happy that you forgot to make your own self happy.
Making you smile is my specialty.
"I still have a lot of people to prove wrong, until then i'm not done yet."
People will always make fun of what they can't have or achieve.
Everything i do with you is a blessing.
I'm losing interest in social media and that's a good thing.
"You can be the most nicest, kindest, down to earth kind of person and people will still fuck you over."
"Not everything works the way we want them to, sometimes you just have to let it be and live with it the way it is."
"You know if you just ignore what others say about you or your life you'll be a lot happier, trust me."
There's a difference between real beauty and makeup. Anybody can look gorgeous with makeup.
You know you're in love when literally every little thing they do is cute and no matter what face they make they always look perfect to you.
"No, i don't hate you. I just lost all my respect for you that's all."
The worst mistake you can ever make is to walk away from someone who actually stood there and waited for you.
Nobody could take your place. Thats the thing.
Hate at first sight.
Everything's been so boring lately.
Listen to your words before saying them.
Tab walahy masr gamila el sobh.
"How hard is it to be nice to someone? How hard is it to tell them ""have a nice day"" or smile or just be nice you know. How hard could it be."
I'm actually happy with the small circle of people i have in my life right now.
"She always thought she was the reason behind your smile, but little did she know, you were smiling at someone else."
Make sacrifices for the ones you love.
Don’t ever let someone make you stop loving yourself just because they constantly tell you you’re not good enough. Fuck them.
"I'm actually happy that i'm difficult to deal with and understand because then I know when someone stays around, they truly want to."
"Pay attention to those little ""jokes"" your friends make about you, those little funny things are how they really feel."
Unexpected surprises in the right time could change your mood for the rest of the day.
Do you ever just get in the mood where you stress about every possibility of where things could go wrong in your life?
"Cheating on a girl goes deeper than people realize. It destroys her outlook on love, her future relationships, and her peace within herself."
I worry too much because i don't stand a chance losing you.
It's just something about you that's so addicting.
People tend to tell you not to do what they do most.
Thursday became one of the worst day of the week to be honest.
Ma3lsh is always the answer to unanswered questions.
We get to choose who we let into our little world.
Don't ever let anyone make you feel bad about yourself. Be confident and stand strong for who you are. You're not weak.
We're too young to be stressed. Too young to be depressed and too young to waste our lives on useless things.
- You can't make everyone happy. - But you can try.
"I don't mind giving you my world, it's all yours. Just give me yours. I promise i'll take care of it."
Something just doesn't feel right when you're not around. It's like something is missing.
"Not everything is meant to be easy, some things take effort, pain, and to put up a fight to reach what you really want."
I hate bothering people who are close to me without even noticing.
I need a 2 or 3 day nap please.
"I'm a really nice person, so if i'm an asshole to you ask yourself why."
I'm down for whatever but only with you.
If i could hold you the whole entire day and not let you got for a second i would.
I just need to figure out what i really want.
Can i just leave this planet?
"It's impossible to find someone who will never hurt you, so go for the one who makes the pain worth your while."
Those relationships where you instantly miss each other right after being together. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Here's a friendly reminder that whatever it is you're going through won't last forever and you're gonna get through it. Trust me.
I'm really boring if i'm not comfortable around you.
"Why is our generation so obsessed with hating love? Be happy, buy gifts and hold hands in public, do whatever the fuck you want.."
Ehna ne pray for Earth b saraha.
Why even bother hanging out with someone who's not even making any effort to see you or make time for you? Such a waste.
Such a disappointment when you defend someone for so long thinking they are different and they turn out to be just like what everyone said..
Worst feeling is being ignored by someone whose attention means everything to you.
"I don't really care how well you used to know me or think you know me, unless you're in my life now you don't know anything about me."
Some girls think they're not attractive because they don't look like the girls that get worshipped on social media and that's unfortunate.
Wouldn't you want someone who's excited to learn about you rather than someone who thinks they already know because of what they heard?
- Parents: you do realize one day you will have to pay for all your things right? - Me: yes but today is not that day.
Kisses on the forehead is such a small gesture yet it's so sweet and meaningful.
Getting a lot of girls isn't something to be proud of or to show off with it. But keeping one is.
Wait... what's wrong with saying omg?
You know when someone stops talking to you and you finally accept that you're not speaking anymore but once they talk you're like wtf?..
She doesn't want to show you that she cares because she doesn't want to do the same mistakes she once did.
"Second chances has never been a problem with me, i usually give 5 or 6 before i realize i was a fucking idiot."
"In a relationship you can't just do what you want, you have to think about the other person and that's something people don't understand."
It's sad when one person is trying to fix things the other is trying to escape and finding a way out.
"Sometimes you just have to admit that you did wrong, that you fucked it up. Nobody is perfect enough to not make any mistakes. Nobody."
"Do you ever ask yourself ""why am i the way i am""?"
It's funny how strangers seem to know when something is wrong with me more than my actual friends.
Twitter became a television show for those who have nothing better to do but to make fun of others. It's quite sad really.
How a person reacts to your sadness says a lot about how long they’re going to be in your life.
We all see things differently.
Sorry but i'm not really interested in temporarily bullshit.
Your girlfriend should be your woman and your brother at the same time.
It's nice when the person you're with posts a picture of you or both of you together just to show that they're proud to have you.
A true friendship is when you walk into their house and the wifi connects automatically.
"I'm the type of person who will be there for you even if i'm angry at you, got my own problems or sleeping."
"Self reminder: you're still young and you're not suppose to have your whole life figured out yet. Don't stress, everything will work out."
I don't mind ignoring every one of them because i only want you.
If you truly love someone being honest and faithful is more than easy. There shouldn't be any secrets.
"But in reality all women are crazy, so you better just pick your favorite type."
When you think your selfie was good but then you stare at it for too long and you realize it is actually the worst picture ever.
"Don't ever be the man to ask a girl where she wants to go, you make the plans and decide where to go."
You know what i like about people? Nothing.
No stress November would be nice.
I really love this.
Do you ever just want to stare at someone's face forever?
"The more difficult the person is to get closer to, the better the prize when you get them."
"Family always comes first, no matter how bad/good things are."
"I hate it when my best friend tells me she's hanging out with another friend, like bitch i get friendjealous you're only mine."
"The favorite button only changed, not your life. Calm down."
Have you ever been so attracted to someone that you can actually feel it driving you insane?
"She'd cry, and get over it, she'd hate you, and love you again, But one day she'll leave, and she won't come back. Thats when you messed up."
"""Fall in love with someone that doesn't make you think that love is hard."""
I need a 2 or 3 hour long hug.
Ironic how people get mad when you treat them the same way they treat you.
Brittany Murphy appreciation tweet.
"No matter how much effort you put in, some people just won't appreciate shit."
"Yalla enzelo ba2a bel ""omg October is finally finished?"" ""Hello winter?"" ""It's finally November"" ""2 months till 2016"" w kda y3ny."
But i kinda find myself wanting more of you everyday.
I hate those moods where you don't really know whats wrong but you feel really irritated with everyone and everything around you..
Always remind yourself that things are never that deep and to keep it moving with or without people.
One of the greatest feelings in the world is when someone openly tells you how much you mean to them. It's just so rare now.
Do you ever just lay in bed and blank out for a while and think about everything and everyone around you?
The reason i get so mad is because the shit people do to me know i wouldn't do the same to them.
I'm running out of people to like.
You're too beautiful to be this sad.
But you can't buy love with money.
"I don't even bother arguing anymore, i'm just like ""Yea ok whatever lol"""
When people treat you like they don't care believe them.
Phones are getting bigger but our minds are getting smaller.
Why is it that we always wait for the things that won't even happen?
Please pray for my grandmother. She has kidney cancer. :s
Don't live a life that doesn't really belong to you.
"Shit happens all the time, get used to it and get over it. Don't complain about it all day."
You went from worth it to worthless real quick.
Some people need an award for being so fake. I'd probably think something is wrong with them if they try being real.
I'm so not ready for 2016.
"You loved me when i couldn't love myself, and that's something big to me."
I mostly put people before me and it's all great till they fuck me over.
People are just too boring. They no longer interest me.
But i don't need anyones acceptance to be happy.
I don't like it when someone else has your attention.
One day they're in love with you the other they're hating on you. Oh well.
Because things aren't how they used to be and they never will be.
People will tell you to stay out of their business but they have the right to stick theirs in yours right? How to be a hypocrite 101. Nice.
Does someone ever say something to you and it just sticks with you and impacts you in such a weird way and you constantly think about it?
That feeling when you just can't get enough of a person.
I'm just wondering what's next. What does life have to offer now?
She's up all night trying to think of something to say to you.
"Don't try to hide it, it'll get worse. Let it all out."
But honest people aren't going to tell you it's gonna be okay.
You know what's real happiness? Being accepted by your parents. Them telling you that you did good and that they are proud of you.
My attitude just really depends on how you talk to me or what mood i'm in.
La howa kol yom ta2reeban doesn't feel right.
"My temper is so fucking annoying, one second i'll snap at you and the other i'd regret what i said and feel like shit."
Don't ask about my opinion when you already know the answer.
I need to start doing something new in my life.  - Says to myself everyday.
Love is haram in Egypt.
"I hate when people bring up old shit, like just move on already, you won't go back to when it happened."
Right?
Is it just me or today just doesn't feel right?
I just love it when people are smiling but they try to stop smiling but they can't.
Boredom and loneliness isn't really a good combination if you ask me.
It's not complaining when you've had enough of everything around you.
If only people really understood how hard it really is to want someone so bad but you can't have what you always want.
"""Romance has killed more people than Cancer, maybe not killed but dulled more lives. Removed more hope and caused more tears."""
"Don't believe rumors, ask their best friends before assuming anything. They know more."
I like feeling pain. Call me a psycho but it just feels good. Soreness and pain are my two favorite feelings.
Sometimes it's alright to be wrong.
You really don't know what love is till you actually can't go on a day without thinking about that person for a minute.
Because eventually distance ruins everything.
Do you ever look at someone and literally feel that your heart is melting because you love them so much?
"""Msh fahem"" basically describes my life."
"No, it's not easy to talk and to say how you feel. Don't ever tell me that, just don't."
But you can't jump from someone to an other just like you do with songs...
"I don't really care who tries to flirt with you, i just care about what you say to them."
Because cursing in English is more polite than cursing in Arabic.  - Egyptian logic.
I don't speak much unless I've known you for a long time and feel comfortable around you.
Let's take a walk in this beautiful weather and talk about running away.
Because everything is peaceful at night.
"I knew better, but i did it anyway."
"I'm sorry if I have trust issues, but when you give someone everything and they toss it away like nothing, you'll understand how i feel."
"If you find someone that is willing to go through hell just to keep you happy, don't ever take them for granted."
"Life may not be perfect or fair for you, but you still have to eat the shit and be thankful, you're better than a lot of people out there."
"Do you ever just think about the first time you met someone, and compare it to where you guys are now and be like wow what happened?"
"I have my reasons, but it doesn't mean i have to tell you what they are."
But i don't mind losing everybody..
"I know your weakest points, but i don't use them because i know how it feels to be beaten up."
But at least I've found out a lot about people.
"On a side note, I love all of you."
"If you don't have friends, be your own friend."
- What do you wanna do in life? - I wanna make people happy.
Be with someone who understands that you have flaws but doesn't try to change them instead makes you love yourself more.
The more you make plans the more likely they'll be ruined by something stupid.
"""She loved mysteries so much that she became one."""
But education isn't going to ever teach you how to love yourself.
There's always a person you had feelings for ever since you met them.
Sitting at home makes me depressed.
Is it weird that i don't really get along with people? It's like it doesn't really matter what they say or do anymore.
"Do you honestly think you'd get away with a lie? If it's not told now, it'll be told sooner later. Trust me."
Well at least i don't disrespect anybody just because i don't agree with them.
When was life ever fair for you to talk about unfairness.
Well... being alone gets boring.
Because i'd never get bored of hanging out with you.
"Nothing comes easy, literally nothing."
It's scary how someone can bring all the happiness in your life and the moment they leave they just take it all away with them.
Do you ever just get tired of telling someone how to treat you so you just stop talking to them?
"If you can't even treat your ex with respect, than you're too childish to even date."
This is how you keep her.
I'm not even sure who's real anymore.
"It's just sad that being yourself nowadays is considered as an outsider, you have to be just like everybody else just to fit in."
I need at least 1 million dollars just to go shopping.. seriously.
Leh wahda momken thot full makeup fel gym tyb ana msh fahem..
I just care about other people's happiness more than mine to the point that i forgot how to make myself happy.
Caring too much just ruins everything.
Maba3rfsh anam gher w ana hatet eedy taht el makhada..
"I'm in my own little circle, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon."
"I'm not even sure what the word ""fine"" means anymore."
"While everybody is at home wishing, wanting, and hoping for it, you're out there making it happen. Just remember that."
You speak fluent bullshit.
When was the last time you actually smiled and felt happy?
"If you just think for a second or two before pressing that send, a lot of things would've been better."
It just takes the right song to make it all better.
You're lonely and you cry yourself to sleep every night right? That's alright. Don't be ashamed of that. You're getting stronger.
Be friends with yourself. It's more important.
"I'm actually glad i've lost a lot of people, i get lazy to text back sometimes."
- Late night tex... - Shut the fuck up.
"I never forget what anyone did to me, whether it's good or bad."
I'm not even sure what happiness means.
"If it doesn't happen now, it'll happen later. What goes around comes around, just keep that in mind."
Don't go in a maze with someone who knows his way back.
"I have a problem with not trusting people, i get easily fooled."
Everything is just boring if i'm not doing it with you.
"Stop saying it's fine, it's not fine."
I would love crowded places if only people don't stare at me and pretend i don't exist.
Could you just kindly fuck off?
We live in a world where people try their absolute best just to look good in front of people.
Because people eventually forget about you and all the things you've done.
She'd do anything just to put a smile on your face.
Let's write a book about all the places we want to visit someday.
Are you really happy? Or are you just saying that?
"Think before you speak, that's just one common mistake everybody seems to be a master at."
It's sad how someone could stab you in the back even though you never did anything wrong to them.
Because once you lose them they'll start talking about you.
"No, you don't need acceptance from people. You just need to accept yourself."
"Just give it a few months and people will say ""hurry up summer""."
You know it's a good day when you wake up in a good mood and slept enough.
I feel sorry for people who think making fun of someone on social media makes them look cool...
"A girls necklace, earring, anklet and bracelet says a lot about her."
She stalks you because she only wants you for herself.
Because being fake is the new trend.
Do you ever just look at someone and be like how am i that lucky to know someone like that?
Howa ana leh 3ala tool ta3ban w 3ayez anam?...
Imagine how our babies would look like..
Dramatic people literally kill me alive.
When she wakes you up because she's bored and lonely. &gt;&gt;
"I love airports, seeing people happy and tears of joy just makes me happy. It's also kinda sad because you see a lot of goodbyes."
This weather is heavenly.
"Maybe you don't like me, maybe you do.. question is, will it matter? What difference will it make?"
- Where you going? - Wherever life takes me.
Sitting there hoping one day everything will change isn't going to change it. But doing something about it will.
Because silence speaks for itself.
Don't underestimate anyone. You never know what their intentions are.
"Don't compare me with anybody, i know my ups and downs more than you do."
You call this a life?..
Do you still remember the first time you ever saw him?
"No, i never take back what i said. Because at one point or an other it was exactly what i meant."
Because every song comes with a memory attached to it.
She fell in love with the wrong person.
"I'm never surprised anymore, i've already seen it before."
It's just the same shit over and over again.
Easy come easy go.
"I admire people who try to be good, not for others but for themselves."
"Not everything will always go the way you plan it, but at least you've tried to make it work and that's what really matters."
Dont ever go after somebody who won't at least meet you half way.
Every time i try to build something it ends up being destroyed by something stupid.

How deep is your love ya bet?
"How to get a boyfriend: Be skinny af, tumbrlish, curse a lot, smoke, get high with guys, write deep tweets, be famous on instagram. Lol."
"How to get a girlfriend nowadays: have abs, a beard, be tumblrish, good grammar, write deep tweets, be famous, act cold, don't give a fuck."
Being an asshole is the one way ticket to being cool nowadays? I lost hope for this generation lol.
"I hate waiting, if i want something i want it now or else i don't want it at all."
Well at least it's better than ending up with somebody who has a poor personality.
I try my best but it seems like not even my best is enough.
I'm just bored of being bored that's all.
You keep telling yourself that you're different than others but in fact you're just like the rest.
"Just because you're attractive doesn't mean you could get anybody you want, you got it all wrong."
Take her out on a date to the ahwa.
- Ana ze2ht men el bet yalla nenzel. - Yalla. *Nenzel w no3od f makan* *1 hour later*  - Yalla nerawah el malal da..

Do you ever just look at somebody and you could tell everything from their ways of looking at you?
I'd sleep a lot easier if you were here.
Is it even possible to stay happy for a full day nowadays?
Do you want it as much as you wanna breathe? If not then you're not doing it right.
"I don't know what's wrong, but at the same time i don't know what's right."
"You don't need people to understand you, you just need to understand yourself."
Maybe we're just far away from home.
Because nobody can replace you.
I don't really remember the last time i wasn't sleepy..
A persons attitude says a lot about them.
Do you ever just get a headache from life?
"Getting addicted to someone is easy, but whether that addiction is good/bad thing, is your responsibility."
Maybe she just needs a shoulder to lean on and somebody to talk to.
"Some girls would probably agree/disagree with a guy just because of his looks, it's just sad."
"I miss those days when the word ""friends"" actually had a meaning."
But when it comes to somebody who's famous or attractive they totally stand beside them even if they were wrong. Eh.
If people don't agree/like what you said they just either make fun of you or try to prove you wrong. It's like your opinion doesn't matter.
Twitter now basically just talks about who's right or wrong. Freedom of speech no longer exists. Kinda sad.
"Just because you simply don't agree with somebody doesn't make them wrong, they don't have to agree with your point to be right."
Life would probably have no meaning without you.
"Maybe not everything is meant to turn out right, maybe sometimes you need to struggle and fight through it to actually turn things around."
Friday is not Friday if you wake up and your body is not into broken pieces and your lazy to even move your arms.
Am i the only one that gets really nervous in the streets when people stare at me and i automatically start walking really fast?
Because i like how only you know everything about me.
"I actually enjoy talking to myself, not ashamed of admitting that either."
Looking at old pictures and old things you've had when you were young just makes you sad how everything really turned out to be.
Cairo streets at 4 AM are heavenly man.
People only seek happiness for themselves. They won't care if you're happy or not.
I try my best to cover it and make it sound like there's nothing wrong when basically there's nothing right.
There's just so much going on in my head that i get lost trying to write them all down.
"I've got so much plans, just wrong timings."
Are you the person you always wanted to be?
"I still hate myself for making you cry every night, knowing that i hurt you one time just haunts me down."
"Not everything always goes your way, sometimes you gotta try different routes to actually get somewhere."
"I don't usually care about anything/anyone, so if i care about you or what you say, you should feel special."
I don't like the fact that days are just passing by so quickly and i'm not really achieving anything. It's frustrating.
Just because he retweets/favorites your tweet doesn't mean he likes you.
Whenever a nice song comes on i just automatically think of you. It's like i can't even control it.
"I can see the tears coming out of your eyes, but i'm going to need you to stay strong for a while. At least for me."
Answer me sarcastically and i'll leave you laughing.
We're just lonely souls looking for someone to complete us.
Maybe if you stop talking and actually start doing you'd get somewhere.
Don't underestimate the power of two people that are in love. They know how to fight for each other.
I got a war in my head that only you got the solution for.
"People don't know the true power of loneliness, you get to secretly see every detail in everyone around you."
I just wanna lay down and stare at the sky while listening to music.
"Don't get fooled by how people are nice to you in the beginning, you can turn around and they'd stab you right in the back."
"I dislike people who try to show themselves to people that they are good on social media, and in reality they're just a bunch of assholes."
"You're like a TV show, i wouldn't mind watching you the whole day."
If only people minded their own life and their own business this world would've been a better place.
The more you actually accept yourself is the moment others accept you.
"We get closer and closer everyday, i like that."
Because nobody has to know what we do.
Life without social media just feels great man.
When she takes care of you like a mother who just got her first new born is when you know she's the one.
The way she looks at him.
"Her smile just makes me realize how life is worth living, damn."
Because i'm the type of guy that'll spend his last penny in his pocket just to make you happy.
Thumbs are important in holding hands.
How my prediction turns out to be right scares me sometimes.
Am i the only one that actually likes summer and wants it to stay?..
Just the though of you smiling makes me smile.
But what if forever exists?
Spending time with you is priceless.
"No matter how tired i am, i'll always push myself till i can't move anymore. I have no limits."
"And when you can't find your friends, you end up finding yourself."
You have to have an image of what you want to become before you start doing something. That way you'll wake up every morning with a goal.
I believe in you. I believe you could prove me wrong and show me that someone can still take care of me.
Because you'll always be the main character in my book.
You could never imagine how much you mean to me.
"You don't get to use me no, i'd let you think you are but i'm the one who actually is. You don't play with people who created the game."
Gotta love how twitter is active when i'm too busy for it and when i'm on it i don't see a single person on my timeline.
"The more you ask, the less you get. The more you appreciate what you have, the more you get."
Give advice to yourself before giving it to others.
"I kinda got used to everything, so nothing barely effects me anymore."
"I don't like where this world is going, i honestly don't."
"People just took being fake to a whole new level man, it's just pathetic."
"I wouldn't really mind staring at you the whole day.Matter of fact, i'd love to."
"Being happy is rare nowadays, so whenever you're happy make the best out of it."
"You only call me when you need something, that's cool. I'll just answer you back when i don't have anyone left to talk to. We're even."
"Problem is i forgive too easily, you could piss me off and by just 1 word i'd forget you ever did anything."
Making you smile is the least i could possibly do.
Thing's don't just get better unless you do shit about it. Don't just sit there and wait for the world to change. Cause it won't.
"The word ""complicated"" basically describes my entire life."
"I'm not your ""fun time"" kinda person you talk to whenever you're bored."
"Same words, just different people."
"People who make you laugh are just a blessing, seriously."
"Don't ever say something unless you truly mean it, otherwise the meaning of it just vanishes away and you're just wasting the persons time."
Let's just take a moment and appreciate the beauty of tattoos and piercings.
I honestly need a new life.
"I'm sorry, but you don't just come and go whenever you please, no. I'm not a toy you leave when you get bored."
"""What am i doing in Egypt"" is the question i ask myself everyday."
It's funny how everything just comes all at once.
A girl can easily forget something that happened a week ago but won't forget the girl that flirted with you 3 years ago.
The only reason i go on twitter is because i'm bored and i got nothing better to do.
"Even if you're joking, people can be offended and not tell you. But in fact they're in pain from what you said."
"Think before you say something, that little word could break a person into pieces so be careful."
Do you ever wish you could just rewind a day or even a moment in your life that made you so happy?
Because life is just all about risk taking.
Because food brings happiness.
Call me old fashion but what's mine is only mine; therefore you don't look/touch/communicate with what's mine unless you ask me.
As much as i really hate social media i end up coming straight back to it.
"Am i the only one that gets really exited over new food in the house?... It's like ""omg new food, i'm gonna taste this today"""
I live in a world that nobody really understands and i'm not planning on changing that either.
"What real friends? Everybody just wants what's fun and and good for them, they don't care what you want or what you think.."
"It's kinda sad really when you're there for a person and always supporting them and shit, then they turn out to be cunts."
"Nah i get enough bullshit from life, i don't need yours too."
"I had a dream everything got better, but then i woke up and realized it was just a dream."
"I like it when you tell me everything, just makes me more comfortable for my next move."
She just wanted a way out of loneliness.
If making you smile is a hobby then that's all i'll do.
Because i just want you to be happy. That's all that really matters.
"People took drama to a whole new level, seriously."
"It's just sad, thinking something good is going to happen and you get all exited over but it turns out to be the opposite."
"Talking about disappointments, i don't even remember the last time i was actually happy."
Never make plans for something you're not even sure it'll happen because you'll be really disappointed if it didn't happen.
"- What happened to freedom of speech? - You're in Egypt, there's no such thing, if people don't like what you say they'll make fun of you."
"I really wanna take selfies and all, but i just look like shit."
"Oh, im not fighting back that's for damn sure. I'm just going to watch how stupid you really are."
Is it just me or is August the worst month of the year?..
I fell in a hole that has no way out.
"You forgot to appreciate, and i forgot to care. So that makes us even."
Don't act cold with someone who's a master at it. Just don't.
"When people use you, use them wiser."
"You tell people you're fine, but inside you're just torn apart."
"Things and people are fading away. People are changing, things are changing. Question is.. is it to the good or bad? I ask myself everyday."
Repeatable pain.
"The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory."
I don't mean to be rude but you're really not giving me any other choice.
"Talk behind my back, because that's all your good at. But i'm glad you are. Just proves me i'm better than you'll eve be."
Because either way people will find the truth about you sooner or later. You ain't gonna hide in the dark forever.
"Being an innocent person on social media just to get followers while you're the complete opposite in reality doesn't make you ""cool""."
It almost feels like the more i do the less i gain i don't know why.
"Try being yourself for a change, stop trying to impress and fake your personality."
The fact that i do everything for people and i don't ask for anything in return is gotta come to an end.
"A girls ""i hate you"" usually means ""i love you"" just depends what level you're on with her."
I honestly need to just sleep for a few days and just forget about life for a while.
You've made me tell you things i've never told anyone before.
"I don't get it, what's with people nowadays? If you don't like something why don't you go change it other than just complaining about it?"
I really want a baby monkey.
What feelings?.. I've lost those a long time ago. You're a bit too late.
If only you could fast forward time so you could know if it's all worth it in the end or not.
We're just entering a new chapter in life. It's just the beginning.
"I even miss her while i'm with her, how is that even possible."
It saddens me how 70 year old people have more will power and energy to do things more than teenagers nowadays.
"""I can't change, even if i tried, even if i wanted to."""
Tool manta mashie wara kalam el nas 3omrak mahatkon mabsut.
"Too naive, too fucking naive."
Change is needed.
"She has a smile of an angel, but a heart of a devil."
Do not do what you won't accept other people do to you. It's really that simple.
"You forgot to say ""what goes around comes back around."""
"Just because we talk doesn't mean we're friends.. no, we just know each other. There's a difference."
Everyday the same time i ask myself why am i still awake.. sigh.
"I don't feel well, i don't even remember the last time i did."
If only you see the truth about people from the first time you see them.
"I mean, let's be honest. Some people piss you off by just looking at them."
You should've done it when you had the chance.
Can we just start over and forget about what happened?
The weeknd - Angel.
"Our hands fit together perfectly, how is that hard to understand?"

I can see every word you're trying to hide in your eyes. So don't.
But damn words come out of your lips straight in my heart.
"""I love him but i won't text him first"" girls logic smh."
"Sad but true, seems like everyone is just copy paste."
"I really love sleeping early and waking up early, but it just rarely happens."
She's that key that opens many doors.
It's just too hard to not look at you and smile.
Is everything a joke to you?
She's up all night wondering what to text you just so you could spend some time together.
Those type of hugs. &gt;&gt;
Bandages don't fix broken hearts though.
"You lost interest, that's cool. But when i reach what i want, trust me. You'll come straight back."
Now's the best time to literally take a walk.
"Let me drawn between your arms, hold me tight and tell me everything's gonna be alright. Tell me you're gonna be there when nobody will."
The only reason i know that we're going to make it is because we never really give up on each other.
"Her hair smells like roses, her skin was soft as silk."
While you're too busy trying to find a way to break me i'm too busy finding my way to the top. Let's see who gets where first.
"Don't ever depend on other people no matter what, always have a second plan, and a second solution."
"""There's a saying that when life knocks you down, try to land on your back because if you can look up, you could get up."""
I've been down that road so many times before.
"Tell me, can anyone else make you feel the way i did?"
People who keep the conversation going are keepers.
I love it when you call me unexpectedly. It makes me happy how much you think of me and how important i am in your life.
Do you ever just repeat a part of a song over and over again because you only like that part of the song?
Cairo at 6 AM is just beautiful man.
"""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."""
"Cause babe, you're the only reason i wanna stay up late and talk all night."
Ladies who take care of their men and make sure everything they do is correct and look out for them. You're doing it right.
"Be your girlfriends number 1 fan, take pictures of her, ask her to take pictures with you, encourage her. That's how you truly win her."
"""Because i'm used to being used."""
If only you could go back in time and fix everything you've done or said wrongly. Damn.
Do you ever just wonder what's gonna happen next?
"Take it slow, take it step by step, rushing it might crash you, not combine you."
"He walked with his head down knowing he hurt her, it killed him so softly he barely felt what's around him."
"You can kill, smoke, drink alcohol, curse, and kidnap in the street but you can't kiss or hug in public? What a fucked up world we live in."
It was never about being happy. It was always about how far we've came.
"Let's just be honest here, if it was easy everybody would've done it."
"Because every time you fail, you learn something, you gain something. That's a step forward, not backwards."
Why don't you make a decision that you're not going to be the same person you were yesterday? Why don't you start?
"They tell you forever doesn't exist, but are you ready to prove them wrong? Because i'm all in."
We fell so many times on our faces to the point that we forgot what pain feels like.
There's just so much that eyes could tell that words can't even express.
The amount of brain washed people in this world is just so tragic man.
3 AM walks are just the best.
"Come to think about it, will it really matter 10 years from now?"
"Just because something is good doesn't mean it's good for you, just saying."
"Believe me, if i wanted you to look like shit i would've done that ages ago. But i'm just mature enough to keep shit just between us."
Looking back to where it started and how far we've come is just breath taking man.
"You don't just text me and reply to me whenever you feel like it, no."
My i don't care game is strong as fuck tho.
"You know my weak side, so please don't use it against me."
If only you see how beautiful you are in my eyes.
"It's the places and memories that haunt you down, not the person."
"Last thing i need is someone telling me i can't achieve this or i can't do this, because i'll always prove you wrong."
The only reason that's keeping me going is that i know one day it'll all be worth it.
"Nobody would ever care like i do, just put that in your head."
"I'm not what people say i am, either hear it from me or it's not true."

"This boredom is eating me alive, literally."
"""If only, what if, but"" are the 3 simplest words yet so frustrating."
"Our minds eat us alive and we're not doing anything about it, it saddens me."
Seeing people smile and happy just makes me feel so good it's comforting.
"She smiles at you with a broken heart and you don't have the eye sight to even see it thru her eyes, what did you expect?"
"Be real careful who you trust and open up to, you can't tell who's real and who's fake now. Everybody suddenly became a professional actor."
I've been disappointed so many times this year i lost count.
"Opinions are subject to change and it's normal to see some things differently after a while, it doesn't make you a hypocrite."
It's disappointing how they tell me i judge people when they're the ones judging me.
"So i'm racist, uneducated and disrespectful. How nice of people to think of me this way when they don't even know how to say my name."
Respecting women says a lot about a man.
"You're all that matters, that's all i know."
There's nothing left to do.
It's funny how people you knew spread rumors and lies about you faster than an volcano's eruption though honestly.
The amount of drama and immaturity is hilarious.
"You wanna do something you go do it, don't just sit there and complain about how everything is standing in front of you, just no."
"Everybody just wants change but they don't wanna change themselves, how is that even possible."
Because you'll always be my number one priority.
"There's a huge difference between being a gentlemen and wearing a suit bruh, just because you're wearing one doesn't make you one."
"Be with someone who tells/wants you to become a better person, not just someone who wants you to be like them in everything they do."
Do you ever just get tired of the same fucking shit everyday to the point that you don't even have anything left to say?
"Everybody is looking for someone to put back their broken pieces, but have you tried to fix your own self? Because i'm sure nobody else can."
You're that light everyone looks for in a cave.
"Nothing really comes easy, if you're not willing to work hard for what you desire then you might aswell kiss it goodbye."
Why is everything so boring nowadays?.. it's like an endless circle that has no way out.
Pushing people away only makes me realize if a person is truly a friend or just an other fake one.
"Disappearing may be the solution to your problems, or the reason behind your depression. It's yours to figure out."
Seeing my parents upset or depressed is just a huge downfall for me.
When music doesn't change your mood anymore just know it's serious.
I'm just not in the mood to do anything lately.
Because tweeting at night is better than tweeting in the day time.
- Don't give up. - Why? I don't see a reason not to. - Because i'll be that reason.
If she chooses you over an outing you better be thankful for her existence.
Maba2ash leya nefs a3mel ay haga f hayaty msh 3aref leh.
"Eat more, talk less."
Seeing someone better than you should give you enough motivation to become a better person.

"Appreciate her like she appreciates you, she was never your slave that bought happiness in your life. Some appreciation is needed."
"I like listening to music with my eyes closed, so i could imagine a nice peaceful world on my own."
"It's just so pathetic how fake some people are nowadays, and what's funny is they show other people that they're angels sent from heaven."
"Life is tough as fuck right now and everything feels like fading away and breaking apart, but it will get better i promise."
"- Tell me something. - What? - How do i make you feel when i hold your hands? - I feel protected, safe, and it feels like home."
"When people think you care, prove them why you don't."
I've seen your worst and i still thought it was beautiful.
Let's lay in bed all day and just sing our favorite songs out loud.
My mind goes insane when i hear your name coming out of someones else's lips.
A part of me had enough.
"Admitting your mistakes doesn't make you weak, admitting them and changing them is what truly makes you a man."
People's true identity really does show once you lose them. You start seeing who they really are.
Howa ta2reeban ana el waheed el msh fel sahel.
"I hate being moody, makes me just hate everything/everyone around me."
And suddenly i forgot how to care.
"If it doesn't happen now, it'll happen later, just don't give up easily."
Do you ever just fall in love with the same person all over again?
Sitting in front of the beach and listening to some music is all i really need.
Some people need to be noticed for their beautiful minds.
Twitter is boring so i wanna follow some new people! Favorite this and i'll check your profile.😌
Meeting the right people just takes time that's all.
Because both of our hearts fit perfectly together.
"There are 3 times of people in summer; those who are partying, those who are home doing nothing, and those who are just in bed depressed."
I just wanna lay my head on a pillow and close my eyes and just forget everything/everyone around me.
Because pain and i became bestfriends.
Emta pa2a el summer peta3ty tebegin ana kaman? :s
It's never too hard as long as you truly want it.
One day you'll grow up and realize how stupid you sound right now.
"Let them ignore you now, but once you reach a point they're going to crawl back to you like ants."
Her mind were full of waves and i drowned in them.
El nas kolaha hatsafer w ana ha3od f bety y3ny? Ok.
You have no idea how i feel when our eyes stare at each other.
Maybe i'll just follow my own shadows.
I haven't been stable for a really long time.
"I thought you were different, but i guess i was wrong so i apologize."
It's so rare finding someone who'd always be there for you no matter what condition they're under.
"People who act friendly and nice just to get what they want from someone, why do you even exist?.."
Wake her up every morning and remind her how beautiful she is.
I have a talent of getting bored of everything.
Do you ever just wish you could sleep for a whole entire day?
"I need to travel, i need to smell the fresh air in front of the beach while listening to music and just letting everything/everyone out."
Do you ever just sit at night and think of all the things you could be doing but you can't?
A fresh start is never too late.
She broke down in front of you because she felt safer with you.
Parents should've told you that not all love stories are real sweet heart.
Because i don't feel like interacting with human beings anymore.
I'm too nice to people that's the problem.
"Go ahead and talk behind my back it's all good, but just remember that you'll always belong ""behind my back""."
How could anyone have someone like you and still ask for more that's what i don't understand.
"But that's alright, i never give up for a second till i achieve what i want, even if it breaks me in half."
I don't know anymore.. It's like i'm trying my best yet it feels like i'm doing nothing. Sigh.
"Don't give your attention to those who seek it, give it to those who deserve it."
Because you're the reason behind her happiness and sadness.
"Why do parents always think that we never run out of energy and that we're also humans?... I mean, we also get tired you know?"
Everything just became exhausting.
She's just beautiful inside out. She makes a man wonder how could someone like that even exist.
I need to go out with people who don't hold their phones when we're together.
"If only people knew how long they're exactly going to live for, they'd appreciate and be thankful for what they have. And enjoy their life."
3awez anam w msh 3awez anam.
"There's just something different about you, i like that."
Because being a gentlemen never gets old.
You and i against the world.
What's funny is that people always end up what they say they would never be.
"People disappoint me everyday, and you expect me to believe a word you tell me? Nah, that's not how it works. Prove it please."
When you just can't get enough of someone. &gt;&gt;
Because being normal is too mainstream.
"When you broke down i didn't leave you, just remember that."
Is it just me or does it feel like everyday is on repeat?
Her voice echoed in his ears whenever she called his name.
You get use to it sooner or later.
"Because ""msh 3aref"" is the answer to everything."
Fee nas kda awel mabetshofha betkun 3awez tedarbha men gher ay sabab.
Because you're the light in the dark room that shows me directions.
I'm physically and mentally tired of everything around me it's overwhelming.
Fake people everywhere.
Not sleeping became the new trend.
Because she brings out the light in me.
He was her shelter when nobody else was.
Life is just so unfair in so many levels.
It's so frustrating when you plan for something and get all exited over then suddenly one small thing ruins it all.
I'll put up a fight for you.
"Once you put it in your mind, you can overcome pretty much everything."
"Protect her, be there for her, take care of her, sweet talk her, tease her, pamper her, spoil her. It's not as hard as it sounds trust me."
"There's a difference between liking ME and liking what i write. Don't get it mixed up, what i write isn't even 10% of me."
I lost interest.
"Ever just look at that one person and be like ""damn i'm lucky""?"
Let's drawn into each other's arms.
Girl's who don't ask for anything just deserve it all.
Because i'll be there at your worst no matter how hard it seems.
"I know it's painful, but you can't let pain overcome you, control it instead."
"I know sometimes people can be a little harsh and ignorant, but you also gotta understand that they've been thru so much in their life."
"She worries and fights with you because she cares and wants whats best for you, nothing else."
When somebody's happiness effects yours though..
I could see all the sadness in your eyes.
"""The Longest Ride"" could possibly be the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life."
She'll tell you it's all fine and draw a smile on her face but inside she's just boiling and waiting to explode.
Would you still love her in the morning with her messy bun?
Does she tweet about you? Is she always there in your moodiest days? Does she worry about your happiness before hers? You fucking wife her.
I know more then i should.
Originality is rare as fuck nowadays.
Hug her tightly and tell her you'll always be there no matter how hard the rock takes to break.
Ouch.
"Think ahead of you, think before doing anything, a small little mistake could mean the whole world to someone."
That amazing feeling you get inside your chest when you see someone you love. &gt;&gt;
Best feeling in life is knowing your parents are actually proud of you and are happy because of who you became.
The fact that i'm too lazy to do anything basically ruins everything.
I just don't wanna live on this planet anymore.
The question is... will you still look at me years from now the same way you look at me now?
I hate the fact that whenever i go out i become constantly tired and wanting to sleep and when i go home i suddenly can't close my eyes.
"Girls always remember the details, don't lie to them."
"I know it hurts to see them happy and knowing you're not the reason anymore, but you need to stay strong."
Why life.
She's what defines happiness.
"- Wear something nice, i'm coming to pick you up. - Where we going? - To introduce you to my parents."
"Be there for her on her worst days, it's when she truly needs someone to hold her and tell her that everything's fine and you're there."
"A date where i wear a suit, the girl wears a dress, a nice restaurant, and long walks afterwards. Amen."
It's funny how people do what they say they shouldn't.
You can't blame people for not caring when you don't give them a reason to.
I wonder what you say to them when they talk about me.
When somebody's arms is all you really need.
Ya salam 3al shaware3 w heya fadya kda...
Don't go for better when you have what's enough. Be thankful not greedy.
"*Staring at each other* - What's wrong? - Nothing, you're just too beautiful."

You have not been treated the way you should have been treated.
- You know what scares me the most? - What? - Thinking that maybe one day we'd drift apart so far we wouldn't know our way back.
"Scream, cry, yell, punch something, break something, let it all out. It'll feel better afterwards."
Crowded places make me nervous.
"You're good at hiding your feelings, aren't you?"
Oh have i lost so much interest for social media. It's like i just feel like deactivating all apps and just letting it all go.
You're the reason why i still listen to that one song.
"If you have someone who's always there for you whenever you're down or need a shoulder to lean on, you're more than lucky."
Maybe disappearing would still not be enough.
Friends? Oh you mean people who talk to me when they're bored not friends.
"Damn do i seriously hate attention seekers so much, it's like they do everything on purpose just to gain people's attention sigh.."
"I still have so much things for you to talk about, just be patient."
Fight for her or someone else will.
"Do you ever just know a person too well and they tweet something and you just wanna tell them ""wtf is this? This isn't even the real you"""
They make fun of what they can't have or be.
You can't really deny the fact that everything happens for a reason.
She smiles with passion and forgets everything around her when she's with you.
People do the absolute apposite of what they say just to fit in.
Her smile keeps me going.
- It hurts doesn't it. - What?.. - Feeling like your a second choice.
Seeing my dad happy or in a good mood because of me just makes me the happiest person alive to be honest.
Everytime i plan for something and get it ready and feel excited it ends up being ruined by the smallest thing.
Ana bakul aktar ma batkalem ma3 el nas ta2reeban...
I can't really remember the last time i had a goodnight sleep.
It was never just about me. Never was never will.
We might as well stay strangers. That way we'll never lose each other.
"Ever been so far away from someone to the point that whenever they come close to you, you never feel the same way again?"
I don't care if we're not talking and just staring at each other for hours as long as you're with me.
Your problem is that you think you know everything but you don't.
You choose the easy way out because you fear failing and being ignored.
Wait is this the moment where we say summer time sadness?
Why can't the people i know live beside me so i'd go and wake them up right now and tell them i'm bored and they should keep me company?..
Nothing pretty much bothers me anymore. Everything is on repeat to the point that i've gotten use to it.
Seems like i've been blind for far too long.
"Not everything will happen whenever you want it, be patient and have some hope. Eventually things will get better."
"People are taking the relationship and life ""goals"" way way too far."
Sometimes letting go of what you thought you couldn't is your key to happiness.
I like how people change it all around and turn it against me.
"There's so much going on in that little head of yours, mind sharing it?"
"Can't trust anyone anymore, everyone just wants what's best for them."
"They think leaving Egypt will be the key to happiness, but little do they know that the whole world is fucked up. Not just Egypt."
- Don't think negative. - Take a look around you and tell me 1 thing that's positive in this world we live in.
"Nobody has a perfect life really, even the rich and famous have nightmares and downfalls. Nobody is satisfied with what they really have."
I'm just tired of being tired that's all.
Don't have high hopes for something that you know it might never happen.
"That special someone you act completely yourself, crazy and hyper with. &gt;&gt;"
"Ever just stare at someone and be like ""how could someone be that beautiful""?"
Stop trying to impress others with things that YOU yourself dislike.
Being nice and there for people gets you nowhere else but under their foot in this generation. Don't give without taking anything in return.
Sigh... How can people sleep at night? How do you not like how quiet and peaceful the night is?
It's sad how people accept doing stuff that they refuse someone else doing it to them.
"Don't tell a girl directions in the street, she'll get lost either way."
She hides her feelings and how hurt she is just to satisfy you and make you happy. The least you could do is treat her well.
Take my hand and let's get lost somewhere you and i only know of so when anything happens we run back to that place and wait for each other.
"If she stuck around in your darkest and moodiest days, she's diffidently a keeper."
I could be everything you need/want but i could also be your worst nightmare.
"Don't blame me for not doing anything you once expected, i have a mind that works on it's own."
I just want you to be happy.
I'm so done with so many things it's not even funny.
Ever feel so left out to the point that you just look at other people and be like damn aren't they just lucky to have someone beside them.
I don't need someone in my life knowing that they're not going to last either way.
"You got that ""i love you"" look in your eyes."
I lose interest quicker than a tornados spin.
"I got lost just thinking about you, now imagine staring at you."
The more attention you give to people the faster they lose interest in you.
You can't hold on to what you never held in the first place.
Ever just feel like losing a grip on life? When you're just like fed up of this everyday routine and that everything's been the same? Sigh.
I've been unstable for quiet sometime now.
I like watching people do things.
I just wanna lay down on top of a really high hill and look at the stars and just erase everything that's on my mind right now.
The future scares me more than anything else in this world. Knowing the fact that everyone is gonna go his own path is just scary.
I always give and ask for nothing in return and that's my biggest mistake in life.
"You can't ever force anyone to love you back or do the same you do to them, you just can't. Either leave it or accept it."

"- Goodmorning! - Don't even look or interact with me, thank you."
"You get what you give, that's the simple truth."
- Can i text you? - And say what? Hi? How am i? What am i doing? What am i going to do today? How's life? No thanks.
Life is just too short to chase after someone who has no intentions in even looking at you.
She still goes to the place where you first met just to think of all the good times you once had.
Would you really look for me if i just  disappeared? Or would you go on with life and pretend i never existed?
When i'm quiet i'm just doing 2 things; either thinking of a way to escape reality or how i got here in the first place.
- We should talk. - About? - How fucked up we really are.
It's pathetic how people fake characters on social media just to impress others.
I seriously need to go either  ultra music festival or tomorrowland. This is just unfair.
We might as well explore each other's mind.
Fame changes people. Either to the good or bad.
Having a little hope is better than no hope at all.

He stared at her like she was a painting.
Ever asked yourself why are things the way they are?
"It was never about how much the bracelet you got her was, it was about that you actually remembered to do something for her."
"""Nobody is there for me, why should i be there for anybody"" he said."
"I've tried to stop thinking, but it doesn't work."
Buy her a flower or a chocolate every time you go out or see her and remind her how beautiful she is and trust me. She'll be the happiest.
There's still so much left unsaid.
It's always the little things you do that make the biggest memories.
Damn do i wish i'd be sitting in the front of the beach right now smelling some fresh air and listening to music. Would be perfect.
"Wake up and face reality and understand that no matter how many times you say it, it'll never happen. It's like talking a deaf person."
Change is needed.
She's screaming inside but you're too deaf to hear her.
"Don't talk to me while I'm moody, you're either going to hate me or you'll want stab me in the heart with a knife."
"They say respect other people's opinion, but once they dislike one of yours, it's totally fine to hate on it. Sigh."
"Don't believe rumors, believe what comes out of my mouth."
"All relationships have it's ups and down, it just really matters on how tight they both hold on to each other."
El gaw da mehtag bet odam el bahr.
"You, my bed, listening to our favorite songs and taking selfies all night long. Amen."
Good thing about living alone is that you get to do everything the way you like it.
"Yeah it's a new day and all, just the same people, same words, same boredom, same songs, same tweets, just different dates."
This daily routine is the reason behind all of this moodiness and boredom.
"It's 4 AM, and i just want to go out for a car ride with you listening to our favorite songs."
"It's 3:15, some people are awake depressed, some are missing someone, some are lonely, and me.. well I'm just bored. Sigh."
"She broke her promises and bypassed her rules for you, and yet you don't appreciate her? What a shame."
I eat as if I'm somebody who hasn't seen food for 3 days.
"Stop going for more when you got what other's are dreaming of having. Be thankful, not greedy."
It just upsets me how a beautiful girl can be unstable because of how her ex is a dumb ass.
"Time passes by like a blink of an eye, it almost feels like 2014 was just a few days ago. Do what makes you happy before it's too late."
Can't i just lay in bed and stare at you all day long?
"I don't mind letting you in, just give me a good reason to."
Sleeping 13 hours is just perfect.
She's too precious to be touched.
*Opens snapchat* *Takes selfies to save on camera roll* *Closes snapchat*
I found myself lost in the middle of nowhere.
The way she slaps her hands on her knees when she laughs and her beautiful face turns red is what i wanna see everyday.
"Wipe those tears and smile, you're beautiful."
Let me discover all that madness behind your smile.
I've pushed everyone away to know who'd still be there for me. Guess what? No one was.
Do you ever just stare at someones face because they're just so beautiful? Like damn.
Be with someone who would take pictures of you while you're asleep.
Living with the fear of losing somebody is just something else.
We're a generation where we ask for love and care but too scared to actually give it.
Social media has become a disease that has no cure.
You're irreplaceable.
"A girl like you should be smiling rather than crying, don't ever let anyone make you feel worthless."
"You're miserable, I'm miserable, might as well be miserable together."
"You can't ever force anyone to fall in love with you, no matter how beautiful you look or how famous you get. They'll still see better."
Let's put all our negative bullshit behind us and have some fun while we're at it shall we?
Time will tell everything sooner or later.
It doesn't have to be that way.
You should leave what you're doing and let's focus on us for a change.
Such an amazing voice you got there damn.
So close yet so far.
She holds that pillow while she sleeps hoping one day it'l be you instead of the pillow.
"Let them talk. Talking is for free, the real thing is actually doing it."
Waking up to your face would probably be better than anything else.
"Don't ever let anyone tell you who you are. Prove them wrong, show them how different you are. Let them talk and brag, you're not losing."
Nowadays girls with 5000 followers on Instagram think they're Megan Fox and guys with 5000 followers on twitter think they're Shakespeare.
Take me back to the time where social media didn't exist.
"I can't stand talking or looking at human beings in the morning, i just cant."
"You're too beautiful to walk with your head down, raise your head and walk with pride, show these people who you are."
Eating watermelon and sunny days in front of the beach are the only reasons why i really love summer.
"Her laugh is like butterfly standing on your fingers, rare yet so beautiful."
Words fell from her mouth as if they were stuck.
Ever just feel so alone in the middle of a crowd?
You're always by yourself in that little world of yours.
"Take selfies with him and fill his phone with your pictures, us men like that."
Why does sleeping 10 hours still feel like i didn't even sleep?
Let's go for a walk at 3:00 AM and forget about everything that ever happened between us.
"You have something that no one else does, i like that."
Who tore you apart and ruined you so bad that you're scared of what may come next?
You're the type of mess i'd like to be around with.
Such a beautiful sad face you have.
How long does it take for me to show you how beautiful you are?
"Ever wish you could wake up one day and find out that your dreams came true and you just think ""i actually did it""?"
I could kiss that face all day and have no problems as long as you're cool with that.
Life passes by faster than an airplane. Do what you wanna talk to your kids about one day.
I'm getting myself into something that i know i might not be able to get out of.
I'd give you my hands and pull you back up no matter how hard you stab me in the back. Thats how nice i am.
I have world war 3 in my head but i like showing how empty it is.
Slowly drifting away from everybody.
Be there for her when she needs you. It's the only time she will truly believe how much you care for her.
It's scary how fast we're growing up.. one day we were those little kids running around in the playground and next thing we're graduating.
"Don't mind their silliness, we should focus on how incredibly beautiful you look."
The harder you try the better you become.
"Instead of talking too much, do what you want to become and surprise them later. It'll give you better self esteem."
It's like their body is growing but their minds got stuck on the way up.
We found home in each others arms.
If i ever wrote a book you'd probably be the main character.
Can i stalk you and blame your prettiness for it?
She looked at him while fake laughing just to get his attention.
Her eyes spoke what her mouth couldn't.
I'm disappointed where this generation is taking us.
As long as I'm happy with what I'm doing then your opinion belongs nowhere else but the trashcan.
Would your 10 year old self be proud of who you are right now?
We should go somewhere where we can be alone.
"God gave you 2 ears. Listen from one ear, let out from the other, that simple."
It's cute when THEY say don't judge and be different when sadly they're just like every other pathetic loser out there.
Tab ana maly goal wala msh goal? Messi wala omak? Zamb omy ana eh? Leh ashof kda 3al timeline? Mat2olena enak rayeh el hamam bel mara...
I literately can't stand immature people.
"As long as you're doing the right thing, keep moving forward. Don't let anyone ever make you look back or try to stop you."
The worst thing about this generation is that you have to pretend you don't want someone just to get their attention.
As much as i wanna hug you and spin you around i also wanna hold you and throw you from the 20th floor. &lt;3
Sleep for a better tomorrow.
"You came into this world for a reason, make it a good one."
"When i laugh at you it's not just me, no, it's me and my 3 other bestfriends."
The reason behind someone being so cold and arrogant is because people either stepped on them too much or they're sick and tired of them.
Everybody needs help but no one is willing to help others.
"I wish you could see yourself with my eyes, maybe you'd understand how beautiful you truly are."
"Assume all you want, i'll leave you with the truth unspoken till one day i'll use it against you."
"I might look older than my age, but once you get to know me and i get comfortable around you. You'd think i'm still 10."
Tickling her just to see her smile makes me smile.
Sometimes all we really need is someone to talk to and tell them everything that's bothering us hoping they might understand.
"The older we get the more stressed we become and we blame it on our parents, sadly we will one day be in their shoes."
"No, you're not done with life, you're still a kid. You don't know what life is yet."
"Give as much as you want to be given. But make sure it's with the right person first, a broken glass never gets repaired."
Do you ever just lay in bed at night and put your head back while listening to music and remember all the amazing moments you had?
"As long as I'm sleeping you're not allowed to call me, or ring the door bell, or wake me up. That simple."
"It's hard to even trust actions nowadays, since it became easier to act."
"You see yourself as a terrible person cause you, yourself only know what you did, but you should always think of a way to make things work."
Ever just stare at a person and imagine your life with them? whether it's going to be all fun and interesting or just a normal boring one?
I can't cope knowing something's bothering you.
"What part of your brain didn't get ""grow the fuck up""?"
Don't trust anyone who looks like a complete different person than they are in pictures.
Sometimes being mr nice guy gets you nothing but being fucked over by people.
"I get moody at the tiniest things, things get to me really quick it's irritating me."
You just don't mess with my family no matter what happens. It's just that simple.
Ever feel like you're just stuck in a box and you can't find a way to dig your way out?
"No you're not always going to be happy and in a good mood, but you can't let sadness take control of you, do what makes you happy."
The ones who matter are the ones you're thinking about at 3 AM.
The way she looked at him was as if she lost piece of her own skin.
Smelling good is attractive af.
"There's two types of people, those who listen and do, and the ones who talk and never do."
Ana hayaty ba2et 3obar3an akl w noom fa el howa eshta el denya msh wehsha awy kda.
If you want a relationship to last you're going to have to sacrifice a lot of things.
"Atl least i try, i make effort, i reach my limit, unlike you do nothing all day and complain how life is fucked up."
As long as you're treating her the same way you first wanted to get her than she's gonna stay yours.
13 year olds nowadays depressed acting like someone took their hearts and burned it. Bitch go read a book and finish school first.
"Smart enough to know, stupid enough to try again."
Daydreaming about you is my favorite part of the day.
"No, you're not gaining attention, you're losing people's respect."
How come us men have to get up and let women sit when it's crowded in a bus and they don't? #MeninistTweet
It's okay for women to call men fat but get offended when we call them fat. #MeninistTweet
"You have your own opinion that's cool, but that doesn't mean i'll ever care about it."
Don't lower your level for someone who's not worth your time.
"It's pretty lame how you can't tell the difference between one and other nowadays, everyone is just the same in a way.."
"Just don't play the ""who will care less"" game with me because you'd always lose."
Negativity won't bring you anything but sadness and depression.
Be with someone that doesn't stop going out of their way to make you happy just because they got what they wanted.
I really wanna be a nice person and all but everyone annoys me.
Leh lama yekun shakly helw atla3 khara fel sewar w lama yekun shakly mo2ref atla3 helw fel sewar?..
"People surprise me, but that's okay because i don't expect much from them in the first place."
The way you look at me is my way of knowing that everything's going to be alright.
Because a girls favorites explain everything.
The problem is everyone is depressed to the point that it's hard to know if someone is faking it or really depressed.
"How beautiful she is just drives me insane, making me wonder how long did it take god to create such beauty."
"Try to compare 2011 from 2015, how much the world changed in just 4 years."
Jealousy is a disease if you ask me.
"""Time changes people"" no, people change people, they want fame, they wanna look pretty, they want to be lovable... not time."
"Be there for her when she needs you, it's like giving a puppy his favorite snack, see how happy he gets? Same goes for her."
Everything just happens so quick..
"If she gave you her body, her love, and her kindness then she's a keeper."
Losing you would be like losing a part of me.
Staring at you became a hobby.
You call it cheesy i call it two people in love.
"""The crazy things"""
"Same words... same days, same actions, same people, and you don't expect me to get bored?.."
Yeah he's an asshole but you're not an angel sent from heaven either.
Because looking at you would be a sin.
"Girls concentrate on the tiniest mistakes and the simplest things you do, so be careful on what you say and do."
"You missed the way he loved you and cared for you, not him."
"Da beta3 el koshk el taht bety ahla menik, el tanaka msh hadwadeeki f heta."
"He lied, he cheated on you, he hurt you, but you have to know that people change. One more chance won't kill you."
You were too worried about them that you forgot about your own happiness.
Ever type something to someone you haven't talked with in a long time and delete it because they don't mean shit to you anymore?
Ana belel halty betkun sa3ba awy walahy.
Maybe one day we'll both get lost in the middle of nowhere.
She hides so much pain behind that beautiful smile of hers.
Just because you're famous on twitter doesn't make you pretty or lovable in real life. Anyone could a fake a character on social media.
Lama te2refak f 3eshtak teb2a bethebak 3amatan.
I don't feel like participating in life today.
The moment he moved on and forgot about her is the same moment she started caring about him.
It's sad that people always pick the smallest mistakes that you do and leave all the great things you've done.
There'll always be those kind of people who will try to let you down by words just because they think they're better than you.
I hate clicking favorite or follow by accident and people think i actually stalk them. Kinda irritating if you ask me.
Let's stay up all night and talk deep till one of us passes out.
I hate when i want to say something and i can't find the correct words to fit it.
Just do me a favor and don't waste my time please.
I'll always be watching over you no matter what.
If you had a chance to do it all over again how would you do it?
"I really need to relax, i need to let go of everything and just sit there all alone and think of absolutely nothing."
Late night thoughts with a cup of coffee and your phone.
I hate repeating myself more than once.
"I could write you a song, but do you promise to sing it?"
How her words get me on my knees every time she says something.
Ever repeat a word that you don't know the meaning of because it just sounds cool?
She's the type of girl i'd run back to and hug her like i lost a piece of me.
"Kolo ya mesafer ya khareg w ana a3ed taht el bataneya badafa, eshta."
it's just sad that the more you give the more they take.
Let's switch our phones off when we're together and forget everything else.
I keep hearing stories of shit i've never said or done from people i never knew.
"Call me over protective, but what's mine stays mine till the day i stop breathing, it's just that simple."
"Let's drop out of school, travel with everything we have to a place we never heard about before."
Follow my new Tumblr account;   i'll only be using that one from now on.
Social networking is eating us alive and we're not just realizing it. And we're wondering why this generation lacks brain cells. Well duh.
Sometimes a hug just isn't enough you know?
You're the type of girl i'd take home and introduce you to my parents.
You fucked up didn't you. Yeah same.
I should really sleep bas fakes.
Because you're what keeps me on my feet.
"I need sleep, but sleep doesn't need me."
"I'd leave anything, anyone just to see that beautiful smile of yours."
Yasta spend time with your girl before it's too late.
It only takes 10 pounds to buy her a flower to make her smile and 5 pounds for her favorite chocolate to make her happy.
"Bala priorities bala neela, el 3awez yekalem hd haykalemo."
People need to stop wanting what they can't have.
Smelling good is just 10x more attractive than usual.
Tab eh? Msh hanroh nebalbat fel bahr orayeb wala eh?...
Sleeping and waking up with a smile on my face is just a blessing.
I can't promise because I'm not sure you'll be doing the same thing you're doing now later on.
You're too kissable to be left unkissed. Sorry.
Because i fell in love with your presence.
- Let's go somewhere. - Like where? - Let's get lost together in the middle of nowhere. - I already get lost by just looking in your eyes.
Because being crazy just isn't enough.
Is it okay if i stalk you a little?
Ma3lsh bas howa enty betheby kam wahed fel osbo3 because I'm losing count.
Hug her like it's the last day you'll ever see her.
Everyones scared to love when love is the only cure that could heal your wounds.
She stopped caring when you started to walk away.
You're pretty much the reason why i wanna be a better person.
I always have my reasons..
We should go on a nap date.
"7th graders nowadays are worried about boys and drugs, when I was in 7th grade i was worried my teachers don't call my dad smh.."
"Piercings, necklaces, tattoos, rings. Are only allowed for females. Because #EgyptianLogic"
"Oh wow, i lost so much respect for too many people in such a short time."
"Well here's to the guys who still open car doors for their girls, you're doing it right."
The thought of someone else having you kills me.
I literally let the stupidest things bother me and i wish i didn't.
"""I'm too young for this shit"" is probably my answer to everything."
Stop looking for the love and care that he didn't give you in everyone you meet.
Because why not just give it a chance?
- Tell me something i don't know. - Me.
Twitter is becoming more than boring and yet I'm still opening it.. sigh.
Let's dance to your favorite song.
Things are slowly starting to look good.
"Imagine a life without social media, cell phones, laptops. Perfection if you ask me."
How can i nicely say that I'm not interested?
I just love it when you look at me that way.
Ever just look at someone and feel like hugging them from how nice they are to you?
I really need to stop being so rude.. gosh i feel so bad sometimes answering nice people in a bad way.
"I don't subtweet, i tweet. If the shoe fits, be my guest."
It's just sad how a nice person could be two faced.
Don't you just hate getting flashbacks from things you don't want to remember?
Sometimes it's good to be heartless with specific people.
Because a man's true love lasts a life time.
You're mine but you just don't know it yet.
Let's not bring back the past now shall we?
She sleeps a lot because her dreams are prettier than reality.
"Not everything you want will come under your feet, sometimes you gotta fight for what you truly desire."
If only you saw my point of view.
"We all change, just into different forms."
Mindfuck them with class and respect.
They always turn against you once they find out they don't have a chance with you.
I just really hate how some Egyptians like to cause fights and problems just because they think they're something they're not.
"If she changes her hair style and wears how you want her to, you wife that girl."
You won't understand because i don't find the words that try to fit in what I'm trying to say.
You're destroying yourself for someone who's not worth it.
People will always assume and judge but will also get upset if you do the same to them.
We all just need a tight hug that'll make everything better.
"I'd really love mornings if i was living in front of the beach... but why wake up to a guy yelling ""yabnl el weskha"" in the streets.."
If only she knew that my tweets were about her.
All i ever ask for is patience.
"Not all assholes are the same assholes, some are nice and some are just assholes."
Sometimes the people you want as part of your story are only meant to be a chapter.
"Mess with people who are close to me, and i'll make your life a living hell."
"There are 1,013,913 english words but I never could string together any of them to accurately explain how much I don't care what you think."
She has the look that makes a guy day dream.
Just don't hate me for doing the right thing.
"I just go with the flow, because I'm sick and tired and repeating myself over and over again."
"If you want something you'll find a way to get it, if you want someone, you'll find a way to reach them. Don't find excuses."
"Don't let anyone control you or tell you what to do, you're not their prisoner or slave, enjoy your life how YOU want it."
It's really annoying when you're like the only person who can see how evil and sneaky someone is and everyone else is like blind to it..
Ever feel like you're just not good enough?
Maybe my passion just ain't enough.
"That ""fuck you, fuck this, and fuck everything"" mood."
I ain't afraid to cross the line with you.
"Whats funny is i understand you more than you could ever imagine, so you acting smart will only make you look stupider."
Her finger tips were magic so i held them tighter.
You were too busy giving the wrong person your attention.
"No, i don't need your attitude, i got my own."
She's escaping reality because she's scared of what might happen.
"No i don't get it, you ignore me whenever you want, but if i ignore you it's a big deal?"
*Sleeps all day yet still tired 24/7*
She'll act like she doesn't remember just to test you.
"I like straight up people, i want you to tell me how you feel when you feel it."
If only it was easy to travel.. life would've been so much easier.
I talk to myself because no one understands me.
I hate this feeling of not knowing what you're feeling.
*Meets a new cute person*  *Spends a week imagining life together*
I'm a professional at pretending to be tired instead of admitting that i'm sad.
Leh makonsh f Miami or Florida for spring break? Zamany ba2azez sushi odam el bahr zy el termes hna.
"You were her home, now you're just something that she passes by on her way to work."
"I just let things slide nowadays, mostly cause i don't really care anymore."
Can i hug you for more than the normal hug time?
I try hard not to dislike you but you're just making it harder on me.
Take my eyes for a day and maybe you'll understand.
"Wipe your pretty eyes, save your tears for someone who's worth it."
"Ever wonder who stalks you late at night and be like... ""Imagine someone is just reading my tweets right now""?"
"Ever type ""i miss you.."" to a person and delete it afterwards because you don't wanna feel weak?"
You're killing yourself to see them happy.
"You like my tweets, not me. You don't even know me."
"You can't trust anyone anymore, nowadays everybody just screenshots what you say and use it against you someday."
"Different life style, different people, different weather, different places, a new beginning. Amen."
Cause you forgot what happiness is.
Cause the kindest hearts have felt most of the pain.
I stress about stress before there's even stress to stress about.
"A real boyfriend knows his girl like the back of his hand. He knows when she’s mad, sad, aggravated, happy, hurtbecause that’s ""HIS"" girl."
Howa ana leh msh bashba3 men el akl?..
Do you ever miss how someone first acted when you first met them?
I hate how a lot of people believe that when a girl’s silent she’s falling apart or crying inside but what if maybe she’s just hungry?...
"This face ""😔"" basically explains my entire life."
"I've been there before, believe me."
"""What comes easy won't last, what lasts won't come easy."""
Why does everything annoy me nowadays?..
"He told her he loved her, she turned around and kept on walking looking down with tears and shame."
11:11 i wish you could see yourself from my eyes.
It hurts doesn't it? Watching the closest person to you get hurt and can't do anything about it.
"I know everything you say about me, i just like to stay quiet and pretend i don't know anything."
Aktar haga bete2felny men ay hd enu yetakhar 3ala mawa3eedu.
Know that feeling when you can't really explain towards a person?
"Waking up to a good morning voice note, is like x10 better than a text."
Ever feel like you're just drifting away from everybody?
Your attention is the only attention i actually give a fuck about.
"The worst thing is wanting to text someone but telling yourself if they want to talk they will, so you wait and wait and nothing.."
Your girl should be bad enough to get every guys attention but loyal enough to let them know they don't stand a chance.
"The only reason i'd ask you to sleep with me is for me to use you as a pillow, nothing else."
Why do you even care about what others say when their opinion doesn't even matter to you?..
"- Can i sleep? - Not now, let's just think of all the fucked up things you did 5 years ago. - Okay."
"I just love private relationships, like the world shouldn't and doesn't have to know what we do seriously."
"It's annoying af how one second i could be happy and loving life, and the next minute i hate everything, sigh."
"She'll get jealous, but won't say shit, she'll just toss hints and give you attitude until you figure it out."
"Before you assume, try this method called ""asking"" first."
"Yes i changed, i started caring about myself, loving myself, since i got nothing in return by caring about others."
I crave late night beach walks smelling the beautiful salty water.
Let me guess.. 1. You're a depressed teen. 2. You like pizza. 3. You want to leave your country.  4. You want a cute relationship.
"When she says ""I'm happy for you"" she doesn't really mean it. What she's trying to say is, ""Why did you choose her over me?"""
Tell her how beautiful she is everyday as if it's her first name.
"- Don't kiss me, I'm sick. - it's alright, we'll be sick together."
People think you’re weird if you talk about things they don’t understand.
I'm actually happy to the point that I'm scared.
She doesn't wanna feel invisible.
"Nowadays the word ""beautiful"" lost it's meaning."
"- Goodmorning. - Not a single word in the morning please, thank you."
"Yeah you're good looking and all, but believe me, anyone can go from fat to skinny, ugly to pretty, it's a matter of who you truly are."
"What you think about me is pretty much non of my business, good or bad, i don't really care, I'm not here to please you. I please myself."
"You gave her a reason to be with you, now give her a reason to stay."
We do.
Because this generation needs to understand that you should always appreciate what you have and stop searching for more.
"I'm the type of person that could be mad at you and all, but i'd never let you sleep upset, i'd probably feel bad about myself."
She fought for you while you looked at someone else.
"You're fighting with your own thoughts trying to forget them, because they took your happiness and walked away. (13)"
"After falling so hard for them and you're finally sure they mean the whole world to you, they suddenly change for no fucking reason. (9)"
"You fell in love with them, you believed every single word they said. (5)"
"At the beginning we started of as strangers, we get to know them more and more by time. (1)"
Do you ever wonder if someone secretly checks your favorites to get to know you a little more?
"Double ""kk"" cause one simply isn't enough."
Can't wait for spring break already.
And she held his hands like they were magic.
"Nah bruh you called her ""tenka"" cause you couldn't get her."
Cause he could tell by the way she looked at him.
Your smell attracted me.
She looked on the ground while she was walking as if someone stepped on her pride.
"Once she gets comfortable around you, is when you realize you truly mean something to her."
Reasons i favorite tweets: - You're hot. - I agree. - I think you're a complete idiot - I know you hate me &amp; i want you to know that i know.
Hugging her felt like home.
Ways to win my heart:  - Food. That's pretty much it tbh.
"I've been judged by people i care about, ignored by those who said they'd never leave but did, but it's okay, life goes on."
I'm that type of douchebag who doesn’t talk with you for weeks but still cares about you and hopes you still care too.
Don't you ever waste your feelings on people who don't value them.
You could be talking to the nicest person ever and they still could fuck you over out of nowhere..
You just can't hate her for being herself.
He treated her as if she's a piece of art.
I think I'm the only one that doesn't care what color #TheDress is...
- Do you want to leave? - Yes. - But your body says no..
"50 Shades of Grey in cinema quality, thank me later,   pick any version and close ads. ^^"
She kept waiting for you while you kept playing around.
"Every guy wants a girl who's bad just for him, and every girl just wants a guy who doesn't give up on her."
"Yeah i saw your text, yeah I'm ignoring you, and yeah I'm tweeting."
"Saying ""I'm sorry"" other than ""sorry"", ""night"" other than ""goodnight"", ""love you"" other than ""i love you"" got a whole different meaning."
Just because I didn't start the conversation with you doesn't mean i don't wanna talk.
She no longer finds happiness in you.
Be with someone who would look in your eyes and tells you how much you truly mean to them.
Ever wonder if a stranger tweeted something you've done in public?
"I either sleep really early or very late, there's no in between."
Slowly getting there is better than not getting there at all.
Does he still give you butterflies like you first met him?
I'll be here waiting.
Do you ever pretend like you didn’t see something so your friend won't feel embarrassed?
"Hearing people say ""i can see you doing that"" after telling them what you want to do in life is seriously the best feeling ever."
"""It either kills you, or you kill it."" One thing i'll forever keep in mind."
I can fuckin' scream proudly saying that i have quit smoking.
Sleeping is so hard when you can't stop thinking..
"No one will notice your tears, no one will notice your sadness, no one will notice your pain, but they will all notice your mistakes."
"Nothing comes easy, you have to work hard for what you really want."
I'm too lazy to interact with people.
Every place in Egypt basically became boring.
- *Stays home* sigh.. I'm bored i need to go out.  - *Goes out* i should've stayed home..
You broke her heart but yet she still loves you with all those broken pieces.

We're all in a war with ourselves.
There are days I lay in bed at night and think about the things I wish I could say to you.
"If you don't like me, please do me a favor and don't act like you do."
"A year from now, everything you're stressing over won't mean shit anymore."
Within time you start noticing that some people just aren't worth it anymore.
- So how's everything? - Please don't make me think about my life.
She wanted him and only him.
"We're not as close as we once were, but i'd always be there for you when you need me."
I seem to comfort people with words i want to hear.
You just can't be nice to everyone.
But you should keep in mind that losing hope will start destroying you and your life in every single way. (9)
You keep on apologizing to yourself for showing care to them and then you try to convince yourself that it's just a lesson learned. (7)
Trying to tell yourself that it's easy to live without them again when it's actually not. (5)
They taught you how to live while they are in your life. They completely made you forget how you used to live happily without them. (3)
"You meet someone, you two get close; it's all great for awhile and then someone stops trying and both of you become strangers again. (1)"
"Be with someone who makes you happy, someone who doesn't complicate your life."
"And look now, all grown up, torn, upset, pissed, depressed, mad, nerves, wondering what's next.. Well yeah, that's life."
Ever miss yourself? That 10 year old you begging your parents for a gameboy? Or toy? When you were never depressed?
Let's be friends with benefits till one of us falls in love and become addicted.
Wait... so am i the only one spending valentines in bed?
Know that feeling when you know something bad is about to happen and you start getting prepared for it?
"2015, you disappointed me."
Being moody became a daily hobby now.
"Hot chocolate, popcorn, my bed, my blanket, and you. That's all i ask for."
"Use my past to hurt me, and i'll use your future to burn you."
I saw you at your worst and still though you were the best.
Effort is attractive af.
Cuddling in this weather would probably be a blessing now.
Making up an entire story in your head and hoping one day it will happen.
"- Do you promise to stay? - No, but i promise to try."
"You can't always get what you ask for, sometimes you gotta stand up and fight for what's right."
After midnight is when my brain usually wakes up and remembers everything that once happened.
I fell in love with the subject of sin.
"I count my friends on my fingers, what else is there..."
Sometimes all you need is someone who can make you smile and happy.
"Stay strong, things will get better."
You only know what i let you see.
"She's pretending like she doesn't miss you, and you're pretending like you don't give a fuck."
Do you?
"You kinda piss me off, but i still like you."
One day you'll regret it and take it all back.
He'll know your worth when he doesn't find someone who cares and loves him the way you do.
My favorite texts are the ones when you re-read and puts a smile on your face like it's the first time you read them.
Nothing is worse than being used by someone you thought genuinely cared about you.
"It seems like everytime i try to make plans, something has to happen to ruin it."
I barely talk to anyone anymore and I'm liking it.
Don't tell me you miss me when you don't even try to talk to me.
Know when u get emotional on twitter but then you gotta mix it up with some funny stuff so people don't think ur about to jump off a cliff.
"- You changed.  - Yeah, we all do."
Maybe it's just an illusion.
"""Baby girl I'm here"" tell her that, and believe me she'll be yours forever."
Music has its way by doing things we never see.
"I'm not giving up till i reach what i want, i don't care what it takes either."
Girl you should stop trying so hard to please the people who aren't even worth your time.
People really need to realize that sometimes there are days when you’re not in the mood to talk or interact with anyone.
Talking with people who only talk about themselves is annoying af.
Girls be dating the worst guys just so they could complain how bad guys are.
"You should know when to be serious, not everything is a joke."
Be with someone who gives you what you ask for without you even asking.
Today just isn't my day.
"Why are parents so fuckin' stubborn? What part of ""we're a different generation than yours"" don't you fuckin' understand?"
Why is it always when i want something i never find it and when i don't it's always there..
What if i wrote a book about you saying all those beautiful things i see in you? Would you believe it then?
There's just something different about you.
Waking up when you can't even open your eyes isn't a good start.
"They can apologize and we can forgive them, but sometimes we just can't forget the pain that they put us through."
"You won't even understand, so it's pretty pointless to explain, besides, I'm too lazy."
And every cigarette she smoked was because of you.
"Girl, take pride in what you do."
Damn girl i'd totally get lost by just looking in your eyes.
"No matter how many times i try to explain to people, they just seem to never understand."
Damn if only your brain suited your age.
"They probably don't know anything, but believe me, i know so much about you and so many secrets you'd be terrified. But yet i stay quiet."
"You can easily make her happy if you choose to, but yet you don't, you like to play around like a little kid who just hit puberty."
"You misunderstood me, but instead of asking, no, you criticized and assumed something else."
They always pick the one wrong thing you did and leave all the good things you did behind as if they never happened.
Howa enty 3ashan beteshtemy 3al twitter w kda teb2y helwa w gamda y3ny wala eh msh fahem? Ahleek marabukeesh 3ala kda.
Some guys just want a girl who acts like a girlfriend and is loyal to them while they mess with other girls... like dude why..
"- Where would you take me? - Somewhere only you and i know of, somewhere far away from all this bullshit."
Hold my hand and let's get lost together.
- You can trust me. - But why should i? - Because i can give you what other's can't.
Sitting doing nothing really makes me depressed.
She smoked to remind herself why does she even care.
"We might think we're better than a lot of people, but you never know if people are acting stupid on purpose."
Because behind every slut or whore is a guy who broke her and used her till she got fed up.
Let's get high and tell each other how fucked up we really are.
"You don't always get what you want whenever you want it, sometimes it takes patience and effort."
Don't give me advice on something you haven't experienced it yourself yet.
"""The ones that love me, i intend to leave behind."""
"Maybe I'm just waiting for something that might not even happen, who knows."
- You're cute. - Ana mesahba. - Ana masa2altekeesh tetgawezeny 3ala fekra.
Maybe we're all just searching for that one person that'll take care of us as if we're piece of diamond.
"Look at that face, god was surely using his powers creating you."
"Oh how dramatic you are, i like you."
She looked at him in a way that no girl could ever do the same.
His name echoed in her ears.
Never fuck over someone who's been always there for you.
"""You make it look like it's magic."""
Leh kol yom lazem haga tehsel tefselny? Mafeesh masalan yom kamel ye3ady b kheer?
I just wanna be happy she said.
"So tell me, where do you think you're going without giving me a kiss first?"
"If you think my bestfriend doesn't tell me everything that you say, then damn you really need to rethink your entire life tbh."
Every time she saw him happy without her just killed her a little inside.
"Push yourself a little harder, it's worth it."
- See that? - See what? There's nothing.. - That's me not giving a fuck.
"No matter which way you look at it, a lie never lasts."
Do you ever wish you had unlimited battery so you won't stop talking to a specific person?
"Write her a letter and get her some chocolate and flowers, and i guarantee you she'll be the happiest."
"Mahu ba3d kelmet ""insta"" dii mayenfa3sh a3meleek followback el saraha."
"My actual goal is to be successful so i can spoil myself and my family and do what I love and go where I want, whenever."
Her smile made his day brighter.
"There's a reason behind every word and action, it's yours to figure out."
"Black, the weeknd, lana del rey, depression, pain, failing in school, acting hard to get, all became mainstream, i wonder what's next.."
Interfere between me and the people i love and watch what happens.
"Sorry sweet heart, it'll take more than that to bring me down on my knees."
I'm actually way different than how people really see me.
"Make her remember something nice you've done to her, not all the argues and pain you gave her."
If only you can lose weight by running away from your feelings.. sigh.
"I don't have a lot of friends, i just know a lot of people."
One thing that hurts me the most is that you don't even realize you hurt me.
How I clean my room:  - Starts at one corner. - Finds something from 3 years ago and stares at it nostalgically for 5 hours. - Goes to bed.
"I'm the kinda person that if even we stopped being friends or drifted away, your secrets are my secrets, i'll stick to my word regardless."
"When I'm moody everything just basically annoys me, even if it's a good thing."
It's nice when someone texts you a long paragraph about how they feel when you're sleeping and puts a smile on your face in the morning.
I sleep like a person who never saw a bed in his life i swear.
Sia - Chandelier.
Am i the only one that still feels like it's 2014?
Do you ever just read old conversations and wonder where it all changed?
"I worry about it and i worry about other people's feelings more than mine, so i should start focusing on my own self for a while."
Social media really did ruin my life.
Disappearing for a while and deactivating some apps would probably be the best thing for me now.
You'll never really know a person till you talk to them at 4:00 AM.
Do you just ever wonder how your friends describe you to people you don't know?
"I open twitter, all i see is broken people, depressed people, people searching for love, pain, stress, sigh."
You're becoming exactly like them.
Maybe it should've ended earlier.
"Never give up on your goal no matter what it takes or how much pain it is, because in the end you'll be more than happy with who you are."
That person you always feel happy talking to no matter how shity the conversation is. &gt;&gt;
She went to the places where you shared the best memories and tears came out of her eyes as she walked passed them.
"Cancel plans with me and i'm canceling you out of my life, simple as that."
Going to sleep happy is like an occasion now.
It's funny how two girls can completely hate each other but yet act normal in front of each other.. sigh.
Girl you got that look in your eyes that makes a man day dream.
"I really hate that feeling when something is killing you inside, and you have to act like you don't care."
Isn't it weird when you waste an entire day doing nothing and time just passes...
"Forgive the people who tell you the truth, it means they lied, but they began to trust you, felt guilty, and told the truth."
It's not really worth it if they didn't prove it.
"Respect her and treat her right, and i guarantee you she'll do everything for you, but make sure she's worth it first."
You're calling her a slut because she rejected you? And you're calling yourself a man? Think again please.
"So tell me - tell you what? Idk.. just tell me. - yeah but what Tell me me everything, cause that pain in your eyes didn't come from nothing"
"If you can make her smile while she's upset, you most likely won her heart."
You just gotta accept the fact that somethings are never going back to the same they used to be.
"He tried so hard, yet you pushed him away like it was nothing and you complain why you're all alone."
Waking up in a bad mood is possibly the worst thing that could happen.
Tired of people pretending that they care and wanting to talk to you and wanting you in their life yet they make no effort.
Don't tell me to listen when all you're gonna say is an excuse.
I'll question everything you say to me.
You're a beautiful broken glass though.
Are you really happy? Or are you just pretending to be?
It's disappointing to see someone who was close to you turns out to be someone who talks shit behind your back.
"We both understand each other, so let's not play around and act stupid about it."
Quote this with a picture of your freckles.
Her tears ran down like a tunnel of emptiness.
Even strangers saw the pain and asked me what's wrong and you didn't.
She's jealous because she doesn't want anyone to take you away from her.
People will always act so good as if they're angels sent from heaven but damn they would stab you right in the back with a knife after that.
"She needed you the most, but sadly you were too busy giving an other person your attention."
"If you're the type of guy that kisses your girl on her forehead when you hug her, you're doing it right."
Everything is basically temporarily now.
"If it isn't making you happy, find something that will. Don't waste your time."
Having someone who understands you and always there for you is such a blessing.
11:11 wish is to run away from all this bullshit.
It takes getting screwed over once by someone you care about to make you never wanna get close to anyone again.
"She smoked to forget, but it turns out she remembered all the memories you both shared."
It's weird how we have an endless mental conversation with ourselves.
Your maturity level basically depends on who you're with.
It's really crazy how people and things can easily change.
Hot chocolate and staying under the blanket mood.
"Just deal with it, you can't really tell someone something and expect them to understand when they haven't even experienced it themselves."
"I don't even understand my own feelings, and you expect me to understand yours?"
It's scary how in a relationship one person can be so in love and the other can just be waiting for an opportunity to end it.

"""It's only a dream."""
"If she stayed by your side on your worst days, don't lose her. She's a keeper."
"In this generation girls are scared to love, guys are scared to show emotions, and everybody just wants to be hard to get and heartless."
"Not in the mood to actually deal with anyone, i just wanna lay in bed and sleep all day."
I need a jar of coffee.
"- Are you happy with your life? - Yes, why? - Because you don't smile and your face seems upset. - But.. this is my happy face."
"If I had a pound for every time someone spelled my name wrong, I could pay for college, a new house, a new motorcycle, and travel."
She's just scared that everything that once happened will happen once again.
- Do you know me? - No. - Do you know my story? - No. - Then why are you talking about me?
I see everyone complaining about the weather.. didn't you guys ask for winter a couple of months ago though?
"We all go through it, just in different steps maybe."
It all just doesn't make any sense.
"Sorry, but i ran out of love to share."
"""I hope you feel my pain."""
A representation of putting your trust in someone.
Let's watch movies and sit in our underwears and kiss a lot maybe?
I don't like getting attached to things knowing they don't even last...
I've been planning on getting my shit together for the past 4 years now.
Ana hamoot forever alone 3amatan.
"My dad likes to play this game called ""calls me from four rooms away and gets upset when i can’t hear him"""
Lonely girls are always the nicest creatures to people.
I hope the next cool trend is called self respect.
"A girl's ""whatever"" basically means ""fuck you"" though."
"When you're sad people call you emotional but when you're feelin yourself they call you conceit, cry me a river bitch I'm me."
I go through my photos sometimes and think “I wish i could relive this day again” and it sucks.
- Crush texts me: haii!  - Me: *tries to act cool by not texting back right away but forgets and never texts back*
Have you ever just looked at someone while they're doing something small and just smile because you like them that much?
"Before you start judging or assuming, try hearing the 2 sides of the story, because someone always comes up lying."
"We'd be sitting here getting high together, but you don't exist."
"Strength and wisdom comes with experience, not age."
"Don't let them bring you down, stand on your feet and show them what you're made of, show them the real you. Prove them wrong."
"She screamed hard enough, but sadly you didnt you hear her clearly."
"Let them hate, you got nothing to lose anyway."
My 11:11 wish is for everyone to be happy.
"Turn her tears into a smile and i promise you, you will not regret it."
It's all a matter of time.
Wife her if she worries about your happiness more than hers.
"Don't ask me a stupid question and wonder why i didnt answer, go get some knowledge into that empty brain of yours before talking to me."
"If i give you my phone to take snaps on snapchat, you better feel special."
"It's quiet sad how you broke her into pieces, she was happy and look at her now.. all torn apart."
Was it worth it? To give him your all and get nothing in return?
Let's share those amazing moments together and think about them 20 years from now and laugh at our stupidity.
"I ate way too much today though, and I'm happy about that, started 2015 eating. Uhh, not a bad start."
"Happy new years everybody, have a wonderful year, smile, you're beautiful and someone out there loves you, not me, but someone.💕"
Haters turn into friends and friends turn into haters.
But you can't blame yourself for everything.
She still thinks of you everyday.
I'm hungry but i don't know what to eat. Story of my life.
- Hate3mel eh fel new years? - Haroh 2a2of 3al nile akul termes w abky.
Am i the only person that has no plans at all for new years?
She faked a smile to show him that she's better off without him.
"Set your mind to it, and you'll get it done."
"But why all this loneliness? Smile, you're beautiful."
"Those scars on your arms, are they real? Cause damn they're beautiful."
"Don't you ever put your happiness in his hands, one day he'll crush it like a nutshell."
"Let our minds combine, i swear we'd create what you call magic."
Let's stare at the sky as we hold hands. Cause girl that's how we'll remember each other.
"Girl, do me a favor and smile, cause damn it makes me happy."
"If she annoys the shit out of you, it only means that she really loves you."
Howa ana emta haftah ketab zy ba2eet el nas w azaker?
"It'll only hurt for a while, till you get used to it."
"Your sadness isn't permanent, it's only a mood, your life is just beginning."
Let's not forget the good times we shared together now shall we?
You remind me a lot of the person i used to be.
We're all searching for happiness somewhere.
Maybe she's just depressed and needs to take a break from life.
"Everything's gonna be alright, maybe not today, or tomorrow or even next year, but one day you're gonna wake up and everything will be fine."
"I like being alone, listening to music in my own world, away from all the bullshit in life."
Sometimes i really just wanna sit outside and talk with someone all night.
"She doesn't want to be lonely, but she's scared to let anyone in."
Ever thought that maybe he won't chase you because you haven't given him a reason to?
Let's dance zy el hobl in the rain.
Dance your sadness away.
"""These fuckin' eyes that I'm staring at."""
But girl why you keep looking for him in everyone you meet?
"Because you know.. I don't like someone telling me who to talk to and who not to talk to, i mean let's face it, i like living."
We just gotta accept the things that we can't change.
"Girl, let me kiss that beautiful mind of yours."
It all starts with a follow and ends with a heart break.
"I made twitter to talk to myself when I'm bored, it works perfect for me."
Let's go for a long walk without talking and we'll see how well that goes.
This is deep.
She'd do anything for you to forgive her.
Ana hakhdak 3ala ad 3a2lak w ha2olak ma3lsh ya habiby.
When something funny happens i can assure you im that friend who keeps laughing even though everyone else stopped 5 mins ago.
Let's just sit in bed all day and stare at each other as if we just met.
Sleeplees nights are the worst.
"You might not like the person, but sure as hell doesn't give you the right to judge em."
- Yalla netkemed? - Yalla. The fault in our beds.
"You asked what i liked about you, oh i love it all."
"But girl, your eyes says it all."
Can 2015 be the year i get my shit together?
I really wish guys and girls could be friends and hang out without people thinking they're dating.
"From ""i love you"" to ""do i know you"" real quick."
I like those people who you can joke around with and have fun with and then have a deep conversation with and it’s not weird at all.
"- You're mad at me? - Yea. - Good, stay mad."
"I never really realized that growing up meant dying inside, but it's whatever."
I've discovered so much about myself this year.
"Don't let memories bring you down, just create new ones."
"Negativity and hate is everywhere, but if everyone just stopped and said ""I'm unique in my own way"" everything would be alright."
I prefer girls with long hair though.
You can't always have what you want whenever you want it.
Howa hadreteek rayha tetgawezy wala rayha el madrasa?..
"Stop assuming and judging when you don't even know the person, they'll always have a reason behind everything they do/say."
"If she makes you laugh when your sad, she's a keeper."
She listens to the songs you once told her and she cries harder every time.
She only fears that you might change your mind about her.
When she tells you to listen to a song she likes she's just telling you what she's really feeling towards you.
"Look deeper, you might find what you're truly looking for, everyone can fake a smile."
She gets lonely without you.
Why is everything so stressful nowadays..
If there's anything I'm actually good at is caring too much for the wrong people.
Akhret el being nice wehsha fashk walahy.
"I'm a libra, what do you expect?"
"Here's a tip, never get attached to me because you'll end up regretting it."
It's always my fault isn't it?
I actually listen to music more than i listen to what people have to say about me or what they want to say to me.
Blocking people became a hobby.
Just because you can relate doesn't mean you can understand.
She lacks confidence in herself.
Yeah.. Imagine.
It's really weird who I started 2014 with and who I'm ending it with.
"We may not be close, but im gonna help you out if i can."
"We never really learn till someone close to us gets hurt or dies, that's when it truly hits us."
"- Are you okay? - I don't know, look in my eyes and you'll understand."
The worst part about taking naps is that you expect to wake up feeling good but instead you feel like you died and you forgot who you are...
It really isn't my fault that i eat too much chocolate and sit in bed like a pregnant women okay? Shit happens.
I blame myself for being too nice.
Can someone tell me how to tell someone to fuck off politely?
Sometimes it all comes down to that one person that no matter how many people come in your life you will always run back to them.
Why do i always blame everything on myself?
2015 is in a few weeks and I'm still overthinking stuff i did in 2010..
"Saying ""I'm tired"" when your actually sad."
Today: depressed. Tomorrow: depressed. Next week: depressed. Next month: depressed. Next year: depressed. Next life: depressed.
Crushes are good and all till you realize that they'll never have interest in you.
We choose the wrong people because they say/do what we want them to.
It's bad enough she believed everything you said.
"Sometimes saying ""i don't really care"" doesn't always mean that you do and you're hiding it, sometimes it's actually true."
I don't really get along with anyone anymore.
Being an asshole and cold became the new trend.
"Don't push away someone you love, it's one of the worst mistakes you can make believe me."
They talk behind your back because they know they can't really say shit in front of your face.
"If she treats you like a little baby, you wife that girl."
"She was scared that you might do what others did to her once, taking her for granted."
"""It's crazy how wrong you can be about a person."""
"He doesn't know what he wants anymore. If he wants to go on with life, or give it all up."
"I really hate that feeling when someone tells me ""i need to talk to you about something"".."
It's a really good feeling when someone still remembers something good you once told them a long time ago.
But.. we'd take cute selfies..
Being your self is attractive as fuck.
I dont really care if you drink or smoke as long as you can keep a conversation about something besides the fact you drink or smoke..
Let's write poems about each other.
Let's wake up and fix our morning coffee and breakfast together and sit in bed talk about how perfect our morning is.

"La ana ba3d kda hakhrug f bety, fel balakona.. el matbakh.. el talaga.. Kda y3ny."
I could see all the pain you've been thru by just looking in your eyes.
"It's funny how i complain that no one is there for me and when there's someone, I'm like ""nah not you""."
"She doesn't care how many girls you talk to, she only cares if you tell them the same things you once told her."
No one is gonna understand my music taste though.
She smiled while tears come out of her eyes as if she knew it was coming.
"The moment you start to think whether you can trust someone or not, that's when you already know u don't."
God bless girls with cheeks.
Buy me ferakh mashweya so i know it's real.
Why even stress or get upset over someone that won't even text you to see if you're doing alright?
I don't care but being someone's wallpaper is the best feeling ever.
I though being a teenager was suppose to be fun and all.. but it turned out to be an emotional living cell hole.
She faked a smile so good people started wondering.
"One day she's gonna move on and find someone better, and you're just gonna sit there and regret everything you said."
I hate it when people always take the wrong impression of me.
If it was only that easy to just erase some people from your life..
Whenever someone is trying to change for the better the worst thing you can do is remind them of their past.
Her eyes shined like a diamond when she heard you telling her that you missed her.
"One thing i've learned, never lie to a girl because one day they will know the truth no matter how good of a liar you are."

"""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" but what if the cover says it all?.."
Jealous girls will always be the cutest.
She was only trying to get your attention.
"I always act like i don't care and nothing bothers me, but deep down i swear it kills me."
"Maybe it's not the time yet, but one day everything's gonna be alright."
"What's my type? Someone supportive, warm, cuddly, someone i can relax with and all.. But wait, that's my bed.."
"If you can make me laugh, then I'm already 90% in love with you."
Making your instagram private is okay but you have 5000 followers who the hell are you hiding your pictures from
"She's fireworks, you're a nuclear bomb."
We live in a generation where people are never happy and satisfied with what they actually have.. they always ask/want more.
I hate people who answer with an emoji or a one word text.. Like seriously?

Don't do what you don't want people to do to you.
"The more you're polite to her, the more she'll respect you."
"One day you're just gonna be a memory to people, so do your best to be a good one."
She looked at him with fear and regret.
"I always feel like giving up, but then i remember i still have a lot of people to prove wrong."
It's not your duty to explain yourself to useless people.

You gotta love her on her bad days when she's moody and irritated as much as you love her when everything is going well.

A real boyfriend can see the pain behind his girl's smile.
"Just because i look happy, doesn't mean I'm happy."
"- Why did you stop talking to me? - Fuck you, that's why."
Sitting in bed all day cause I'm that lazy.
"Stay. No matter how difficult and an asshole i am, but stay."
- I don't care about looks. - Bitch please..
"I really do understand, but i like acting stupid about everything, it makes it more fun."
"If we don't talk for days, it's obvious that I'm not that important to you."
"My life is just one big ""whatever""."
This weather suits your soul.
She doesn't wanna look at you so she wont think of what you've done to her.
I hate people who come up with excuses all the time.
Silence is better than bullshit.
"She faked a smiled in order to show him that she's doing fine without him, even though it's killing her slowly."
- Will you always be there for me? - Nah.
"Dear parents, not everytime I'm quiet there has to be something wrong okay? Thank you."
The way she looked at him was as if he cut her heart into pieces.
Sometimes i have to remind myself that i don't have to do what everyone else is doing.

Sorry but i don't have any space for kids in my life.
Her blurry eyes were full of sadness and regret.
"Just because he knows alot of girls doesn't make him a player, and just because she knows alot of guys doesn't make her a hoe."
Her laugh sounded like she was crying inside.
"Yes i did change, i became more of my self."
Girls with less friends are the best girlfriends.
You should have showed me more attention when you had the chance.

It's rare as fuck for me to be happy nowadays.
There's a difference between - thinking someone's cute - having a crush - being interested - liking someone - loving someone - being in love

Memories..
Most good things come with the risk of something bad 3amatan.
I'd rather be alone than give someone my everything and end up with nothing.

Never allow loneliness drive you into the arms of someone you know you don't belong with.
"Not every ""sorry"" deserves an ""it's okay"" in return."
Always ask yourself why do you even care?
Food &gt; people.
Some things are better unsaid fe3lan.
Know what's fucked up? Is that we live in a world where being a good person is considered lame.
Text you first? Sorry I'm not that high yet.
"If she doesn't text back, she's waiting for you to double text her."
Nowadays you can be everything somebody wants and still get played with.
Your mind is a beautiful thing to look at.

Originality is attractive as fuck.

Fuck texting.. Come here.
I just can't seem to remember when was the last time i actually cared.
Texting first is just not my thing.
People who don't like coffee are people you don't need in your life.
"Please don't mix being nice with flirting, thank you."
Respect her like you respect your mother and that's how you'll truly win her heart.
Lost respect for too many people.
Love me harder.
Girls should also take the first step you know? It's not always us guys.
I actually feel sorry for the people who tweet something and do the complete opposite of it in real life.
Do you ever wanna text someone 50 times until they answer?
Fast replies badal manekhsar ba3d.
- What's wrong? - What's right?..
I seriously need to meet new people to go out with.
I'd rather do this than go to a party anytime.
My texting speed depends on how important you are to me.
Kill your haters with silence and respect.
Don't let your emotions make your decisions.
People are childish as fuck these days..
I'm actually the type of person you'll completely hate till you have a conversation with me.
"You were everything she wanted, now watch her love someone else."
"You don't text first, we don't talk, el moshkela? Fee gherik haytext first."

"You need to show her what her heart is for, it's been mistreated badly."
The ability to make someone smile should remind you that you still have what someone is looking for.
God bless curvy asses walahy.
Ya alby i ran out of fucks to give.
It never stops hurting does it? - what? Giving her the best of you and watching her still chose him.
"People say that you can do whatever you want, they're lying, they just hope you believe it's true."
Girls who smoke is such a turn on for me.

Someone doesn't have to be perfect to be exactly what you need.
"He's what you want, i'm what you need."
Stuck between i don't know and i don't care.
Reasons i never text first: - I feel awkward. - I feel annoying as fuck. - I feel that the person msh taye2 el gabuni - I hate texting first
It's like almost impossible to find someone my taste.
Finding people you actually like is rare as fuck these days.
"I want you permanently, not temporarily."

How someone treats you at the end of a relationship is far more telling about their character than how they treated you during one.
I can't hangout with people who don't eat as much and as often as i do.
"12 year old me: i know exactly what I'm gonna do with my life, don't tell me what to do.  18 year old me: please help.."

Sometimes your situation will keep repeating itself until you learn your lesson.
"My thoughts are free to go anywhere, but it's surprising how often they head in your direction."
"What's embarrassing is hearing a joke and not getting it, but what's worse is being the joke and still not getting it."
"Be a loner, it gives you time to wonder and search for the truth."
"You can't make friends without getting a few haters, but also remember that haters only hate the person they can't be."
No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness.
"No matter how good you are, you will never be good enough for someone who isn't ready."
It's nice to have someone in your life that can make you smile even when they're not around.
I want to be told the truth even if that shit makes me mad.
Sorry but you're just not allowed to hold my phone unless you're my bestfriend.
Be with someone who would stare at your morning face and messy hair and still thinks your beautiful.
Don't ever get attached to someone you know you may never have a chance with.
"It's suppose to hurt, that's why they call it a crush."

"""Don't allow yourself to become someone else just to be with somebody."""
Sometimes you feel like you want to say everything but you can't because you know it'll never make sense.
My advice is to not give advice on anything you know nothing about.
"We could spend the whole day together, but i'd still miss you the moment you leave."
You know someone means alot to you when their mood easily effects yours.
"Before you follow someone's advice, make sure they're headed in the same direction."
Wife her if: She gets jealous sometimes. She makes you laugh. She is goofy. She listens to you. She trusts you. She loves you.

"If it doesn't matter, get rid of it, if you can't get rid of it, it matters."
Don't call other people ugly because what you say is a reflection of your personality.
That moment when your internet goes off and you don't know what to do with your life.
"I want to drop everything and just travel the world with someone who wants it, just as much as i do.."
"People mistakenly think trusting someone is a choice, trust me it comes naturally."
"Sometimes even the closest people to you, don't know the real you."
"""Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he will never shows to anybody."""
"I think alot, but i don't say much."
"It upsets me how wrongly you treated me, and how you thought it was okay."
The worst mistake you can ever make is walk away from the person who actually stood there and waited for your ass.
"Sometimes it's better to keep it all inside, where the only person that can judge you is yourself."
"You got what you wanted, but you lost what you had."
The worst kind of sad is not able to explain why.
"I ran from who i was, to find who i am."
We all have stories we won't ever tell.
We can't solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them.
Why would anyone stalk me though?
"Sometimes, we come into a persons life not to make them love us but to let them feel that they are so much worth loving."
A person who's jealous and clingy is actually someone who cares the most.
"I just really hate texting people first, i dont care who it is."
People need to start thinking positive for a change.
"If you don't love yourself, you'll always be chasing people who don't love you."

"After the third, forth, fifth chance you gotta realize the person is walking all over you and has zero intentions of changing."
"Come here, i miss you."
"You're attractive and all, but your personality is shit."

Cuddling sounds so good right now..
"If you care too little, you lose them.  If you care too much, you'll get hurt.   3alam bent weskha."

"No matter how angry or pissed off you are, you always forgive the person you love."
"That feeling when someone says ""can i ask you something""."
"Once I'm with you, nobody else matters."
I really wanna be the person you're afraid to lose.

"In a relationship you don't keep secrets, you're together to grow closer, not hide things and ruin trust."

What's going on in that beautiful mind?
It's just so hard not talking to you..
"If i text you 5 times in a row, it means I'm comfortable embarrassing myself in front of you and you should feel lucky, not annoyed."
"So tell me, when you subtweet someone does it make you feel better?"
Somewhere stuck between fuck you and i wanna fuck you.
"Sucking dick and eating pussy is apart of sex, if you think it's nasty then maybe your ass is too young to be fucking in the first place."

"Our generation is pretty fucked up when it comes to trust, loyalty, and relationships."
Those songs that express the feelings you can't say. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Why do girls always go back to the same asshole that hurt her? I just don't really get it..
"Maybe if i ignore you for a while, you'll start to care."
"If i didn't care, i wouldn't really bother arguing with you."
I really hate liars.. especially when i fuckin' kept it real with you.
"To those who have given up on love, i say trust life a little bit."
Nothing hurts as much as missing someone that doesn't miss you.
God bless girls with long hair.

I'm awkward and weird.. Why would anyone like me?
"Guys, do this with the girl you like and watch how she treats you, BELIEVE ME!"
I'm too lazy to text.

"Some feelings just cant be explained, coz it's either very special or very painful."
"I'll fight for you, but i won't compete for you. There's a difference."
"Once you've been hurt by someone, it's really hard to trust or love someone else but fuck it you know? Enjoy life.."
"You're sad? I'll cheer you up, you're upset? I'll love to listen. All you have to do is come to me and you know i'll always be there for you"
Happiness is... Not setting the alarm for the next day.
Texting is boring.
Don't date anyone who isn't proud of you.

I really hate when people think I'm in a bad mood just because I'm quiet..
Just because i don't react doesn't mean i don't notice.
Does it really get better? Or do we just get used to it?..
In the end they'll still judge you anyways so whatever.
"In the end of the day, people are still full of shit."
I wanna wake up every morning with you in my bed.
"Why can't most people in relationships be happy with what they have? Like you have someone good, stop trying to search for more."
"I don't know, nothing feels the same anymore."

"""Stop crossing oceans for those who wouldn't jump a puddle for you."""
What was i thinking when i though we had a chance.
If i take the time to send you a long ass message then i care about you.
If your girl doesn't get at least a little jealous she ain't really your girl.
It's amazing how we can let one person determine our mood for the day.
The best relationships are the ones you never saw coming.
That one bestfriend that turned into a stranger..
The biggest mistake i've made is letting people stay in my life far longer than they deserve.
"Don't beg for anyone to stay in your life, if they want to be a part of your life, they will stay."
I really hate people who play hard to get like really just fuck you.
It scares me that you never know what someone is thinking or feeling towards you and everything they say could be one massive lie.

Depression became my new bestfriend.
There's always that one person that you've had feelings for since the moment you first met them.
I have a personality you will absolutely love or completely hate.
"It's either you're all mine, or not mine at all there's no in between."
Move on from people who keep ruining your happiness.
"I still like you, i'm just tired of trying."
Do you ever take out the trash and feel like you should throw yourself out along with it?
"If a girl says ""wow"" in an argument she's secretly wondering how she could be dating such an idiot."
"Don't need you, but kinda want you."

Find someone who knows you're sad just by the change of your tone in your voice Be with someone who loves the feature that you hate the most
The worst mistake that you can make is to walk away from the person who actually stood by your side.
"When someone keeps playin games, you eventually lose interest."
"I regret opening up to some people, it just bugs me knowing there's a few out there who didnt even deserve to know me like that."
"I don't even get mad anymore, i've learned to expect bullshit."
Friends are turning into strangers.

I hate getting flashbacks from things that i don't want to remember.
We come from a generation where your relationship could possibly be ruined by your snapchat best friends.
"I wish i had someone i could just call at like 2AM and be like ""let's chill, or go for a walk"" and they would do it."
Never make someone a priority when they only make you an option.

"A girl doesn't need to tell you straight up how she feels, it's written all over the way she acts when you're around."
I keep alot of things to my self.
It kinda sucks when people don't realize how much you care about them.
"The more you think about it, the more it hurts."
You dont just give up on someone you love.
"I don't trust words, i trust actions."

I'd rather hear your voice than read your text.
"Lip biting.. Neck kisses, back scratching. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"
I kinda like someone who gets jealous and protective but still trusts me.
It's hard to actually find people that get me.
Every girl deserves a guy who can make her forget that her heart was ever broken.
"My ""walk past you like we never met"" game is strong af."
You don't have to be rich to be romantic. All it takes is a little effort to show her that you really care.
Kinda weird that you can think about someone as much as you want and they have no idea.
I don't let myself get my hopes up anymore because people nowadays always end up showing me i should never trust them.
I should stop stalking you.
🙌
"I wanna roll over at 3AM to a kiss from you, not a text."
We're not friends... We just know each other.
Do you ever leave your phone for like an hour and expect to come back to like 60 texts but you get none? Yea same here.
"Isn't it weird that we have one hand that knows how to do everything and the other one just sits there like ""idk how to use a pencil"""

"LOL I HATE WHEN GIRLS WITH BOYFRIENDS HIT ME UP WITH THE ""you dont text me anymore"" LIKE WTF ARE YOU GONNA TALK ABOUT?!HIM? FUCK OUTTA HERE."
Girls friendzone guys to test if they actually care about them and are going to stick around. Dont leave the second a girl friendzones you.
"If a girl asks you about another specific girl, don't even bother lying. She already know bruh."
I wonder what i look like in other peoples eyes.
A real man never stops trying to show a girl how much he cares even if he already has her.
Let's go on a rooftop and makeout.
Maybe i did get my hopes up too high.
I want to be someone's favorite person to talk to.
Being cold and heartless ba2et el moda.
I think it's cute when someone texts you after hanging out just to say they had fun with you.
"I care about you, but not enough to let you keep fucking me over."
Dont become who hurt you.
"A relationship where you can just chill at each other's house, makeout, cuddle, take pictures, cook, and watch movies please?"
"Being someone's first may be great and all, but being someone's last is just perfect."
"1 text, 1 song, 1 mistake, 1 lie, 1 word, 1 truth, and 1 person could change your mood in 1 second."
"Its not called being whipped, it's called having respect for your girl."
Those who are heartless once cared too much.
I hate when you wanna talk about something that bothers you but you feel like you've already talked about it too much so u just hold it in.
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone how much they mean to you.
All relationship problems would be solved if people just showed their true feelings.
Will you give me your all if i give you mine?
"Yeah i want you, but I'm not going to chase you."
"You only have one dick, so you only need one girl."
"Stop being so cute, I'm trying to be mad at you."
"If you dont like me, then I'm cool with that. Just dont pretend that you do."
I'm so fucking weird.
This generation acts like having feelings is gay.
"People come and go. We start off as strangers, but end up meaning the world to each other. Never doubt, everything happens for a reason."
"The best thing about being single is sleeping around  You can sleep all over that big lonely bed of yours  Left, right, middle, wherever."
I lose interest when i get ignored.
"One day I'm gonna say ""I'm over you"" and mean it."
Having someone you can be yourself with. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I've grown so close to people i thought i'd never talk to and i've drifted away from people i thought i'd be close to forever.
Dont fuck with someone's relationship just because you cant get one.
Do you ever say bye to someone and in the back of your mind you're hoping they'll fight for the conversation not to end?
I need someone in my life that is willing to go out at 3:00 AM just to hang out and talk.
I wonder what it feels like to be someones first choice.
"Sometimes it's not enough to love, some relationships are over before they even start."
"Kiss her in the middle of the sentence, girls love that."
"""If you ever fall in love"""
Ever miss yourself?   The person you were before you had your first heartbreak or before you got betrayed by a person you trusted?   I do.
When you're kissing someone and you stop for a second and smile and kiss again. I cant think of anything more beautiful than that.
"Being bestfrends with the person you're gonna marry is such a blessing, it's like ""hey, let's hang out... Forever"""
Do you ever just all of a sudden feel really alone?
Why overthink when you can over drink?
Every girl deserves a guy that will make her smile and laugh even when she doesn't want to.
"If cinderella can get her prince charming without taking her dress off, so can you."
"Be close to people who make you happy, but be closer to the ones that cant be happy without you."
"If i care about you i'll put myself through a lot till i say fuck it. So, if i give up on you just know it wasn't that easy."
Those type of girls&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Why waste your time getting hurt by someone when there's someone else out there waiting to make you happy?
"Just remember when you're ignoring her, you're teaching her to live without you."
"""I fucking thought about you with somebody else, i dont like that."""
Sometimes you want to protect someone who doesn't care about you while there's others who quietly protect you.
You can do whatever the fuck you want a long as you stay loyal and honest with me.
Do you ever wish you had a second chance to meet someone again for the first time?

"I'm constantly torn between the ""be kind to everyone"" and the ""fuck everyone, you owe them nothing"" mentalities."
"I agree, everything does happen for a reason, but maybe.. just maybe that reason isn't good enough?"
I swear everytime i care for someone they have to give me a reason not to.
"I might like you and all, but I'm still not texting you first."
"If you dont start appreciating what's right in front of you, you may lose it."
"Treat her like a queen, fuck her like a porn star."

Stop worrying about people who ain't worried about you.

How can people sleep at night? When it's basically the best part of the day..

It's better to know and be disappointed than to never know and wonder.
Apologizing doesn't mean that you're wrong and the other person is right. It just means that you value your relationship more than your ego.

The more you push away good people the more you're gonna complain about not finding the right person.
Sometimes the person you want the most is the person you're best without.
Treat me the way you want to be treated.

How can you expect to keep a relationship going if you cant even keep a conversation going?
It is important in your life to know when to let go and move on because holding on is never worth it.
Lets go somewhere where we can be alone.
You cannot force someone to stay and love you if they are no longer happy being with you.
A relationship that lasts? Yea diffidently not in Egypt.
Lets be honest.. Who really gives a shit about you other then your parents and maybe 2 bestfriends? No one.
Sorry but i forgot what its like to have a heart.

Give me one good reason why i should trust you.
If you kiss or suck my neck I'm not responsible for what happens next.
Don't live a dull boring life. Spice it up. You don't have too much of it left.
Just remember i was there when no one else gave a fuck.

I'm not who you thought i was.
I just got prank called by a crying girl telling me i left her.. life keeps getting interesting everyday..
Aly &amp; Fila - We Control The Sunlight. Favorite song of them so far.
Aly &amp; Fila - coming home.
I suddenly started liking trance again.
"I dont know how she took it, but she just did."
Mistakes are painful. But they're the only way to find out reality.
"Life isn't all about relationships and love and sex, it's about becoming someone in life."
"People change, feelings fade, people grow up, personality changes, shit happens, that's all a part of life, start getting used it."
The weeknd - the zone.
I dont know the meaning of pain anymore.
Imagine life without sunlight.
It's usually the small things that count the most.
Snapchat: RahmSalama #snapme #bored and add me ofc. 🙊
Ask yourself What have I done to deserve how they're treating me? If nothing realize that you deserve better and move on.
If you're a slow texter dont even bother texting me.
Bitch how can you not care if all you do is subtweet about me? C'mon.. Be real.
So you like you're own picture on Instagram? You seem cool.
Wesh omik da 3awez yetkatef.
Does he touch you here like this?
If she runs to you and jumps on you while hugging you marry that girl.
"I've never been this cold in my entire life, i guess this is how it's like to grow up."
You need someone to tell you how to feel.
"The beard stays, the hair stays, you go."
The weeknd - Professional.
I dont really regret anything in my life..
"All battles are worth fighting, but some of them just aren't worth winning."
The little cute pie.❤️ Despite the hair.✋
"Yesterday was you're last day in Egypt, i'm sorry for the delay bro, you've been always there for me,"
Snapchat: Rahmsalama #snapme &lt;&lt;&lt; ✌️
Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.
"Life is neither a bed of roses nor a carpet of thorns, it's just what you make of it."
You're the same old song.
People who keep the conversation going are the ones who actually give a fuck.
Why does summer always have to be good at the end?
Well today was interesting..
"Headphones on, weeknd on, walking in the middle of the road like a boss."
Relationships nowadays relay on who texts first.. like seriously?
Edward Maya - Historia de Amor. REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT. @EdwardMaya
"Just keep moving forward, and don't worry about what anybody thinks. Do what you have to do, for you."
The word 'happiness' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.
Am i the only one who thinks Nicki Minaj is ugly as fuck?
Usher - She Came To Give It To You.
Sleepless..
"I'm not sayin i'm perfect, but at least i try my best."
I want iphone 6 already..
I hate repeating my self more then once.
Cold as ice.
Sometimes i just like to keep shit to my self you know.
The only real chances you regret in life are the ones you don't take.
"Knowing when to walk away is wisdom. Being able to is courage. Walking away, with your head held high is dignity."
What a day..
Hello.☺️ #selfie #puppyface
MJ - smooth criminal.
The Weeknd - Twenty Eight.
I'm just dying to see this generation 10 years from now.
I get high for 2 reasons 1: to deal with dumb asses like you. 2: to make reality more fun.
"We're friends,you laugh, I laugh, you cry, I cry, you jump off a bridge, I get in my boat and save your stupid fucking ass."
"Live your life, take chances, be crazy. Don't wait because right now is the oldest you've ever been and the youngest you'll be ever again."
I'm not crazy. My reality is just different from yours.
Sometimes following your heart means losing your mind.
"Life is not a movie, so stop acting like it is."
"They say that life is too short, I just wonder who took the measurements."
I really dont hate sleeping.. but sleeping hates me.
I hate people who think that they can get whoever they fucking want.. Like really.
"No one is really busy, it all depends on what number you are on their priority list."
"Thank God for what you have, trust God for what you need."
"When a girl no longer gets frustrated and upset with you, you can almost guarantee that she doesn't care anymore."
Sometimes its best just to let go.
"Finally got to see you today bro! Been a while, thanks for today, had a great day! ✌️#selfie"
I'd rather sit home with my bestfriends then go out and do absolutely nothing.
Snapchat: rahmsalama #snapme
Love is nothing without any action. Trust is nothing without proof. Regret is nothing without change.
Don't judge my choices without understanding my reasons.
I bet you'd taste better with whip cream on you.
"Bring me a plane, i need to fucking get out of this prison."
"Egyptian girls watchin a romantic movie: *Awwwww i want this!!!*  Me: Bitch shut the fuck up, you wont even hug or kiss your bf in public."
Relationship without sex or sexual feelings? Is exactly like a laptop without internet. Enough said.
"Take my hands, we're going on an adventure."
Lets take a swim in the middle of the night and forget everything around us.
"There are 7,259,164,570 people In this world, a bitch like you wont make a difference in my life.  #SadButTrue"
"I always say ""there is plenty of fish in the sea"" which means i dont really give a fuck."
Gosh i wanna fly a plane so fucking bad...
Most people are struggling to find themselves because they are busy trying to live the life of someone their not.
Everyone will get hurt by someone. Getting hurt is a part of life. Expect to get hurt but don't change into someone you're not because of it
"It's not about who hurt you and broke you down, it's about who was always there and made you smile again."
"Life may not be the party we hoped for, but while we're here we should dance."
Rise of the guardians. 😍
Ya'll so boring. 😂
The Weeknd - Appointment.
"Sometimes when things are falling apart, they may actually be falling into place."
Quick replies so you wont lose me.
I wasted too much time on the wrong people.
#Throwback an unforgettable day. 👍
"Say goodbye to the past, because it's time to move on, it's time to start over."
I hate waking up moody.
Have some self confidence because how can anyone see how great you are if you can't see it yourself?
I gave up hope for this generation long time ago.
"The way to say ""hi"" to Egyptians nowadays is to give them a cigarette."
"I think i'm the only person out there that dislikes Lana del rey, Eminem, boy bands and Soccer.."
Dont waste you're time on someone who's not worth it.
"We all make mistakes, we all make the wrong choices, but we have to move on."
Its very cute when people forget your existence until they need something.
"No matter what they say, dont change who you are."
Bitches be playin hard to get nowadays like smh. 😂
"That moment when your best friend talks to a hot girl and she tells him ""i dont talk to strangers"" 😂"
I'm that guy you're mom warned you about.
"If you dont give me a good reason why you reply late, then i shouldn't give you a reason why i didnt reply at all."
*goes to the same spot and waits for an iphone*
With apps worth 50 dollers and it had no password.. i mean really?..
My best friend found a bran new iphone 5 on the floor.. god loves him.
"Not all girls are the same, and also not all guys are the same."
This generation needs to just... DIE.
"I'm a guy and i'm tellin you, never ever trust a guy unless he proves it with ACTIONS."
"Dear girls: if a guy thinks you're a slut coz you wear hot shorts and tank tops and hugging guys in public, kick him in the balls."
Let's sit and do nothing for the rest of the day.
Jus coz she's hugging a guy in public doesn't make her a slut.. get real.
"Dear people who reply late to texts: You either go fuck yourself, or you delete my number."
I'm so lifeless.. it's pathetic.
"You're bored? good, so am i."
Her voice early in the morning and late at night tho. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ugh.
Let's get high and go out and laugh at people like a bunch of morons.
"Chasing after something that's not worth it, is like chasing after a plane."
I lost interest in you.
"Listening to the weeknd - Montreal for the 2nd night, i CANT GET ENOUGH!"
Boredom just never ends in Cairo does it...
That moment when you and your bestfriend say the same shit the same time tho.. &lt;&lt;&lt;
I just love it when you sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.
My lungs are about to explode.
I really need to stop being so cold hearted..
Burn. Bitch.
"Yes, i like you. No, i'm not texting first."
Lights cut off every hour now? Fuck this shit..
Her sleepy voice tho.
Patience and faith are the two most powerful things that can help us in overcome any difficulties in life.
Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.
Egypt will be the death of me.
Morning.(:
"But baby i'm a pro at letting go, i just love it when they come and go."
I just watch em come and go.. Enjoying it.
I'm sorry but girls if your bf doesn't hold ur ass or slap it then he aint the one.
I really need to tattoo my whole arm.. already fuck....
"You can call me pervert, but girls are also gods creation you know.. That gives me the right to look at em. ✋"
I started checking girls out at age of 7... 🙈
I was just born dirty minded..
"This guy told me once that ""the weeknd sounds gay"" he no longer exists in my life."
It's X'O or get the fuck out.
Montreal. 5 hours now.
I really need to get the fuck outta this country.. I feel like I'm in prison..
"If you want me to sleep, you either get me drunk as fuck or high as fuck. But it's gonna take some hours."
Lets drink till one of us passes out.
"I dont care about my health, i really dont."
Is it weird that i just love smoking all though i know its fucking me up big time?
We can just stare at each other all day and not say a word.
Whats a bed?
What is sleep?
I need to get high to think straight.
If you dislike the weeknd or hate him you cant be in my life. Sorry.
I think i made my neighbours love the weeknd... 😩
A long walk would be perfect right now. 👌
Sleep late everynight and regret it every morning. Typically me everyday for the past 5 years.
I've been legit listening to the same song for 4 hours now.
Who needs sleep when there is wifi and food?
Having a walk with 3 of your bestfriends at 2:00-4:00 Am is the best tbh.
Black. Everything black.
I love jealousy even though I'm not a jealous person.
Arm tattoo and 1 ear pierced. 👍
I cant wait till i get my tattoos and ear piercing.. 😩
Making her laugh when she's upset. &lt;&lt;&lt;
I love it when they come and go.

"Dead God, please take me out of this country. Amen."
"If you really wanna do somethin you'll find a way to do it, if you dont, you'll find an excuse, enough said."
"Don't take life too seriously. Sometimes just laugh at your problems, knowing it's not the end of everything."
Being happy is good but spreading happiness among others is even better.
Worrying doesn't change anything.
"I can fill a whole book to tell you how I feel about you, but I know you won't understand, believe me."
"If i had a farmland full of weed, i would miss my friends. :')"
I want some dark chocolate with 2 blunts and some black coffee please.
I get high so i wont hear bullshit everywhere i go.
The Weeknd - Love through her.
Usher - Numb.
One night stand.
Never run back to whatever broke you.
Her intention is the paper she dont need no fucken love..
She's spillin all this liquor tryna pass me all these cups..
Let's get high while listening to the weeknd and makeout for the rest of the night.
The Weeknd - Outside.
"The person you took for granted today, may turn out to be the person you need tomorrow. Be careful how you treat people."
13 sins.
I once loved driving till i came to Egypt.
Let's play hide and seek naked.
It's so unfair when you love singing but you weren't born with a good voice.
If you dont matter to me then neither does your judgements so you shouldnt even waste your time to judge me.
"Be who you choose to be, not who others choose to see."
"Be good to the people who are there for you, they deserve it."
Patience is the key which solves all problems.
Being in love with someone you know you cant be with is one of the worst feelings ever.
"It's tough when someone important to us starts to ignore us, but its even tougher when we have to pretend that we don't mind."
Whatever happens happens.
I want red eyes.
"Challenge yourself with something you know you could never do, and what you'll find is that you can overcome anything."
Opening my drawer and finds a pack of ciggs when i tho i was out of ciggs WAS THE BEST FEELING EVER!
Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity. They seem to be more afraid of life than death.
"First of all, i was high in this picture so forgive me. Now i was tagged by @mirnaaly_ to do the 20"
Kiesza - Hideaway.
We all have our stories we won't ever tell.
Lets go out now.
I've been dead inside for a long time now.
"Trust me bitch you aint a saint, dont act so fucking innocent."
"If someone doesn't see how dope you are.. Fuck them, their loss."
"“@UberFacts: In Austria, there’s a town called Fucking.” I need to go there."
"Know the difference between promises and memories? We break promises, memories break us."
"To understand me, you have to meet me and be around me. And then only if I'm in a good mood, don't meet me in a bad mood."
Your a great person and i love you &lt;3 — Thank you. :3 but still i'm not. Trust me. :P

"Enta mawold fee America w americne wla your father egyptian ... — I was born in the US, and yes my dad is American."
"When did your parents get divorced and is your mother in egypt — They got divorced when i was 3, and yes she is."
Your a libra? — Yup yup. ^^
Wth? You look 22.. — Life is tough.
Age? — 18 next month.
I wish i was a teenager in the 50's.
Let's lay in bed all day with our phones closed.
And some popcorn.
I want hot chocolate.
So.. who's gonna entertain me all night?
Backstabbers are only powerful when your back is turned.
"Some people create their own storms, then get upset when it rains.. shit happens ik."
"Hun, if you really didn't care about me, you wouldn't spend all day tweeting about me."
"Less friends, less drama."
Life isn't like a box of chocolates. It's like a litter box. Full of shit.
"Maturity starts,when drama ends."
Hiii I think im broken a little but im fine — Okay?
Girls with British accents doe.
If you aint complimented nigga you offended.
Why do you like the weeknd so much? — Whats not to like about him or his songs?
"Howa anta kont fel rehab men kam yom ma3 el wad x? — Ah, meen?"

Anta fin kol da? mesh betrod leh — Meen?
Why u dont answer any more question anymore? — Coz i was bored of askfm.
The Weeknd - Wicked Games.
Never give up on what you really want to do.
2015.. hurry the fuck up?
I hate family gatherings.
Am i the only guy who hates all sports except swimming?
I'm obsessed with the weeknd.
Am i the only one who only listens to the weeknd?
The Weeknd - Twenty Eight. REPEAT THE SHIT ALL DAY LONG.
Asians are hot.
The Weeknd - Belong To The World.
Let's fuck while listening to the weeknd.
Finally i got a goodnight sleep for once...
Why cant i just sleep..
If going to a different planet was just easy..
"I want popcorn, someone make me popcorn."
I wanna either get drunk or high to the point that i dont even remember my name anymore..
"Give people a fucking chance, the more you push people away, the more you're gonna be ""forever alone""."
*Goes to an Egyptian girl* whats your number? i like you. Girl: *walks away* me: and ya'll complain why you dont find a guy.
Why am i seeing guys wearing hot shorts? i mean.. are you that desperate for a guy to fuck you?
Wannabe's... wannabe's everywhere.
"Belly piercings, tats, hot shorts, converse, wide shirts. &gt; PERFECTION."
You want me to respect you? go respect yourself first.
1 question.. WHY DO GIRLS LOOK AT GUYS ASSES?
Searching up a word for it's spelling on google makes me feel so fucking stupid..
Lets go to lala land together.
K.
I'm forever bored.
So... who's going to watch it with me? :'c
"YES YES YES YES! ""how to train your dragon 2"" IS FINALLY GOOD QUALITY!!!"
You dont like me? see that wall? go hit your head in it till i give a fuck.
Why am i so fucking hyper at 1:00 AM? when i got only 5 hours of sleep?
"32 questions on askfm.. fuck it, aint answering shit."
How about you go fuck yourself?
"Enjoy life, coz you're gonna be a teenager only once in your life, might as well make the best of it."
"Get high, get drunk, go to parties, do whatever the fuck you wanna do, coz u aint gonna do it once you grow old ya know.."
"Having sex in your first date doesn't make you a hoe, just like waiting for marriage wont make you a saint."
Let's go to the beach at 3:00 AM and get high.
Drunk in love.
"People change, personality changes, feelings fade away, shit happens, life goes on."
"Hate it when people say ""she's too young for you"" bitch people grow ya know.. they dont stay the same forever."
It's finally September bitches.
To find yourself you must look within yourself and not others.
Forget what hurt you in the past but never forget what it taught you.
Always put your fears behind you and your dreams in front of you.
"If i annoy you, it just means i really like you."
Don't worry if people don't like you. You shouldn't change to be someone that you're not just for other people to like you.
That moment when you're teacher is hotter then the girls in your class.
You either reply fast or dont reply at all.
That moment you regret texting a person because they reply late.
Lets smoke till one of us passes out.
Whats up with the selfie sticks nowadays?
"Everyone has problems, but don't lose your happiness just because you focus too much on your problems."
Remind yourself that it's ok not to be perfect.
"Sleeps at 4 and wakes up now, real cute."
The weeknd - what you need.
Sleepless nights.
My tweets are so boring today.. blah..
Dear boredom; GET THE FUCK OUTA MY LIFE. kbye.
The Weeknd - High For This. REPEAT ALL NIGHT LONG.
Too high for this.
"Never piss off a girl on her period or else you're in deep shit, believe me."
Instagram: RahmSalama
The Weeknd - The Morning.
Let's go to kiss land together.
- Why do you smoke so much?  - Me: Coz people like you exist.
Just posted a photo
The Weeknd - Live For.
"Worrying is like sitting in a rocking chair; It gives you something to do, but it doesn't get you anywhere."
Don't live a dull boring life. Spice it up. You don't have too much of it left.
"Over thinking ruins you, ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry and makes everything worse than it actually is."
King of the fall.
Can i just stay high for the rest of my life?
"Make fun of ""the weeknd"" name and we wont know each other."
Imagine Egypt without Egyptians. :')
I came home to listen to the weeknd in peace.
I'm never going out on saturdays again.
The weeknd - Outside. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
House of balloons.
We be all night.
"It's never to late to start from scratch, you just have to keep your shit together."
Before you say there's no good men Just make sure you are a good woman.
Your mistakes do not define you.
"THANKKK YOUU THANKK YOU, YOUVE HELPED ME IN MY CHOICE, IM THANKFUL =)) — Glad i could help, no need. ^^"

"Write your name in arabic — My keyboard doesn't have arabic in it, but say ""John"" with an ""R"" and an ""M"" in the ..."
What makes girl attractive? — As in looks or personality?
How to be attractive? — Be yourself.
Lets lay in bed all night and make out while listening to music.
Open the lights in my room 1 time and we wont know each other.
Would u lie to a nigga or nah?
Sitting in the dark all alone with a smoke and music is perfection.
The weeknd or nah?
Hello.☺️ #selfie
Watching them cook legit made my day.
"It shouldn't really be called a ""sleepover"" since i never actually sleep.."
A house without food but alcohol and hash.. yea.. what should i expect?
"A sleep over with 2 idiots is gonna be fun to watch, long ass night, let the fun begin."
How about no?
Lets get high.
Massari's voice doe..
The Weeknd - Rolling Stone. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
"Someone told me once ""the weeknd's voice sucks"" they are no longer in my life."
"*opens twitter, see's @egyptianweirdo tweet about trance all day, throws my phone*"
Am i the only one who dislikes Lana Del Rey?
I wish i could get a tattoo in Egypt and feel comfortable walking in the streets.
Waking up moody isn't a good start.
Boredom.
The Weeknd - King Of The Fall. REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT.
I really need to relax.
"If God wanted us all to judge, we would have all been born with a gavel in our hand."
"Life is filled with surprises, you just have to cut down your expectations."
"Things change, friends leave, life goes on."
A word of truth that may hurt for a while is better than a lie that will later hurt for a lifetime.
"You can give without loving, but you can't love without giving."
"Remember that you just have to make the first step, the rest will come along."
It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like so long as somebody loves you.
"Love yourself and be proud of everything that you do, even your mistakes. Because even mistakes mean you're trying."
I luv ur hair — Thank you.
"What happened am so confused — Nothing, some kids wanted to show off."
3awza ashoofak tanee — Okay.. but who are you?

The  best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.
You  shouldn't give up. Fight for yourself and who you are. You've got to go through the worst times in life to get the best.
Sometimes  laughing isn't something you do for fun. Sometimes it's a relief when you have nowhere to run

Feelings? Ain't nobody got time for that?
"Young or old, I will always get worried if my dad didn't answer his phone right away."

I am who I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.
Its 2013 why does food still have calories...

I dont care.
If your life is a MESS clean it up.
The more I try the more I start to think that you don't care.
"Be weird, be random, be who you are, because you never know who would love the person you hide."
What am I doing? I'm doin me.
"Ya, we all do wrong things, we all fuck up, we all make mistakes, no body is fuckin perfect, so don't pretend to be one."
"Its so hard to trust people nowadays.. Best friends now, strangers tomorrow."

When someone means the world to you. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Make a girl feel like she's something and she'll make you feel like you're everything.
It's annoying when people try to tell you what you said.

Don't talk about how much you love God if you don't even go visit Him at his house.
"If you can't love my past, my flaws, then I don't need your love at all."
I have more conversations in my head than I do in real life.
The hardest thing is having to choose between internet and sleep.
Sometimes I wish that I could go back to being a little kid where happiness was only a cookie away.
I love it when you share everything only with me.
Sorry I am not okay. Sorry I am not perfect. Sorry I am not that good. Sorry I am not him.
Telling a girl to calm down works about as well as trying to baptize a cat.
"Life is about doing the things that make you happy, not the things that please other people."
"When kids watch horror movies, parents usually tell them that this shit is not real, they should have said the same for romantic movies."
It's sad when you've already learned to be a part of someone's life and then end up being strangers.
Better days are coming.
Loving 2013 already.. ♥
"We have so many masks that we put on everyday,that we realize we no longer know which one is real."
Stop focusing on past memories and START creating new memories.
"Nobody is perfect, life aint easy, you'll never know what people are going through. Stop judging and criticizing."
If you put someone above you don't be surprised when they start acting like you're beneath them.
You're face...I like that shit.
You don't have to wait for a new year to better yourself. Why put off until tomorrow what you can do today.

Thank you music for being there for me when everyone else isn't. :)
I feel alone on this planet sometimes...
Dear Insomnia please let me sleep.
In the end you only have yourself.
"Don't talk, just do."
I've been down this road too many times before.
That moment when your sitting in bed wondering what to tweet about. &lt;&lt;&lt;
When people are honest with you. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
When in the world gonna end? I'm sick and tired of fake ass people.

#MentionSomeoneIMiss @HAGGAR_HESHAM :3
I'm sorry I'm not perfect.
I hate people who just sit there and pretend everything is gonna come for them.
I dont like missing you...but I love having you to miss.
The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something when really it's all you seem to think about.
We are still alive... O.o damn I wanted the world to end today.

Being hurt so much leads you to become the person you never thought you'd be.
"I am what I am, if you don't like me, turn your head, and walk away, simple as that."
It's funny how little information I need on someone before I decide I don't like them.
Watch who you make fun of. You don't know their past.
Doesn't matter where I come from or my look. All that matters is who I am inside.
We should only judge by what they do rather than what they are.
Yes I trust people but I never trust no one as much as I trust God.
"It takes courage to stand up to your enemies, but it takes much more to stand up to your friends."

I keep on faking a smile just on the simple hope that one day it will turn into a real one.
"You may have been through more than others, but its how you react to that pain that defines you."
People intend to forget mistakes that they made...but they never miss opportunity to point out others mistakes.
Good things fall apart to allow better things to fall in place.
The more you hide your feelings for someone the more you fall in love with them.
Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing; some people are not even worth your words.
Confused.

Im jealous of people who get to see you everyday and i dont. -.-
Hoes be wearing more make-up than clothes now a days.
"I love it when I see old couples together, because it makes me believe that true love does exist after all.."
"God first, family second, friends thrid, me last."
I thought watching you leave was hard. But knowing you weren't coming back was harder.
Life is like a confused teacher...first she gives the test and then teaches the lesson.
I should stop being so nice cause some people just seem to take it the wrong way.
People say follow your heart...but which way do you go when your heart breaks into two?
Lost with no directions in a world with no instructions.

"We all have have that person in our life, we can't live without."
Just say fuck it and move on.
I'm gonna put a video camera in my pocket next time to see what my headphones do. *tired of un-tangling* :(
One of the wired-est dreams last night.
Night. x ♥

I'm done trying.
"Its not hard saying ""I love you"", its hard proving it."
"If you put me down once, I'm never coming back twice."
Its wired and funny how people can change in 1 day.
Sometimes the smallest things can mean the most.
People always prove to me why I shouldn't hold on too long.
"Don't ever be embarrassed to hold/hug/kiss your girl infront of any one, fuck the world if you're together."
I wish I can tell you that I want you.

"Life is a one time offer, use it well."
"DON'T use her, just to get over your ex."
"You look sad, buy yourself a happy meal."
Work hard for what you want...Play hard with what you have...
"I love listening to lies, when I know the truth."
Just because someone doesn't worship the same God as me that doesn't make them a bad person.
Aint gonna beg you to stay aint gotta ask you whats wrong. Aint no reason in chasing something thats already gone.
"Mr luck, can we be friends for a while?!"
Cuddling in bed and listening to music. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Never wait for a man/woman or a bus...there will always be another one.
I can choose to let my past define me or I can choose to move and leave it behind me.
The only difference between me and you are the choices we make.
"I don't know why they call it heartbreak, it feels like everything else is broken to."

It really hurts knowing that you give a lot and not get much back.

Don't waste your moments with people who don't deserve a moment of your time.
Santa saw your Facebook status's... he's getting you a dictionary for Christmas.
You should not be asking what the point of life is. But what you want for yourself out of life.
When do you get used? As soon as you show people you're nice.
If you wake up in a red room with no windows or doors dont panic...your in my heart
"12/12/12 - same shit, different day."
"Whenever things start to look up, someone throws all the shit from your past in your face."
Im tired of liking people who are pretending to like me.
"Life is like a sport. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but the game always goes on."
That moment when you just feel like crying because you studied everything except for what the teacher put on the test...
There's always that one person who can send you a text &amp; cause you to smile instantly.
If you're man enough to lay down and make a baby... then you can stand up and be a father.
"Friendship isn't about whom you have known the longest it's about who came, and never left your side."
Shit just got real.
Life is such a bitch sometimes...
Every single time I trust someone they prove me why I shouldn't.. #smh.
Everyone has his/her own opinion and taste in everything. Don't judge.
Relationships where you tell each other everything. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
#IWishPeopleDontSay YOLO in 2013.
"If you never try, you'll never know."
Don't pretend your someone your not.
Once I care about someone I really fuckin care.
"I don't stop when I'm tired, I stop when I'm done."
"Dear 2013, please be a special year for all of us."
"Before 2012 ends, I just wanna say, it was a bad fucking year."
#MentionCuteCouples me and my bed. &lt;3
We talked about old times and it made me smile because you didnt forget.
"HOLD ON - two worded, hardest thing to do in a relationship that seems to be going nowhere."
Bad decisions make great stories.
I dislike people who think the world revolves around them.
One day you'll realize I'm the one who's always been there for you.
Spending a long time writing a really long message then accidentally pressing the back button.
Love is not something I can give. It's something you have to earn.
"If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse."
There's only 2 options: Make progress or make excuses.
People's bullshit and fakeness are why I usually like being alone.
Saying whats right or wrong isnt judging.
If you're going to talk shit at least spell correctly.
"I was going to give you a nasty look, but I see you already have one."
Sometimes I wonder if your ass is jealous of the shit that comes out of your mouth.
"If you want to make your dreams come true, the first thing you have to do is WAKE UP."
"Isn't it weird how people talk shit about you, when the only thing they actually know about you is your name."
Don't waste too many I love you's because by the time it's true it won't mean that much anymore.
I make time for people who make time for me.
People get fake when shit gets real.
I'd rather have no friends than fake friends.
"It's hard to move on, when memories are pulling you back."
"Death kills you once, fear kills you repeatedly."
Stop discussing your problems with people that are lower than your answer.
A girl worth kissing is not easily kissed.
I love how it's December and no one even cares about the end of the world anymore.
Your hate is not worth my time.
"I dont blame anyone one for breaking me down, I just blame myself for being so nice."
Dear flu: please stop coming in the days i go out in...
"Looking at grandparents and thinking ""will I ever find someone to live my rest of my life with"". ♥"
"Im not a fly, which means im not sticking around your bullshit."
I live my life like I want to...I don't care about what others would say.
People hate to see you move on just as much as they hate to see you happy.
"I admit... I hate these thoughts I can't avoid, these feelings I can't deny."
My dad thinks i'm only one the person who spends all day on the internet.
"People who judge, are the ones who need to take a good hard look at themselves first."
Fuck second chances. People never change.
I just love being myself because there is only ONE ME in this world.
Thank god there's no relationship status on twitter.
People miss you more when they see how much happier you are without them.
Wake up every morning with the thought that something wonderful is about to happen.
"Remember, God put those obstacles there for a reason, you should always learn from the ones you trip over."
That annoying moment when you cannot find the long side of your blanket.
"When I say I'm not going to wait for you forever, It means hurry up before I give up."
Life doesn't get easier. You just get stronger.
I really wonder what you say about me when I'm not around...
"People who you love the most, hurt you the most."
When your wish finally comes true. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
If all the guys are the same.. Then who told you to try em all?
words&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Actions.
"A 3 a.m phone call. Were you asleep? No, I was skydiving..."
Its crazy to think someone like you would be with someone like me.
That LIKE A BOSS moment when you get the right answer and the smart kid doesn't.
The one thing I've figured out is no one has it all figured out.
There are certain people who no longer belong in your life no matter how much you want them to. You know who they are. Let them go.
"Like me? tell me, Hate me? tell me, i might not live till tomorrow."
Closed books don't open the mind.
"Love me or leave me, just take it or leave it, it's not that I'm needy, just need you to see me."
Before you complain about life think of someone who died too early on this earth.
"Honestly, I would prefer to look back at my life and say, I can't believe I did that.. Than instead of saying, I wish I did that..."
Making faces at babies when their moms aren't looking because it feels like the right thing to do.
I could tell a lie to make everything okay but it just makes the truth harder to say.
Happiness is for everybody no one deserves to be sad for any reason.
Don't make a person fall for you if you have no intentions of catching them.
"Everyone has a dream, i have one, and i promised my self i would do it someday, i hope that someday is soon. &lt;3 (being wired) i know. :)"
There might not be tomorrow so let's do it tonight.
"Dont take me for granted because unlike the others, I'm not afraid to walk away."
Sometimes I can't stop thinking about you but other times I wonder why I even waste my time.
"We love people that hurt us, and hurt people that love us."
"Never say ""That wont happen to me."" Life has a funny way of proving us wrong."
Good Morning. &lt;3
"Roses are red, violets are blue, you treated me like shit and guess what? Fuck you."
Many will judge you without ever meeting you. That's their loss not yours.
#GoodAfterNoonEveryone. &lt;3
Over time you learn that not everyone can be called a friend.
Doing the moonwalk is the only way to look cool while wiping dog shit off your shoes.
"Don't waste time on jealousy sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind."
Some call them haters...I call them my motivators.
Its better to try and fail than to never know and always wonder.
"Sometimes, the things we can't change end up changing us."
Saying I love you doesn't always fix everything.
"Maybe one day, I'll be what you need. But don't wait too long.. Because the day you want me, may be the day I've finally given up."
#HomeSweetHome what a great day with friends. &lt;3 @ahmedmazzika12 &amp; @tito_little_her thank you guys so much!
"Finally out of #TahdeyaCaslte and going back in a few hours, it was really good, no fights no nothing, god bless #Egypt."
"I once had a grip on everything, but it feels better to let go."
"Pain is the only thing that's telling me, I am alive."
"I can't make you love me If you don't, because you can't make your heart feel Something it won't."
That awkward moment when you text the wrong person something sweet.
"Of all the liars in the world, sometimes the worst are your own fears."
"Dont let what people have to say get you down, what you think is all that matters."
A pretty girl with an ugly personality is nothing compared to a ugly girl with a beautiful heart.
Life is hard; it's even harder when you're stupid.
It's so hard to make the first move when they don't even know you exist...
Don't start dating someone by wearing a mask or you may end up spending a lifetime on stage.
Sometimes removing some people out of your life makes room for better people.
"We live in WTF generation - Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook."
"The best memories are the ones where you think back and ask yourself ""What the hell was I thinking?"""
Pray.
Shit happens. Just flush the toilet and move on.
"Be strong when you are weak, brave when you are scared and humble when you are victorious."
People will never learn the easy way..
"Let us all take a moment and pray for #Egypt and what's happening here, god bless them and us."
Had a great day with my #Friends back home and tired AF.. #Goodnight.
"I was smiling yesterday, I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow. Simply because life is too short to cry for anything."
"I'm going to start letting go, and hope for the best. :)"
We do dumb things while we're young so we have something to smile about when we're old.
Live while we're young...i'm forever young.
I'm jealous of my parents. I'll never have a kid as cool as theirs.
You'll never know how much you'll miss someone...until they are actually gone...
"In a few months, I'll probably laugh at myself for caring so much."
There should be a 'feel sorry' button on twitter for some of the fake lifestyles people tweet about.
Relationships are sometimes friends forever.
I'd tell you who I am but I'm still trying to figure that out myself.
"Stay strong, positive and keep on smiling. You will see a big difference."
"Itll cost nothing to dream, and everything not to."
"Don't take people for granted no matter how much they love you, people get tired eventually."
Finding true love is like finding a star in a cloudy sky.
"Had such a great day, thanks to my friends at #TahadeyaCastle #Egypt God bless us."
#OUT on my way to #TahadeyaSquare god bless #Egypt.
Feel it. Believe it. Dream it. Be it.
I hate waking up wondering why am i thinking about yesterday.
I wish it rains today.
Here's to the people who have stopped dreaming and started doing.
RT for a goodmorning mention. :)
Morning. &lt;3
#SomethingThatMakesMeHappy ; Music. ♥
"It takes a minute to like someone, an hour to love someone, but a lifetime to forget someone."
"If you aren't happy being single you will never be happy in a relationship. Get your own life first, then share it"
"Sometimes I just look up, smile, and say, I know that was you God Thank you."
Nowadays people say I love you just like they are saying hello.
Never lose yourself while trying to hold on to someone who doesn't care about losing you.
"Sometimes, it's not the person you miss. It's the feeling you had when you were with them."
You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time.
Be weird. Be random. Be who you are. Because you never know who would love the person you hide.
"Spend life with who makes you happy, not who you have to impress."
Just because something isn't happening for you right now doesn't mean that it will never happen.
"Respect people's feelings. Even if it doesn't mean anything to you, it could mean everything to them."
"Don't lose hope. When the sun goes down, the stars come out."
Don't judge someone just because they sin differently than you.
Stop being so afraid and start living instead.
"Make mistakes, take chances, be silly, be imperfect, trust yourself and follow your heart."
Often in life we forget the things we should remember and remember the things we should forget.
Don't make me regret everything we've been through.
Allow me to be the reason behind your smile.
Life full of fake people before you decide to judge them make sure your not one of them.
That moment when a friend magically transforms into a stranger.
"Smile, trust me it's free."
#Back.
#BRB.
"It's much easier to turn a friendship into love, than love into friendship."
"Understand then Accept, if not at least Respect."
Don't respect people who make a promise. Respect people who keep theirs.
"It's called Facebook, not Boobbook So next time, try to get your face in the picture too...thanks."
"I wish people would be honest and say "" hey, im coming into your life to fuck it up and leave."""
"To be honest, I feel like shit when you ignore me."
I'd rather be honest than impressive.
"Before I go to sleep, I start imagining things that I would like to happen."
Some nights I lay in bed and imagine what I'd be doing if you were with me.
The best memories come from bad ideas.
A quick reminder that the world should end in 18 days. #Bullshit
Having a dream that are so realistic that you have to think about if it really happened.
"You can never ""just be friends"" with someone you fell in love with."
"Pretty words are not always true, and true words are not always pretty."
"Sometimes, I wish I could read your mind. Then I wonder...if I could handle the truth."
The truth about a fake smile ; it doesn't make you feel any better.
"Oh, you took 10 mins to reply? it's okay ill take 20. :)"
"Never forget what people say when their mad, cause that when the truth comes out."
Being popular on Facebook is like sitting at the cool table in the cafeteria at a mental hospital.
I hate how spiders just sit there on the walls and act like they pay rent...
"When someone says everything happens for a reason, I'd like to smack them and say, ""Yeah, I guess you're right."""
Being such a good cook that even the fire alarm cheers you on.
No man should ever make eye contact with another man while eating a banana or lollipop...
"When someone says ""I like your shirt."" I look down to see what I am wearing."
It's really rude to talk while I'm interrupting.
"Oh, you lost your cell phone on vibrate? If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it. #Dancing"
Whoever said nothing is impossible...Never tried to staple water to a tree.
"MY GRADUATION SPEECH: ""I hate all you fuckers, I'm out."""
Life is a lot like toilet paper. You're either on a roll...or you're taking shit from some asshole.
"When I'm wearing a brand new outfit, I walk out the house feeling all good..."
My cat raps. His name? Wiska lifa. #LOL!
"I wish facebook would notify me when people delete me, that way I can Like it."
I think car horns should sound like gun shots....I bet you'll move then.
#MentionSomeoneBeautiful @HAGGAR_HESHAM  :3
"The moment where you're like, ""WHO THE FUCK TOOK MY, oh...here it is..."" #LOL"
"Damn this shirt looks good..""Checks price tag"" fuck that shit.."
"I've always wondered why it's called a walkie talkie, yet a vacuum isn't called a pushy sucky?"
They said the world is going to end this year...Right... -.- They can barely predict the weather.
Slut jokes are just whoreable.
When I have children I am going to make them watch the movie 2012 and tell them I survived that like a Boss.
"Domino's Pizza: ""Now made with real cheese!"" Me: What the fuck did you use before!?"
#HomeSweetHome. &lt;3
I hate waiting for something I know it will never happen.
For once I wanna go to school without being tired.
Goodnight. x ♥
"Ah well.. i'm bored, #brb."
Teacher: DO YOU WANNA SPEND LUNCH IN MY CLASS !? Me: Are You Asking Me Out?
"I'm not saying she's a slut, but I tried to put her name as my password and it said ""Error: too easy."""
Home alone; Thoughts = Party!!!! WOOOHOOOOO!!! Reality = Peeing with door open...
"If she thinks 69 is just a number, she's too young for you bro."
X's and O's for my ex's and hoes.
I hate people who say 'Age is just a number'...Age is clearly a word.
My first tweet in 2013: Is any one alive?
Teacher: Why are you talking during my lesson? Me: Why are you teaching during my conversation?

"My idea of a good morning is one when I open my eyes, take a deep breath, then go back to sleep."
"If alcohol kills millions of brain cells, how come it never killed the ones that made me want to drink?"

"If Tumblr and Twitter were school subjects, my parents would love me."

Being nice and being flirty are two diff things. I hate when people get them confused.
'Do you have a phone?' Translation: I want your number but I don't want to make this awkward.
"You flirt with everyone else? Cool, my turn..now lets see how you feel."
"When you see someone really attractive and you're just like damn, I really wouldn't mind getting to know you."
I dont believe that love comes to those who wait. Today love comes to those who flirt.

Covered up in bed and cuddling with you pillow in the cold = best feelings ever. ♥
That feeling when you get a goodnight text knowing that you're on their minds before they go to sleep. &lt;3
"I chose you &amp; you chose me, was that not enough reason that this was meant to be?"
"Just watching your grandparents hug each other makes you wonder... ""will i ever be like that someday?"""
"I see those couples...you know, the ones that are so in love. Makes me wonder if I would ever be like that."
Love should be something that LAST Forever and not LOST forever.
The ability to bath a cat is a martial art.
Whoever said you can't buy happiness forgot little puppies.
Did you ever walk into a room and forget why you walked in? I think that is how dogs spend their lives.
I want a relationship where we can lay down beside each other and just talk all night. #Dreams
Always wear your cute pajamas to bed you'll never know who you'll meet in your dreams.
"Celebs walk on the red carpet because they are famous, but me and my best friend walk on tissue paper because we are the shit! #LOL!"
"She said, I've never kissed a stranger. I said, I've never kissed a angel."
I'm not a perfect person. I make a lot of mistakes. But i really appreciate those people who stay with me after knowing how i really am!

A day without you is like a year without wifi.
"Memories last forever &amp; never do they die, true friends stay together &amp; never say goodbye."
Dreams are just thoughts you had during the day.. That would explain why I dream about you so much.

"They say 'A Picture' Is Worth A Thousand Words but I think they're wrong when I looked at yours, I was speechless..."
An angel without its wings is just a friend in disguise.
"Don't worry, don't you cry, I promise you no more lies, I'ma keep you satisfied, until then, just dry your eyes."
Nothing's as mean as giving a little child something useful for Christmas.
Trade in your broken heart for a fresh start.
My best friend and I can communicate just by facial expressions.
"If my love for you is a crime, I want to be the most wanted criminal."
'Us' I like the sound of that.
"I hate all alphabates but I love ""U"". =]"
A smile is a curve that makes the life straight.
The best date is to be with someone who can take you anywhere without touching anything but only your heart.
Having 20 girlfriends isn't swag...having 1 girlfriend and 19 girls chasing you is.
Never tell a girl that she looks like or reminds you of your ex girlfriend.
When your girlfriend has Taylor Swift lyrics as her status either you've done something very right or very wrong.
Dying seems less sad than having lived too little....
Time will come that you need to forget everything and start with nothing.

"There are two sorts of romantics: those who love, and those who love the idea of loving."
I think one of the most romantic things that anybody can do is draw a portrait of the person you love.

Know how to live the time that is given you.
You can never plan the future by the past.
"If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?"
The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.

"The longer you wait, the longer you'll last with each other, always take your time in everything, dont rush, no one is running behind you."
You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back.

"Oh, you love a guy and youre 15 years old? that's cute, lets see how long you gonna last shell we? XD"
Do you have to have a reason for loving? nope.

"Giving your girlfriend your hoodie when she's cold, is one of the most sweetest things you can ever do to her. &lt;3"
What the world really needs is more love and less paper work. &gt;.&lt;
Love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few.

"If you push me away once, don't expect me to be running back to you."
"Girls nowadays all they do is ""the angel emotion"" it's like.. ""Gtfo"" but in a nice way."
I like staying up late coz I like how quiet it gets.
Why can't relationship be as good as they are in movies? &gt;.&lt;
"Sitting there wondering, when is this gonna be over?"
I'm the kind of person that always has my phone in my hands and headphones in my ears. ♥
That annoying moment when you can't find a place to park you're car. &gt;.&lt;
"I hate when people say ""I'm sorry"" for something, then a week or month later they do it again."
I'm the kind of person that cant smile in pictures.
Moments last forever.
Everyone feels better when they cry.
May god make things easy for our brothers and sisters in gaza. :)
No body wants to wait forever.
I'm the kind of person that needs to learn how not to care.
Best feeling in the world is having the person you always wanted.
"Sometimes I pretend I don't give a shit, but trust me, inside of me is just dying."
"People say what they don't do, talk is cheap, show her/him that you care, they won't stay forever waiting for your ass to make the move."

"I'll just act like I'm not jealous, and ill just try to forget what happened."
"I can't promise I'll stay forever, but I promise ill always be there for you."
Pain changes people.
I really don't like talking about my self a lot.
I'm the kind of person that likes to keep everything inside of me.
My own insecurity is what drives me to impression.
"If you like me, don't just tell me that and expect me to believe it, show me."
"Once I have you, don't make me regret it please."
#Back Goals? DM me.
#TiredAsFuck
Goodnight. ♥ x
Any good apology has 3 parts: 1) I'm sorry. 2) It's my fault. 3) What can i do to make it right? Most people forget the third part.
If someone doesn't care there are others that are dying to meet someone like you.
Why do people get mad when you treat them the same way they treat you? i dont get it.
4 days weekend.. #whew &lt;3
Friendship is one mind in two bodies.
A friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself. &lt;3
A true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down.
You need imagination in order to imagine a future that doesn't exist.
Dreams come true when you follow your heart.
"Live out of your imagination, not your history."
That moment when you get friend-zoned by the one you like.
It's really hard to find someone that truly cares about you nowadays.
Woman: She needs a man with good future. Man: He needs a woman with good past.
I'm really tired of thinking too much about things i know deep inside that it wont really happen.
You change your life by changing your heart.
Don't let the fear of striking out hold you back.
What you dont know is that every time i see a text from you i just automatically smile like an idiot.
When someone makes you smile. &lt;3
"If you like me tell me, dont be scared to say how you truly feel about people."
"#Nap time, brb. :)"
A film cost $31 million. With that kind of money I could have invaded some country.
Faith: not wanting to know what is true.
God didn't make a mistake when He made you. You need to see yourself as God sees you.
Once your happy life has to ruin everything for you..
#Confused  :S
"Some girls are like covers... good on the outside, shit on the inside (not all)."
"Yeah your beautiful, but your inside is shit."
It's good to be home. &lt;3
I never wanted any thing else but for you to care. :)
Morning. ♥ x
Goodnight. x ♥
"Sometimes in life, you find a special one. Someone who changes your life just by being part of it."
When you realize you've lost them forever &lt;

this song is just great...
"Even if you fall on your face, you're still moving forward."
"Do it now, or you might never get a chance to."
"Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later."
A baby is God's opinion that life should go on.
Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.
All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.
My mind is playing tricks on me lately. #Confused
Slept too much.. idk if i can sleep at night or not. :(
You can always change the future but you can't change the past .
It's really sad how people can change that fast.
Back. &lt;3
Everyone wants to feel like someone cares.
"Its wired how people can change... Yesterday we were best friends, today we are strangers."
"Let's make a deal, you be mine, and ill be yours."
"Say what's inside of you, before it's too late, people aint gonna wait forever."
That mood when you don't know any thing what so ever.. Empty headed. #ShitHappends
That moment when all the memories just hit you.. Damn that shit aint nice.
Sometimes I wonder.. Why does overthinking just ruins everything? O.o
"Once you care about someone, its hard to move on."
Sometimes you just gotta forget it and move on no matter how hard it is.
Can't sleep.. :/

Goodnight beautiful people. &lt;3 x
We live in a rainbow of chaos.
"Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it."
Cant study shit for Geometry... :/ #Failing :&lt;
"Tough times never last, but tough people do."
"Before I refuse to take your questions, I have an opening statement."
There are more people who wish to be loved than there are who are willing to love.
My father is the only person i can depend on. :)
Old friend: We should hang out sometimes! me: Sure just tell me when your free. Later on.. never happens. :)

"Just trust yourself, then you will know how to live."
"For every good reason there is to lie, there is a better reason to tell the truth."
"What's mine is mine, i dont like sharing."
"We can change our lives. We can do, have, and be exactly what we wish, but its needs someone who is willing to."
Only god knows how i truly feel.=]
Missing you is becoming a habit...
"Want the most amazing and inspirational tweets? Follow ----&gt; @Drakee_YMCMB &lt;3 ill follow those who follow him, (checking) ;)"
You change your life by changing your heart.
"I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. =]"
"We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. =]"
"I'd rather be just ""friends"" then loosing you."
"A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil, people think its the other way around."
"Be faithful or stay single, don't break someone's heart over someone who doesn't deserve."
Change your thoughts and you change your world... simple.
Believe you can and you're halfway there. =]
That moment when your just too lazy to get off a chair. #Laziness
"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'."
#Nap time. &lt;3
"Hate seeing tweets saying ""I want this"" ""I want that"" just shut the fuck up and appreciate what you already have.."
"It's not the having, it's the getting. =]"
Failure is success if we learn from it.
"Think twice before you speak, coz words can hurt."
Home sweet home. &lt;3
The best thing about a photograph is that it never changes even if the people in them do..
That feeling you get when you see the person you like talk to other people. &lt;/3

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired its you that I'm missing.
"My Phone = My music player, FB, twitter, chatting, internet, life. ♥"
You won't know if you didn't try.
I truly miss being happy.
Mexican songs are the best. ♥
Who cares?.. They will just find someone better then you someday.
Loud Music + laying down in bed eyes closed = fuck the whole world around you.
Those cute memories that just pop out from no ware. ♥
"Don't hide your feelings for too long, coz the person might move on."
"Just coz someone is happy from the outside, doesn't mean their happy from the insdie."
Grandparents are the most sweetest thing ever. ♥
I miss my grandma. :(
"I know I aint the best, but trust me.. I aint like the rest."
Just close you're eyes and tomorrow will be better. (:
Everyone dies someday.
Seeing old people happy together just makes you wanna be like them someday. ♥
Sometimes I wonder when are people gonna start growing up?
Slow music + bad mood = best thing ever... ♥
"Once you care too much, get ready to get hurt too much. :)"
"If I'm jealous and I always tell you to do things, its cause I actually give a fuck about you, you should be mad when I don't. :)"
Me in bad mood = don't bother talking or get ready to get mad. :)
I can't find words to describe how much I like you and care about you.
"That mood when you just say ""fuck this, fuck that""... :s"
That moment when you just feel like giving up.

A woman's mind is cleaner than a man's: She changes it more often.

"""you are my one in 6 billion"" bitch please, i dont think you will say that if you see a hot girl pass by."
Unforgettable moments with your friends. &lt;3
"I dont always die.. but when i do, i dont."
I'm a bad influence.. but damn i'm fun. ;)
There's always someone that will listen to you. :)
"Every smoker has a story, so before you tell him ""smoking kills"" i want you to know that something is already killing him."
"Oh.. im sorry, i forgot i only exist when you need something from me or your bored."
Everything is different now.
"Those ""umadbro"" moments. &lt;3"
"Just g""I""ve me time and i""l""l get ""OVE""r ""YOU"". :)"
I dont care for people who dont care for me.
Expect nothing and you will never be dissapointed.
If you care about what other people think. you will never live.
"Someday, somewhere, somehow, me and you. will be together. :)"
Just do it. Tomorrow.
Train your mind to do the right things or your mind will just be the same.
Always think before you do.
What goes around comes back around...
"Some people just dont come the easy way, you have to yell, scream, curse so they can listen.. #Weirdos"
"Dear people who smoke and dont have a lighter or a cigarette, please dont bother smoking. :)"
3 more days for the new twilight.. #waiting
Math: Mental abuse to humans. :)
The body says what words cannot.
#Done Studying at last... #whew
"It's all make believe, isn't it?"
I've never dropped anyone I believed in.
Life is just a bowl of pits.
"Once your in a good mood, someone has to come and ruin it all for you."
That moment when you just wanna listen to any kind of music to relax.
When Lyrics talk about how you exactly feel. &lt;3
#Naptime &lt;3 brb.
"All I can do is be me, whoever that is."
"SMILE, and pretend nothing ever happened. :)"
"Life is hard. After all, it kills you."
Someday i hope i become the reason you smile.
A kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years.
Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.
The future ain't what it used to be.
"A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake."
A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same.
Know how to live the time that is given you. Dont waste it.
You can never plan the future by the past.
"Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."
A baby is God's opinion that life should go on.
Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.
"Well, I gotta tell you: I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that, because the person who wrote that... is dangerous. #LOL"

Sitting in class is more boring then sitting on the floor at home. &gt;.&lt;
#School Time. &gt;.&lt; Brb.
☐‎​T̸h̸e̸ w̸h̸o̸l̸e ̸w̸o̸r̸l̸d ☑ God. ♥
Calling someone an idiot doesn't make you the smart one.
Goodmorning. ♥ #Coffeetime
#Offline
#Bedtime Goodnight. ♥
Stop thinking about the easy way out.
#boredom goals? Dm me.
Learn from your past and think about you're future. (:
"Relationships = lots of drama, lots of fights, jealousy, lots of crying, getting hurt a lot, but most importantly, finding love. ♥"
"Being single = no drama, no crying, no bad feelings, no fighting, no arguing about stupid stuff, and most importantly not getting hurt. :)"
You can tell how someone feelings on their face and their way of talking. Not everyone can fake everything.
Everyone wants to show-off nowadays. It got old.
"I hate those ""what if"" moments."
I need google in my brain and Anti-virus in my heart. (:
Everyone will find the right person someday.
"Maybe I'm in the wrong place, or maybe people are just too stupid to understand things."
"If you won't take me for who I am, then go ahead and look for someone else. I'm sick and tired of people tbh."
"Life is just a lesson, when you die, there is an other life waiting for you."
As teenagers we got no idea what love is until we become adults.
Show her and prove to her that she's the only one you want in you're life. Words are cheap. :)
Old friend: we should hang out sometimes. Me: sure just tell me when. Never happens.
That 1 song that makes anyone cry. (:
Hiding under the blanket when its cold. Best feeling ever. ♥
Looking in someone's eyes for a few mins. ♥
Sometimes I ask my self why do I care?
"If I'm a player, then who's the coach? :)"
I wanna go to a place where there is no one and just forget the world and relax my mind. :)
"Caring and liking the wrong person hurts a lot. And in the end, you gain nothing."
#studying brb.
People will know who you are after you're gone.
"I wonder why when you treat someone with respect and being nice, they think your playing with their minds and shit... #mindblown"
"Calling a girl beautiful or cute, is way better then calling her hot, sexy, smoking hot, makes them feel different at least. :)"
Being single is way better then letting someone give you some memories and leaves in the end.
Relationships won't last forever if there is no trust or love.
I'm a player? Nah I just love to flirt all day long. :)
People need to stop worrying about having the sexist girlfriend/boyfriend and worry more about their life and future.
"I don't think ""love at first sight"" exist's in this fucked up generation."
Sometimes there is no words to describe how you feel.
#justwokeup and I feel really dizzy for some reason.. O.o
#Naptime &lt;3
"There's a big difference between being nice and being romantic, some people just dont understand that."
"When i flirt with a girl doesn't mean i want her or date her, it means i like her as a friend, nothing more."
Home from school. &lt;3
You just lost my respect.
Sometimes you gotta let-go the things that mean the most.
"Bored and got nothing to do? Go downstairs for a walk and listen to music, you'll feel better. (:"
When the time is right ill tell you everything that's on my mind. ♥r
That moment when you just being with someone you like. ♥
"I love making people laugh and be happy, that's my job. ♥"
Teacher: why do I hear talking? Me: Coz you have ears duh!!
Sometimes you just gotta forget those who hurt you. ♥
My history teacher is damn hot... #LOL

"#boredom gonna go ahead and sleep, night folks. ♥"
That moment when your teacher thinks your the one talking and your not. #Pleasedie #LOL
Everyone has that 1 annoying friend.. If you don't than its you.
"Too much players, too much fake people, too much lies.. Shit. #idontwanttoliveonthisplanetanymore"
Feelings feelings feelings.. Just fuck offf. #LOL
That moment when you just wanna get high just to forget the world around you.
Everyone makes mistakes and everyone fucks up most of the time... But that's fine. Nobody is perfect.
#LOL at people who show off infront of girls to show how idiotic they are.
I love how people treat you bad for what they see without even knowing shit about you...
You know.. Smoking kills.. You know.. My grandma lived for 104 years.. Smoking? No.. Minding her own fuckin business.
Anger and jealousy changes people.
"They say pictures tells 1,000 words, but when I see yours all I see is 3: I... love... you... ♥"
Once you stop giving a fuck they come running back to you like a bitch.
Don't trust people that easy... Most of em are fake now.
Thoughts and ideas comes in my mind when I'm mad.
That 1 person who makes you feel special just the way you are. ♥
I miss old conversations when we fight about who misses the other more.
People should wake up for once in their life and see what the fuck is going on around them.
"People grow up, and minds stay the same.."
Everyone's mind is about sex nowadays.
"When your single, no one wants you. When you're in a relationship everyone wants you.. #mindfucked"
Girls who are shy with you. ♥
"I just want to hear "" I love you "" but only from 1 person.. Idc if she means it, I just wanna hear it from her. ♥"
Something are just not meant to be... And the worst thing is.. You can't change it.
Late night Conversations are always the most romantic ones. ♥
#boredom does kill after all..
My mind is empty as a empty cup for some reason..
Bestfriends + Lovers = Relationships that don't end. ♥
Friends who make you laugh when your down. ♥
#sleepy goals?
"People come and go, don't stick with the ones who don't give a fuck about you."
#new avatar ;)
Had a great day with friends. &lt;3
#homesweethome #studying :'(
"I've been on so many blind dates, I should get a free dog. #sad :P"
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.
"As for me, all I know is that I know nothing. :)"
A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband.
I had 2 nightmares last night... o.O :'(
Goodmorning. &lt;3 #Coffeetime
#Sleeping Goodnight everyone. &lt;3
RT if you remember this song? &lt;3 XD
#workingout
Dont ever say things that you cant do.
Fake people will stay fake all their lives.
Things dont just come and disappear.. they have a reason.
Its funny how most people tweet about things that they never do in real life.. #LOL #wiredpeople
That moment when your too #lazy to get up from bed.
I wonder why actors make Relationships so perfect in movies.. o.O
I wonder when we all grow up.. and have kids and have our own lives.. and look back on how we are now.. what are we gonna say?
Some songs change people's life and way of thinking.
If im wired around you means im comfortable  with you. &lt;3
Everyone is someones dream.
#sigh
I put a tear in the ocean when you find it I'll stop loving you.
Distance doesn't break love no matter where you are.
"Beauty is like a book, it cannot be judged by its cover."
"The only ugly faces, are the ones we make."
What you feel is what you are and what you are is beautiful.
"Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it."
There is no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs.
The best advice is this: Don't take advice and don't give advice.
I miss someone so much..
#back dm me.
#today was amazing. ♥
#raining ♥
"I refuse to let you see me cry, but we both know i'm not that strong."
Want to let stress out and relax? Get dressed and go run around you're house 3 times.
"Once you have feelings for someone, its really hard to forget it."
"You can't just make me like you, and then leave."
Loving the weather today. ♥
I'd rather be single then being with the wrong person.. but again.. being with the wrong person is a step closer to the right one.
Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.
"I have no plans, and no plans to plan."
#awayforawhile :3 be back later. :)
That moment when you don't know what to tweet about. O.o #fml
Dear food: I love you. &lt;3
Gotta love the weather in the morning. &lt;3 thank you god. &lt;3
Sitting outside at 6:00 AM in the morning in the quiet is always the best time to think about anything.
I hate being confused...:S
"You tripped me, so I fell for you."
People tell me there's plenty of fish in the sea. But who wants to date a fish?
"You always stop and stare, why not just take a picture?..."
#Coffee #Balcony = Best thing in the morning. &lt;3
Should I smile because we're friends or cry because that's all we'll ever be?
"Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again? :P"
"Hey I just realized this, but you look alot like my next girlfriend."
"Its okay if people let you down, just smile, be strong and get back up. =]"
"Are your legs tired, because you've been running through my mind all day long."
From A to Z all that really matters is U and I.
Roses are red Violets are blue The sun is hot And so are you. &lt;3
Did the sun just come out or did you just smile at me?
"If nothing lasts forever, will you be my nothing?"
The spaces between your fingers are meant to be filled with mine.
"If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we aren't really living."

Everyday is a gift.
"Sometimes I wonder if I died today, what would people say about me?"
"You never know when you're going to die, so thank god everyday for everything. ♥"
"I'm the kind of person that gets jealous really easy, so don't get mad at me."
Don't let go someone who is always there for you.
"Nickelback, You have completely changed my life upside down. ♥"
I know the feeling of being alone. I've been there.
"Fake friends, fake people every ware..."
Only god knows if I'll be with you.

Texts late at night are always the best.
"If you've got a talent, protect it."

What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
"The most effective way to do it, is to do it."
"Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there."
Well done is better than well said.
It's always too early to quit.
Never complain and never explain.
"If your thinking of giving up, dont, give it just one more time."
Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
That person you cant get off your head. &lt;3
"If people bring me down, its okay, im strong enough to get back up."
Finally Home sweet home. &lt;3

I remember the 1st day I got a dog.. I was really happy.. I wish I can get that feeling once again.
I remember those nights when you stay up late with the person you like. ♥
I remember when we use to laugh.. About nothing at all.
Those nights that you wish it never ends.
That moment when you just wanna sleep to change your mood.
Is it me or is It you? I know I've said things I didn't mean.
Feelings just don't go on their own... there is a reason for everything in life.
Texting that person all day and never getting bored. ♥

"Without music, life would be a mistake."
"If food were free, why work?"
"One should eat to live, not live to eat."
Anything is good if it's made of chocolate.
It's okay to eat fish because they don't have any feelings.
In a relationship you have to open yourself up. #dontgetmewrong
I'm deeply in love with a person i dont know yet.
A relationship requires a lot of work and commitment.
I got through my teen years by being a bit of a clown.
You've got to grow up sometime.
As a teenager you are at the last stage in your life when you will be happy to hear that the phone is for you.
It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.
People don't notice whether it's winter or summer when they're happy.
"Never look back, learn from it."
"Winning is not everything, but wanting to win is."
Nobody can give you wiser advice than yourself.

Watching Prometheus #movietime &lt;3 #brb
My life needs editing.
Fashions have done more harm than revolutions.
"I wear a necklace, cause I wanna know when I'm upside down."
I drank some boiling water because I wanted to whistle. #Flo-rida
"Life is hard. After all, it kills you."
My fake plants died because I did not pretend to water them.

"Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company."
"A day without sunshine is like, you know, night."

"If you can dream it, you can do it. #Followyourdreams"
"If you're going through hell, keep going."
Just because everything is different doesn't mean anything has changed.
Things do not change; we change.
"If there is no struggle, there is no progress."
"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself."
"As I grow older, I pay less attention to what people say. I just watch what they do."
Love is the flower you've got to let grow.
"Come live in my heart, and pay no rent."
A girl/guy knows the face of the girl/guy they loves as a sailor knows the open sea.
Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.
"You are always free to change your mind and choose a different future, or a different past."
Whoever is happy will make others happy too.
You change your life by changing your heart.
"I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best."

A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil.
"Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain."
Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.
"When words leave off, music begins."
Music should be your escape.

I never like to make plans. It's nice to just hang.
"When you're young, you're always wondering when you're actually going to feel like a grownup."
"It is nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice."
"I just don't want to die alone, that's all. That's not too much to ask for, is it It would be nice to have someone who will care about me."
"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?"

Sometimes we just run out of words to say.
"I love you, not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you."
Once your happy.. there has to be something that ruins it.
The life and love we create is the life and love we live.
"When you love someone, you love the person as they are, and not as you’d like them to be."
"We cannot do great things on this Earth, only small things with great love,"
I hate it when i see you talking with an other guy...
Sometimes there isn't words to express your feelings.
"If you hold my hand today, i promise i wont leave it tomorrow."
"If i stopped caring, you would figure out your self."
That mood you get when you got no idea where you stand..
Your beautiful. &lt;3
Everything i said to you... is what's truly inside of me..
I never stopped thinking about you for a min.

When friends make you laugh when your not in the mood. &lt;3
I only respect those who respect me. :)
"The worst feeling isn't being lonely, it's being forgotten by someone you would never forget you!"
I will be happy someday.. i hope. =]
Please dont judge me. :)
The awkward moment when you can't tell someone is being sarcastic ;)
Awkward moment when there's only 24 hours in a day... :P
"why should i worry when i find you happy without me? :) go ahead, live your life."
Girls who get jealous. &lt;3
"I'll pretend you dont exist, and let's see if i exist to you. :)"
Sometimes the reason why we hold on to something so tight is because we fear something so great wont happen twice.
It is better to be alone. than being with someone who makes you feel alone.

Life is unfair. That's why we have dreams.

"Texting isn't enough, i want you here."
"Your the one who pushed me away, so dont expect me to come back."
"Always think before you talk, you never know how deep is your words."
"Life is full of bullshit, full of haters, full of trash.. just pick the good ones and stick with them."
"I wont promise you something, that i know i wont be able to do, so if i promise you i'll stay, i'll stay no matter how hard it is. :)"
"funny how people stay for a while, and leave once their bored..."
"Dont hide your feelings, its just an other way of saying ""go find someone better then me""."
That moment when you have so much  feelings for someone and they dont even give a damn lol..
"People think i change with them... i dont, i just let it go and move on. :)"
Girls with green eyes... « ♥.♥
I won't change for any one.
I'm a pro at fake smiling. :)
"I didn't change, I stopped caring for those who don't. (:"

Feeling unwanted sucks...
Morning. ♥
"Adjeuiwsajndlkasdfgey ""what?"" ""Nothing, I'm bored"". :P"

Time passes quick when your thinking..

"If this is our last chance, let's make it worth it."
Everything happens for a reason..
Long Conversations at night. ♥
I can't sleep..
I wanna start fresh.
"All I need is someone to hug me and tell me ""everything will be alright""."
Time to move on.
"If you didn't talk for 1 day, then you don't have to talk at all next time."

"Thanks for the memories, time to move on. :) bye."
"Its okay, there is other people, you're not the only one. :)"
Don't ask me to be nice while you're being a bitch.
Love lasts forever only if you both dont play games.
Distance shouldn't matter if you both love each other.
That 1 song that exactly talks about your life.
Any new movies to watch? ;)

Worst moment ever is finding out that your crush likes someone else...

"Dear Twitter, thank you for being there when no one else is."
RT @Aku_nayaa ♥
God is there for you no matter what the situation is.
You'll know when I stopped caring..
Nothings better then home sweet home. ♥

Once you don't give a fuck... They start caring.. *i don't wanna live on this planet any more* :'(
Girls who get jealous. ♥
Girls with leggings.. ♥♥
I feel like dancing.. #Dancing
I miss those old conversations where you stay up all night talking about everything.. ♥
Thinking about that 1 person that you know you will never have...
Retweet for a shout out. ;)
Dear feelings.. Move on please.
Girls with an open mind. ♥
"No women no cry, get drugs get high."
Sitting there thinking.. What the fuck am I doing in this country?...
"If today was my last day to live, what would you're last words be?"
Some times I wonder if any one cares..
"When I was young I wanted to be older.. Now that I'm older, I wanna be young again."

Life gets harder everyday.
Morning. ♥
I can't sleep... Hjsdfhjedledjh. :(
"Goodnight everyone, love you."
Life will never be fair.
All my wishes will be real someday.
Don't ever say something you know you can't do.
No idea what else to say.. :o
"Don't expect me to be nice to you, while you're just stabbing me in the back."
I love you dad.
You can't change something that's meant to be.
Dear feelings.  fuck you. :)
A Big Fuck For The True Love Which lead us to hell ..
Bored... :/
Some times you have to get lost ... to find your self.
I liked you since the moment i saw you.
"If they're never there for you, stop being there for them."
I hate people who joke around with the person i like.
Life is just a bitch sometimes its not even fuckin funny..
"If you're mine, can you stay mine forever?"
"Hey vegetarians, my food shits on your food."
"The next time you shave, could you stand a little closer to the razor?"
Don't get me wrong. I`m not trying to make a monkey out of you. I can`t take the credit
Nobody says that you are dumb. They just say you were sixteen years old before you learned how to wave goodbye.
Ordinarily people live and learn. You just live.
You must have a low opinion of people if you think they're your equals.
"If we were to kill everybody who hates you, it wouldn't be murder; it would be genocide. :P"
"If you were orphaned when you were a child, I feel sorry for you, but not for your parents."
"They say that two heads are better than one. In your case, one would have been better than none."
I hear you pick your friends to pieces!!
I'm not actually this tall. I'm sitting on my wallet--and the dead bodies of people whose brains I've eaten.
November is here... Time to hibernate. :P
My favorite hobby? eating food. :)
"You're never alone, God is always by your side no matter how bad/good you are. &lt;3"
Only god knows if i'll be with you. :)
"If u still talk about it, u still care about it."
People who dont give a damn are always fun to hang out with. &lt;3
"Without trust or respect, it'll never work."
The best things happen when you let go what's familiar...
"If its not happening, it means you're not ready for it yet."
"People come and go, if someone doesn't give a shit about you, just move on... there are 6 billion people for god sake..."
"If i like you, ill tell you, if i dislike you, ill also tell you... im not shy to say the truth. :)"
Its really hard to explain what's really inside of you..but sometimes you just gotta say it. :)
Thank god for everything. :)
Once i stop caring... i stop.
"I never ask for much, but when i ask for 1 thing.. i never get it.. :/"
"Nothing is better then sitting at home, cup of coffee, laptop, and on twitter. &lt;3"
If I don't give you any attention its because I don't give a shit any more. :)
Look at you go.
Hello - Evanescence. ♥
"Laying in bed, listening to music, thinking of someone... ♥"
"If you take my hand, I promise Ill show you a place you've never seen."
Jake Miller. ♥
Sitting in bed thinking at night for hours just makes it all worst...
Sometimes I think all the people are same for some reason or not..
"Everyone gets hurt in a different way, don't think you're the only one that does."
I won't promise something that I won't do.
"Hearing your voice just for 5 minuets a day, will make me feel much safer."
There's nothing better then home sweet home. ♥
Me + bed = best relationship ever.
What a boring day..
"People fall in love everyday, and people get heart broken everyday."
""" I'll be there until ur heart stops beating ""-Jacob Black"
"Sometimes I wonder if I die today, what are people gonna say tomorrow?"
Not a day goes by without me thinking of you.
Good Morning. ♥
Sometimes its really hard to say whats truly inside of you..
I love people who try to keep the conversation going no matter how wired it is..
finally home from the hospital.. what a day.. :/
I got no more to say.
Its nice to have friends by your side.
Talk is cheap... I want something real.
Jake miller = future eminem.
That mood when you feel like no one cares about you..
"Coolstorybro, maybe I should get some popcorn and listen to your bullshit a little more. :)"
"I need more haters, the old ones started to like me."
How is 2012 end of the world when my yogurt expires in 2013..
Thank you music for being there for me when no one else was.
"If I get to see you 5 minuets a day, I'd be happy."
"If I like you, I want you, and only you."
Life is a lesson.
"Money can't buy happiness? Yea it can buy chocolate, almost the same."
Sometimes you just gotta let go.. And move on.
I gotta learn how to move on..
I try so hard.. But I don't see that you care...
Always the wrong persons teach the right lessons of life.
Don't say something you aint gonna do.
"You only live once, might as well live it up."
That mood that you don't care about any one any more.
You can't change something that's not meant to be.
"When your happy, you listen to music, when your sad, you listen to the lyrics..."
Once I learn from my mistakes I don't do it again.
"You only live once, mind as well live it up."
Goodmorning Everyone.♥
I Love you. ♥
"If you like me, tell me."
I wanna do something no one has ever done before.
Caring too much for the wrong person is just like holding a knife inside you for a long time.
"I like being alone, at least I don't get hurt easy."
Love songs make you feel unhappy.. Unwanted.. Alone... Metal songs make you feel like you wanna throw a rock at a person.
"Thank you ""LOL"" for being there when I got nothing to say."
"Hahahahahahah.... ""What?"" ""Nothing"". :)"
Sometimes I feel like I don't matter to any one...
"I don't fuckin need any one, god is always with me. ♥"
Ya Rab ! ♥
Fuck it. :)
I love how people treat me like trash..
"If I tell you ""I like you"" its coz I like what's inside you."
"My only problem is, I love too fast, and I care too much."
I hate my self sometimes and its not even funny..
Don't waste time with people who don't deserve. :(
"Trying not to love you, only makes me love you more."
I'm trying not to love you.. But its just too hard..
"If I ask you to forgive me, that's only coz I want you. ♥"
"If I leave now, don't expect me to come back."
Sometimes you just gotta let go... :/
"I get jealous, I fight a lot, I do all kind of stuff.. But that's only coz I care."
"If I don't care, then I won't tell you what to do."
The only reason I'm on twitter is coz I can say what's inside me without caring who knows.
A relationship without trust is like a car with no gas.
"If you think that just sitting and waiting for the right person to come, then your wrong, go and find him/her. ♥"
"Being single isn't always the best, but you'll find the right person someday."
"Single? Nope, in a relationship with ""freedom"". (: ♥"
"If you think I'm like the rest, please don't talk to me then... You got 6 billion people, enjoy."
"Don't love too much.. Coz you'll end up alone, and you'll get hurt too much."
Looks like you don't even give a flying fuck.. But oh well.. I'm not gonna loose any thing.
"If you don't do something you've never done, you'll never learn what's wrong and right."
Once they see you happy with an other person that's when they will want you the most.
"Once you move on, they will want you back."
"Life is too short for regrets, just be happy and smile and move on."
"you're only young once, so do as much as you want coz life is too short."
"Its okay to do the wrong, we are teenagers, we do everything wrong."
I never mean to hurt any body.. But some people just deserve it.
Imagine how the world would be if everyone cared..
I'm always here no matter what goes wrong.
"When I promise something, I never break it, never."
"I can't promise you the best relationship, but I promise I won't leave you alone."
Things always come in my head at night..
The past isn't a mistake if you learned from it.
Be the type of person you'd want to be around.
"It's not about finding yourself, It's about creating yourself."
Never rely on another person.
"If u don't go after what u want, u won't get it. If u don't step forward, ur always in the same place."
Trust your gut feeling more than your knowledge of things.
"There's a point in life where u realize who mattered, who never did, and who always will."
It's crazy how we always end up where we're meant to be.
Music is medicine.
"Think before you speak. Once you say it, you can't take it back."
You eventually end up where you're meant to be.
Damn it feels good to lay down after a long day.
The beginning is always the hardest.
Sometimes latest nights are the most productive nights.
The little things you do are what people remember the most.
It's never too late to start something new.
Waiting for it to happen doesn't make it happen.
Don't judge choices without understanding reasons.
"Before u talk... Listen. Before u react... Think. Before u quit, Try."
Success kills haters inside more than anything.
Being one step ahead is everything.
"I never regret the past, only time wasted with the wrong people."
"When u stop giving a damn, They start caring."
Bored? Me too.
"If you ever feel left out, pray."
"If you don't care about me, there is someone someday that will care about me."
"Im-Possible, make it possible."
"Your not alone, god is always beside you."
I promise ill be there when you need me. &lt;3
Happy halloween everyone! ♥
Wohoo!!! 5 mins till Halloween!
Sometimes its just not meant to be.
"For every dark night, there's a brighter day. - tupac"
"Dead or alive, who cares?"
Sometimes you're only choice Is to let go. :)
Thank god for everything. ♥
El7.
"If love isnt a game, then why are there so many players?"
"I never needed you, I wanted you, there's a difference."
You can tell if a girl is interested in you by the way she texts you.
"I didn't text you to exercise my fingers, I want a damn reply...."
Good Morning. ♥
Night folks. ;)
"Don't ever think that I'm stupid, I can just mind fuck you all day long."
Words can kill.
"Some people care, some people will stay some will leave, some will ask for help, and some will use you.. All kind of people."
Not all the people are the same.
Who knows what tomorrow can happen?
Idk if I should throw a shoes or a rock at your head so you can wake up.
"If someone truly cares, they will say, they won't be shy or ashamed of their self with you."
Some people just don't understand.
Twitter = The only place I can say my true feelings.
I can't wait till summer.. ☀♥
"I need to leave this country, I really can't take it any more.. O.o"
Stop Wasting Your Time With People Who Don't Care..
Goodnight. ♥
♥.♥
Who cares?
Only takes 1 special person to let you do things you don't want to.
"Someday, someone will come in you're life and will change it."
Always be happy with what you have.
"If they won't stay, don't bother try."
"If someone doesn't like you, who cares? There will be someone who will."
"If I'm not enough, then I hope someone else makes you happy. :)"
"Sometimes its hard to move on, but you have to."
Idk what else to do.
Sometimes you just don't know what's your part in life.
I hate it when someone else flirts with you.
That person you can't loose feelings for.
Am I not good enough for you?
"If someone doesn't feel the same about you, move on."
Always the wrong persons teach the right lessons of life.
"The worst feeling is the person you like, likes someone else."
Bored. :(
"When I say ""I like you"" means I want you with me, and I want us together, but when I was ""I love you"" I want us forever."
I don't get why I care so much..
"When you like someone you try your best to get their attention, but when they don't care, just move on."
That person you text all day and never get bored. ♥
I like people who keep the conversations going.
Goodmorning. ♥
"There's always a real reason behind every ""just wondering"""
"When your past calls, don't answer it. It has nothing new to say."
Keep Calm and believe in God.
A hug from you right now would make my day.
Music is my escape from the bullshit in life.
All people want is to feel loved and appreciated. Why is that so hard to find these days?
Goodnight everyone. ♥
That person you think about before you sleep. ♥
Never let go someone who is there for you.
Only people who care can really see how you feel.
"Seek first to understand, then to be understood."
Remember me? I use to mean something to you.
When the person you like text's you first. ♥
Maybe some day people's mind will grow who knows.
Oh you're the strongest dude in high school? Tell me more when you're 21.
"Thank you music, for being there for me when I'm down."
"I promise I won't leave you, like the stars don't leave the sky."
If you're crazy then what am I? O.o
"If you hold my hand, I promise I won't let-go first. :)"
"Someone is reading this right now, and you're beautiful."
Don't waste your time with someone who won't give a fuck about you.
"People come and go, so if someone doesn't give a fuck, just move on."
I can't care if you can't.
Sitting at home is better then going out and do nothing..
You got a secret? I think I know it.
You judge me by what I'm wearing? Damn you must be really cool.
Shit happens all the time.
"Never never... Say ""this is unfair god""."
Always thank god.. For everything.
I will not give way for those who try to make me unhappy.
Words are mostly meaningless.
"Instead of wiping away ur tears, wipe away those who made u unhappy."
"Ask me nicely, don't make demands."
Sometimes you have to think about your own life and do what’s best for you.
"Girls can be dogs and players too, it goes both ways."
"My heart, my mind and my body want you and only you."
I love winter clothes.
Keep your head up and keep moving forward.
Leave if they're offering you LESS than you're worth.
"I'am difficult, but I Promise am worth it."
Sometimes I just wish you are here.
"I miss our old conversations, our old jokes, our old fights.. I miss you."
Always search for people who won't leave you.
Never leave someone who cares about you.
Great day with friends. (:
Home sweet home.
I wont care if you won't.
Girls with beautiful personalities will always be the prettiest ones.
Sometimes we don't notice the beauty of things because we're too busy trying to create it.
Control my own destiny.
"When u stop giving a damn, They start caring."
Live every day like its your last chance.
"Good things fall apart sometimes, So better things can fall together."
Say what u mean. Mean what u say.
"You only got one life, Do the most with it."
It doesn't matter who you used to be... Only what you've become.
"I'm ready for this, I'm ready for that."
I blame movies for my high expectations of relationships.
I hate feeling like I'm not good enough for the person I like.
That scary moment when you start to feel attached to someone.
Slow replies make me think you're talking to someone better than me.
"Sorry for trusting you, I wont make that mistake again."
"I Think a lot about her, but I don't know if she really does. :("
"I may not be the best, but I’m definitely not like the rest. (:"
"Let love come to you, be patient. In fairy tales they don’t find each other until the last page."
"""Weed is Illegal"" Yeah, so is the music in your ipod..."
Why bother caring when no one else does?
I constantly check my phone for no reason.
"If I'm weird around you, that means I'm comfortable with you."
Retweet for a shoutout. (:
"Get real with me, and ill be real with you."
I wish you could care like I do. :(
"Sad thing is, sometimes I feel like I'm nothing."
I always get hurt in the end.
I care to much and I love to easy. ♥
"I don't ask for much, never did, never will. =]"
Some things are just meant to be.
Never give up on something you want.
"No matter how hard it is, ill try my best to help."
I'm always thinking about you. ♥
I never wanted any thing more then for you to care.
Always think before you say any thing.
"If you truly Like/Love someone, prove it to them."
"Life is never easy, but always try ur best in everything you do."
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Sometimes I just can't get you off my head..
I wish I can hold your hand and never let It go.
"man, people need to stop hating &amp; start worrying about themselves."
"Be thankful for every opportunity, and use it to the fullest."
Letting go is never easy.
Live &amp; Learn.
Goal? Dm.

Amen.
"Yes I'd come for you, and only you."
"You make your own luck, Good &amp; Bad."
Things change. Accept it &amp; Move on.
Choose to make yourself better each day.
Everyone has a bit of a guilty side.
Don't worry about tomorrow... Tomorrow will worry about itself.
There's always something behind everything.
"Life doesn't always give u 2nd chances, So take the 1st one."
Do what makes you happy.
The past is never a mistake if you learned from it...
I'm always trying to do better than I did before.
Don't let someone who gave up on their dreams talk u out of urs.
Never limit ur challenges. Challenge ur limits.
I love driving at night. It's less crowded on the roads.
"If you can't find a way, make one."
"Fear stops you, Courage keeps you going."
Choose to make yourself better each day.
Don't wish. Do what you can to make those 'wishes' become true.
Never make decisions when ur mad.
Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself.
"When you think you can, you can. When you think you can't, you can't."
If you keep doing what you've been doing... You'll get what you've always got.
You're more aware of what you want when you experience what you don't.
"Success is not the key to happiness, Happiness is the key to success."
"If you think you can do it better than me, Go do it."
Keep going forward.
Fear is what stops you. Learn to have courage.
Pay no attention to those who say it can't be done.
Everyone seems normal... Until you get to know them.
"If you're not getting someone's attention, Don't give them yours."
"If you don't believe in yourself, Nobody else will."
Some want it to happen... Some wish it'd happen... Some make it happen.
Always think before you react.
You can't judge them without knowing them.
"Before you point fingers, make sure your hands are clean first."
As long as it's worth it... Never walk away from it.
"Give up, Give in, or give it all you got."
Believe in the impossible.
Having great time with friends is all I need.
Don't let go of something that's worth holding.
"I learn, I don't regret."
I can't stop thinking about someone.
Can't sleep... :S
Things are different now.
Forget what's gone... Appreciate what remains... Look forward to what's coming next.
"When you believe in something, nothing should stop you."
Things aren't the same... &amp; That's fine.
Not everything needs to be changed.
"If something's meant to happen, it'll happen on its own."
People who gave up on their dreams try to talk you out of yours.
"Let them hate, Never let it phase you."
"Never look back at the past, only learn from it."
"It's good to listen to others advice, but in the end you gotta make up your own mind."
The person who thinks too little usually talks too much.
"Learn from ur mistakes, But never regret."
If you keep doing what you've been doing... You'll get what you've always got.
Learn from Yesterday. Live for Today. Hope for Tomorrow.
Focus on your successes and learn from your failures.
Not everything needs to be changed.
"If something's meant to happen, it'll happen on its own."
Never allow your life to be controlled by someone else.
Life's too short to think about those who aren't thinking about you.
Keeping shit hidden only hurts yourself.
"Never look back at the past, only learn from it."
"Let them hate, Never let it phase you."
"It doesn't matter where ur from, only where ur going."
The best time to do something is before someone else does.
"Life is short, While you're living... You gotta go out &amp; Do what you love."
Stay surrounded with people who make your life better with them in it.
"All you need to say is ""thank you god"" and he will be happy. :)"
"Always thank god for everything, some people don't have any thing at all."
Real friends will stand beside you no matter how hard the situation is.
"That mood when you say ""fuck all the people"" :/"
People need to open their minds and wake the fuck up.
"Life is a bitch, its okay tho."
Me and my bestfriend = epic comedy.
"If you're mine, you're mine, I don't like sharing."
Ill stay no matter how hard it is.
Happy Eid everyone. :)
"Life aint never easy, and its never how we want it, but never give up."
"Be thankful for each day, because not everyone gets to see another one."
"When you're right, Some people will always accuse you of being wrong."
"What ever you want to do, Do it now. Tomorrow isn't always guaranteed."
People will either hate u for it or love u for it.
Every new day is another chance to do something amazing.
You can't judge them without knowing them.
"Less hate, more love."
"Never look back at the past, only learn from it."
"Live,Laugh,Love.♥"
"Do whatever you can , with what you have and where you are!"
"I hate when you get a text and think it's from someone you really want to talk to, but then it's someone else."
Stupid conversations make sense when you're talking to someone special.
Forget what others think &amp; Do your own thing.
"If you're not prepared to take risks, you can't expect to see results."
Never stop doing your best.
The most important thing is to enjoy what you do.
I'm not mad at you... I'd hate me too if I was you.
What you see depends on what you're looking for.
Other people's opinions shouldn't become your reality.
The greatest risk is not taking one...
"People don't change, they only become who they were meant to be."
You have to be the change you want to see in the world...
There's a difference between knowing the path &amp; walking it.
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished.
Trust that everything has a reason.
Keep your mind open to the bigger picture.
"Everything isn't meant to work out, Sometimes we have to learn the lesson."
Always stay with people who care about you.
You're single?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Me too.
"Relationships nowadays: 1st week: I love you baby, 2nd week: forever baby, 3rd week: single."
No one really gives a damn.
"If you truly like me or care about me, show me how much it takes."
I guess you like someone else. :)
I don't give a flying fuck any more.
"Prove it, and ill believe it."
Love is such a beautiful thing.
"if someone left you, don't go back, you'll get hurt again."
She's always going to be the best ill ever have.
"""I love you"" is such a hard thing to say to someone."
"Who gives a shit, they will ALL leave in the end and leave your ass."
Goodmorning and goodnight texts. ♥
I wonder how much it takes for you to like me back?
I wonder if I met the person I'm going to marry.
Relationships only lasts if you both trust each other.
Relationship without trust is like a car without gas.
Always stay with the people that care about you.
"I wake up every morning thanking god, coz he's all I have left."
God please stay with me. :)
"What goes around, comes back around, that's life."
"If you don't care, they will."
"Adios, you just lost me."
"Fuck you, and fuck her, I'm done."
Who cares?!... LOL! Our generation is fucked up already.
Sometimes I feel like twitter is the only thing I got.
The sun doesn't always shine.
"Sometimes when you go fishing, you don't catch any thing."
"That moment when you just say "" fuck everyone""."
"Oh, you're talking to 3 other guys other then me? Ok, go have fun with them."
"People come and go, so get use to it."
"If someone push's you away, forget them and move on with life."
"If I don't care, I wouldn't tell you what's right or wrong."
"If someone likes you, they will show they do."
"If someone cares about you, they will tell you."
"Just close your eyes, and forget everything around you."
Just forget it.. No one gives a fuck in the end.
"No matter how good you are, There's always people who will criticize."
All I do is what I feel.
Look beyond every thing you see.
Believing in yourself if no one else does is what makes you succeed.
You won't always be at the top... But you won't be at the bottom forever either.
A year from now you might wish you had started earlier...
"If you never try, you'll never know."
"They say you shouldn't give up, But you should on things that aren't worth it."
To be irreplaceable you have to be different...
"Follow your heart, not people."
You have to love &amp; believe in yourself first for everything else to fall into place.
"Focus on what you need to do in life, Quit worrying about everything else."
"Sometimes you gotta take the step, even if you don't see the rest."
"Some things will never come back to you, No matter how hard you try"
"Continue to be who you are, Even when you're full of doubt."
Don't count days... Make days count.
"Once you don't give a damn, they do... Wired ass people."
If I'm not feeling it... you'll know it.
"People come and go, who cares?"
Don't expect anything from people who don't care.
"Lol, people are all the same.. They never wanna change."
You were meant for amazing things. Don't doubt yourself.
Never care about what people think of you.
Thunder strikes and raining OMG! ♥♥
Raining!! Yay. &lt;3
"Most of us will never do great things, but we can do small things in a great way."
"It's not what you say, it's how you make people feel."
It's the moments that don't last that live with us forever.
"""If you are doing your best you will not have time to worry about failure."""
There are no mistakes in life only lessons.
Don't count on life to see you through; count on yourself to see you through life.
"To be honest, you're the only one I've ever spent this much time and effort on."
"No matter how bad today is, there is always tomorrow ♥"
Wishes are always granted but you just have to wait for the perfect time.
"The path is never gone, it may just be hidden in the place you'd least expect."
"Sometimes reality tells us what's true, problem is we choose not to believe."
There's no reason to regret. You always have good choices that you decided not to take.
"""Live life, Always try, Be happy, Never cry"""
"Sometimes by losing yourself, you find yourself."
Sometimes wrong choices take us to the right places. ♥
Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it a meaning. ♥
"It's hard to forget someone, who gave you so much to remember. ♥"
"If someone treats you like shit, treat them like dirt, smile, move on like nothing ever happened."
"I miss the people that I use to call my ""best friends"""
I wanna go back to L.A or England.. No one understands me..
"I hate this country, I hate this school.. I hate this life.. I hate all the people in it.. No one deserves a fucking thin from me tbh.."
"Girls don't let someone tell you that you're stupid and hurt you're feelings, your better then that.."
"Guess what? :) I like you, don't let me down."
That feeling when you like/love someone else so much and you just can't get her/him off your mind the whole day.
Never cry for those who don't deserve.
Always remember that I was there when no body else was.
I get in a bad mood everyday almost... Because of something I know it will never happen.
"If people put you down, learn to get your self back up."
Never trust someone unless you know them good.
I just wish I can move on and forget it...
"If someone is pushing you away, forget it and move on, before you get hurt."
"I saw a piece of shit on the ground yesterday, it reminded me of you"
Morning beautiful girls. &lt;3
"You treated me like shit, but for some fucked up reason I still want you in my life."
I need a person to tell to all my problems and what's really inside of me.
"Its hard loving someone for a long time, and they didn't even care."
We all know they will move on someday.
I wanna be happy for once..
I wanna leave this country.. I'm sick and tired.
I hate the idea of anyone else having you..
You can't blame someone for walking away if you didn't do anything to make them stay.
"The last words from Bob Marley were ""Money can't buy you life""."
"There are lots of things I would've done differently, but I do not regret anything."
What doesn't kill you fucks you up mentally.
Find the one who makes your heart smile and keep them.
That depressing moment when you think about someone who used to be your best friend and wonder.. Did they change or did I?
Over-thinking ruins everything.
I wish I can move on but its really hard.
Sometimes you wish you can meet someone who actually cares.
"Sorry I'm not perfect, but I try my best."
"Everyone should be happy with what he/she has, some people don't have any thing."
I think people need more open minds other then iron minds.
"I believe in love at first sight, its true."
"Everyday I wake up and thank god, that's because I only feel safe with him."
"Every year, I realized. How stupid I was the year before."
"I'm not even on drugs, I'm just weird."
"When I was young our phones didn’t have internet, they had snake."
You hate drama? Cool. Then stop starting it.
Sometimes you gotta eat the shit even though it sucks.
Life is a bitch. :)
I wish someone would care about me like I care about people.
I wish I could say what's really inside me.
Those moments with your friends that you'll never forget.
"I don't understand why people cheat. If you're not happy, just leave"
Sooner OR later you'll get tired of chasing &amp; begin replacing.
Do you ever wonder what your life looks like through someone else's eyes??
Sometimes you run out of words to say.
Always show your real feelings to people.
"I know the truth hurts, but you have to say it."
"If everyone cared, life would be perfect."
Could you promise you would never leave?
Will he love you like I love you?
"I'm a moody person, I get mad, angry, confused, without any reason.. Over thinking ruins everything."
"If someone cares about you, don't leave him/her alone, go after them."
"Always look for people who stand beside you, and be with them."
"Your girlfriend should be your bestfriend, so don’t treat her like a friend with benefits."
"I don't have a type. If I like you, I like you."
I'm just gonna keep my feelings to myself and keep smiling like there is nothing wrong with me.
"A real boyfriend never ""gives up"" on his girl. He fights for her. Period."
"Real feelings don't just ""go away""..."
"People nowadays are scared to get hurt, but also scared to take a risk."

Technically we all suppose to die in 2 month... -.- 2012.
"Always show people how you feel, never hide your feelings."
Never judge someone by his/her looks.
"Nobody is perfect, but I can see you perfect for me."
Just because they hurt you doesn't mean that every person you meet will.
"Love isnt something you can turn on and off, unless you're faking it."
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how.
Communication + Trust = A relationship that will last a lifetime.
"I can't control my feelings, but I hate how my feelings can control me."
You attract people by the qualities you display. You keep them by the qualities you possess.
"Technically I'm single, but my heart is taken by someone I can't have."
"Accept that everybody moves on, and realize that it's not such a bad thing."
"If someone doesn't feel the same as you do, don't waste your time and move on."
"If the girl doesn't feel the same way you do, don't waste you're time and move on."
"From the moment I saw you, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you."
Sometimes its best to let go.
Some people need anger management.
Bored as hell. :(
The best moments are usually unplanned.
constantly blaming someone else for your mistakes is ridiculous.
People come and go but life is simply about seeing who cares enough to stay..
"What hurts you today, makes you stronger tomorrow."
"Don't punish the one in front of u, for the mistakes made by the one behind u."
Goodmorning. &lt;3
I feel like no one deserves and no one really cares..
Some people just don't understand what you're going thru.
Twitter is the only place I can tell all my feelings to.
Sometimes I feel like twitter is my only friend.
"Always forgive, no matter what happens."
That person you just wanna punch in the face so hard.
Boredom kills. :(
Oh you have a 2 million dollar car? You must get all the chicks LOL! ;)
"They don't miss you when you're gone, they miss you when you move on."
Music is what feelings sound like.
"People always leave. Don't worry, you get used to it and most importantly, learn to deal with it."
I want you but I also want to get over you. Neither is happening.
Dont talk to me cause you bored . the fuck?
I hate this feeling of not knowing what you're feeling..
"If you don't want me now, I don't want you later."
"If you still talk about it, you still care about it."
"A real woman can do it on her own, but a real man won't let her."
I hate fighting with the one person I want to talk with the most.
Sometimes I just want you with me and forget about everyone else.
Think before you do.
Life doesn't have a remote. Get up and change it yourself.
You're better off being alone than being with the wrong person.
"Story of my life: I like them, they like someone else."
I want a water bed.
You can't deny your feelings forever.
You're most aware of what you want after you experience what you don't.
If she gives you a second chance she's a real keeper now be a man and show her why she should keep you.
I will never make the mistake of leaving you.
"Yes, I'm selfish. I don't want to share you with people."
Every fucking thing reminds me of you.
"In my eyes, you are perfect."
"The more you care, the more you'll get hurt."
"The less she has to say to you, the closer she is to being done with you."
Loyal people go through the most bullshit.
"Sometimes, it's so hard to forgive."
"Just remember, I was there when nobody else was."
I hate that ''what if'' feeling.
You don't understand and I can't explain it.
"I need you, miss you, want you, like you."
Love ain't shit to fuck around with.
"Just because I understand your point of view, doesn't mean I have to agree with it."
Don't dress like a hoe and expect a guy to approach you like a princess.
I wanna punch someones face so hard its not even funny.
I fuckin hate this....
I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else.
People think I'm moody but that's just my natural face..
I actually find it easier to stay up late than to wake up early.
A million feelings. A thousand thoughts. A hundred memories. All for one person.
Relationships are not like Twitter. You just can't log in &amp; out whenever you please.
i keep a lot of shit to myself because in reality no one really gives a fuck.
People are not mirrors: they see you completely differently than the way you see yourself.
"I don't hold grudges, I just won't fuck with you."
I'd rather hear your voice than read your text.
Somehow I ended you liking you a lot more than I had originally planned.
It's ok to be different after all you have to stand out in order to be outstanding.
"The next time I say "" I love you"" it will be to someone who shows me that they deserve my love."
"Who are you to judge the way I live? I know I'm not perfect, and I don't live to be."
I hate school. :)
"its easy for me not to care, but its hard for me to forget you."
"I'm not a second choice, you either want me, or you don't."
"Worst feeling is watching the person you like, like someone else."
Why do parents think it's so easy to get straight A's?
Gas prices are a lot like girls.. We just wish they would go down.
"Being alone is scary, but not as scary as feeling alone in a relationship."
"Good relationships don't just happen. They take time, patience and two people who truly want to be together."
"The nicer you are, the easier it is for you to get hurt."
"You'll make it, with or without them."
I’ll just pretend what you said didn’t hurt.
I hate being jealous but I refuse to let anyone take you from me.
We cannot become what we need to be by remaining what we are.
"Without bad days, you’d never know what a good one was."
Goals? Dm me!
"Cheating on someone u ""love"" for someone u ""like"" is a dumbass move."
"That moment when someone hates on you. Bitch, my mom thinks I’m amazing."
I wouldn't mind spending forever with you.
You can't stay mad at someone who makes you smile.
"We met for a reason, either you're a blessing or a lesson."
"I can't promise that things will be perfect, But I swear I'll never leave."
People with bigger brains are likely to have more friends.
"Dear Heart, Why do I still care?"
There's a drug I take everyday to survive. I call it music.
Every life is a story. Make yours a best seller.
"I'm a dumbass for missing you, but oh well."
That one teacher who hates you for no reason.
That 1 person that you want and you just can't have her.... !
Please god be with me.
Why is life so hard?
I'm so sick of watching you laugh about everything I say that's true.
Sick and tired of this feeling... Why can't I just get over it?
That moment when everybody wants to be with you...except for the one you want.
I don't think you know what you are doing to me.
Guess what? I have feelings too.
Never think that ill take you for granted.
"There is this 1 person, only 1, that's always on my mind, that I wish I can have."
Sometimes you wish you can have what you want.
"No matter what you say or do, ill always care about you."
"I'm glad I met you, I hope you know that."
People change. Memories don't.
"Choose your words carefully. Once they are spoken, they can only be forgiven, never forgotten."
Everything happen for a reason.
"I dont have bad writing, i just have my own font"
"And at the end of the day, it's always you."
"Saying ""bitch"" after proving your point."
"I give a fuck slow, and stop giving a fuck fast."
"If I get jealous, then yes, I obviously like you."
"I'm not giving up, I'm just starting over."
"I hate people who steal my ideas, before I think of them."
"Talk is cheap. If their actions don't reflect it, they didn't really mean it."
"Dear cancer, I hope you get cancer and die."
Sarcasm is a way of life.
"Technically I'm single, but my heart is taken by someone I can't have."
"Everyone has three lives: A public life, A private life, And A secret life."
That annoying feeling when your friend is friends with the person you hate.
Calling someone names without knowing them? You must be cool.
You'll never find anyone who cared as much as I did.
Keep Calm &amp; Ignore Bitches.
I Swear I See Right Through People Like It Ain't Shit .
Couldn't Give A Fuck If I Tried.
"When I was a kid, I wanted to be older. This shit was not what I expected."
"If you like her, tell her."
I'm done.
"Words are easy... Proving is the hard part, let's see how much you really care about a person."
You think your the best? Think again.
"Oh your happy without me? And your happy with other people? Ok, bye. :)"

"That mini heart attack you get when someone says ""I heard something about you""."
"Me opening the fridge: ""Baby you light up my world like nobody else."""
H.o.m.e.w.o.r.k = Half of my energy wasted on random knowledge.
I feel like I annoy every single person I talk to.

"""If you fall, I will be there.."" - The Floor"
Four words that I never want to hear: There is no food
I love hearing old songs I used to love. They're like memories you can always go back to.
"Every time I trust someone new, they end up reminding me why I shouldn't trust anyone at all."
I didn’t stop loving you. I just stopped showing it.
Explaining your feelings to someone is one of the hardest thing to do.

It scares me how much I think about you.
Be the one who they all want. not the one who they've all had..

"Trust before you love, because love is nothing without trust."
"Relationships start with ""Can we talk?"" and end with ""We need to talk."""
And in the end we turn out being the person we swore we will never be.

When people text back slow I don’t even feel like texting them anymore .
Don’t like me? Aw cute how you thought I cared.
I love being in that mood where everything is hilarious.
"""Dammit I'm mad"" backwards is still ""dammit I'm mad"""
"You don't have to be the best, just don't be like the rest.."

"It's good to listen to others advice, but in the end you gotta make up your own mind."
"The truth sometimes hurt, but lies always kill."
"When you say 'I love you', you are making a promise with someone else's heart. Try to honor it."
Sometimes you just have to forget the rules follow your heart and see where it takes you.
I need to stop loving people and caring about people.
Nothing is better then having someone to care about you.
Twitter Is the only place I can write what's really going on in my head.
"Once I stop caring, goodluck getting it back. :)"
Disappointment is one story and giving up is the end of that story.
My life is my damn life.
Don't base your decisions on the advice of people who don't have to deal with the results.

Sometimes we have to stop and let go of one dream so we can move forward with another.
"Have you ever had so many thoughts on your mind, but just can't make them into words?"
Some people in my school just need a hug. Around their necks. With my hands.
A gentlemen only lies to his woman if it involves surprising her.
A smile can be a sign of true happiness or a mask of pain.
Me + Music = Goodbye world.
I love to sleep cause my life has a tendency to fall apart when I'm awake.
Sometimes you feel like u wanna cry without any reasons..yeah I feel like that now.
Bad mood..
I wish I could call you mine.
I wish I could tell you how much you mean to me.
"There is a lot in my head I wanna say to you, but I just can't.."
I can't take this pain any more.. I need to relax and forget the world.
I'm giving you a 0% caring.
I don't give a flying fuck any more. Kthxbai. :)

Short replies are such a turn off.
Older I Get = Less People I Trust.
"If you’re brave enough to say ""goodbye"", life will reward you with a new ""hello""."

No time to waste on regrets.

"I'm not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am."
"The longer you're single, the more you start to think something's wrong with you."
Why worry about things you cant change? Move on because life isn't waiting.
Me and my bed have the best relationship ever.. We sleep together everynight.
"When I feel left out, I just listen to music to feel better."
Sometimes I run out of words to say..
Sometimes I just have nothing to say...
I hate how people treat me for what I do... I want someone to care and treat me for who I am...
"sometimes you can love each other, but not be together.."
I hate it when people flirt with the person I like.
I cant imagine being with anyone but you..
My bed is so much more comfortable when I'm not supposed to be in it.
Sometimes i wonder why things happened the way they did.
"So uhm, I like you... a lot."
Change the way you think to change the way you act.

When you make an epic joke and everyone starts laughing and you just sit there with so much power.
Forever having to text people first.
"Sometimes bad days turn into bad months or years, but if you keep fighting you'll have good days again."
If you're sick of being at the bottom keep fighting until you get to the top.
Cuddling before going to bed is 12 times more effective than sleeping pills.
I can hold the world in my hand by simply holding your hand.
High school made me realize a lot of people will change just to fit in.

Don't expect it to happen IF you're not trying to make it happen.
"If I'm weird around you, that means I'm comfortable with you."
"Your past might be fucked up, but you can't stay broken forever. Find a way to fix yourself."
Anybody can go from nothing to something if they try.
"Those 'fuck this, fuck that, fuck everything' moods."
"If you're having trouble with using the correct your/you're, just use ""ur"" because ur a retard."
Think before you act. You might hurt someone.
"It's okay to be afraid, because everybody hurts, everybody screams, and everybody feels this way."
You don't get smarter as you get older. There just aren't any stupid things left that you haven't already done.
"If you can't get someone off your mind, maybe they are supposed to be there."
"There's a big difference between who we love, who we settle for, and who we're meant for."
Goals?
I really have to stop caring about people who don't give a fuck..
Forgetting someone was like trying to know somebody you never met.
Girl: I'm fine. Me: have to know what's wrong no matter what.
Your popular and cool? Omg I would love to see that in 10 years from now on.
You judge people by what they wear? I can just judge by the way you talk. (:
Never judge without knowing the reason and what he/she been thru..
SMILE! Its free! :D
OH! Fake smiling? I'm a pro at that. :)
I hate seeing people change just to fit in... That shit is just fake..
"Heart broken? Smile, move on."
Thinking of someone you like/love at night is just an amazing feeling..
Over-thinking just makes everything worst..
Just do it.. - Nike.
That moment when you just wanna lay your head on the pillow and not think of any thing...
"The best thing to do is not care, you'll save your self a lot of pain trust me..."
"Happy life = single, party, bestfriends.&lt;3"
Oh you don't like me or love me?! HAHAHA who cares? :D I know I don't.

Hey you.. Yes you.. You're beautiful. &lt;3
"Don't let someone make you cry, they don't deserve your tears.."
"Never break someone's heart, break their bones, they only have 1 heart."
You light up my world just like the sun lights up the sky. &lt;3

"My problem is, I care too much, I love too easy."
I wish someday someone cares about me like I care about people.
Having crazy time with bestfriends. &lt;3
Times changed. Things changed. I changed and so did you.
I guess love's a funny thing the way it fades away without a warning.
My life. My choices. My problems. My mistakes. My lessons. Not your business..
I wonder whatever became of you...
How are you doing? Cause I'm doing just fine without you.
"I hate the fact that you ignore me for so long, then you start talking to me like nothing happened."
Never promise to be with someone forever if you know its not true.
We will never be done. I promise.
You are the one person in the world who is necessary to me.
I love the sound you make when you shut the fuck up.
"Actions show who someone is, words show who they want people to think they are."
"As long as you're the same person I fell for, my feelings for you will never change."
I hate missing someone knowing they don't give a fuck
Every moment we spend together is a little more than amazing.

"Home, Where I can look ugly and enjoy every second of it."
"I Don't Trust Many People, Because People Have A Habit Of Fucking Me Over"

Love should be something that LAST Forever and not LOST forever.
"Let's flip a coin - if heads you are mine, if tails I'm yours"
"When I was a kid, the only fake friends I had were invisible ones."
Never let go of the memories that mean the most to you.
"We change, we grow up, we fuck up, we love, we hurt, we're teenagers, we're still learning."
"No matter what, keep it classy."
"Forever sad, tired or hungry."
Keep it real with the people around you no matter how fake they are.
Keep your head up no matter what comes your way. You don't want to miss the next great thing coming toward you.
Maybe one day I'll replace someone instead of always being the one replaced.
Never give up on someone who cares about you.
It's nice to have someone in your life who can make you smile even when they're not around.
Don't confuse the people who are always around with the ones who are always there.
"Forget the drama, forget the BS, just enjoy your life."
"Excuse me Karma, if you don't mind, I have a whole list of people you missed."

"It's not hard to find someone who tells you they love you, it's hard to find someone who actually means it."

You're seriously all I want.

"Black, White, Fat, Thin, Old, Young, Disabled, Short or Tall... Everyone Is Beautiful. ♥"
"The fact that I can’t have you, makes me want you even more."
A smiling face doesn't always mean a perfect life.
I'm still waiting on the best day of my life to happen.
"Just for your information, I didn't let you go, you left."
Don't give your all to someone who doesn't give a damn.
"Telling a girl she's sexy is flattering, but calling her beautiful means so much more."
Hating me won't make you pretty.
I’ll just pretend what you said didn’t hurt.
I'm really hoping something good happens between us
People should listen as much as they talk.
"With the right person, you don't have to work so hard to be happy."
"l admit it, l get jealous when others flirt with you."
"A relationship with no trust is like a car with no gas. You can stay in it, but it won't go anywhere."
"I'm not giving up, I'm just starting over."
"I like sleeping, it's like death without the commitment."
You light up my world like the sun lights up the sky.
"When you are hugging someone you love, never be the first to let go."
"When you’re around someone so much, for so long, they become a part of u."
No one ever remembers that I have feelings too
I forgive you but I will never forget what you did.
Sometimes you have to lose your mind before you come to your senses.
"If you don't wanna talk, just let me know now instead of keeping me here waiting for a reply that's never gonna come."
"People are like music, some speak the truth and others are just noise."
"Just be real with me, because thats whats going to keep you around."
I want your hands in mine.
I was only walking away to see if you'd stop me.
"I didn't mean to fall in love, but you made it so easy."
Holding her hand in public is just another way of saying you're proud to have her.
I'm sorry for wasting your time with my feelings.
Don't be afraid of losing someone who doesn't feel lucky to have you.
You are beautiful. And nobody has the right to make you feel like you're not.
"Text her first, it lets her know that she was on your mind."
You should save the best part of yourself for the person who deserves you.
"Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret."
"Most people are only nice to you when they need something from you, real fake shit."
I’ll stop being so lazy when being so lazy stops being so awesome.
"I sleep less, I'm tired. I sleep more, I'm tired"
"Don't talk, just act. Don't say, just show. Don't promise, just prove."
"Maybe if I cared less, I wouldn't be so stressed."
"If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you."
Every moment we spend together is a little more than amazing.
Cut the bullshit; start being real.
"I don't give a damn about anyone not liking me, just don't smile in my face when you see me."
I have no control over my emotions.
Stop giving someone else the job of making you happy.
"Ladies if he loves you, he will chase after you. So don't waste your efforts on a someone who barely calls to say hi."
Sometimes you don't know what you want and don't want.. You just go where the flaw takes you.
I need someone who can change my life and tell me what's right and wrong about me other then parents.
"I love watching someone try to act cool, and miserably failing."
"At times makeup sex really does fix things , or at least temporarily....."
"I'm afraid that if someone else catches your attention, you'll start ignoring me.. even worse, you'll replace me."
Never lose yourself while trying to hold on to someone who doesn’t care about losing you.
"if a man respects his mother, at least you know he's capable of respecting someone other than himself."
"I don't hate you, but if you were on fire and I had water, I'd drink it."
Music is my escape from a lot of things when i'm down.
Love is when two hearts beat as one.
There's always that one person who always catches you doing something weird.
C.L.Α.S.S: Come Late And Start Sleeping.
"If I'm weird around you, that means I'm comfortable with you."
I constantly check my phone for no reason
"Don't bring up the subject, if you're not going to tell me."
"Learn to forgive, because you also make mistakes."
Smile for the person that makes you happy.
"I text you because I want to have a conversation with you, not get one word answers."
"I don't need a perfect relationship, I just need someone who won't give up on me."
"Please don't make me hate you, because when I love, I love with passion but when I hate, I hate with all my heart."
You can't control love. That's the best and worst part of it.
Awsome feeling Is coming from school and laying in bed for hours.
I like school.. But I only like it for friends and hanging out.. Not the learning part.
"I am who I am, aint gonna change my self for someone like you."
"If you don't know me, then don't judge me. No one said you had to love me."
"Girls, be his all or be his nothing. No in betweens."
"Sometimes, the most important things are the hardest to say - but they have to be said anyway."
"Everyone wants to take something, no one wants to give anything"
One day I will say I'm over you - and mean it this time.
"The more you hide your feelings, the more they show. The more you deny your feelings, the more they grow."
"Do whatever you can , with what you have and where you are !"
Learn to be comfortable with the uncomfortable.
"According to a new study, talking to yourself makes you smarter."
Our generation doesn’t ring the doorbell. We text or call to say we’re outside.
Listening to soft music while your in pain makes it even worst. :(

That depressing moment when you wake up during the best part of your dream.
People that text back instantly. I like that shit.
dry ass texters. slow ass texters. boring ass texters. that's the shit I don't like.
"Being tired, but not wanting to sleep."
Apologies don't mean shit after a while.
"Don't lose the girl of your life, for the hoe of the night."
"I respect those that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is."
"Getting rejected isn't nearly as bad as being led on, then dropped for someone else."
High school made me realize a lot of people will change just to fit in.
Treat me like a joke and I'll leave you like it's funny.
*Me at school* Me: I'm gonna do my best this year. *2 weeks later* Me: fuck this.
Change is not a matter of possibility; it is a matter of decision.
I wanna throw a party with fake alcohol and see how many people act wasted.
