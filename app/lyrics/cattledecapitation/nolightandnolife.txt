I could not be anymore negative if my life depended on it
The look on my face of actual hate
Look in my eyes to peer inside - no light and no life

I hope you die within my lifetime
I wish nothing but the worst for you and everything you know
Conditioned by the acts you hide behind
Condemned to believe that this is how life should be

I don't wish to spew this rhetoric, I've been damned with this voice
I don't wish to be filled with hatred, I've been given no other choice

This hostility, malicious enmity, the spite inside of me,
Dark as pitch and black as night
This cursed chemistry, an acid to clemency, pre-meditating helplessly...

If man cannot change the world
We must live long and die out
There's far too many of us anyway
You are the proof that these are the end of days

Rationalize the status of your life on this earth
Actualize trampled worth as your life is reversed
Dehumanized, your re-birth, now dispersed in the hearse
So brutalized, phlebotomized draining of life

I don't wish to make these threats on your life
I've been damned with this voice
I don't wish to hate the whole of this "humankind",
I've been given no other choice

This hostility, malicious enmity, the spite inside of me,
Dark as pitch and black as night
This cursed chemistry, an acid to clemency, pre-meditating helplessly...
