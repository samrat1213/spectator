Were your plans to overthrow?
I'll let you experience struggle.
Ignoring suggestive influence, your intellect has merely lead you to martyrdom.

Which shall serve as a deterrent for those who chose to follow.

Corrupting public thought, influencing paranoia, breeding a new infectious plight based off mental terrorism.
For such defection, find punishment in execution.

(Your execution)

For such defection, find punishment in execution.

Now face the repercussions of these acts.

Tortured, nearly beaten to death, your tongue is severed from your mouth, a reminder that there's no freedom of speech anymore.
As your soul bleeds out, your body shall be left to rot, and the rodents to feed upon your corpse.

Silence is simply that easy.

You have failed to deconstruct a flawless design,
Bow to a real oppressor.

Your voice and mind are the true contagion,
So you must be exterminated.
