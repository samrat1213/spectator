Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Golden metal flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gon' take money to go

Oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no

I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go
