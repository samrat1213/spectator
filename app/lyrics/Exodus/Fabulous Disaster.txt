[Instrumental Intro]

When the missiles are falling and the reaper comes calling
You had better kiss your ass goodbye
Atomic detonation, mass immolation
Without a warning, all your memories will die
So try to relax, face up to the facts
You'll either die or the fallout will rot you in your tracks
There'll be no tomorrow, only pain and sorrow
'Cause our future's in the hands of a raving madman

They spend all their time building missiles so people die
What kind of life do you expect for us to live?
We're angered by fear because the time is near
When some lunatic will finally pull the plug
And forever after, you can hear the laughter
World's being plastered by an evil bastard
Exterminating faster, devastating plaster, fabulous disaster!
Now you can see, what this all means to me
When the bomb... comes falling down!

[Instrumental Break]

Now the reaper has called, but do you have the balls
To sit there or stand up and fight?
Try to make a note, it's your right to vote
To keep these fucking assholes in line
It will always be the same 'cause they lie in their campaigns
Promise through their teeth for total world peace
So we know it's not the truth, they should call Dr. Ruth
On how to give the people the real big screw
They spend all their time building missiles so people die
What kind of life do you expect for us to live?
We're angered by fear because the time is near
When some lunatic will finally pull the plug
And forever after, you can hear the laughter
World's being plastered by an evil bastard
Exterminating faster, devastating plaster, fabulous disaster!
Now you can see, what this all means to me
When the bomb... comes falling down!
Down, down, fall down!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
