[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Good Samaritans are something I can't stand
Suppressing their own needs to lend a helping hand
Looking out for number one is my only creed
Self-preservation runs deep in my breed

[Pre-Chorus]
I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be

[Chorus]
Me, myself and I - Only these three apply
Me, myself and I - On these three I rely
Me, myself and I - My only true ally
Me, myself and I - I'm greed personified

[Verse 2]
Thinking of myself is all I ever do
Not a single thought will I waste on you
My only concerns are things pertaining to me
Don't bother trying to find any generosity
[Pre-Chorus]
I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be

[Chorus]
Me, myself and I - Only these three apply
Me, myself and I - On these three I rely
Me, myself and I - My only true ally
Me, myself and I - I'm greed personified

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
No charity, no one rides for free
No solicitors, can't you f*ckin' read?
Take your social clauses and your empty pleas
Me, myself and I is the only thing for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be
[Chorus]
Me, myself and I - Only these three apply
Me, myself and I - On these three I rely
Me, myself and I - My only true ally
Me, myself and I - I'm greed personified1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
