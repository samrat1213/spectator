i miss you and the rain won't stop falling
"the simpler you become, the greater you appreciate quietness"
caught in the rain. i wish you were here
the silence and scent of old churches entice me
days when you struggle with numbness
days when you don't feel beautiful inside
"tonight, the sky is mine"
sometimes the light appears like petals. like hands or pure silence
simplicity. keeping this new focus
i think of you when i need to feel safe
some days are so hard to bear
i'm always ready to hug a tree
i simplify. things that are out of my hands deserve freedom from my mind too
my quiet moments are precious and most are about you
this is not the time to pull away. we all need a shoulder to cry on
"keep your heart open, sometimes you need to focus on letting people in, just choose the ones who boldly and courageously inspire light"
quiet and gentle but not empty
every time i miss you it hurts
i love you and i am not very good at letting you go
your light is a gift
all i know is when it rains poets fall in love
i love you and i don't mind if the whole world is fading
trees will save us all
i hugged a tree today and for a moment i felt my heart refreshed
"if you are kind and you understand simplicity, you are the most beautiful person in the world"
"i do not let the hard days win. i speak to trees, i smell the flowers, i look at the sky"
"when you understand simplicity, you begin to appreciate the little things in life and the comfort they create"
i am at peace with simple and little things
when hope rises and falls
another day of quietly loving and admiring you. i have no intention to stop
to believe that one day you will transform into a beautiful flower is courage
"we are all broken people, we all carry pain"
i will keep folding my hands into flowers until your sadness disappears. until your heart becomes full again
you're saying things with no hope. i worry about you
you don't need to be perfect. just be my everything
thank you trees for creating some calm
today i just want to walk barefoot on grass and lie with the fallen leaves
when something quietly breaks
you write because you want her so much but you can't tell her
please remind me again that this too shall pass
i don't feel very strong without you
i can't stop thinking about holding your hands and your heart forever
i also have days like sometimes i do not know how to continue anymore. the sky gives good counsel that i saturate my mind with silent prayers and good thoughts. so i pay attention
i wish i have all the words to make you stay
the things i cannot touch because they are too far
too many words but nothing can save the flowers from wilting and the leaves from falling
torn between wanting to bloom or disappear
so much healing to be done
it is impossible to breathe when you are drowning. i feel that every time i miss you
what you are on the inside makes a big difference in the world
i don't know if this is a good place to break
i love growing things but not the  longing that fills my chest
i miss you. my heart is screaming miserably
sometimes i feel my heart is like a lonely leaf quietly falling and drifting with no end
i wish i have something profound to tell you today. all i have are yearnings and butterflies. this is what you do to my heart
"my mind keeps moving forward, but my heart keeps falling backwards"

"god, this whole film is pure poetry ....   The World To Come: Abigail &amp; Tallie ""Friday, April 25th""   via @YouTube"
"trees, flowers and kind hearts. i am constantly in love with these things"
"you inspire beautiful poetry so i can breathe. i am not perfect but you are and my heart is deeply grateful, my mother earth"
the attractive quality of kindness
a place where flowers will not wither
quietly becoming a cloud
when nothingness is trying to pull you back
days when it's hard to choose. choose to love yourself
missing you is like hitting rock bottom
it's quite hard to talk about the light when you're not living it
you can't pour from an empty cup. i hope you understand this deeply
having a high respect for your own well-being and happiness is the best gift you can give yourself
focus on being grateful and you will find yourself healing
on days when you don't know what to do. plant a flower garden
i miss you and the rain won't stop falling

"trees, flowers and kind hearts. i am constantly in love with these things"
"you inspire beautiful poetry so i can breathe. i am not perfect but you are and my heart is deeply grateful, my mother earth"
the attractive quality of kindness
a place where flowers will not wither
quietly becoming a cloud
when nothingness is trying to pull you back
days when it's hard to choose. choose to love yourself

having a high respect for your own well-being and happiness is the best gift you can give yourself
focus on being grateful and you will find yourself healing
on days when you don't know what to do. plant a flower garden
i'd like to believe that my hope is full and not empty
"when dust settles, when everything is said and done, you would want to be at home and at peace with that one person you choose to be with, that one person who becomes your safe place; that no matter what you do, you know you would still be accepted and chosen"
i don't know how to say that i have deep feelings for you
trees are powerful healers
"when my heart feels so dull, i soak in endless quietness and gentleness of trees"
growing and nurturing plants is healing
the sea is calling me deeply
"when you've been in the dark for so long, you begin to appreciate the light more and more when it comes"
silence. sometimes it hurts
i wonder what you're running from today
"i know what it's like to have days, weeks or months where it's harder to be joyful"
"when you thought your heart is okay, but it's not"
there are days when finding stillness is so difficult. when there is too much coming at you and you feel so much all the time. when happy moments don't count as deeply anymore. days like this are the hardest
humans connect with humans. i connect with trees
"while you feel uncertain and sometimes hopeless. keep looking at the sky, it offers hope and solace and the certainty you need"
you are kind and you send light to every human heart. i will never forget you
the people who truly love and care for you will guide you and share their light until you find your own
"one day someone will take your heart to a quiet place, hold it gently, faithfully with both hands and you will burst into tears"
i'm quiet because i'm gracefully trying to heal
i focus on growth and i always look at the heart
it's really more about the heart
i appreciate your gentle quietness
trees. because they accept me for who i really am
"you should never dim and hold back your beautiful light. share it, some people might need it to survive"
she is a feeling. a love poem
if you are trying to create light for others. i deeply admire you
to those whose hearts are falling apart nature heals
i'm sorry if this world is letting you down
this world needs more people who care
how many times have you told yourself i give up
"when you get so tired waking up in the morning praying for a day without heartache, without loss. sometimes you question yourself if you can still hold on, if you can still make it"
i love you and i'm dying to hold you so close
i don't know but sometimes i feel like i've been floating for decades
of course i need love. but not the kind that comes and goes
show her what true love is. go beyond words
life must go on and i hope you will choose to grow rather than wither
the hardest part is wanting to move away from everything but you simply can't
please stop trying to please everyone
today i wrote myself a love letter
oh sick and restless heart please heal
hello march. more healing please
sometimes i want to call you late at night to tell you i miss you and you're always on my mind
getting away from people is how i need to reconnect with my true self and find peace. trees and other little things like walking barefoot on grass or simply staring at the blue sky help me breathe and calm my mind
remember to be gentle even when days are bad
"i prefer to put my focus on positive, grateful thoughts"
"i have loved and been broken so many times, i know the pain and struggle of moving on"
"and if i lose hope, i lose everything"
i still get days when everything weighs so heavily and i cannot move
there is a cold voice in my head constantly telling me that i am not enough and i don't matter at all. i know this voice is wrong
sitting alone beside a quiet tree. unfolding my hands for birds to come by. the wind is a peaceful company. for me this is freedom
you are your own best friend and true love. it's not loneliness to enjoy your own company
so i decided to simplify and unlearn. i put down some meaningless things i used to carry. my heart is so quiet now and my daily life doesn't need much but nature and silence
superficiality wears me down
maybe you need to stop tolerating those voices in your head telling you that you are not enough
but can you hold a heart without you ever breaking it
sorry if i'm obsessing about your next love poem
someone who will understand her profound need to be quiet and alone
empty and hollow noises
"my quiet time includes feeling the grass between my toes, breathing fresh air, watching the trees move or simply sitting under the blue sky thinking of you"
i'm trying to focus on what truly matters. this is how i want to live my life now
"i found comfort in simplicity, it took me a long time to realize this"
i love you
"if you are a tree and have lost your leaves in winter, just hang on you'll get new ones in spring time"
"if you are an introvert, i love you"
you listen to old songs and write poetry because you miss her so much and you don't want the feeling of being alone
the things you see when you start looking with your heart
"i take care of the trees, plants and birds near me and they take care of my mind and heart"
"gentler, quieter, softer like the setting sun"
i know sad and empty feelings
are you also here because everything is so heavy and you are looking for a safe place to break
there is no point hiding your softness
"when you don't know how to define good days anymore. try to look at the sky, walk on grass barefoot, smell the flowers, touch a heart. begin by doing the little things you love"
"you suffered, you didn't give up and now you are growing stronger. i'm so proud of you. happy new year love"
"the more i think about it, the more i realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others. vincent van gogh"
"i know that i am healing, i know that i'm almost there. my heart is quieter and my hands are steady and i can see more light even when there is almost none"
"no poetry, i'm just sitting beside a quiet tree daydreaming of your hands, your eyes and your hair that smells like fresh raindrops"
the soothing sound of raindrops on tree leaves and flower petals is my poetry today
i notice every hope. please don't stop
all i wish is for your heart to remain kind and gentle even when the world is not
i can feel your heart breaking when you talk about december
today is good. merry christmas 🎄
please love her forever
those who embrace and understand the beauty in small and simple things. please don't change
one day at a time love. one day at a time
nothing but trees for comfort and company
i need that. a hug that feels like home
"when you love, love everyone including yourself"
i love the quiet days. the only time i feel like my world is in order
there are tough days and days when i cry. these are the days that i deeply miss you
so exhausted that i have no strength to keep everything alive
please remind me again that i don't have to be strong all the time
i admire the ones who can see beauty in simple things
it's nice to look inside every once in a while and focus on what truly matters
"if you are still writing, i'm proud of you"
i cannot think of anything to talk about. i cannot write a single thought. i don't know if i'm falling short of words or courage
there are feelings i choose not to feel. to survive. to stop hurting
i care deeply but i also fight so hard. please excuse me if my boundaries are so noticeable
"how many days, weeks, months or years have you waited to feel better or a little less sad"
i still feel some kind of sadness and it slows me down
"if you are quietly healing, learning and growing, please carry on"
"sometimes i feel like there's nothing to hold onto because everything is constantly changing, my dreams are passing and at some point i have to walk this road alone"
the trees are enough to save my day
brave but delicate and very human
i hope you are still loving
november is all about slowing down. taking time to be quiet and still
"i don't belong here. i belong in the mountains, in the woods and out in the oceans"
"nobody writes or visits, until you've lost all hope. cherish the ones who do care"
i'm here for you and i care that you're here
i think your hand fits perfectly with mine
i love you. your light and your shadow
"do you also feel strange and weird sometimes, as if you are not part of this vast universe"
i understand the sadness in your eyes
i hope you're doing what you love
all i ever wanted was to call you mine
compassion for those who suffer is a beautiful thing. it touches my heart
constantly pushing myself out of my comfort zone. this is how i grow
my quiet moments are important
"you sit down, stare at your walls, or you close your eyes because you are too scared to look directly at nothingness"
i love seeing how people grow
i'm learning to love and take care of myself deeply and it feels really good
"i love rainy days, i love sunny days and sometimes it doesn't matter anymore. for me, everyday is a new day"
i wish i have all the words to keep you closer
"i love people who are not afraid to be vulnerable, people who open and share their hearts without expectations but simply to inspire and bless others"
"when i feel calm and quiet, i know i'm on the right path"
it is the heart that truly counts
"sometimes my days are a bit slower and dull and old fashioned, but it doesn't matter. i'm grateful, and it's an amazing thing to be alive"
"there's a lot of unhappiness around me. people are confuse and in desperate need for meaning, direction and often times, love. a very dark and dormant phase. i don't believe that we can go through life without experiencing these things"
"i'd like to build a sanctuary where i can sing you arias, read you words and adore you like there is no tomorrow"
this love begins and ends with you and the middle part is all yours
"today i tried to put down my pen, took all my house plants outside and let them play in the rain"
missing you is breaking me in and out
"sometimes the void crushes me, it leaves me lifeless"
"it's a tough world, we need more flowers. flowers always help"
your story counts
all colors are beautiful
nothing to see here. just me and my house plants
"i'm quiet most of the time, but i observe keenly and i listen with an open heart and mind. i know if your love is true"
"i can sit all day, watch the trees move and just think of you"
i stopped changing myself to fit in
"it's not always sunshine and roses. oftentimes, it's all dry leaves and thorns, but i'm still here, grounded but always flowing"
i want the only hands that matter
"i'm putting more trees, flowers and sunrises in my life. this is how i want to take care of myself"
when you feel like you cannot go on any further and you start to criticize and doubt yourself. this is quite painful
"days when you don't want to do anything but sit and stare at your house plants, praying they will not rot and die of too much watering, because that's the only way you know how to care for the things you love"
"i only keep the things that nourish my soul, the rest i let them fall away"
how gently you touch my heart
i'm sorry but i cannot bear too much words without actions
i'm just here watching my small dreams and big dreams fall away like dead leaves
you got away. please don't get stuck again
i prefer to have you closer
"the world around me is becoming more hectic and complicated, and here i am constantly craving for simplicity"
i love watching women who are not afraid of hard work
sometimes a bird looking for a gentle tree to rest. sometimes a tree quietly looking for lost birds who wish to be held gently
"some words are pure light, exactly what you need to hear"
grow more than just a pretty flower
trying to find my way upwards
i'm sorry for the things i have no courage to tell you
"i know what it feels like to tell people you are fine, when you're not. sometimes you can't breathe"
something about sitting on the porch daydreaming about your hands
i've been thinking about all the flowers i want to give you
please don't stop hugging trees
"stop taking nature for granted. instead, take a closer look and be inspired"
a close-up of raindrops dancing on flower petals
i stopped being so lonely and miserable when i realized i was burning myself and all the shooting stars
spending every moment breathing and spreading as much love and kindness as i can
"i remember the small things that make me happy. like the sound of an old typewriter, the smell of old books, walking barefoot on grass, and when i sit beside a quiet tree. then i feel better and can think more clearly"
"the way you love fascinates me so much, how you give new meaning to my name"
is it okay if i lurk a little bit longer and deeper inside your heart
i'm restless. things are calling me away. my hair is being pulled by the stars again. anaïs nin
i know you love raindrops and the forest is your home. but i still want to know you deeply. every piece of me wants to try
"i'm trying to focus on the things that give me joy and hope. if there's anything pure, lovely and admirable. i pay attention on these things"
i love you on your good days and bad days
"the thing about the quiet ones, they live in their heads for too long"
i'm not here to judge your choices
i always try to be grateful. even on those days when i feel the most melancholy
"the thing is when she falls in love, she drops her guard completely"
i do wrestle with darkness. there are times that i feel like giving in. but most days i win
letting it all out in one deep sigh
it's hard to go on when no one is paying attention to your dreams. i know what it's like
spreading beauty and kindness would be my wish for this place. god bless all the artists in the world
i look at the sky when my heart needs to rest
i think of you when i need to smile
the soft and quiet sound of blooming flowers
i love you. this is something i do not want to hide
the sound and touch of raindrops reminding me that life is still beautiful
a raindrop wishing for your hands
"tell me, are you the words you write"
do you also cry when you hear a violin playing
"if you want to move and touch my heart, be yourself, be authentic"
i hope you feel me even when i have no words
"some days words are not pretty, but write anyway"
standing in the rain. suddenly i remember what it feels like to be myself again
"when your own light goes out, sometimes all you need is a little spark from another to rekindle the flame within you"
if you ever need someone to take you to a very still and quiet place. go find one who talks to trees and loves rain
i can only unlock my heart for the most special soul
"so the rain comes down, and it keeps coming down, but still my heart is in flame, always burning for love"
please stop criticizing people who are optimistic. those who have hope. those who hold on to the promise of spring. those who feel the sunlight growing stronger. they are not blind to the problems of this world. but they choose to reach out with love. so please don't spoil it
her quiet is gentle. like a falling rose petal
so drawn to your light
"you stare at every sunset with tears, you wait for the next rainfall like a kiss, you blush when you talk to flowers. you hug trees with passion. you stop when leaves fall around you. stay close to people who understand these things"
"sometimes i need more words to feel love. sometimes i just need you to stay close, silently allowing me to be quiet"
"she maybe quiet, but the voice in her head is very loud"
is there anything worse than being in love with someone who doesn't return the feeling
"if you speak the language of rain and trees, i want to fall in love with you"
listening is showing love
so attracted to a lot of things. but kindness is one thing i can't resist
i'm not here to judge the way you love
be beautiful inside
i'm trying to stay away from all the noise and superficiality. i'm tired of these things
absorbing the gentle swishing sound of leaves and petals on a breezy afternoon. the only sound i hear
the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet soul
i don't understand your fascination with darkness. but it's not your fault
i love reading the gentle and quiet hearts
maybe your love can handle all the longings and sadness inside my heart
missing you is a terrible thing
you are quiet about everything that hurt you because the world is ending and you are afraid that no one will pay attention
come here. let me give you the softest hug ever
you are enough as you are. i will come and hold your hands until you believe it
and so i kept walking
"when you said you were thinking of me too, my heart beat quieter and less lonely and that was the last time"
"sunshine, blooming trees, singing birds, soft hugs, kind people. i hope my melancholy ends here"
"i see you like a beautiful tree, so deeply grounded, completely immovable. as if life couldn't touch you"
"she will come and find you, and you will fall head over heels in love with her beauty"
i can't explain the feeling of standing in the midst of this sprawling bamboo grove
"when trees and forests are gone, so will my sanity"
i find it difficult to imagine a world without flowers
"don't look so sad, love. one day a heart that matches yours will find you"
"even if you rip my chest open, all you see are flowers with your name written on every petal"
i love you and all i want to do is hold you in my heart for a long time
"the sky is my favorite thing. sometimes, i catch myself staring at it and forget about how shattered my heart is and i just think of you"
comforted with little things. like the raw misty raindrops kissing my skin
dig a hole. bury your fears
aspiring wanderer
"this is how i want to breathe, pure and natural. now my heart is more steady"
one day someone will hold you gently with both arms and never let go
it's been drizzling all day
quiet now. she's trying to bloom
once again finding myself silently drifting towards you
"when you love someone, you give her your heart. a completely devoted heart"
"write me a poem, sing me an old love song or bring me books, i want to fall in love with you"
you touch me and i stop wilting
your eyes are my favorite love poems
"old trail, flowing river, singing cicadas"
i notice every hope. please carry on
i always take time to be near my favorite trees. i'm comforted by simply sitting and staring at them. they calm my heart. they do even more than this
i always have this serious yearning to read you
your heart is a gift from the sky. don't leave it pale and empty. fill it fuller and fuller with beautiful gentle flowers and all the pink sunrises that you can ever imagine
night walk
"be strong, even though words are not enough to heal"
"the need to feel safe, seen and anchored"
this innate need to be constantly surrounded by trees
"my love language is physical touch. when i hug, i hug passionately. i make sure you will melt"
when words are not enough and all you need is that one person to hold you
"the world is so quiet here, i want to love you this way"
"i appreciate how you look, but the most precious part about you is who you are inside. i love what's inside"
"it was all i wanted for the longest time—to open my eyes and see you there. to stretch out my hand and touch the soft, yielding warmth of your skin. but now i have learned the secret of distance. now i know being close to you was never about the proximity. lang leav"
there is nothing more loving than professing adoration to someone who is close and important to your heart
i wish i can explain to you the meaning of life
when was the last time you blushed
"i don't know what's killing me, the cruelty of this world or your silence"
"imagine a love that will change everything, a love that will blow your mind and drive you crazy"
we should start writing hand written love letters again
your words have always been music. always called me in ways i cannot explain
that song you listen to when you go everywhere
"the truth is, i often like women. i like their unconventionality. i like their completeness. i like their anonymity. virginia woolf"
of course i love it when i can feel you reading me
that feeling when you stand in the rain. you tilt your head to the grey sky and let the cold water washes over your skin
quiet morning. gentle breeze
girls who wish to become poems
returning to my books. resuming in solitude
i just want to sit with trees today. alone with trees
protect and guard your hearts. remember your lessons about love
can you ever look at the sky and not think of her
a raindrop dancing on a flower petal
but beauty must be broken daily to remain beautiful. virginia woolf
too many hearts screaming in silence
let's just fall in love and make the world tremble
"of course, i don't want you to stop loving me"
"i don't know about you, but i fight for the people and things i love"
once upon a time i was falling in love. now i'm only falling apart. another song that i keep singing in my head
it's been really cold and strange inside my heart lately. i'm not sad nor happy or maybe i don't know
why does it hurt to say your name at night
i love the quiet in the little things
we need more people who believe that softness is a strength
it's getting so hard to breathe again
i'm naming all the bright stars after you
"i don't understand why do you say i love you, but you never show it"
when was the last time someone held your hands
a graveyard for my dead dreams
when you see your dreams sink like ships
why do you want to disappear
sorry if i'm thinking about you again
too afraid to watch another sunset without you
"every time i couldn't find the right words to touch your heart, i end up in darkness"
tell me how to read you and not fall
sometimes i cannot bear the pressure of staying
how you wish there is a magical way to stop loving someone
you opened the door of your heart but she didn't come
"i miss you, i'm afraid the world is ending"
"you are beautiful as you are, with or without those pretty words"
"i see you, keep thriving"
i rise up. i always do. i know how to unbury myself
i understand how important it is to have hope during this difficult time. that's why i'm trying to keep it alive all the time
another shattered and pale day. i'm sorry
"i hope you love your work and you love where you are, and i also hope your love is requited"
i can no longer describe the kind of things i see everyday. i don't enjoy seeing many hearts drowning in despair and  hopelessness. how i wish there is a magical way to end all suffering
i love you. the only words i have and the purest that i can ever say
"i still love being alive, i still notice the little things. the sun is beautiful in the morning. today i picked some lilies and watered them with raindrops, and just like you i'm still rooting for love to save the world"
trees are better inspiration
"i don't rhyme and sometimes i don't know how to end my sentences properly, but i love you"
another day feeling strangely incomplete
floating. unattached
all is fragile
watching everything around me crumble. it is so difficult not to weep
i don't want to be here without you
"i never stop dying, but i also never stop rising"
how many times can a person break
i just want to scream your name into the sky until my heart stops bleeding
all is shattered
all i really want to do is write poems full of you. i don't know why i always end up writing poems full of sorrow
i picked some flowers for my dead dreams
i don't know why everything you write makes me shiver
"i'm still trying to understand how to live. i'm still keeping some gentle flowers in my heart in case i need more softness. trees have such great stories about coping and surviving, so i try to pay attention. words are beautiful but sometimes they are not enough to mend and heal"
you said love is the answer. show me
"for this ache, words are not enough"
sometimes even if i write the ache is not less
let me gently hold your heart until everything becomes less lonely and bearable
brave little flower. i love you
"i love this rain, how it drowns out every other noise, then all is still and soft and quiet"
"i know that my hands are not enough to reach you, but i hope my heart is"
"just try to hold something kind and gentle today, a raindrop, a flower, a tree or maybe a hand"
"silence, because too much noise weakens my heart"
"i always have a soft spot for people who hide their tears, sometimes i pretend i don't see them. i know it's difficult"
when people tell you to let go and get over. sometimes this is the part that i hate
"you can't easily fight feelings. sometimes the more you try to avoid them, the deeper they reach and shake you"
what are you. a poet or a lover
falling for you is madness
i uttered your name not once but many times today
when you are too needy to refuse and too vulnerable to resist and you hate to feel this way
"old photographs on the walls, a faded lamp and a century old tea pot"
the scent of fresh raindrops
i need beautiful things to fill this waiting
constantly searching for something to hold
you notice how she reads you?  intently
you write beautiful love poems. i want to kiss you
i'm rooted but i flow.  virginia woolf
"put your walls down, i want to see how beautiful you are"
"at this point, i'm really trying so hard not to explode"
"dear world, i'm tired aching please"
"dear heart, i'm sorry  if you had to love the wrong people"
does it kill you that you can't be with her
did i tell you that you are the most beautiful when you write love poems
"and if she loves you, i'm pretty sure she'll turn you into poetry"
just tell her she matters and be constant
i'm trying to tell the moon that i love you and i can't stop
"if only i can hold all the flowers in my hands, i will keep them alive and blooming all the time"
today i wish you a heart full of gentle flowers and quiet trees
"rain, trees, silence"
only the gentlest hands can ever hold this heart
i always have a serious yearning to hug a tree
"and if you love gentle things, write about flowers"
thinking about all the ways i want to hold your heart and not just your hands
i need you to hold my hands. please tell me to slow down
this sadness is so hard to handle. i'm afraid there is no easy cure
you said that if i truly love i must learn to let go. so please don't ask me why i am quiet
my only plan is to love you with all the flowers and the trees and all the sunsets and sunrises in my heart
the thing about flowers is that they always want to be adored
i wonder if there are graveyards for wilted flowers
something in me is utterly and completely exhausted
some hearts you want to cherish them for a long time
only nature has the ability to calm my heart
"no pretty words, only deep holes and longings and a love that has no place to go"
do you also cry every time you write her a poem
beautiful but empty words. careful not to fall
"what are you, a flower or a tree"
"and i'm getting tired waking up in the morning praying for a day without heartache, without loss. sometimes i question myself if i can still do this"
i'm afraid that i'm reaching a more profound sense of despair. some days i no longer hope for sunrises
"when i'm tired of people and the noise they create, i take shelter in the quiet company of trees. sometimes like a restless little bird, other times like a lost flower petal"
i don't know if it's the silence or the noise. both hurts
"if you can take away all the sadness inside my heart, i love you"
"you are quiet because you feel every pain, the sadness of trees, the restlessness of rain, the dark face of life"
"the stars belong to the sky, the trees to the forest. what about this love"
she is a tree. you can't keep her from the forest
i love you and i'm too far from slowing down
"i maybe too far, but i can see your light. it reaches out bright and steady like my favorite star"
"i'm afraid that if i become a flower, i'm probably the prettiest but also the saddest"
"i don't know if i'm crashing, there is no sound, just this creeping sadness"
i'm sorry if i'm obsessing about your next love poem
can i just steal you away and love you
the only way is forward
sorry i broke us
today i'm taking the road covered with trees
that feeling when you see the sun after a rough rain
here i am again with my lonely heart feeling everything and nothing all at once
"take the path where light is, where pure love stays"
my heart is ready to be soft again
i'm so impressed with quiet things. the gentle sound of raindrops falling on flower petals is my favorite
grateful for the trees that glow and the drops of rain that flow through my hands
"as i've said before, i have days that i don't give a fuck"
"you cannot force me to rt or follow you, that is not how this whole thing works"
"affirmations are important, you don't want to leave your kids, the people you love and even yourself emotionally crippled"
forgive yourself for not being perfect. you are human
"i love all kinds of trees, when i see them alone and very sad i hold them quietly and gently with my heart, the same way they hold me"
"love is supposed to be like this quiet, still and very calming"
i'm just over here quietly sitting under a tree. this is how i rest my mind and heart
thinking of you is my favorite quiet time
careful not to fall with shadows
"i have my days, like sometimes i ask myself why i even try or why i even care"
today is a good day to stop doing the things that do not express your heart
every single leaf is important
another unsent love letter in my hands
authentic quietness is a gift. not everyone has it
when the only thing you could feel is the empty ache inside your chest
she's the song that will make you close your eyes and ache in pain
"watching the sunset, contemplating how not to fall apart"
gray sky gray heart gray dreams
hope and love. if only you can keep them alive all the time
"no matter how strong you appear, i can still smell tears on your skin"
"if you are a flower and you're trying to bloom in darkness, please don't stop"
i'm just here watching how the trees move and contemplating how to stay away from hopeless feelings
do you still cry every time you miss her
i never wanted anything so much than to gently touch your heart
the only plan i have is to love you
"i always try to find wisdom in everything. in the falling of rain, when leaves and petals die. in the trees and forests and oceans you adore. in empty walls, shadows, and abandoned gardens and sometimes even in the spaces between your written words"
then you become more quiet and sometimes all you hear is your own heartbeat
the people i adore are trees
don't just admire trees. talk to them
i cannot pretend that i don't fear being unloved by you
sometimes i feel like an abandoned house plant
i'm quiet because i love you but you are not mine
where are your love poems
do you love her because she is fragile
"some days are so quiet and soft and all i want to do is to love you, love you and just really love you"
"then i got tired of explaining myself all the time. so i became a tree, looked at the sky and surrendered to the wind"
have you ever missed someone so much that you shatter
"i want to be more quiet, to be more like trees"
"you see, i'm still learning my lessons about love the hard way"
and this love is supposed to be quiet and beautiful
"you are the love that i write about, the love that moves and touches my heart but also the love that i can't face and run away from"
why is it so hard to name all these feelings
my world is too quiet without you. your absence is freezing my heart
i'd like to name all the quiet and gentle rain after you
that feeling when you sit inside an art museum
in another realm i mattered enough and you loved me
sometimes i like to pretend that those words are love poems written just for me
"i miss you so much, i don't remember how to sleep anymore"
when beautiful things break
"some days i miss you so much and i hold on like i have hope, but other days i break and cry"
all i want today is a little rain and your love
don't tell her you love her if it's not true and if you're not sincere. she will believe you and she will hold on to it
"some people have no capacity to reciprocate. they don't even know what to do when you say you love and adore them. let them be, expect nothing and move on"
hate and unforgiveness. these things don't fit anymore
be careful who you profess your love to. love comes with togetherness and knowing someone deeply
not everyone who tells you that you are beautiful loves you
"they keep asking me about love, and i keep telling them about you"
tell me anything about your favorite person
i hate the days that i don't see you
"peace and healing to every broken, grieving and angry heart"
"you can't tell me not to fall when you write about all the things i love, the rain, the forest and your heart with so much love and passion"
i hope your heart is still holding on
i wish you could hear the song i'm playing over and over in my head for you
my eyes are tired and my heart has nothing more to say
what is the point of having hands if they can't even touch you
i wish i could find a way to stop missing you
i can't tell whether i'm a tree or a flower
"they say the signs are here. some pay attention, others fall asleep"
i picked up some flowers for my dead dreams
"i have no idea when is this going to end, sometimes i feel like this is eternity"
"i want to do something beautiful today. i want to plant some rose seeds in a pot, hug a leafless tree and write you a letter"
i just want to love you so hard
i'm sorry if the world is falling apart and all i can think about is you
"girls who fall head over heels in love, please let them be"
"your hands are too far, but i don't know why i feel them holding my heart"
it's good to look back and remember how good it was ...
i only love trees because they know how to listen with quiet intensity
can you ever truly know someone
does it really matter what other people think about you
"dear hearts, please stop breaking and dying every day but don't stop loving"
i also get tired of empty and lonely feelings
feel the void. it is where you begin to see things clearly and sometimes it is where miracles happen
and it kills you even more when you see them and you have no courage to tell them that it hurts
"sitting on a lonely bench, under a quiet tree, silently pretending you're beside me holding my hands"
"hey quiet one, happy birthday ... wishing you many more to come and hoping to meet you one day, hugs and much love to you 🌻 @herbluelullaby"
people who are close to my heart are trees
"sometimes when i can no longer hold, i close my eyes and pretend i am a raindrop that it's okay to fall and your hands will catch me"
"i hope you teach your kids too how to be grateful, to be givers not takers"
we need nature to help us fix ourselves. we are all complicated messes. confused and full of difficulties
"don't you love how the rain falls on your skin. touching your forehead, exploding over your eyebrows, like a kiss of a lover but sometimes like god's voice"
rain and other silent aches and longings
alone with my heart wondering how to break up with sadness
today i feel like a leaf falling from a tree limb
different is good
"ok, someone here just asked me if i can be her girlfriend on twitter. i wonder if this is a thing here now... but i'm telling you i am not a twitter girlfriend material. i will just bore you 🌻"
if you cannot find inspiration from people then find it from solitude
"when your quietness grows deeper, you will see everything differently not with your eyes but your heart. you will try to hold a bird gently in your palms and when you see fallen leaves and petals on the ground, you will try to pick them up as if they are pieces of a broken soul"
i need to hear you say my name again
guard your friendships
i'm always ready to be soft and quiet
"we will all turn into flowers or trees, it's really just a matter of time"
there is something about this place that softens my heart and hardens it at the same time
i hope you started talking to trees again
having deep feelings for someone is quite exhausting
i have days that require nothing but more silence and more trees
"the thing about being quiet is you see, hear and feel everything"
"i went out for a drive today. the road was beautifully fogged up. i thought of the flowers, they must have turned into fog"
you have no idea how much i want to touch you with my heart
the earthy smell of wet trees
do you also love holding her hands so much that it fills up your entire emotional tank
i hope you will allow kindness to bloom in your heart beginning today
if you love beautiful things write about trees
i miss the sea so much
"i also have my own version of heartaches, some are endless and it keeps me wondering if i will ever be free"
missing you every day is like dying over and over again
stay in the light
whispering a prayer to the trees asking them to help you lighten the heaviness you feel in your heart
i need a good forest bath
you write because you want her so much but you can't tell her
i'm sorry if i didn't hear you falling
i love both. the sun on my face and the raindrop on my skin. they nourish the earth and my flowers begin to grow
i don't mind being labeled soft and quiet
it seems endless but all things shall pass and i hope we will all rise up unbroken
"i love almost all kinds of trees. those in the forest, at the park and the ones where the graves are"
"in your heart you were a flower, then you became a tree, but someone came and said that you have a heart like a bird. these are pretty things. but who are you. how did you end up here"
navigating darkness with courage and hope
we are supposed to love and inspire each other
take me where the rain will not hurt
flowers who strive to blossom in the rain
"every time you love yourself, you bloom"
how did we get to this place of chaos
i want to disappear but i don't know why
all i have are feelings and most of the time they are nameless
i wonder how you breathe now
"i don't recognize this silence. it sounds and feels different, and almost unbearable"
"if you pay attention with your heart, you know that my words are meant to love and adore you"
i have no pretty words. i barely see a single star in the city and the trees are too far. there's nothing here except loneliness and my heart is becoming a graveyard full of dead flowers and forgotten dreams
"i miss the time when happiness was all about flowers and rainbows, collecting raindrops and listening to the sound of your voice in the morning"
let's talk flowers
sinking softly into solitude
the grief in the air is unbearable
"all i know is i am both rain and flowers, and sometimes wind"
sometimes i feel like i'm forever stuck in a daydream
"alone with my heart and hands again, wondering how to break up with sadness"
"to touch and hold you, and become one beautiful flower"
one day i will grow my own forest of tall trees
"every time i let the trees speak to me, my heart becomes more quiet and gentle"
you are allowed to dream
"here i am with my heart, rip it open and find your name inside"
girls who talk to the moon when they are sad
"dear heart, you are drowning i worry about you"
don't you feel pain when you see violence
"when you see something so beautiful you just can't let it go. i understand this deeply, i loved and was loved this way before"
old stories that no longer fit
i don't read you lightly. i read you with my guards down and with my heart wide open
"no matter how quiet you exist, i can still feel you in many things"
in my dream i was holding your hands and your heart forever
"i'm trying to feel everything. the raindrop on my skin, the silence of trees, the laments of the wind and the sound of your heartbeat is the only music i want to hear"
"grateful that my heart is still beating, a reminder that i'm still alive despite everything"
"i don't really know how to do this, all i know is i like you"
"when your heart is in a bad place, it helps to surround it with beautiful things"
trees are good company. you don't have to face bad days alone
"dear heart, don't you dare give up now"
"if you don't love trees, you are rude"
i can't pretend that i don't want more of you
you smile even when suffering. it must be the hope you carry in your heart
i hope you still know how to be happy
you don't need to convince me to love you back
i cannot explain how much i miss you
"so tell me, do you still think about her every night before you go to sleep"
"when people tell me that they are afraid, sad and lonely i don't know what to say anymore. all i can think about is the message of the pouring rain, my lessons from trees and the quiet grace of a falling leaf"
sext: flowers are magic
i'm crazy about flowers
monday has been cancelled
this feeling of longing. i wish it's not mine
humans are terrible i would rather paint or write about trees
trees have been speaking to me in many ways gently teaching my heart how to endure
i know that feeling you changed your mind you let her go now you are crashing down
"love, courage and hope. i think about these things"
"if your heart is quiet and calm today, you should enjoy it"
you are quiet because you don't see her anymore on your notif and you wonder if she still reads you
do you also love loving strangers
everything is falling but you decided to find a tree to cling on instead of sorrow
you make me write poetry in the rain
i woke up with flowers in my mouth
what a lovely sight
dreaming that one day you will look at me the way you look at sunsets
i love trees i love how they gently hold the little birds how their leaves grow and fall quietly  how they gracefully stand and bend in the wind how they are rooted so deeply on the ground i wish i could tell you how beautiful it is to see you like a tree
"i miss you so much. sometimes i feel like i don't know how to live anymore, so scared that nothing will make sense and my words will become so tired and meaningless"
i'm just here admiring the sunset. wondering if i have enough sorrow to become one
"steady your words now, look at her"
can we be lovers like the ocean and the sky the stars in your eyes the raindrops on my skin your words in my heart
dreaming that one day i can rest my head gently on your  shoulder
my weapon of choice today is a fervent prayer from the heart
what now
your hands. your voice. your poetry and other gentle things  that will calm my heart
it's been raining sorrow. i will spare you a tree to hold on to
"days like this, i would rather sit in a forest"
"everything is so grey including my heart, the sky and my dreams"
"i always listen to the rain. sometimes i get startled by the strange sound of trees creaking in the wind. when the leaves are ready to fall, i stop just to feel the silence, the gentleness and the grace"
i hope you feel safe now
i'm just here quietly sitting with nothing and everything on my mind
i day dream of holding your hands in every sunset
my heart wants to kiss you
sometimes i think that i'm better at hugging trees than people
tell me you miss me every time it rains in your backyard
i hope time will come that we can just live on the clouds
i daydream of getting lost in the woods with you
i have enough hope for all of us
i just named my favorite tree after you
find me talking to the trees in your absence
quietly staring at empty ceilings and walls. my eyes are tired
"loneliness is real, you don't really like it when it hits you. sometimes you just let it hold you, because you're too tired to stop it. so you let yourself sink and it hurts like a stab wound to the heart. then you hope you are braver and you hold on"
how old is your soul
everyday i hear too many broken hearts silently screaming for love. sometimes i pretend mine is not included
girls who talk to flowers
you are quiet because you're missing her so much and you wish she feels the same
"today it's only me, my heart and the sky"
i'm not always blue but you don't know that until you catch me freely and joyfully wandering with the birds where many trees and flowers and butterflies meet
another leaf is falling but my hands are full
follow the light. go where your heart is safe
i'm reading the signs and i'm taking them seriously
i'm trying to grow more flowers and we need more trees
"she blooms like a lotus flower she burns like a shooting star she falls gloriously like a sunset  but when she loves oh, when she loves"
"i was just reading your words about light, hope and love and the next thing i knew i was already loving you like my favorite tree"
"i live in a city. i walk few miles everyday just to see and hug my favorite trees. they know when i need silence. i'm sure i will survive without them, but they are important to me and my love for them is pure and will forever remain constant"
life is short. i hope you read good books
her eyes are pure and real. there are stars quietly sitting inside them that's why they appear like the night sky
i'm trying to tell the moon that i'm sad and i need more flowers and hugs
when was the last time you allowed yourself to be grounded by nature. like you sat quietly under a tree. you touched the grass and felt it on your skin. you went down to the river and stared at the waters
i love you. i don't know why i can't stop
"today i just want to sit under a tree, think of you and be very quiet"
i get softer and quieter each time you touch my heart
something dies inside me every time i miss you
"i always want to write soft words, feel soft things and be held and treated softly like a flower"
i'm sorry if sometimes i keep wilting instead of blooming
i don't understand your absence
i think my soulmate is a tree and she is a girl
i don't really talk a lot. sometimes i leave without saying goodbye. even when my heart is hurting you will never know until you rest your head on my chest
you are quiet because she is so beautiful and you are afraid to be the first one to fall
you are my favorite tree
"she is a woman, be careful how you touch her"
"sometimes i feel like the world is pressing me so hard, and i worry that my heart can no longer stay soft"
i miss you. every time i say these words i die and live at the same time
carefully reading your words. you have no idea how much i want to turn all your tears into flowers
"stop abandoning yourself. find her if she's lost. dance with her if she's sad and lonely. adore her if she feels so ugly and insecure and most of all, if you feel like running away, please take her wherever you go"
"i love quiet things. i'm so impressed with the calming sound  of raindrops on flower petals, but my favorite is your heart how softly and courageously it perseveres"
the trees are calling
"i have no urge to stay, i'm torn between wanting to bloom or wilt. they say there are beautiful flowers inside my chest and i have a heart like a bird. but what am i supposed to do with all this sadness and sighs"
you don't have to be so strong all the time. even the right ones fall
my heart is so much like an ocean today and my mind is full of noise. i can't breathe around people and the trees are too far
"i wish i have more words today, but all i have is sadness and sighs and the only thing i feel is your absence"
i cannot hide your light even when darkness is in front of my eyes between my hands
"sometimes, i don't like to talk about feelings"
the flowers inside my chest are ready to wilt
your eyes are my favorite love poems
here i am again with my lonely pen inside an empty room hiding my quietness and melting into sad poems
silence is here but i can still hear your voice
broken branches and fallen leaves on the ground. i don't know if i'm crying or it's raining
i always read your words with my heart
the only time i feel at home is when you hold me inside your heart
"if you love trees, i love you"
i don't need so much. just take me to the woods and leave
i'm just sitting here watching the tree hold a little bird. it feels pure and real
trees know when your heart is sad
sometimes i feel like i'm growing more thorns instead of petals
my prescription today includes more trees and sunrises
you are quiet because everything is falling into place except your heart
"i'm not a poet and i've never been a poem, but my eyes are made of love letters and i always smell like winter"
this nothingness is in full bloom
"today, i wrote something with my tears"
you touch me and i stop wilting
sometimes i want to be the moon
how many times do i need to scream your name into the sky so you will come and get me
"you realize you love her, but she is an ocean and you are afraid of deep waters"
"dear world, i want to be soft but you're not helping"
maybe self love is when you stop comparing yourself to others. everyone shines differently
your eyes are love poems
what happens when your heart is no longer patient
in another life my heart is not broken
i'm not alone i have the moon all night
how cold is your heart today
i once held a heart so hard and it broke
the smell of rain and memories
you are quiet and soft and no one knows how to take care of your heart
"sometimes i don't want you to stay, i don't want you to know how loud my quietness is"
maybe if i touch you i will become a forest
"if you don't love trees, i don't understand you"
it takes a patient heart to grow new leaves
stop judging her sadness. just love her
"i want to tell you how i feel, but your hands are too far"
"are you also good at looking good. like calm on the surface but deep inside you're like an ocean with so many deep, restless and foggy undercurrents"
pretending all the scars i see on your skin are flowers and butterflies
you are a flower. you grow good leaves and beautiful petals but you wonder why you don't fit in anyone's garden
too many words but not one can save the flowers from wilting and the leaves from falling
i always feel so close to the trees
"i want to swallow every word you write, i want to get a piece of your beautiful and brilliant mind"
this is what i know. i love you and i can't stop
you are exhausted because you keep trying to please everyone
you know who you are. it doesn't matter how others see you
"staring at an empty page, i don't know why it hurts"
do you pause for love
the weight of emptiness. why is it so heavy
then you keep falling and breaking like it's the only thing you know you can do perfectly
i wonder if there is a place  where flowers never die where leaves never fall where hearts never break
sometimes all she needs is to be felt
she loves details. tell her how much you want her and why. use your words
"i hugged another tree today, this one was almost naked. i found some bruises and scars on her skin, they were real and so deep. i managed to hold my tears but i was so tempted to kiss them"
"of course, i want to be the reason why your hands tremble, why you get chills on your spine, and why your heart is beating so loud, but i don't want you to be miserable, i want you to love yourself first before me or anybody else"
i hope the rain will pass without hurting your heart
addicted to loving you and i'm beyond recovery
"i'm so captivated by the idea of loving you, but i'm scared of lightning and i get lost in deep waters"
people who know their worth are not afraid to be alone
i went to church today and thanked God he created you
"the sadness you carry in your soul, do you recognize it. do you even know that you are sad, and why do you say you are fine when you are sad"
"i wonder what you do with your chaos, do you bury them or you keep playing them like your favorite old love song until they bury you"
i'm not interested in anything that isn't about you
i always feel at home around trees
"those scars made you so beautiful, why are you hiding them"
don't let your dreams die. even when it's hard. even when your heart is broken
"whether i wander, drift or sit, i always end up thinking about you"
i am a different person because of heartache and also because of love
"once you fall in love with silence you will always have a constant desire to know and understand more, you will always seek depth and meaning"
i am a soul person. outward appearances don't fascinate me anymore
perhaps if you will start affirming and validating yourself instead of tirelessly seeking validation from others your heart will stop breaking
my need for silence is as fundamental as my need to breathe
the simplicity of a quiet mind
"i hugged a tree today and it felt really good. i wanted to show you, but she was very shy. i felt the warmth and her hunger for pure and gentle touch. before i left, i said i love you, and she held me back and said i love you more"
your words are perfect. i know you write them carefully from the heart
i was telling the truth when i said i love you
trees will teach you how to move and fight with grace. pay attention
"if you fall, fall gently and gracefully like leaves from the trees. without a sound, without breaking"
don't just argue. have convictions and make sure they are guarded by love
be careful not to push people away just because your heart is full of doubts and fears
"i know that feeling, you say i love you but they won't say it back and it creates a deep dark hole inside your chest"
your hands are wise. they know where and how to touch
i am so attracted to your heart
"i no longer talk to the trees, not because they don't listen. but sometimes i am ashamed of my words"
this generation demands too much but lacks commitment
"someone took your heart and your hands are shaking. it hurts, that's why you are here"
nothing is impossible when we choose love. i'm not exaggerating
my heart has nothing more to say
"sitting alone in the dark with trembling hands. i need to go back where the trees are, the light in which the leaves sway with grace, i crave that light. i need to be with my solitude once again"
"i knew from the very beginning that if i start touching you, i won't be able to stop"
her silence speaks a thousand words and it's all about you
"and this, thank you my lovely friend, aria 🌻"
what i want is a love that doesn't need a space
"if you want the people you love to stay close, be careful with your words. they have power, powerful enough to keep them at a distance"
"this thing in my chest is like a rising tide. i have no walls, i have no defense"
"something is happening inside me, i cannot find it. i don't know what it is, but i think it's broken"
"no matter how much i choose my words carefully, sometimes they still betray me. so today, i choose not to engage and reciprocate, and will never again speak to you any words of affection"
you're not alone. the whole world is broken
some nights are empty. the sky my only friend
i'm not putting you responsible for my happiness. you are free
i also break like glass
"look at her eyes again, more intently this time. what do you see"
"here i am again packing my things, i have done nothing but leave"
today i'm a cloud. i want to drift aimlessly with no end
sitting with nothingness. please bear with me for a while
i love you. sometimes i find writing so difficult without you
"i don't remember anymore how many times trees held me, and taught me how to bend, sway and stay and fight gracefully"
my sadness has many colors
tell me about what moves you deeply. what touches your heart
i'm back here
sitting under a tree with fallen leaves in my hands and a quiet heart
if your hands are trembling in loneliness and despair try to hold your lonely pen and start writing about your lonely love and maybe you can turn every lonely heart into more less lonely flowers and butterflies
"the thing is when you love so much and so deep, sometimes you sink and it doesn't end until you forget what it's like to breathe"
i'm not always soft. flowers fall and wither in my hands
it's not quiet. i hear the universe sighing endlessly and my hands are trembling
every flower is unique. don't be afraid to be different
"i'm no stranger to heartbreak, i know what it feels like to die inside"
what is this love. it refuses to leave. it clings so much like a fallen wet leaf
"i love you, but sometimes i don't know what to do with this love"
"hello, Hong Kong"
my world is too quiet without you. your absence is freezing my heart
do you also let your guard down sometimes
trees will teach you solitude and stillness
"when you feel you cannot bear any more sadness spend time with trees, flowers and butterflies. you will notice some  beauty, some tenderness, some light"
i love you. i will let you touch me with your sorrow. i will fold my hands into flowers for your pain
i don't know why i can't make you smile
"some days she's a love poem, other days she's an ocean of empty and terrible things"
when sadness crosses over like a storm cloud
every time i feel your absence my heart simply cracks and breaks
your words are perfect
"anyway, happy new year love. i really hope you stay"
2019: when love did not come
do you also wonder where did the years go
so drawn to the light i see in your eyes. i see it even when i close my eyes
"i've been sitting for an hour now. i still could not find words that would fit in my heart. i don't know, but suddenly i feel nothing and everything has fallen silent"
please don't disappear
please don't say you love me if your heart is not here to stay
i don't know how to read your words and not fall in love
i prefer a place where silence is comfortable and few words are enough
"for some people it's the most wonderful time of the year, but for others whose hearts are abandoned and can barely move this is the time when they fall harder and colder than snow. please tell your hearts to stay and listen harder"
the struggle without your hands holding my hands is real
"aside from her favorite song, what else do you play on repeat"
"merry christmas, love"
writing about trees make me quieter and more contained and yet i feel so free and alive
"do you also feel like a broken radio sometimes, people will ask how you are and you tell them similar things over and over like you're okay but your voice is shaking and your brows are heavy"
my eyes are meant to see. i refuse to stay in darkness forever
i have learned to love the sun where i am but every time i watch it fall before moonrise i couldn't help but think about you and the day you left my hands
i love you. the reason why i wrote you letters
"hey, thank you @cardiacscars i appreciate this so much .... 🌻🌻🌻"
"oh, this is crazy... 😏"
do you also look at sunsets with tears
i need you closer. closer than my own heartbeat
thinking about you is my favorite quiet time
"slowly i'm learning not to push people away. i always knew there were people who really wanted to stay, maybe to hold my hands or sit with me. i realized quietness should not be complicated, like i can be quiet and open at the same time"
don't say you love her but you don't send her flowers. this is not how you keep her
i enjoy walking alone. i want my solitude all the time
why are you here. are you also hiding from the world
"you are allowed to obsess, but gently please"
"what about the space inside your chest, what do you plan to do about it"
whispering your name under the sun feels like worship
sometimes you feel so disconnected and suddenly you become a complete stranger to everything you see and hear
"it's like when you wander in a quiet woods you cannot look anywhere and not breathe. the air is pure, the water is clear, the trees are dancing, and there is light. so much light."
"breathe. always try to breathe. take care of the light inside you. when you move, always move forward. there's no point going back"
i read everything. even the space between your words. the place where you hide
then i found and learned new ways to overcome. i think it's true that when you surround yourself with people who exude light. the more you feel you possess it too
i used to be a very anxious person. my temper was too short. i obsessed mentally and i had this inability to focus on anything. i was too paranoid and fear made me very slow and weak
my alone time is where i recharge. it's a beautiful place where i'd rather be
"so much is going on in the outer world of my life and it's quite messy. it's strange not being eaten up by these things. not that i don't care. i take action that might make a difference, and then i grow quiet"
"it's when you look at the trees and spend time with them. when you feel love for them, you become them and you cannot hold yourself apart from them any longer"
i'm not a tree filled with birds. my leaves are falling by the heartbeat. but today i'm carrying within me this long period of quiet and this shimmering moment of pure stillness
i will always be this tender for you
this place is starving for real love
i ache for the people i love
i don't mind if you don't understand me. the trees do and they are so tender and magnificent when they hold a little bird
i'm trying to write about this thing in my chest but i couldn't find the right words. something quite new and yet it feels very old
i'm glad to see you moving on
do you also wish to touch her with your little poem
sometimes i let the trees hold me
standing on a forest ground inhaling the fragrance of trees and watching the leaves dancing in the wind. i don't want to move
"do you know how lucky you are to be alive. we forget, almost all the time, this amazing thing"
it is so quiet now in my chest. i've put down things i used to carry. fear weighed so much
every time i sit under a tree everything inside me gets still and quiet
"this overflowing amount of i love yous inside my chest, i feel like my heart is about to explode"
where do you go when you want to hide from yourself
there's something about the way you write. i adore your grace and wisdom
i'm quiet and still because i'm thinking about you
you deserve a great love story
when you don't need somebody else to complete you. i think this is freedom
today i'm turning all broken hearts into flowers
i respect all forms of silence. i listen more than my ears
it hurts every time i couldn't find the right words to touch your heart
i don't know what to do with my hands without your hands to hold them
i'm trying to write a poem that will fit in your heart
too tired to think and feel. i just want to go down to the river and stare at the waters
"but now i'll leave rememb'ring her... 🎶  ha long bay, vietnam"
"if i love you, your heart will know. i will move heaven and earth to show you"
please bring me more happy flowers from the mountains
"when's the last time someone wrote you a handwritten love letter?  .... i got one today, thank you lovely. it's beautiful 🌻🌻🌻"
today it's just me and my lonely pen wandering aimlessly
my nightmares are mostly about your hands that i couldn't hold and your heart that i couldn't call mine
dry fallen leaves on the ground. they remind me the ending of everything
the rain is sad. the trees are sad and my heart is in between sad and tired and restless
i'm not sure if this is the right place to break. but i can tell you now that writing is a good way to start
"just like the sky, you can only touch her with your heart"
there are flowers blooming inside her chest. i love how she takes care of them
"some remnants of my past i still carry them deep in my pockets. an old torn photograph, a broken heart locket and the crumpled letter you sent when you said it's over"
"whispering more melancholy things to the trees, including your name and how much i've been missing you"
"in the silent company of trees, listening with my eyes closed"
"i sit still enduring your silence revering your limits i don't ask, i don't demand you said you like me, i said i like you so much but my heart is yearning to do more please tell me i'm doing this right"
here i am with my lonely pen writing you poetry at three in the morning. please tell me again this is not love
i want to break your walls. i want your strong affections
love when freely given is the most beautiful thing isn't it
today is simply quiet. there's only the wind and my melancholy heart
"does it happen to you too that sometimes no matter how much you try to spread your wings, you just couldn't fly"
of course i love it if we can watch the sunset together
"then i let myself drift once more, this time i ended up on the surface of a quiet sea. like a message in a bottle i waited to be found and read, and maybe held and loved"
no flowers can match her eyes
her eyes are real. there are stars quietly sitting inside them that's why they appear like the night sky
that's the thing. i always feel
i love it when you read me. but i love it more when you write. i miss you and my heart is dying to read you
"of course it hurts when a tree, a flower or a butterfly dies"
"when darkness continue to persist, suddenly the universe will send you someone who will remind you of the light. the one who will make you think and live and grow"
another day of feeling strangely incomplete
do you also dream of something you know you cannot have.  it's pointless isn't it
"i love you, but my heart is dying to love you more"
hearts laden with snow
i love you. this is something i do not want to hide
going against the light will not take away pain. it will take away hope
it hurts to watch some flowers wilt so soon
i don't mind waiting in the name of love
walking away from the mundane and ugly
i have no words for this kind of love
you remind me about flowers
i'm not ready to stop missing you
some poets have this strange way of writing about emptiness i don't even know i have
i want nothing more today than to get away from the city lights and be alone in the middle of a quiet woods where I don't have to talk to people. i want to find myself again and feel comforted
god i love her  my midday prayer
you need to breathe
"sometimes i don't know where to get the words. when i don't see you, when you are so quiet"
"leave me with my books, i prefer that"
this feeling that i'm drawn more deeply into silence
i'm telling you solitude is fine. love it. embrace it
i believe in hand holding i believe in kissing  and i will always believe in loving no matter how many times  it took my heart and made it ache  with so much sorrow
"i'm after your heart, i want it"
"i still remember how November broke my heart, it never really loved me"
i have no words for November only silent tears
"i can't see it. but i can feel it. sometimes it sits beside me, or above me hiding beneath the light and i just keep on falling and falling"
sometimes she can sometimes she can't love her anyway
i miss you
completely honestly naturally this is the way my heart knows  how to love
i see you in every sunset
"in my quiet and raging moments,  please be my constant"
"i'm here to love and adore quietly, not to hate, judge or criticize. i hope you too"
"a void so dark quietly sitting beside me. touching my skin, holding my hands. i can hardly flee"
i love you and this is the only thing i want to feel
"i hope you understand that these things are temporary, everything is fleeting and nothing really belongs to you except the light that you hold in your hands"
bloom. don't ever stop
she fights  she reaches out she heals she brings light her roots are not shallow her colors are not faded in her small world she matters
touch
"even when the sky is dark, you still look radiant and perfect like the sunlight"
"when people tell you to fuck off, you listen. it's a pretty good advice"
she is all about simplicity
"fallen petals on abandoned roads, still too many"
"i don't know where you are, you could be on the other side of the ocean or at the ends of the earth and yet i still feel very drawn to you"
i easily fall for kind hearts and pure minds. i don't do superficial
do you also fall at night
some people write to change the world. i write to tell you how much i love you
i miss you like hell at night
i want to see you and show you my hands. they match your palms and they are yours to hold forever
but her love is so pure i can't even touch it
i'm watching you closely i can feel your heart i can hear you breathe
so tired of the mundane
"she speaks about hope and pure love but my heart is tired, i can't even breathe"
sometimes i just couldn't write about anything at all but you
"maybe it's true, our hands aren't meant to touch"
i miss you and it is achingly sad i could die
i hope that you find love today. the kind that brings light
i see loneliness everywhere. sometimes i feel it crawling towards me like a child waiting to be held
all i ever wanted was to touch you with my heart
"i'm not even sure if i know you, but i miss you and it feels so strange"
staring at an empty page in a quiet room is lonely
watching beautiful women lifting up each other. please don't stop
bitterness is a bad fruit
and sometimes the falling never ends
let the mask fall
do you also want to disappear but you can't
i hope you listen more than you talk
"i was sound asleep, but my heart was wide awake through the night abandoned"
how badly do you want her
please write me a long poem
every day i also fight to save me from myself
thank you lovely @lostwallfl0wer 🌻
so how are you? are you still loving? where are your poems
some days sadness is real. you feel it touching your skin. moving. exploring. gliding
what about i pin my heart next to yours
but can you catch a shooting star and not burn
i take nothing but the light in my hands and your love
all i need is a heart that is completely mine
my mind is so consumed by you
it's too quiet nothing breathes nothing moves only the light
i found a child in the woods. she taught me how to love myself and hold the light in my hands
"the last time i let myself drift, i ended up on a lonely tree hanging like a lost leaf"
yes please...
"some days are too sad, they leave your heart abandoned"
i don't know which is falling harder. the rain outside or this thing in my chest
and then there's the quiet one
"some people are miracles, they bring so much light"
those who pursue kindness. i adore you
tell me your heart is still soft. i worry about us
when the current keeps pulling you under and you still try so hard to stay afloat. this drowning agony
i love you
it's not easy to kiss the ocean without drowning
they asked you about love and all you could tell them was your heart and how it was broken
some love stories are not simple
you have the most beautiful heart and i don't need poetry to tell you this
i don't know how to say i have daydreams about you
my heart is beating a little quieter today
the stars belong to the sky. the trees to the forest. what about a love that has no place to go
gloomy poems
melancholy letters
paper hearts
i'm in love with someone whose heart beats poetry
all sunsets are beautiful
sitting a little closer to the moon waiting for your hands to hold me
holding hands while walking is incredibly intimate
the comfort of having someone to hold your hands
i'm not a fan of oxford comma. please excuse me
because i need you closer
dull hearts
another leaf another petal another raindrop  falling
"i want to fall and rest inside your heart, i think it's a beautiful place"
"i'm tired, love"
i think October is the sweetest
once again quietly sitting inside a raindrop thinking about you
i hope October will bring you some sort of happiness or good vibe. like everything will fall into place including your heart
"you can write about what you feel but sometimes words are not enough to hold, to mend"
i went wandering around in the forest and found myself
"ok October, let's do this, but please be gracious"
do you also try to be less lonesome
touching the darkness with my hands. turning it into some kind of bright light. i hope you can see now
i wonder if there are graveyards for love letters that were never sent
there is something about the falling of leaves that makes me remember the day how you left my hands
to love them truly despite their heavy flaws. i think that is pure
"thank you, lovely @lullekbh ... 🌻"
the moon is my secret lover
"i prefer to look at the sky, always"
"i don't fear darkness, but i'm not going to stay there"
i'm telling the trees how beautiful you are
"dear heart, please stop mimicking the leaves please stop falling"
it's too quiet but i can hear the silence softly whispers your name like a mantra
after watching Vita and Virginia  me: god i want one. a lady muse
"to my goddess mom here who is forever gorgeous and very kind, fierce and yet so tender and loving, happy birthday! sending you more hugs and tons of kisses! 😘😘😘 i l y 💕 @Dharkneeds"
once again curling my back to quietness
i miss you like the world is ending
"another day, but the same nothingness"
she has grown into a forest. both wild and quiet
"the flowers are sad, i can almost feel them and where are the butterflies. i miss the butterflies"
watching how raindrops dance on flower petals
i'm falling for someone whose heart belongs to the forest
today i'm turning all of you into trees
"tell me, why do you like trees instead of people"
"you are not a lost place, but a beautiful spot in a quiet woods"
grow and move softly towards the light not against it
let go  it's the only way
how many unread poetries are you
this is not the place where you can find the meaning of life. please move on
you move me like how love moves me. deeply and gloriously
a never ending dark void
some words can really hit you harder than the worst kind of physical pain
what happen if you put love inside an empty room
dancing to a quieter music
i hope you bloom even when times are worse
there is grace and tenderness in the falling of leaves
hearts so soft and gentle and open like flowers
some eyes are beautiful and deep like the sea
"another tear fell in my hand, and then another"
i'm not ready to stop loving you
inhaling the fragrance of the trees
she deserves a love that is truly beautiful. love her with a true heart and never ever stop loving her
inside her is a secret garden growing purple jasmines and sweet pea blossoms no wonder why she blushes warmth and giggles tenderness
"more hearts, more flowers and more trees, please"
too many ghosts speaking words of wisdom
"write me a poem, tell me about the color of your sky and your favorite song"
she is poetry written on fallen petals
"catching up with my favorite star, the one i named after you"
today is full of tenderness
i heard the trees whispered your name like a prayer
"sometimes it's not about writing a poem or a song for someone, but it's about the words you speak into someone's life. the kind words, the positive affirmation, the generous praise"
i love how you color the whole sky. you are quite glorious
"every time you say my name, i blush in pink like the sunrise"
i miss you deeply i have no strength i have no power not to
were you brought here by sorrow too?
some nights the moon sings to me
"to the quiet ones,  i can imagine how silence comforts you  it's beautiful"
take me to the sky i want the moon i want the stars
i love the quiet days
i dreamt i was sitting inside a raindrop gently falling upon your skin
sadness is falling upon me like rain and i'm utterly soaked
i heard your favorite song and my heart cried a little
"hey @lithiumdrop thank you for including me in that list, I love the name. nice to see you back! 💕"
i'm most drawn to people who are mindful of trees and oceans
"when we die, we will all turn into flowers"
"some days you feel every pain. the separation, the sadness. the dark face of life"
"quietly reading your words, i want to know what you ache for"
i love your eyes when they look at me
i hope i'm loving you beautifully
"if those hands are looking for hearts to break, i don't want them"
hearts hopelessly screaming for love and everything broken. i hear you. your words matter
"trees are my favorite, they listen even when i'm not saying anything"
"to the one who is not afraid, i admire you"
"tell me, how far have you fallen"
"her love has no end, but crushed down to a secret place hiding"
the hardest part of loving is when you can't stop. when your heart refuses to stop
the ones who clearly see your soul. keep them in your heart
the unfading beauty of a gentle soul
the stars are silently shooting and falling and here i am in the middle waiting for your hands to catch me
"you hold the moon in your hands. the stars in your eyes. indeed, you belong to the sky"
once again finding myself silently drifting towards an empty space
fluent in hand holding
"her silence is profound, you better pay attention"
"i like you. your strength, your honesty, your passion and the way you love"
"you have a marvelous way of describing flowers, trees and oceans. i want to fall in love with you"
grateful for the trees that glow and the drops of rain that flow through my hands
what about some quiet time
fluent in forehead kisses
september rain and other silent aches and longings
i get high when you explode with pretty words
"so tell me, do you still fancy her"
"unsent letters, unread poetries, petals falling off and a love with no place to go"
"i belong to the void. so yes, i'm taken"
somewhere deep inside her it rains everyday. in her mind she's becoming a raindrop
when silence greets you
"the void is always here. it never leaves. sometimes it's dark, but i'm not afraid"
just be who you really are and i will call you beautiful
i need your hands. please turn me into a flower
with you nothing is missing
she's falling and once again she's falling hard
"spend time with trees, sketch a leaf, smell the earth, watch the sunset, talk to strangers, walk, stop, look at the sky, then walk again. you'll be fine"
my hands are untouched and they feel so ugly
the sky is dark and the road is empty. i hear nothing but the sound of crunching twigs and whispers of my heart that longs for you
unfold your wings. fly as if the sky belongs to you
you inspire me with your words and the way you love
all the things you are afraid to say  tell her
if you love her take care of her take care of her a lot
i can't unlove unfeel unbreak so i write
"with your hands in mine, i feel beautiful"
i easily fall for gentle hands
love her. she's a keeper
i miss you. your gorgeous scent and your exquisite old fashioned look
"oh poetry, too many broken hearts holding on to you"
what i need now is a unicorn and a pair of enchanted lips that can save me from sleeping forever
the feeling that you are travelling in the slow lane all by yourself
"september, another kind of loneliness"
"thank you pretty soul for the list add. your words are beautiful, they always leave me mesmerized  @herbluelullaby 🌻"
she is a little distant and quiet. please let her be
there is something about the words you write that i cannot keep myself from admiring
she likes all music. the earthy tone of trees when they rustle in the wind is her favorite
how much darkness can you take
"i love the way leaves fall. i feel the gentleness and the soft whispering sound they make, but every time i sit down and watch them fall, i can't help but think about you"
another day of drowning
do you also feel like sometimes your words are meaningless
i need words that will turn this feeling of desperate loneliness into hearts and stars and smiles and roses
where are the quiet ones
a love that will change everything.  i need that
"if ever i get inside your head or maybe inside your heart, i swear i will not make you cry"
and there are pretty flowers blooming inside her chest and i love how she takes care of them
her mind is a beautiful place
"what are you, a poet, a preacher, a palm reader or a rock star. I'm confused"
please write me a poem that matches my hands
it hurts when a flower wilts in my hands
the sky knows i love you
"oh, melancholy. where can i flee from your presence"
"watch your step, you are playing with fire"
the quiet calm after the rain. it's beautiful
do you also wish to become a poem
words wrapped in passion
this thread is ❤❤❤
i hope you heal
i feel very close to you
"we hope. sometimes, this is how we survive"
"i don't get to see the sunset every day, but i feel it. i know when it's time"
"if you are exquisitely old fashioned and natural, i like you"
"do you also miss her this way, like, you write her name on your walls, you see her face in the stars and when you hear her favorite song everything stops and you cannot move at all"
show me your heart. i want to know you
"hi lovely @OhHell_Cherry  so grateful for the visit, i guess it's my day today! ❤ thank you so much!"
"thank you, beautiful @Dharkneeds for the visit... you are very kind ❤"
"sometimes, i let myself drift like a fallen petal"
my hands feel so ugly when you're not holding them
"stop looking at her like she's a lost petal. love her or not she will bloom, she's a wild flower after all"
i have no room for lukewarm hearts
heartbeats made of bells and windchimes
what if i let you touch
i miss you every moment  every breath
"if you don't see me here, find me in the woods carving your name on every naked trunk and fallen leaf that rustles in the wind"
i just want to breathe you in today and keep you still inside me
"the way you make me say i love you, like it's the only word my lips can utter perfectly"
"you will love the way she speaks about the rain, how she gracefully moves and tiptoes between raindrops"
"but thank you for telling me that i'm beautiful, and thank you for saying it over and over again"
"i have no pretty words today, i just want to sit down and break a little"
"i'm so attached to many things; trees, raindrops, waterfalls and my favorite is the sky, the one i see in your eyes"
"every single time you look at me, i tremble"
"i'm not a garden, i'm just a girl searching for love"
do you also cry every time you walk in the rain
"centuries of love songs and poetries can no longer help me understand this heart. i don't know, but this feeling is nameless"
you are beautiful. the little stars and the big stars adore you
this fog leaves me hurting
"you try to move on, but you don't know where to go"
"tonight, the sky is mine"
"i want poetry, hearts and flowers"
"it's okay. one day you will find the right words. they will fall like leaves, like raindrops"
my nightmares are usually about your hands that i couldn't hold
"oh, naive soul"
"to get around in a place like this, you need to know the language of trees, flowers and waterfalls"
"when days are odd, i hope you fly"
status update: i've been hacked. please ignore DM messages from this account.. thank you.
"when you can't stop writing about her, even when you know it's over"
adore her with your hands
"do you know how much i like you?  i shake, i melt, i fall"
"do u know this guy? bec i saw some of your words (others and mine, too) posted under his name on Goodreads... ????? 😕  @VVanGone @ItsAPerfectLife @fairycemetery"
i dreamt i was a flower growing on the surface of the moon
you are my poetry and my prayer
"if you want answers, spend more time with trees"
heavy sighs and this feeling that i'm sinking lower and lower and lower
"when you truly love someone, you give her your heart. a completely devoted heart"
what is this love? it clings so much like a wet leaf
"i'm here to write you another poem, and if i will stay here, i will stay only to love you"
"freshly cut roses, i like them"
quietly reading your words. i want to know the meaning of your sigh
i will just sit here and adore you
"write me words, sing me an old love song or bring me books, i want to fall in love with you"
collecting fallen leaves as souvenirs
"some days, you just really want to sit down and let loneliness hold you"
i can't stop thinking about your hands
i'm so impressed with quiet things and the sound of your voice in the morning
missing you night and day with tears in my eyes
i love you. i can't help it.  i can't stop.
another unsent hand written love letter in my hands
this world would be in a very sad shape without people loving trees and oceans
"some days are terribly heavy, every step is a prayer"
i want the only hands that matter
"i see people sharing their most vulnerable broken parts of themselves, it seems like they have some sort of covering more powerful and profound than anything else i can imagine. they are not afraid"
sometimes words are not enough to make her stay. it is never simple
i write because i want to keep you
"stop daydreaming. if you like her, just fucking tell her"
"silence so deep, i can feel it in my bones"
no words. just your hands holding mine
i feel strangely incomplete today and i don't know why
"it's too quiet where i am, but  everything is living and moving and growing. finally, i can breathe"
no words. no asking why. i just want to quietly lay beside you
"i can sit all day, watch the trees move and think of you"
kindness is cool. i'm glad you're pursuing it
it rains and rains and rains and i feel like a sad poet
"no words from the sky today, just a sigh that went unnoticed"
i want to see you and show you my hands. they match your palms and they are yours to hold forever
sitting under a tree with fallen leaves in my hands and a broken heart
"i wanted to become a butterfly when i was a kid, when i grew up a little i dreamt to become a flower, then a raindrop, and now i wish to become the sky so i can watch you move and dream under the moon"
"and those who perpetually try to understand, i admire you too"
too many broken hearts searching and praying for love
"sit beside me my love. i will write you songs, and turn you into a poem"
"those who endure, i admire you"
"tell me, how do you want me to love you"
i like your name. i think you are beautiful
"the most quiet hearts, sometimes they fall and break here"
"when people fuss about the color of your eyes, why they look so blue"
i hope you fall in love
i want to write more about love. but i'm afraid to fall into cliches. i see many here
i'm here to forget
this sadness. it rises and falls. it rolls and crashes. like waves. like thunder
hello. come here if you need a hug
"i love everything french. french stars and oceans, and french kiss is sexy"
which flower are you?  i am a complete rose
what makes you comfortable?  me: kindness
i want the moon
today is quite heavy. i have no glorious words to speak
sexual preference: LOVE
"a love like that, you have to die"
"you move me, that's all"
"nothing, just a little blue"
she moves like a flower petal
"your words are so restless, i wonder if they sleep at all"
i am a friend of silence and solitude but not loneliness. I don't think they are the same
this rain is making me feel so fragile and abandoned
i miss holding your hands
those eyes are freaking magnetic
"some days she's like the sun shining in the sky, other days a petal falling off to the ground"
sometimes reading sometimes writing most days breaking
"i don't know about you, but i fight for the things i love"
let me grow you more flowers
loneliness is a terrible thing at 2am
"she's always been quiet, like a gentle breeze, a soft whisper"
"if there's a place where pure love exist, please take me there"
some people are miracles. they bring so much light
"sometimes, i let myself drift like a fallen petal"
"dear heart,  please slow  down"
the smell of fallen leaves
please send me more butterflies
you can define love in any way you want. maybe in one color or many. this is a safe place . i don't judge
"when you see a sunflower in full bloom, remember how much i love you"
"tell me, are you sad too?"
when you feel like falling apart and words cannot hold you anymore
"she speaks about hope. she said grace does not live in darkness so she talks about light and love. I found myself paying attention, and it's all good news to me"
"i decided to fill this empty space with trees, rivers and waterfalls"
she's like a song that will leave you feeling raw and aching
"your words are very sweet, but i'm not falling today"
what about a guy with pure heart and a gentle soul
i will flood every place in your heart with my love
"maybe you need to start living and loving differently now, this way you move on"
"thank you, beautiful soul @DarkerSunrise"
raw and honest pain
i can't stop thinking about you and i don't know what to do with it
i see lonely roads and burned forest ahead of me
i don't know if it's your song that makes me feel raw and aching or maybe it's your silence
sometimes i'm afraid of silence
"let go, it's the only way"
some days I don't want to be here
"if you are honest, you are beautiful"
"i love thinking about you, it makes me quiet and still"
your heart will heal
my home is where the sun falls
quiet and easy. i love it this way
"i'm sorry if you don't see me here every day. but i swear, i'm holding you inside me all the time"
"i love old songs, the sky is my home, and i admire all kinds of flowers even when their petals are falling off"
when was the last time you felt so connected
you inspire me with your words and the way you love
"i wish i could say you are mine we can drive all day, take a chance and hold on tight"
"dear diary,  she's alone again"
"i can hear you, even the things you don't say in words"
sometimes the silence is too much and unbearable
love letters written on fallen petals
"i'm so tired, love please hold my hands  and tell me how to breathe"
"you're too far, i can't breathe"
"dear diary, i think i'm dying inside"
"so tell me, do you still fancy her"
"she tried, but feelings are crazy. so she kept falling"
"then suddenly you wake up and you search for life's meaning, you feel so tired of human love and you just want to walk alone and love yourself a bit more"
"she fell without a sound, like it didn't hurt at all"
"what is your version of rock bottom, mine is every time i miss and think about you like my bones are hurting, my chest is exploding and everything inside me is falling"
"maybe it's true when you love without conditions, like you die to yourself every day"
urge me to stay
life is too short. kiss the girl you want to kiss
tell me if you want me to hold your heart. i'll drop everything
"love is complicated, feelings are crazy. but she falls in love like head over heels. she will drive you insane with a kiss and leave you melting and breathless. she will go all the way, and you cannot stop her. so get her now and never let go or forever hold your breath"
i want to say i love you but you're not mine
"happy 2019, love"
"i know you are different, that's why i like you"
"i miss you every moment, every breath and sometimes i don't know what to do with this feeling anymore"
to a friend who is forever young and beautiful! sending you smiles and more love! may today and all of your days be glorious and amazing! happy birthday! 💕☺ @apocketsaint
you're so lovely to watch. every part of you is fucking perfect
"an open heart is easily wounded, bby"
"i love when you're quiet, when you simply adore wild flowers and tip toes between raindrops, and when you explode with beautiful words, i get high and love you a little bit more"
i want you all the time
"dear december, please take it easy it hurts"
"dear heart, please stop being so scared and just be happy"
"write with your heart and soul. people will frustrate you for not appreciating, just let them be. write for yourself"
"you wanted to say i love you, but ended with goodnight and suddenly you felt your heart crashed like it died a thousand times"
what if i let you touch
talk love to me. but not the kind that will end in pain
sometimes words are not enough to make her stay. it is never simple
"watching the trees move, they look like humans searching for love"
i love your heart. i think it's beautiful
hearts made of flower petals
"dear heart, you look a little lost"
"some people write to change the world, i write to tell you how much i love you"
what do you think about when you are quiet
"have you ever felt that way, like you knew it spoke to your very soul, and you wanted it so much. it took you to a place where you wanted to be, somewhere high above the ground, but at the same time it left you so confused and forever longing"
heartbeats made of bells and wind chimes
"later love, my ride is here 🌻"
"the most quiet hearts, sometimes they break here"
i admire your passion
she's beautiful. some sort of pure light lives inside her
"it's impossible to breathe when you're drowning, and i can tell you now this is exactly how i feel every time i miss you"
mood: comfortably numb
"i'm not sad nor happy, or maybe i don't know. but i'm grateful today, i can freely talk and write about you. i may run out of words but my heart is so full of you and i really don't mind if i break a little because i'm so in love with you"
"i love the way you move, i can watch you all day"
"every time she speaks about you, it's like she's reading her favorite poetry"
"the first time i heard your voice, my heart exploded"
"take me with you, put me in your pocket or press me between pages of your book. i don't mind where as long as i can feel you holding me"
every day i search for words to touch you
"take it easy with her. when you touch her, touch her gently and light like silk and velvet petals. let her sing, move and grow. take your time, she likes that"
"it happens when you truly love, it hurts, then it bleeds and sometimes it never stops"
hold my hands and tell me you're mine
i crave your voice in the morning and every night and each moment in between
you are not truly beautiful if your heart is empty of kindness
"you write about her like little raindrops, then she turns into a song that you play time and time again, then suddenly you can't stop thinking about her like it's  fucking crazy, then one day you wake up and she becomes your everything and so much more"
old fashioned and natural
i just really want you to stay
mood: ancient and almost quiet
"you laugh like the sound of my favorite song. you speak about trees like poetry. your eyes are so  intense like the sun. now i can't decide, i can't think"
you can't keep her from the sky
"be brave, dear heart falling is not easy"
i'm not hiding. i just want to be somewhere quiet
falling for you every day. like rain
"when you forgive, you heal"
"how do you feel when you can't touch the one you love. do you feel like you're dying too. like there is this constant ache in your chest, then you wake up every day like your bones are slowly melting and nothing is holding you up anymore"
it's your eyes. i could tell with one simple look
"it stays in the hollow part of your chest, then in the corner of your eyes, then it becomes a lump in your throat... like unsent letters, unread poetries, songs that you can't stop playing in your head, petals falling off or maybe a love with no place to go"
"dear heart, life isn't always gentle, but be gentle anyway"
be kind. many people are hurting
"he will come and find you, and you will love him with all your heart"
i want you and i want forever
what if i let you touch? is it really in your heart to stay
what happens when people open their hearts
"loneliness is real, you don't like it when it hits you. sometimes you can't stop it, and you let yourself sink. sometimes it hurts like a stab wound to the heart. then you hope you are braver, and you hold on"
"some hearts are too fragile, be careful when you hold them"
"hello october, please tell me how to start all over again"
"be careful when you make a promise, forever is a very long time"
she's falling and once again she's falling hard
i'm ready to stay still for a while
i miss you so much and i feel like it's going to hurt forever
please do not leave terrible scars on her heart
"dear heart, let nothing frightens you, all things are passing"
"take the path where light is, where pure love stays"
no words. just hold me
when the only thing you could feel is the empty ache inside your chest
just write from the heart
"just be careful. there is danger in loving too hard, in holding too tightly"
hand written love letters. i'm old fashioned like that
my bones are heavy and i have no glorious words to speak
she is a gift from the sea. please do not leave her heart empty
be with someone whose hands are steady enough to hold and carry you
"nominated by the lovely @LASwann07 day 7.. seven days, b&amp;w photos of your life...no humans; no explanations...challenge someone new each day...i choose @catalogueofsuns"
"i see people sharing their most vulnerable broken parts of themselves, it seems like they have some sort of covering more powerful and profound than anything else i can imagine. they are not afraid"
i can see how you cover your wounds with words
"some days are terribly heavy, and every step is a prayer"
"nominated by the lovely @LASwann07 day 6.. seven days, b&amp;w photos of your life...no humans; no explanations...challenge someone new each day...i choose @Plaingrayjane"

"nominated by the lovely @LASwann07 day 2.. seven days, b&amp;w photos of your life...no humans; no explanations...challenge someone new each day...i choose @hisxowl"
"i miss you, and i'm missing you a little more today"
there's nothing like the sound of your voice in the morning
just shy and quiet. hi Vincent
"love when given unconditionally heals, and carries you"
"unkind and hateful words, rudeness and too much noise. things like these make me sick"
the kind of falling that never seems to end
"i feel everything deeply, and it's quite exhausting to have a heart like this"
i hope you find yourself again
"rain is here, and other silent aches and longings"
"dear heart, please be strong"
"i fear unforgiveness, so i forgive"
never let kindness leave you
"i love you, and this is something i do not want to hide"
"your words move me, they rip my chest and break my bones. many who don't get it, call it idleness or boredom, but i call it pure art"
i want to hold your hands while you write
"seen but unanswered messages, how to stop them destroying your life"
she values your heart. she loves you
"when you love someone, you give her your heart. a totally devoted heart"
"do the things you love, maybe this way you find meaning"
i miss you and i'm just going to sit here and watch the stars come out tonight
words that trigger deep adoration
"secret tears, i see them"
"... that i have a heart like a bird, and the sky is jealous"
"girls who love with all their hearts,  please let them be"
"it looks like everyone has aches and pains, please be gentle"
this is a lonely place
"she's like an angel with broken wings, she can only fly holding your hands"
the simple pleasure of uttering your name
the world ends with you
once again finding myself silently drifting towards you
i will always be this tender for you
i desperately want you to feel the same way
"i know it's hard, but i want to get there, where pure love stays"
"may you have a wonderful birthday!  @dreamscaffold more love, hugs and kisses to you my dear! xox ☺"
"old sad songs hitting you down to your core, suddenly you feel like a petal falling off"
take me to the sky
this heart is so full of you
even the right ones get lost and fall in secret
you look so lonely
"eyes like the sunset. be careful, lest you fall"
silk petals and other gentle things that will melt your heart
hey @Wantnit i truly appreciate you! thank you so much! ❤
"hey @elixandor thank you, that's very kind of you! ❤"
"you wanted to say i love you, but ended with goodnight, and suddenly you felt your heart crashed like it died a thousand times"
"hey lovely @sirensong1208 thank you for dropping by, you are very kind ☺🌷❤"
i gave up trying to forget you
hey lovely @DarkerSunrise thank you for the visit ☺❤🌷🌻
"your words are very honest, and i believe you are with yourself too. and that is something i really adore, because i myself haven't reached that point that i can write everything i want without holding a bar.. and yes it's not up to us to please people here"
some days you just really want to sit down and let loneliness hold you
don't try to force anything. the right people will come when the time is right
just let the rain gently fall on your skin and breathe
i wish you talk to me. i wish you say hi
"no matter what, don't let this fallen world steal your tenderness"
i came here to love you. the only place i knew i could
"dear heart,  i'm sorry, i know it hurts"
i'm just going to stay here and admire you
it's probably how some people protect their hearts
walk in the forest. be a part of nature and see how you heal
hand holding gives me comfort
i will love you until your leaves fall off  me to the trees
"i feel like the stars are alive and breathing, and they watch me dream of you every night"
please stop looking at me like a lost petal
"keep going, even when the rain refuses to stop"
you see her move like a flower petal
this too shall pass
"the one who pleases your soul, don't let her go"
find her in drops of rain
give her reasons if you want her to stay. maybe give her all of you
rain and all the i miss yous inside my chest
i'm just going to sit here and adore you
take care of your heart. protect it
"i found solitude in writing, and i feel like i'm healing every time"
"hang on to your heart, it's okay if you feel"
sometimes i let myself drift like a fallen petal
"tall trees surrounding me. finally, i'm home"
and suddenly i feel naked without you
"there's a lot of pressure these days on social media, putting too much emphasis on physical body, sometimes it makes us feel inadequate and dissatisfied. know that you are more than your physical appearance. detox from social media for a while and see if that makes a difference"
"love your body, love yourself and embrace your unique beauty. see beauty around you, and in the faces of the people you love"
"i appreciate how you look, but the most precious part about you is who you are inside. i love what's inside"
"some days i miss you so much, and i hold on like i have hope but other days i break and cry"
loving is easy if you will stay
let go. it's the only way
moving on is difficult without forgiveness
being content to listen to someone whose heart is heavy is a gift you can give today
sitting under a tree with fallen leaves in my hands and an open heart
my mind is so consumed by you
"i don't know how much these songs really mean to you, but when you sing them they seem to mean so much and i'm beginning to love them"
i still dream about you
"the way you write words,  how you make me feel and then fall, but don't stop  because you make me love and i hope i won't break"
"little flowers are beautiful. they are more gentle and quiet, but this world is too loud. i hope you survive"
memorizing every part of you
"you are a wife and a mother, being both is not very easy. you deserve everything beautiful.  happy mother's day ❤"
"if you hate, you simply lose yourself"
another leaf is falling
"don't worry. one day, someone will come and he will want all of you, and it doesn't matter if you are flawed"
"sometimes, love comes softly"
i want only a faithful love
"pay attention to those who are present to love you, even in silence"
let kindness be your default mode
"he came like rain, and gave me a new heart"
i want you so bad
"she knows her worth, and yours too"
she's full of soul
"the world is so quiet here, i want to love you this way"
she then planted flowers in all the places you left empty
i hugged a tree today and felt my heart opened up
let me keep and admire you
her heart is the most beautiful thing about her
"""The life you clutch, hoard, guard, and play safe with is in the end a life worth little to anybody, including yourself, and only a life given away for love's sake is a life worth living"""
once again covered with sadness heavier than the sand of the sea
"i miss when you write, exposing your heart"
"amazing then awful, amazing then awful... i don't think human hearts were created to bond and break, bond and break over and over again"
stay soft
your heart hurts because life is too broken and flawed
"fall in love, but try not to lose yourself. listen to your head once in a while, i'm sure your heart wouldn't mind"
be careful who you profess your love to. love comes with togetherness and knowing someone deeply
i know gentle hands when i see them
talk love to me. but not the kind that will end in pain
the ocean. her heart's true love
"people who are courageously different, i like them"
"inside her is a beautiful garden, please don't break anything"
"they only get water when it rains, but look how they stand"
i hope you heal
"being quiet isn’t a bad thing, many people though cannot stand empty air"
maybe he didn't. but you loved yourself and that was enough
sunset here is simple and quiet
and then there's the quiet one
i love the way she speaks about the rain. how she gracefully moves and tiptoes between raindrops
your love makes me quiet
"work on your thoughts. like those fears, they need to leave"
"if you love her, you don't sit and daydream about her all the time. you go and do something for her"
when you say you are surviving do you also mean that you are trying to let go and move on
heartbeats made of bells and wind chimes
hearts made of flower petals
"slow down, baby. slow down"
"her silence is profound, you better pay attention"
quiet now. she's still learning how to breathe without hurting
"your hands are too far, tell me how to breathe without holding them"
"my joys are immense, and so are my heartaches"
tell me how to read your words without tears
"let go, it's the only way"
maybe you should stop blaming love for your misery
unspoken issues of love and other things that i can not name
i see little flowers drooping and falling and fading
covered in grey and other shades of melancholy
holding your hands was the only thing i knew i could do perfectly
love must be sincere
"you've been weeping for so long, dry your eyes now"
silent aches and longings
"i love the parts that are raw, fragile and flawed"
when words are not enough and all you need is that one person to hold you
grateful for the trees that grow and the drops of rain that gently flow through my hands
girls falling head over heels
"dear self,  please learn how to fall without hurting yourself"
"sometimes, i see you like an anchor, so completely immovable. as if life couldn't touch you"
"your mind is the most beautiful. your words are penetrating. suddenly, i feel my heart bleeding"
one day someone will hold you gently with both arms and never let go
i hope love will find you today
i want the only hands that matter
"find her outside, under the night sky, falling for a shooting star"
"suddenly, i miss holding your hands"
december is leaving too softly
broken girls love differently
december is telling my heart to forgive
i'm just a girl with words
i'm all yours to keep
"i always think about your hands how i loved holding them all the time yes, i remember now maybe because it's all i want to do to hold them once again"
she writes caring words
this constant battle between my heart and my mind. it's awful and i'm getting tired of its sound
the sky is dark and the road is empty. i hear nothing but the sound of crunching twigs and whispers of my heart that longs for you
"i miss you, i'm saying this with tears in my eyes"
my heart still sinks every time i think about you
"staring at a blank page, thinking how to write 'i don't care' beautifully"
"you don't keep flowers in your pocket, they will not survive"
december is telling my heart to lighten up
sometimes the bleeding never ends
you were always happy and laughing. i was always quiet. holding your hands was my comfort
"i remember your hands, i loved holding them"
she moves like a flower petal
i'm no stranger to heartbreak and i know what it feels like to die inside. believe it or not it will come to pass.
sometimes we forget how beautiful sunsets are
just love her
"hey, @DarkerSunrise finally it's Sunday and i didn't miss it!happiest birthday to you, i hope you enjoy your special day! more love everyday, and forever! weeeehh! 🍻🍰🍗🎁🎊"
i need a love that will change everything
"she called him babe, and everything fell after"
more fallen petals
"the words i write for you, i hope you don't find them too familiar. i hope you don't get tired of their sound"
i hope you're loving yourself better now
"hey, happy birthday to you... thank you for sharing your words. the stillness, the silence, your love for nature.. i just love everything ☺ @ItsAPerfectLife"
"you don't force love, let it find you"
"this thing in my chest is like a rising tide. i have no defense, no walls"
talking to a lonely tree about the meaning of life
"and when you speak my name, i blush in pink like the sunrise"
"what i'm saying is, i don't like myself when i miss you like this"
"hurting leaves and petals, slowly falling off"
she's good at smiling even when tears are near
"i want to hear your voice once again, i miss the way it gives me chills in the morning and how it makes my heart so tense every time"
perpetually pensive
"i know very little about oak trees. maybe, it's true.. i love all kinds. i love the things they teach us, i just feel that they get lonely too when ignored"
"i respect the trees. those in the forest, at the park and even the ones where the graves are"
"she's always like that, she will teach you how to love yourself"
"i wish i can write more pretty verses. like when you read them, you will again believe in love and maybe you hold on"
"watching the trees move, they're like lonely people searching for love"
"breathe into the feeling. maybe,  try a little tenderness"
write me words. tell me about the color of your sky and your favorite song
more flowers soak in rain
"she's heavily flawed, but she's beautiful and kind. she bends her knees and stretches her arms, even her hair reaches out. you will love her more than her skin and bones"
i'm here to write verses and adore you
"raw and flawed, but the words were there"
"suddenly, i have no words, as if your silence took them away"
"maybe, she's not real. maybe, she's a unicorn"
"i know very little about unicorns,  all i know is they are sweet animals and they love rainbows. i'm not even sure if i have the ability to touch them"
"hey, happy birthday @EyesOfGreen73 ... more love to you, lovely! 🍰🍰🍰"
"some came here to break, others to heal. just give them space and let them be"
"little flowers are beautiful, they are more gentle and quieter, but this world is too loud, i hope they survive"
"strawberries and blueberries on the side, i love my pancakes like that and you by my side every day, always"
"at the end of the day, it's really just me and the sky"
"i don't know why this heart couldn't say no, so stubborn and reckless, it refuses to see, all it does is to love you"
"i heard your favorite song, and caught myself biting my lips to hold the tears, but they fell sooner"
"those tiny purple hearts, i wish i knew what they meant"
"don't look at me like a lost petal, just come here and hold me"
and all this sadness is simply about your presence that i couldn't have
some raindrops stay on shallow places. others go deep
because i love you without reasons
"they all fell on the ground when i came, the red ones were my favorite, i wasn't able to catch any and it broke my heart"
"in case you wonder if i still write for you. yes, i gave up trying to stop"
"calm down, 280 will not kill you"
"i want to live inside your heart, i want to stay there for good"
chest full of i miss yous and other silent aches and longings
it's not easy for me to see you fall
"finally, my ride is here ✈  #flightmode"
love unrequited will not survive
find her in drops of rain
very shy and steady
"i talk to myself a lot but i do get   so tired of my own voice, so i wish you talk with me"
"but seriously, beauty is fleeting, but the kind that endures is the one that can be found inside you"
ever look at a flower and you see nothing but love
"talked to myself the whole day. nothing really profound, but mostly about you"
don't worry the right ones will always stay
this endless waiting. i wish i have more time
her tone carries love every time she speaks about you
mom used to tell me to find a real man not a boy. now i understand better
"you said it's real and you love her, then protect her. get her out of here. this is a dangerous place"
what about love  how does it work  how long does it last do you give it only when asked
sometimes her silence is the most difficult thing
"hello november. i hope you slow down a bit, october ended too soon, and i'm still tired"
hand holding gives me comfort
"happy, happy birthday to you @DeusLady ... wishing you more love today and every day until forever!!! ☺🎂🎈🎁"
"you're too quiet, and suddenly i have no words to say"
"i want to love you more than this, i'm just afraid how much your heart can take"
when loneliness becomes a friend. a friend you can't bear
"you said love is the answer, show me"
take a flower in your hands and really look at it. what do you see
i don't really mind if you say 'fuck' a lot or if you don't say it at all. just water your plants and try to send love once in a while
"and the sky, i love it. blue or grey, i love it"
i love all kinds. the ones that bloom and the ones that die
flowers soak in rain
my kind of person is someone with a steady hand and a kind soul
"the last time i tried, i hit rock bottom"
what i'm saying is all things are passing and that includes your pain and mine
i adore you for what you are and your name is tattooed on the wall of my heart
"they say signs are here. some take them seriously, others fall asleep"
"some days words are not pretty, but write anyway"
"when it feels like everything hurts and nothing seems to work, try to touch the sky with your knees bended on the ground"
"when your mind wrestles with your heart, it's awfully confusing"
"she loves like a flower, her heart blooms"
so in love with you. i can't either erase it or ignore it
fall with me and stay
sitting by a tree waiting for leaves to fall around me
"i hope you don't mind me sounding like a broken record every time i say i love you, i miss you and i think of you all the time"
feelings so intense that you can't put them into words
"aww, this is so pretty. thank you so much 😙"
"i heard your voice, and suddenly i needed nothing"
i have no words today. i'm just going to sit here and think of you quietly
when love hits you out of the blue
"just hold my hands and breathe, i'm here and i love you"
"her silk petals are the most beautiful, you don't touch them with unholy hands"
i'd like to grow you more flowers
"dear self, you said you've learned your lesson. now prove it"
"again and again, it's you"
"this world is too fallen, i hope you survive"
you are my poetry and my prayer
"she writes about you, the reason why it hurts every time"
"hello 2 am, it's me again"
let me hold you and keep you with me
"more than your words, it's your kindness that i adore. please stay"
when you put everything on hold because you love
kindness makes me smile
"forgive, this way you move on"
when your mind shuts off but suddenly you feel everything all at once
"you expected nothing, but suddenly you realized that she's everything you ever needed"
"you are love, always"
"arabica coffee, medium roast. black. no sugar"
because love is something else
i'll just sit here and adore you
playful touches
"touch her face, linger a little bit more. she likes that"
"my hands and yours, i love the way they touch"
quietly sitting right beside the moon and thinking of you
"walk your talk, this way you make sense"
her petals are slowly falling off. she must be really tired
the flowers are beautiful. thank you ... ❤
"you wonder how not to drift away ...find an anchor, something that can't be moved and you hold on"
"just be kind, because love is like that"
"hold her gently until she's ready to let go, then hold her some more until she's ready to move on"
when you are at your worst
sunday longing: YOU
"so attached to many things; leaves and petals, raindrops and my favorite is the ocean, the one i see in your eyes"
hello October.. please be tender
"my heart is tired, but it refuses to stop"
my heart's only agenda is to love you
so crazy about you. i don't know what's taken me this far
"she's a woman, be careful how you touch her"
"i just feel it, a lot of it as though my heart is bleeding to death"
my heart needs a break  #tired#offline
i wouldn't choose me either
it hurts a lot to know
mom is lecturing me about love vs infatuation. she forgot i'm 24
i don't know what's killing me - missing you or pretending not to
i'm here because i want to be with you
you keep on running away from what you feel and now you're restless
you wonder what to do with those feelings ... just be gentle with them
"we think too much, all we need to do is give love"
see how trees let go when their leaves fall
i just want to be the last person you think of at night. the reason why you close your eyes every time you hear that song
one day i'll grow my own forest of tall trees and wild lilies
"some days she's an empty page, other days a missing lyric"
"the one i love doesn't like Math too.. at least we have something in common, better than nothing 😭"
you give me butterflies. so many
if there's one thing that she's passionate about . it's love
you're still the one i think of at night. you still have my heart
"10 hour drive, hello tuesday"
i love your heart
is it really wrong to say please love me too
"i knew i would probably never see you, but i'd still want to try and say i love you"
"most days i pretend that you see me, other days i hold on"
i want to stay where you are. i don't mind if it's quiet and grey
"when leaves fall, i wonder if the trees ache. i wonder how they hold on"
rock bottom moments
when your heart refuses to let go
"i refused to join them, i'd rather sit alone and think of you"
"i stepped on several tiny pieces of broken glass on the side walk, and saw my heart how it looked like when you left"
whenever i feel this way i don't know if i'm lost or abandoned or maybe i just really miss you so much
"i don't know what's killing me, the cruelty of this world or your hands that i couldn't hold"
nothing has changed. i still miss you
i get lonely here too
i uttered your name not once but many times today
the only plan i have is to be with you
"i love both, the sun on my face and the rain in my palms. they nourish the earth and my flowers begin to grow"
please send me more butterflies
"you are beautiful and i love you but you are crushing me, baby"
"this world will break you. it will make you cry. be strong, keep your peace and hold on"
tell her she's your Mona Lisa
"the kind that will suffice, something that i can hold and reach like a hundred times and forever"
"give more love. if it's possible, the kind that doesn't require conditions"
"me, too"
i can't unlove unfeel unbreak i wish i knew how
"i have yet to learn how to sing you to sleep, but i can write you my heart till you fall"
"and i'm unlearning things, too, but not that part. i can't unlove you, even if it feels like drowning"
i'm learning new things like folding papers into hearts and letting you go like the wind that i couldn't grasp
i'm done with so many things other than loving you
"im sorry if you find these words not enough, if they can no longer hold you. if you break now, they will break with you"
i don't know why i keep on falling like it's the only thing i know i can do perfectly
you stay as friends but you wanted more
earth doesn't want to hurt you. she simply wants you to pay attention whenever she tries to make a point
i just wanna lie next to you and we can just go on and on and on
i gave up trying to forget you
"her eyes speak sunsets, leaves and petals and other gentle things that fall"
"read, write your heart, look at the sky and walk"
you were not an accident
you said you want to tell me a lot. just put them in three words and i'm fine
last night in my dream you said you loved me. i cried
you don't hurt good people. not many of them exist
i'm reading the signs and i'm taking them seriously
the world is getting too loud fussing about many meaningless things. the sky is weeping and i'm tired
"it's not what you say, but it's what you do. be careful how you move"
love is like that. it can break you but it can also give you everything
"she just loves to watch, she breaks and cries after"
maybe it sucks being the one who loves more. but love is like that you don't count. you just love more and more and more
"the one who pleases your soul, don't let her go"
"people who makes you feel important and values your worth, keep them closer"
it's pretty when someone likes you and isn't afraid to show it
when you want to stay but the sky is too far from you
when things break
"oh god, you have no idea"
"i miss the time when happiness was all about flowers and rainbows, collecting raindrops and listening to your voice every morning"
"you see, i can't go on without writing about you"
"be okay with yourself, just the way you are. you are so beautiful when you are vulnerable. just sit with it for a minute"
i'm taking you seriously
i guess this cutie is here to stay
i just want a heart that is completely mine
i don't know how i ended up loving you like this
you are beautiful and so much more. let these words sink in
"when you see them in full bloom, remember how much i love you"
i don't scream. i sigh. maybe the reason why you don't hear when it hurts
"do you love like there is no tomorrow, like it's the last night of the world"
"it happens when you truly love, you see their mess and flaws and you love them anyway, sometimes it makes you love them even more"
"broken people, i see them here everyday. more broken than me and they are beautiful"
please take me to the sea
just keep breathing till it doesn't hurt anymore
maybe you're just too beautiful to be mine
my eyes are not blue
leaving the last page empty
"some people, no matter how much we are drawn to them, are not worththe attention and sacrifice"
"she paints her sadness in the woods, on every naked trunk and fallen leaf that rustles in the wind"
spending a full day in quietness
you always draw me back to the basics.  like getting quiet and thinking of you
"you wonder what to do with your feelings, keep them in your heart where they belong and when it's heavy, spread them like tiny raindrops"
let's just fall in love and make the world nervous
i'm so impressed with quiet things and the sound of raindrops
i understand i'm yours
collecting fallen leaves as souvenirs
i want to take you with me and place you somewhere i can see and hold everyday
i can still feel what's missing
"and if you fall, the sea will hold you gently"
"don't be afraid to fly, the sky is yours"
"tell me, how do you want me to do that"
i still feel the same like i still get lost when you're not here
"you wonder how to begin your day, maybe you can start with her, love her first then you tell her how much you miss her"
i long to get close to you. very very close
she's like that song that will make you close your eyes and ache in pain
"the words i write for you are true and i'm real. they breathe as i breathe and if i break, they break with me"
all i hear are raindrops and whispers of my heart that longs for you
sometimes i let sadness hold me. the kind that makes me sit all day and just think about how much i miss you
would you mind hitting that follow button so i can move closer and make a connection ... 🌷🌻🌹
sitting a little closer to the moon waiting for you
i just want to clutch you to my chest and take you to a quiet place to love you
i don't want somebody else
all this sadness is simply all about your presence that i couldn't have
another day without you
i feel like a raindrop waiting for your hands to catch me
"if ever i see you i will grasp you tightly to my chest, i swear i will never let you go"
"it happens when you love, you tear up"
"even the things you hate about yourself, i will love them a hundred times and forever more"
"i keep breathing without you, but every day is like the end of the world"
ever miss someone so much that you break and cry
no pretty words today.. i just want to sit down and break a little
counting teardrops
"am i loving you too much, do you want me to stop"
let's kiss and forget about the world
"it happens when you miss someone so much, your chest hurts and sometimes breathing becomes difficult"
writing you another love letter that i'll never dare to send
"so fragile, often broken"
"i need you to just sit beside me, bring your books if you want to, that's alright. just sit beside me"
i felt everything today and my heart broke a little
"my words are falling deeply into you, i hope you hold them with care"
maybe i'll crash and burn but i can't stay away
i'm yours and i'm staying
"no need to cover yourself in fine linen, just come as you are"
and sometimes the bleeding never stops
she named all the stars after you. she must have fallen too hard
"i love you floating around my head, it makes me quiet"
"maybe it's weird or a little scary to just let people know you like them, but it's beautiful if you tell them"
"dear me, please stop arguing  with your heart"
"sometimes i lose myself when i write about you, but i said it's fine, no one knows anyway"
"thank you my friend.. don't lose your list again, that means don't deactivate     haha ✌ @awaitingfrost"
"tell her, she deserves to know"
love her until your bones ache and your lungs split. until every single thing inside you falls and hits the ground
"collect good people, too.. not just good memories and stories"
this rain is making me feel too much
there isn't anything left to be said but i swear i'll spend all my quiet moments to write you into words
"messed up heart, i hope i survive"
i tremble when you write like that
"love her, the one who fell without a sound"
"i remember the first time i heard your voice, my heart exploded"
"none of these gives me comfort, i want you"
much of this loneliness is about you
"and i swear, i'll go all the way with you"
she speaks about you a lot and she radiates a certain kind of calm every time she does that
fallen petals on abandoned roads. so many of them
she gives everything all the time and she's a goddamn hopeless romantic
"do you miss me, can you feel me when i think about you"
she's falling for you and once again she's falling hard
me every time you're not around
how come when your heart is broken you feel everything
i love you but sometimes it breaks my heart and it really hurts every time i breathe
"this missing you, it will never go away"
"don't go too far, baby. stay where my eyes can see you"
you make me almost believe in magic
how could you spark something this intense in me
tell me if you want me closer
"the words i write, you keep them, they are yours to hold forever"
it happens when you're in love. you simply can't get them out of your head
you stay in my heart
you lay yourself bare and they accept and love you as you are. keep them closer
everything about you makes me smile
all this rain is making me think about you so much
"love with all your heart, this is just how true love is, with all your mind and soul"
"some days are easy, but most days my heart demands more of you"
"i love silence and tenderness. i fall for such words easily. i love kind words too, and seriously i don't mind rawness and flaws at all"
"some days are so quiet and soft and all i want to do is to love you, love you and just really love you"
"thank you for the list add, you are very kind, love your words and you 🌻@dreamscaffold"
"i don't know how to write i miss you without a single tear falling on my lap, maybe the truest words i've ever written, i can't even breathe"
a raindrop wishing for your hands
and this whole thing is about that one flower living on a star
caution: falling in progress
the quiet pleasure of watching you move
what if i let you go
i just want to be with you all the time
when words are hard to come by
"i told you, there are flowers in the sky you see them after the rain and sometimes during the night and they are as beautiful as you are"
i only write for you and the flowers in the sky
let me keep you
i want you closer
i need beautiful things to fill this waiting
it's lonely outside
"it's not that i don't like people, it's just that sometimes i'd rather mingle with trees"
sometimes i wish i could save you
sometimes i wish to have more trees around me than people
"thank you for the list add @awaitingfrost, you are very kind 🌷"
watching the leaves fall like silent teardrops
she's a bit messy but she's kind
"don't look at me like that, i might love you forever"
find someone who can walk with you even if he can fly
i want to hold your hands and kiss you while you read your books
"i love thinking about you, it keeps me quiet and still"
"then i said to myself, i'll just plant a garden and write you poetry"
in my dreams you're always mine
just stay where my eyes can see you
"i'd like to grow you more flowers, take you deeper and write you more love letters"
"dear love, i always knew that someday you'd come find me"
"i'm not still, my hands are shaking and i just spilled my coffee"
when you find yourself constantly searching for something to hold
please stop being so mean. there's nothing attractive or admirable about this behavior
stop treating people poorly. dig deep and find compassion in your heart
tell me how do you want me to love you
from sunrise to sunset and each moment in between i love you
"sometimes when my heart hurts, i want to grab your hand and place it right exactly where it aches the most"
write if it hurts and if it hurts some more plant a garden
i want more of you
my quiet moments are important and they are yours
this is a strange place. i can hear everyone's heart
be careful. some words can't be taken back. ever
the kind of falling that never seems to end
when you know that something is dying inside you
secret tears. i see them
too much empty space
"when you put love in a bottle, it hurts"
you don't know how lonely that makes me feel now
i fell in love today
when you know that your feelings will never reach them and yet you stay completely and desperately in love. the worst feeling in the world
i love you and i'm too far from slowing down
at a loss
"even if you tell me nothing, i will still hold you in my heart"
"alone with my thoughts, craving for raindrops and strawberries"
everything conspires to make me think of you
your words tell me so little. i want more
i want a flower tattoo on my skin with your name on every petal
tell her it's ok to fall and you'll catch her with everything you've got
i want more flowers in my garden and a wishing well
real and true love seeks what is best. sometimes this kind of love will compel you to say no. i'm just saying
this love begins and ends with you and the middle part is all yours
what can i do if i fall easily like teardrops
you run inside my head like a star crossing the night sky
i hate the way you make me feel
"tell me about the one you love. mine is like a sad song, a rain drop and a universe"
don't give me the moon and the stars. give me you
a love that can change everything. i need that
"every time i miss you like this, the sky disappears"
i can sit all day watching the trees move and just think of you
when you love someone you can't hold. it's lonely
you are so much more
i'm afraid. i know i'm going to love you more than this
and having to pretend that every detail i know about you doesn't float around my mind all the time
the kind of loneliness that doesn't pass after sometime. it lies dormant
"when you want to say i love you, but you know you can't. it burns you alive"
it's beautiful to find someone whose heart beats so much like yours
"buried in your silence, i could die"
"i just heard your favorite song, i cried a little"
i love watching your eyes like the sunrise
all things are passing but not this love
i want you as you are
tell me where your heart is
this is a lonely place. i don't know why i am here
"old photographs on the wall, a faded lamp and a century old tea pot"
i want to love you more than this
give me something to go on
a heart that flies and a mind full of thoughts i can't explain
she collects tears in a bottle and labels them love
🌻🌻🌻
you don't hurt a tree. you protect it
she bleeds flowers
"this tug of war between mind and heart, it never ends"
"love her or not, she's going to bloom. she's a wild flower after all"
this world has become so cold and difficult. we need more kind people
"sometimes we pretend that we are okay, that words are enough to mend, to heal"
"if you don't see me here, find me several miles away chasing sunsets"
"this love won't leave, it clings so much like a wet leaf"
i'm not giving my heart to other things. it's all yours
she's an old soul who dances to the sound of wind chimes
grandma used to tell me that angels were created to keep people from falling. i love that
"your silence is giving me grey sky, it makes me lonely"
"grey skies and empty pages, i don't know if i survive"
"catching up with my favorite star, the one i named after you"
"and you wish the last petal will tell you ""she loves me"""
"tell me more, baby...make me shiver like i'm yours"
"and she just goes on and on and on, she doesn't fear being unloved"
she's crazy and high and on edge about you
"her eyes are soft and deeply set, they were made to speak"
"i'm after your heart, i want it"
kiss her face and tell her how beautiful she is
you're the only one i want
"stop looking at me like a lost petal, just hold me and tell me you want me"
"i love you like this, i hope you find it beautiful"
"everytime she speaks about you, it's like she's reading her favorite poetry"
is it okay if i lurk a little bit longer and deeper inside your heart
"sometimes i don't know where to get the words, when i don't see you, when you are so quiet"
"the moon just asked me to run away with him, but i said no because i'm so in love with you, your empty forest and your broken fence"
"stay warm, baby"
sometimes you just need to step outside and get some fresh air
it doesn't matter if u love like hurricane or a gentle wind or a tree that bends or breaks. just don't stop. there is no weakness in loving
"dear heart, please stop falling"
"her eyes are real, there are stars quietly living inside them that's why they appear like the sky"
i'd rather love
"unrequited love, this too shall pass"
"it's love, baby.... it hurts too much to be anything else"
some days my heart is heavy and all i can do is touch a flower and pray that it will move and blossom in my hands
i shake like a leaf when you write like that
she's heavily flawed but her heart is a cathedral
just be true to your own character. it's beautiful to be authentic
"i don't need answers, i need your arms around me"
"i swear, these are not just words"
i just want to look at your face and touch it
something about you is magnetic
i wonder what your day is like
i love you and i don't mind saying this over and over again
"i love when you write, but in case you fall for these words, i love that, too.."
"she loves simple things coffee, a good book, raindrops and the sound of an old typewriter"
and every time she hears your voice she turns into a flower
"she speaks about you a lot, like true love, like it's forever"
i want every part of you
she just keeps crashing
"i'm so scared to love you, but then i love you"
she writes you love letters and everyday she reads them like she's saying a prayer
forgive me for not even trying
"i love the parts that are raw, fragile and flawed"
we all need love. don't be ashamed to admit it. it is a natural need as the air we breathe
"you are too quiet, i don't know how to continue"
i'm afraid i might hold you so tight until your wings crush in my attempt to keep you close
"it's okay if i don't see you all the time, i enjoy thinking about you as a bird"
i know you'd fall
i only fall for gentle hands
"some people write to change the world, i write to tell you how much i love you"
"tell her this: i love the way you talk about the rain, the way you gracefully move and  tiptoes between raindrops"
"i don't pick flowers, i love watching them grow"
falling for you is madness
the first time i heard your voice i knew i was going to love you like this
"and when love bites, breathe, heal.. you can move forward"
no love comes without acceptance
"even when you have fallen into silence, i still feel you softly in many things"
she expresses her love differently. don't judge her
"i tell the flowers about you, they know what keeps me from sleeping many nights. they know that i think about you a lot"
i'd like to hold your hands while you read your books
she came like a sad song
"when you see a sunflower in full bloom, remember how i love you"
"i love words, but i'm not falling for them today. i need to be inside your arms, i want you"
every night she tells the moon of her sadness
forgive me for being fickle
she's beautiful like a song
she's a keeper
i care when trees fall
"if you held me like your favorite book, i swear i would never let go"
she's a woman. she knows how she needs to be touched
i swear i will never stop wanting you
"dear self, stop now"
"it's okay if you can't stop loving, but holding on to something not truly yours is fucking insane"
"when you can't stop writing even when there's nothing else to write, even when you know it's over"
when you try so hard to protect a broken heart
it takes a soft heart to understand the pain of fallen leaves
i'm not always soft. flowers fall and wither in my hands
how in the world can i keep myself from missing you when all i do is think of you all the time
be kind today or at least do something that would fall in this category
"it's beautiful to be a part of the ocean, but it's more beautiful to be a part of you, the part that you can't do without"
"it's okay to cry, flowers need some water to grow"
"sometimes i need rain, sometimes i don't but when i do it means my heart is dry and i need you"
"no need to promise me the world, the galaxies i hold them in my hands"
why every time i say i love you your eyes go down
and this whole thing is all about how she beautifully loves you
she drifts and falls and breaks but she can dry your tears with her hands
"she wears the depth of the ocean in her eyes, if you look closely you'll drown"
when you can't stop yourself from feeling everything deeply even the things that are not yours
"i'm deeply drawn to trees and oceans, i always hear them when they call"
"sometimes, i don't know what to do with all the silence"
when you become empty and full all at once
"""because when she sings, even the birds stop to listen"" 🌻🌻🌻"
"when you said you're mine, is it real or just a line from a song"
"soft hearts, when all they do is fall then break"
"and when i can no longer hold myself anymore and the galaxies inside my chest seem to explode, i let the sea and i wait for your hands"
"this is the part where you bargain, the part that i hate"
i want to see your face and watch you move under the sky and just love you over and over
"even when you say it's over and you try as much as you can to move forward, sometimes the pain stays in place"
"we often take things for granted until we lose them, even those we love"
"conversations make me smile, but your voice it makes me happy"
remember the story of the giving tree? she loves a lot like that
she dug a hole to bury her heart
"maybe you were right, when you said that loving you is harder than letting you go"
she writes with a broken heart
"i always have a soft spot for people who try to hide their tears, sometimes i pretend i don't see them ... i know how difficult it is"
you have no idea how much you've broken me into a severe state of melancholy that never seems to end
her voice is tuned to sing sad songs
i'd like to believe that being happy has nothing to do with anyone else
"even if i write, the pain is not less"
when you can't keep from writing and your words are careless
when you are too needy to refuse and too vulnerable to resist and you hate to feel this way
"take me with you, put me in your pocket or press me between pages of your book, i don't mind where as long as i can feel you holding me"
i'll grow you sunflowers and paint you blue skies. this is how i love you
she's beautiful and wild and kind and she loves you
"watching the trees move, i wonder if they get hurt when their leaves fall and their branches break. i wonder how they hold on"
"some nights are empty, the sky my only friend"
when you can't stop yourself from falling
once again covered with sadness heavier than the sand of the sea
"some days you behave like a strong wind, you hit me everywhere and i break every day"
"i still remember, everytime you speak my name i blush in pink like sunrise"
this world would be in a very sad shape without people loving trees and oceans
i want to know what you ache for
"your eyes, they appear so kind. i want to live inside them"
i was made for your hands
"this thread is insanely gorgeous ... and this girl, i know her, she is gloriously beautiful and she has a heart like a bird"
i miss you and the rest of the world disappears
i love you each time it rains
"i want to see your face, the way it lights up hundreds of dead galaxies inside my chest"
love letters written on fallen petals
"her love has no end, but crushed down to a secret place hiding"
i'm most drawn to people who are mindful of trees
missing you is like emptiness that never goes away
"i wonder if you know how beautiful and graceful you are, i could watch you all day"
"you know when it's love, it hurts too much"
find someone who can see beauty even when it's not pretty everyday
"i can't stop thinking about you, i don't know how"
"i was sound asleep, but my heart was wide awake through the night abandoned"
when words are not enough and all you need is that one person to hold you
"i feel so similar to nature. loving space, loving silence and blooming like a wildflower"
this heart has no room for other love
"i only write for you and i will go on and on, till you fall and find your soul in them then you tell me that finally you are mine"
when you fall deeply for someone whose affections lie elsewhere
i'd like to build you a sanctuary where i can sing you arias and read you words and adore you like there is no tomorrow
"the sky is my favorite thing. sometimes, i catch myself staring at it and forget about how shattered my heart is and i just think of you"
i just want to breathe you in today and keep you still inside me
"don't ask me about love, i just know that everything means nothing if you're not with me"
you are my perfect reason why sometimes at night my sky is not dark
i love you but sometimes i just don't get it
"bury me, i don't mind as long as it's inside you"
"""And I'm thinking if you were mine  I'd never let you go,  And that would be but beautiful I know."""
the way you make me say i love you like it's the only word my lips can utter perfectly
it's the way you catch my attention even without saying a word
"Soft Reminder: don't be afraid to fly, the sky will hold you gently"
"watching the trees move, they tell me it's okay to bend but be careful not to break"
"Soft Reminder: be kind all the time, all of us are doing the best we can"
Soft Reminder: today is a good day to stop doing the things that do not express your heart
the human heart is so strange
"missing you so much, i don't know how to make this stop"
sometimes i fall asleep pretending that i'm inside your arms
i don't know why i keep on falling in love with you like it's the only thing i know i can do perfectly
i can't explain the way my heart misses you
there are days when i feel nothing but you
there are days when my heart's only agenda is to fall for you and break a thousand ways just to love you
"there are days when i'm so lost for words and all i can say is i love you but each time i say them, i die"
there are days when i'm jealous of everything you touch and the ones you call baby
"there are days when my heart misses you, the sky falls and i'm not steady"
there are days when i catch myself carving your name on almost everything i hold
there are days when all my thoughts are about you and i don't know what to do with them
there are days when i dream of sleeping and waking up inside your arms
please just stop making me feel this way
it's extremely so difficult to get so emotionally hooked or attached to something that isn't really yours - like you for example
"i don't know, but the more i try to unlove you, the deeper i sink into you"
i met someone who loves trees and oceans a lot more than i do. he is beautiful and i like him
it is more difficult to love someone then to walk away from them
"i didn't mean to fall for you, it's just that you sounded and looked a lot like true love"
"some days are so quiet and soft that all i want to do is to love you, love you and just really love you"
i hope you don't miss the whole point why i write you words and i hope you like it
sometimes no matter how i try to capture you with words there is always this part of you that i couldn't
"every time i try to block you off my mind, the deeper you get into my memory and the harder it breaks me apart"
i met someone who speaks about trees and fallen leaves like it's true love
you have no idea how much emptiness this heart gets every time i miss you
"i swear i go deep after 2 am, don't let me catch you write"
"you can tell me anything. i don't mind if you roar or say it softly, or you can just hold my hands and breathe, i'm here and i love you"
just leave the last page empty
i just want my name to sound like the sweetest melody inside your chest
you're the perfect thing to see in the morning
quietly thinking of you
"i want to see you and show you my hands, they match your palms and they are yours to hold forever"
i miss the smell and sound of the sea like i miss your voice in the morning and the way it touches me like gentle rain
she wears the color of the sky and she becomes more radiant and beautiful when she's inside your arms
out under the stars creating my own constellation and naming it after you
"watching the trees move, they tell me it's okay to bend so you do not break when a harsh wind blows"
you are indeed all that you say you are and you take me as i am. thank you 🌻
Soft Reminder: quiet your mind. learn from trees
there's nothing about you that i don't love. all that you are is beautiful
"somewhere deep inside her it rains every day, in her mind she's becoming a raindrop"
"i wish to become part of the sky, so i can move the sun, hold the moon and watch you dream under the stars"
this longing to know your heart is becoming a gentle obsession
"i don't know if i'm empty or lonely, i can't tell the difference anymore. all i know is every time my eyes cannot find you i feel both"
"watching the trees move, they look like humans searching for love"
"Soft Reminder: close your eyes, try to sleep, try to dream"
"write me your heart, i want to know you"
"it's gray and rainy, i need a safe place to fall"
"this love is like a surge of waves rolling inside my chest, it refuses to break"
"i long to wake up every morning in that place where the sea and the sky reigns, and the trees they hold me"
"she fell for that one star, and never came back"
"write me words, tell me about the color of your sky and your favorite song"
the world disappears every morning i wake up searching for your hands and my eyes cannot find you
my mind is so consumed by you
"i really don't understand how the stars move, but every time i look at the night sky they seem to light and turn towards you"
"every time i listen to your voice, it's like i hear the sound of the sea, it's like silence and it means everything"
missing your voice in the morning and all your little things
"every time my eyes cannot find you, i let the sky, the ocean and the forest hold me"
sometimes i just let myself drift like a fallen petal
"i write about you because i want to be okay with loving, not to hold back and not to be afraid"
"i have no pretty words to tell you, but i have my arms to hold you and they are not broken"
"when your heart gets sore with every beat, this is how it feels like missing you"
"let me see your garden i'll grow you sunflowers and paint you blue skies, and it's okay if your fence is broken"
i'm not really sure if i know how to fall apart beautifully
"sometimes when i can no longer hold, i close my eyes and pretend i am a raindrop that it's just okay to fall and your hands will catch me"
"in the end, everyone leaves"
i could not tell the difference between love and pain anymore
"the sky is a bit lost tonight, nothing is in place, the stars and the moon they're all gone. it is empty, and there is no light"
go deep with me
i like the way you occupy my mind
even the most fine word i know could not begin to tell just how much this broken soul silently aches for your soft hands
"Don't Know Why, your cover @djprincessleigh"
shrinking a little inside
"remember the star i named after you? i caught it last night, the brightest and the most beautiful star i have ever held in my hands"
"i hold the moon in my hands the stars, i wear them in my eyes tonight i am your sky"
it's quite exhausting to feel everything deeply
"i see your face in every sunset, it tells me to stay and never let go"
"the earthly scent after the rain, the world smells different"
"when i love, i don't stop"
tell me you're mine today and i'll be fine
"if you don't see me here, find me inside you"
"let me fall inside your arms, lock me in and never let me go"
tip toeing between raindrops and thinking of you
i love the sound of the falling rain. it is like silence and it is not empty
"i'm yours hold me like your pillow in the night, feel me all over you like your sunlight in the morning and let me fall inside you every day"
"she fell in love with the rain, the way every drop touched her bare and naked and she was never the same again"
"she can't possibly break, she wasn't even whole to start with"
"she's always been quiet, like a gentle breeze, a soft whisper but she loves like an ocean, bare and reckless"
"i write because i love you, there is nothing hidden"
"when i say i miss you, i mean i wanna be with you everyday, hold your hands from where the sun comes up to where it sets before moonrise"
"that untamed, broken rawness i see in your eyes, the part i fall for everyday  over and over again"
watching the leaves falling like silent teardrops
"i was never held like that, i felt the ocean in his chest raged with so much  tenderness and i liked it"
"she blushes like the rising sun, intense and gloriously attached"
"i just wanna be held like a pillow, like the ocean that never refuses  to kiss the shore"
"i think about you all the time, on every page, in every love song, in spaces between several heart beats"
"no matter how safe and serene your life maybe, it can end in shipwreck any moment ..."
"no matter how strong you appear, i can still smell tears on your skin"
my palm matches yours
i miss the scent of fresh rain drops
the sky is dark and the road is empty. i hear nothing but sounds of crunching twigs and whispers of my heart that longs for you
"these are just words and i don't even know u, but why everytime i read them they make me listen to my own heart beat"
"walk me to your forest. let me smell your composting leaves, hear your creaking branches and feel the sunlight filtering through you"
"i love the part when you said that i have a heart like a bird, and the sky is jealous"
there are more words in your eyes than your lips could ever utter
"the sin you can't escape the hell you so embraced it's not above you, or below it's inside you taking, breaking n never mending #fieryverse"
i'm so captivated by the idea of loving you but i'm scared of lightning and i get lost in deep waters
i see lonely roads and burned forests ahead of me
"the sun adores her, utterly lost in all that she is"
"show me the world inside you, i don't mind if you have broken walls or abandoned garden, and if your moon is dark let me hold your hands"
i don't know what to do with these feelings anymore
inside her is a secret garden  growing purple jasmines and sweet pea blossoms no wonder why she blushes warmth  and giggles tenderness
even the right ones get lost and fall in secret
"i miss your gorgeous scent, and your exquisite old fashioned look"
pretending that your poetry is just a prelude to something more
i have been teased and tortured by your words past my limits
I have never found a cloud sufficient to express the sky.  ~ Adrienne Rich
howcome i feel like we're galaxies apart
i feel like a lost tornado hit me
inside her chest is a dry forsaken ocean
"i was sound asleep, but my heart was awake through the night abandoned"
you are poetry inside me
should i sink or swim or simply get lost in the sky
you are heaven's melody sent to make me fall in the night
"those eyes like the unseen wind, they move me"
you've been lurking in my brain and i want to scream
without you each day is lost
i'm yours before the world and i'm staying
"comforted with little loves, while great love is gone"
"""you'll be happy again, but you won't forget"""
"i tried to give comfort, but i ended up giving pain"
sometimes i am ashamed of my prayers
he arrived with flowers to pay my heart a visit
"they say she's lost, and she needs love"
