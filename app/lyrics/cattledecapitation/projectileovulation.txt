A vast hormonal elevation - begins
Nasty ovulatory phase - brutal malaise
the constant shedding of chunks -
strip-mining cavern of blood
Ovarian follicle ruptures - discharging ovum in spurts

The uterus as a weapon
A gross underestimation of vaginal deception
Fallopian fenestration
bulbous with inflammation, read for the penetration
An aperture in need of a catheter
The flow is too heavy - destroying the levee

One half of the reason for overpopulation
Projectile ovulation - a uterine explosion

Bursting forth, a river of sanguineous hell
A slough from her trough and passing out from the smell
Ketones, platelets and hemoglobin -
erythrocytic disgorgence
Oxygenated molecules agglutinate to your face
Directly I ingest from the abscess
Profusely redirect the spewt onto the Sunday dress

Each and every human is an object
I've only torture for my subjects
Subjected to very distorted objective view of this species -
humanity and what should happen to it
I concur, they're idiots, both male and female pieces of shit

Kill me, I'm dreaming of lifeblood zygote streaming
Breeders on an earth already teeming with bastards
bent on over breeding and becoming the masters of a planet
for which we've planned only disaster

Human reproduction: a massive stimulation of biological degradation
Environmental abolition
Grounds for accusation and total annihilation
bleeding and breeding and in need of some terminating

All genders
All humans
Are disgusting wretched pigs for the slaughter
