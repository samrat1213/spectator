All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)
All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)

This a constant eulogy
We are the judge
We are the judge
We are the jury
We are the jury
We are in trial and it won’t end well
Forsaken life
It’s given us everything
And we still want more
More 

In a sense we’re innocent
In a sense we’re innocent
In a sense we’re innocent we’re fucked from the start
We’re soulless shells looking for a way out

This is a constant
Eulogy
Day by day
Day by Day
Wasting away
Wasting away
Look around enjoy this world we call our tragedy
Forsaken life
It’s given us everything
And we still want more
More

All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)
All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)
