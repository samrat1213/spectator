I make an incision in her skin from her ribs to her pussy lips. I peel
her skin back to see her innards. Her eyes now roll back in her head -
the bitch now wishes she was dead with her crucified family. As I look
to see her womb I notice her beating heart pumping her blood onto the
ground. One down - a billion to go; a list of women are dissected to
know if they carry child and If they don’t we fuck them all anyway.
These are the final stages: A holy conquest; official orders of The
Pope; a catholic plague of hatred ready to wage war upon God. With new
omnipotence of our great Pope we will overthrow our maker. The
architect will fall to his creation. Through the oculus of the Vatican
we ascend. We will rise to witness God’s demise. We now defy the
prophecies of God.
