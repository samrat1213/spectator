I Still Smoked Lyrics
I remember you
Patagonia sweatshirt and wine in a solo cup
And I remember me
Asking you your name
I remember Eminem playing on the stereo
For early October, it was kind of cold
And neither one of us watching the football game
We had our first kiss that night
Back before time could fly

We were runaway flames in a backseat fire
Growing up fast on renegade tires
Didn't worry about tomorrow
And it sure didn’t worry about us
Every time I kiss you it feels the samе
I still remember us that way
Oh, don't it feel just likе yesterday
You drove that old jeep and I still smoked

Now I wonder how many miles and Marlboros I burned up with that top down
I wonder how many suns we watched set and then come back up
And I wonder how many times your mama said, we'd never make it
And don’t give him your heart, girl, 'cause he's gonna break it
Now I really can't blame her, looking back on us
Because we were runaway flames in a backseat fire
Growing up fast on renegade tires
Didn't worry about tomorrow
It sure didn't worry about us
Every time I kiss you it feels the same
I still remember us that way
Oh and don't it feel just like yesterday
You drove that old jeep and I still smoked
Oh, I still smoked

To the runaway flames in a backseat fire
Growing up fast on renegade tires
Didn't worry about tomorrow
And tomorrow didn’t worry about us
Every time I kiss you it feels the same
I still remember us that way
Oh and don’t it feel just like yesterday
You drove that old jeep and I still smoked
Yeah, I still smoked

I remember you
Patagonia sweatshirt and wine in a solo cup
And I remember me
Asking you your nameEmbed
