I am sent from hell above
I'm worth more dead
Hello again though we've never met
Watching demise through ancient eyes
I will be the vessel for all to see
Swim in the abyss without me
Drown in faith next to me
Brainwashed filth belittle existence
Clarity through my beliefs

I am the Overlord
I am the Overlord

Together ascend
Forever condemned

Through me you'll be set free
Through me you'll be set free
Through me we'll be set free
Through me we'll be set free

Brainwashed filth belittle existence
Clarity through my beliefs

I am the Overlord
I am the Overlord
I am your Overlord
I am your Overlord
