This is the story of a murderer
A cold blooded killer, a ruthless, harmless, slaughterer

I didn't mean to kill him
Listen to me, wait
I was talkin to a fine asss date, ha ha ha
Phat titties, lookin like pow
and she's tellin me to come by right now
Oh shit, I jumped in the wagon, no more laggin, I'm taggin
This bitch, dead in the ping hole, make her lose control (mmmmmmmmm)
I showed up, I ring the ding dong
Grippin my wing wong, something's wrong
Who's this, not a bitch, but a dude
and he's tellin me to beat it; fuckin rude
It's jimmy, her man, a punk ass,
So I throw a left hook at him, splaaa, 
then I came back with a right hook
POW, he fell to the ground
I didn't mean to kill him

I even poured a little brew in your IV
Don't die, oh you tryin to speak
Fuck you, your punches are weak, ehhh
So bitch, you wanna talk shit again
I jumped up wit a boot to the chin
Pull his plugs out, and start chokin
Ewwwwwwww his necks already broken
He swung, hit me wit a bed pan
I was just makin sure you ain't dead man
Fuck this, I grabbed a scalpel
and stick it down in his scalp, uhhhhhhhhhh
