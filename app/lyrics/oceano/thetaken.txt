Awakened, blinded by lights
An untraceable vessel illuminates the night
Mesmerized as it levitates
An unwordly presence invades the mindscape to communicate
Entranced, your body slips into psychic restraints
Now you elevate

To relive relapsed recollections of an abductee
Dissecting flesh, no scars of entry left
Relive relapsed recollections of an abductee
Dissecting flesh, no scars of entry left

From your insides, you are tracked, there's nowhere to hide
A foreign device resides embedded
Or is it all in your head?

This is your life, a slave to experiments
This is your life and now your captors beckon
Tracing locations
It is time to elevate again
You are one of the taken

A mutilated possession
Internally violated
Mentally numbed
This encounter won't return you
The true gods have new purpose for you
The true gods have new purpose for you
