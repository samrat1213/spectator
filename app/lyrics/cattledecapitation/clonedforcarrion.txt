New disease
New ways to reach out and torment
One by one
Cloned, throats slit and packaged for delivery
Creation of carnage
Reproduced for consumption
Waste heap sold through fast food
Human is as stupid does
Maggots, burrowed rot worms
Thrown in a vat of rice
No escape from carnivorous butchery
Swallow salmonella filled carrion
Blood
Extract
Cloned carcass from DNA
Life
No meaning
There can be no god here
