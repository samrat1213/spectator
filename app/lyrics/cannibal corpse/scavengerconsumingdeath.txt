Hammers swing, cracking their skulls
Blades slash, spraying their blood
He waits, watching them kill
When they're done, he will feed

Scavenger consuming death
Yield of violence gives him life
Scavenger consuming death
Parasite awaits your demise

Viscera, torsos torn
Chopping off legs and arms
Sounds of violence draw him near
Soon he'll feed, soon he'll feed

Scavenger consuming death
Yield of violence gives him life
Scavenger consuming death
Parasite awaits your demise

Scavenger consuming death
Body parts and severed heads
Scavenger consuming death
Human vulture seeks your end

Scavenger
Gruesome forager
Tracking murderers
What they leave behind will feed this ghoulish fiend

Cannibal
Waits for you to fall
Insatiable
Your mangled corpse will soon become his latest meal

They have died
Eat their flesh
Before they rot

Gnaw and tear
The fresh meat
Leave only bones

A morbid harvest, once alive
Murdered, butchered, eaten, they're gone
Exploit the carnage, he survives
Hunting, waiting, reaping, death's spawn
Eat them all

Scavenger consuming death
Yield of violence gives him life
Scavenger consuming death
Parasite awaits your demise

Scavenger consuming death
Body parts and severed heads
Scavenger consuming death
Human vulture seeks your end
