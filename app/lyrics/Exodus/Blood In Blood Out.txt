[Verse I]
We're throwing down the gauntlet
Chomping at the bit
About to lay down the law, show you all the way
Bare witness to the genesis
Of the violence, the way it was back in the day

We've been here from the start, with a one track mind
We kept the hate alive
Always had the power, now is zero hour
Tonight we're gonna fight like it's 1985

[Chorus]
Blood in, blood out!
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out!
This is a fucking dynasty of thrash notoriety
Dive in or bow out!
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family
All in or all out!

Half way, no way, give it all you've got
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed, let's see what you brought
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out!
[Verse II]
Stand tall, show you've got the backbone
Welcome all who never took more than they gave
Punish all deceptions, no exceptions
Fortune always favors the brave

Bring your anger, bring the mayhem
Anything you do is allowed
You're the kings of pit insanity
Tonight we're gonna rage and make Paul Baloff proud

[Chorus]
Blood in, blood out!
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out!
This is a fucking dynasty of thrash notoriety
Dive in or bow out!
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family
All in or all out!

Half way, no way, give it all you've got
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed, let's see what you brought
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out!
[Lead: Lee Altus]
[Lead: Gary Holt]

[Verse III]
We're bringing down the thunder
Bottling the light, battering the way
Burning down the place
Our one stance, zero tolerance
Time to cut to the chase

We expect nothing less than a full scale riot
Give everything that you've got
Put an end to the peace and quiet
Let's start the pit that time forgot

[Chorus]
Blood in, blood out!
All I'm telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out!
This is a fucking dynasty of thrash notoriety
Dive in or bow out!
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family
All in or all out!

Half way, no way, give it all you've got
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed, let's see what you brought
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
