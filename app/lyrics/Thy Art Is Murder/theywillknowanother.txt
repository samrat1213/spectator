From the filth and the dirt
And the overflowing septic tank within the earth
A sea of shame floods us with terror
Swallows the earth into hell
Forever

Old world don't look away
I want you to watch our children die

Torch the dirt
Scorch the flesh
Burnt to ash
Peel away the skin
And grind their bones into a dust
Part the seas
Shift the trees
Move their sacred stones
Raise their towers higher
Fall into the fire
Feed them fear
Keep them locked up in their homes
Turn one man against another
Take the sword unto his brother
Feed the pain
Make them sick against their will
There's always more blood to spill
One more child that we couldn't save
Just another life smothered
We thought that we could take away the pain
But they will know another

I'm not afraid to die
I'm afraid I'll survive
And have to
Watch you suffer

I'm not afraid to die
I'm afraid I'll survive
And have to
Watch you suffer

Old world don't look away
I want you to watch our children die

One more child that we couldn't save
Just another life smothered
We thought that we could take away the pain
But they will know another

One more child that we couldn't save
Just another life smothered
We thought that we could take away the pain
But they will know another

They will know another

I'm not afraid to die
I'm afraid I'll survive
And have to
Watch you suffer

Watch you suffer

I'm not afraid to die
I'm afraid I'll survive
And have to
Watch you suffer

Forever
