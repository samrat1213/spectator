As... I look up to you
A cold carved stone, that I look up to for guidance
now your lost smashed to pieces, by this hammer I have
with this I swear you'll crumble, reaping what I have, cold cry
your face your guidance wont be in vein, last time
your face, not again!, forget your face? I count this watching crumbling down,from the sky
and with this hammer you will crumble! from the sky, you will crumble,
from the sky, destroy such beauty, count the lies on my own fingertips,
destroy such beauty, death awaits
destroy such beauty! please forgive me
