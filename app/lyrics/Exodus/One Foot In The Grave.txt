Why do people sell their souls away
Just to ride the horse another day
They're all slaves to the heroin
But it's a war they'll never win
They'll never live to see the error of their ways

One foot in the grave
Ruled by the drugs they crave
It all began as a need for kicks
Now they'd sell their lives for a fix
Powerless to break those chains
There's only losses and there's never no gains
They only live and die as a slave
With one foot, one foot in the grave

It promised an escape but only lied
Master of the world they're trapped inside
The needle and the spoon only gave
A one - way ticket leading to the grave
And suffering until the day they dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
