Child of sorrow
Born in hell
Birthed in blood
Child of sorrow
Innocence undone

Peasants turn the plow to man
Visions of heaven bring hell to the land

Ritualistic execution of the masses
Like lambs to the slaughter
Poisoned vision, the venom it pierces
The hearts of the holy order
Ash in their throats
The word of the lord
Sewn with the seeds of destruction

Peasants turn the plow to man
Visions of heaven bring hell to the land

Child of sorrow
Born in hell
Birthed in blood
Child of sorrow
Innocence undone
Blasphemous cross

Blasphemous cross sewn with the bones
The remnants of life torn off by the wolves

Blasphemous cross

A nation carved out by the blade of the vile
How we mourn for the motherless child

Ash in their throats
The word of the lord
Sewn with the seeds of destruction

Peasants turn the plow to man
Visions of heaven bring hell to the land

Blasphemous cross

The young will grow with hate in their hearts
Our world will burn forever
