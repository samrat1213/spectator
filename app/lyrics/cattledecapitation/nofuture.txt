Get set to self destruct 
No hope, no hope at all.
Nobody wins. No future.
Nobody lives. No hope at all.
Nobody cares. No Future.
We just go on and let suffering reign.
I crawled along the harvest floor
In my enemies shadow, last kicks of life
Out of the pale, into the night.
The brain is dead. Neurons have stopped.
Nobody wins. No future.
(no hope, no hope at all)
Nobody wins. No hope at all.
(no hope, no hope at all)
