Sinister emissary of God.
Castrated at the altar. Forcibly sterilizing the tools of the first violation. Given the flesh of the Father: the Edgewood Arsenal. Given the blood of the Father: absolute eternal terror.
Your religions are worthless like every corrupted system created by every nation. Insidious instruments to perpetuate the malignant madness of humanity.
"All that you ever are is a prophet of selfish delirium. All that you will ever truly serve is a demented God, so nightmarish and gluttonous."
You promised us salvation from a lake of fire and pain. But it was you who made our lives a sea of infernal insanity and flames.
Trapped in a cosmic prison filled with people losing their heads. Eating and violating each other for their own benefit. Puppets to beings outside time and space. We are forever bound to this horrific fate.
A heart of scorching light and a brain blackened by existential fright and spite for the existence of life.
"Born under a blood red sun, born for dread and death. Cast out of nothingness into a land ruled over by chaos and the abyss."

Night terrors and sinister laughter as the Tree of Knowledge bleeds horror into the Garden of Eden.
The mother of apathy looking down on us. The father of nightmares filling everything with madness. Brothers and sisters of torment spreading their insidious infections.
"Sweet tales of paradise told to you, child, was all a lie just to make you dance day and night to their desired rhythm till you die."
"My tears of misery and nihilistic ecstasy as I am ravaged in this forest of delirium, they shall water these trees of cosmic madness."
"Moonlight shining on us while you fuck me rough in a garden of datura flowers, oaks and black ivy."
"Willingly diving into dark delirium out of some nihilistic morbid curiosity, despite knowing the heavy emptiness and despair that awaits afterwards."
The Night Lords are now and forever my favorite Space Marine Legion. Fucking badass terrifying fuckers.
"If I am to live forever in the glory of divine terror and nightmarish madness so the end of mankind may come to pass, then let it be so! I embrace it with a sinister smile."
"Left, Right, both must die. Collapse the system, burn it to the ground, let nothing grow again. The root of our problems is our own existence. Sterilize and scorch the soil of human civilization."
"A religion of anti-humanity. A belief of anti-societies. Hymns sung of horrifying insanity from forced insight of this horrifying reality. Angels of Extermination, bless us. God of the Void, bring our total destruction."
A new church has been formed. The church of terrifying annihilation. Lost hopeless souls reborn. Humanity will partake of the sacrament of its own extinction through its own hands or through another's.
Celebrities dead in the streets. Banks in fucking flames. Churches full of corpses and the insects and crows that feast. Every statue of hope in pieces. The human species consumed in a global plague of insanity leading to our extinction.
Your churches haven't done a single thing for the human race. The only thing that brings change is justified misanthropic hate. Bring the fucking end to the human disease and every ounce of us making it out alive.
"Buildings full of souls silently screaming alone. Innocent children and animals suffering in the cold. Apathy, psychotic greed and delirious optimism reign, but not for long."
"Hide the truth with blood, corruption and flames. The timeless terror will reveal Its face anyways to the unsuspecting descendants you try to manipulate."
"Your God is The God; a demented demiurge beyond your limited comprehension. An Abrahamic eldritch abomination.  Universal nightmarish chaos being Its design, along with your ignorance, anguish and everything that will die."
Dying in timeless abysmal waters as I am held in the embrace of a drowning angel of the sea.
Latter-Day Saint singing psychotic praise to a petrifying being beyond their fragile mind's understanding.
"Demented God, spreading its divine Word of madness through numerous prophets, driving them delirious with Its harrowingly holy presence."
"Terror at Sinai's peak, freezing the saintly blood of a hopeless Moses. Mind violated by the holy tendrils of Yawheh. Divine Commandments of Madness given, shown through a starry black psychic fog."
"Eternally hellbent on digging our most asphyxiating grave even as our bodies weaken and our sanity decays. Because of ourselves, nothing will ever be okay."
"Humanity is forever stuck in this spiral of self-destruction and will never get out. Our species is too focused on money, power, the latest trend, the latest Marvel movie, tits, getting our egos masturbated by talk show hosts and whatever puppet media outlet we listen to."
"Your ignorance is your death sentence. Everything is not a threat if it's all approved by your bias friends. We are fucking up our home and it's collapsing, and you have the audacity to say nothing bad will happen."
Music that is both sinister and despairing/gloomy is deeply cathartic in a night like this.
Embracing a Saturnine night.
Breaking orbit from sanity to make way towards the storms of terror's cosmic divinity.
"Indifferent visions of the grim future haunting me Infinite possibilities, so terribly bleak, eating away sleep The ethereal hand of Death slowly guides you As the mouth of madness has me slowly consumed."
"Singing hymns of death at the Chapel of God, a holy nuclear reactor melting down, bursting forth the purest essence of God to melt and mutate all life it touches."
"Merely being in the presence of one of God's avatars stops all life's cellular growth. Malignant mutations begin. Bodies break down and flesh melts down to the bone in a matter of minutes. All life around It becomes a sea of radioactive flesh and bone, screaming, to become One!"
"The Uranium God turning against man. Tearing them apart down to the very atom, every atom being ripped to shreds."
"There can be no hope for change in a world of sentient life that's very nature is to consume, destroy and spread its madness. There is only hope for a cure, and that cure is extermination."
No amount of romantic love can fix this. Just the liberating hand of annihilation.
I'm really tired of my own deteriorating mental state and also the state of how the world has been for far too long. I just want oblivion. All of us into oblivion.
Let every nation collapse into dust and the traces of man scorched off the face of the earth. No more repeating the same mistakes. No more spreading our curse.
"""Isn't it time we stopped hoping for a change and started making a difference? Do you believe in nuclear war? I know I do."" - Puissance"
It's damn good jazz music when it makes me feel like I'm in some Silent Hillish/supernatural horror Noir story.
Looks like it's gonna be a dark doom jazz afternoon.
"Damn, the bleak depressing music I listened to almost 6 years ago when I was drinking and smoking by myself still manages to bring back those vivid memories. Depression's a bitch. Well fuck, life's a bitch let's be honest."
Another photo of an ominous and somewhat almost otherworldly menacing building. photo taken by u/Coopscw
"But honestly, nothing will ever beat the ocean. My first and lifelong love 🖤💙 Definitely need to visit the beach sometime soon."
*Sigh* to live and die at places like this would be wonderful 😌
Honestly where I want to be right now. I feel like shit physically and mentally and this place feels like my kind of medicine.
"Already having Dead Silence, I feel the need to get Magic 1978. I still wish they made more psychological or supernatural uncanny valley horror movies."
"""Well, now it's too late for our sons and daughters Can we look upon ourselves with pride Now it's too late for the earth to recover Our guilt we can no longer hide"" - Arcana"
"Lego Yoda death scream but it's horrifically distorted and reverbed, playing all around the world until we all die."
"""So bury your trust beneath the ground with me And lay your loneliness down for the sun to consume"" - SWANS"
Lay down and die on the beach to let the waves drag us off into the deep and chill.
"For some reason this instantly reminded me of the story ""The Night School"" by Ligotti. Great story btw, highly recommend giving it a read."
"The more you look at the world, mankind, even nature itself, you start to see there is no universal morality. It's just grim nihilistic dark entropy with destructive auto-cannibalistic behavior."
"An oppressively bleak and ominous sky ruling over a dismal gloomy landscape of rotting fields, charred black forests, cities swallowed by the sea and menacing mountains looking over a nightmarescape of industrial factories that operate and run blindly towards oblivion."
"The place we call ""home"" will be our tomb because we violated it, violated and slaughtered our fellow siblings of all forms of life on this Earth for our own selfish personal gain. Our grave won't be a beautiful one under green grass, but under polluted soil and weeds."
Dark ambient from at least 10 years ago just hits different now. Like a mixture of nostalgia and existential dread in a seamlessly woven tapestry.
"“From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me!”"
I think I might have the omicron nomnomicon necronomicon variant. Sorry I feel lightheaded loopy and like I’m dying. What a wonderful way to spend the weekend. Damn borderline-schizophrenic paranoia keeping me from the vaccine. Fuck this weak human flesh.
"Magic, wonder and the spirit of adventure emptied out and devoured into oblivion by the uncaring maw of the reality of cosmic indifference, madness and pointlessness. Just a black hole resides inside."
Every church is a church of Babylon and delirium. There is no such thing as sacred purity in any of these buildings. Just the cosmic presence of demented deceitful evil behind a mask of holiness.
There's nothing worth saving. There's no blissful paradise on the horizon waiting for mankind. There is only a bleak nightmarish polluted hellscape that will be our tomb.
"I don't sympathize with people who defend capitalism, drone striking innocent civilians, corrupted justice systems, deranged laws and the absurd situation where so many people have to work multiple jobs just to survive, leaving little to no time to destress or relax."
"Ever looked at a corpse of any organism, and felt like something ghastly and dreamlike was waiting for the spirit or life to leave the body as it shut down, so it could seep itself into that home of a carcass and dwell in it for some unknown reason, making it more unsettling?"
"I feel like something dark and unfathomable is coming for me. Maybe it's some psychological result of my mental state. Or it's something else entirely, something foreign to my mind. This dread is slowly getting thicker like some timeless black fog."
Very curious and looking forward to becoming a deceased spirit. I greatly feel that in doing so will reveal answers to some significant and specific questions I have that the living world does not have the answers to.
Accelerate the speed of our way to annihilation. Rise the tensions between nations. Act like nothing horrific will happen. Justify mass genocide with the bland reasons of progress &amp; religion. It will change nothing. It will only bring the end of our malignantly useless existence.
"Religious siblings of the Earth, we have reached the path of no return. Yet you wish to increase the pain of the burn of this human hell's rising temperature."
"Vile minds, running their own species to its own demise out of selfish ignorance, inevitably out of time. No time to repair. No time to prepare. No time to escape. No fucking way out of your man-made grave."
"Sound the sirens, commence the nuclear parousia when the sun rises one last time. A saviorless apocalypse that fills every religious soul with terror until it ruthlessly devours their minds."
"The Garden of Life; wretched and deranged in every way of its demented design. A foul forest of horror and madness, that must be scorched until every organism is forever sterilized."
The world of man is rotten to its very core. The only way to purify it is to send it to the Void like all extinct species that came before.
The sound of midnight waves roaring in unison with an eerie omnipresent screeching as if a choir of thousands of distorted birds sang some song of ominously obscure summoning.
"Rather than recommending Schopenhauer (which has been done numerous times by others) to people leaving religion behind and becoming nonbelievers on a search for the truth of things, I highly recommend Emil Cioran, Thomas Ligotti, Ulrich Horstmann and Albert Caraco."
"If we antinatalists and efilists are demonized by every ideology and atheists and religious alike, we shall still stand by what we believe to eternity and of what we know of the evil insanity of existence and procreation, which is the propagation of that malefic insanity."
Me together again with my guardian demon of ecstatic nightmares after not banging for weeks.
"Deny the evidence of our impeding doom, but believe all the lies that are spat from those you blindly follow. Just know that when extinction arrives at your doorstep, there will be nowhere to flee to."
"We are the ones who will destroy the great and spacious building of humanity. We are the ones who will burn down the Tree of Life. We are the ones who will dry the Rivers of Filth.  We are the angels of the Void, sending everything to oblivion."
Optimistic atheism never appealed to me because I could feel and see that it was just as flawed as all the other religions. Nature isn't lovely or kind. It is indifferent and horrifyingly destructive to itself and everything it touches.  Existence is horrific predetermined chaos.
"I always wanted to know the truth of things, and I always wanted it rather than a comforting lie. I got the truth and it is terrifying and indifferent. And from what I've learned and experienced through the truth, that is why I pray to the God of the Void to send us to oblivion."
"Since I haven't officially been excommunicated, I'm technically still a Mormon. I don't like boasting, but to hell with it, I think I'm the most pessimistic fatalistic ""mormon"" with the bleakest grim view of existence. #exmormon #mormon #pessimism"
"Take each other's hands, jump into the Void for liberation, be cleansed of our human insanity through the oceans of nothingness."
"The human race is madness incarnate. We rape each other and this planet without compassion. You may have left the delirium of religion, yet you refuse to see the malevolence of our existence."
"Seek the end of all of this anguish, take us back home into the ocean's depths. Or continue the sinister cycle of religious and existential madness."
"God guiding wave after wave of terrorism to spread the perfect amount of horror and death. The Devil hopelessly trying to stop the madness with sanity and sympathy, but the prophets of Yahweh muffle his message."
"The most sinister spirits will happily take your children into their care as you push them away for your prophets, beliefs and God. Keep putting your religion above them all, and your children's souls will fall into the terror that turns your blood cold."
"Holy self-loathing and godly misanthropy will consume their souls. They will see there is no hope, not even in the Heaven they call home. More and more innocents becoming spirits of vantablack hatred and merciless death."
"Keep being more and more cult-like, LDS church. You'll be increasing the psychological suffering, dividing families out delirious ""righteousness,"" and pushing more souls into the darkness of not the Devil, but something far worse than your fragile childish minds can imagine."
"Abandon what is right just to feel alright with your own life. You are just living a lie, so monotonous, so mediocre, so malignant. You're nothing special to the indifference of Nature when it's time for you to die."
"Sacrifice your minds to the petrifying light of God, children of Lehi.  Sacrifice your sanity for the delusion of superiority and safety in this cosmic insanity.  Send more souls into this nightmare of existence without a single thought of rationality."
"From the Black Mist I came to the Tree of Life, partook of its fruit of insanity and left.  In the Great and Spacious building I tormented and slayed its inhabitants with Nature's terrifying indifference. Down into the River of Filth, I dragged every remaining soul."
This spinning pebble in the cosmic ocean of infinity is our only home and we are raping it with our greed and madness.
May you die in your sleep so you may not suffer anymore in this human hell of insanity.  May you find peace in the nothingness you seek  For I must stay here to see through the end of our malignant species.
Apathy fearfully gives way to justified sympathetic and despairing misanthropy. Reality of humanity always pierces through the lie that this world will ever know peace.
"God-given glorious gloom, piercing through the flesh and into the bone. A holy Void blooming within all that we know."
Hallow hollowness. Angelic existential dread. Rusted blackened silence. Sacred amnesia. Petrifying parousia. Violent wordless messages of comfort. A primordial emptiness unearthed.
"It crawls within me with numerous claws. It pulls every string. I'm sent walking to God's gaping abysmal maw. It leaves a mental endless sting. Praise apathy. Praise this nightmarish entropy. I'd weep if I could, but It will only let me scream. I will never be free."
I'm still a sucker for slightly or completely ominous looking buildings.

"The system was made to divide us all, to infect us with meaningless hate, to easily manipulate every man, woman and child. You will never find sanity in a world that has gone irreversibly insane."
"You wanted to exit this bloody mess, but you get pissed off when we exit the bloodbath. Admit you're deranged like the ones controlling the masses with a gun to our heads leading us all to oblivion, telling us all nothing's wrong, that they're not corrupt. Nobody to trust."
"Sing your holy hymns of delirium. Sing your praises to a God of demented cataclysm.  Let the seas swallow you into the abode of the unknown, back home into the abyssal depths where we will be made whole."
Divine beings blesses the bold with divine non-euclidean insanity.
"As the tomb opened, the two Roman soldiers went mad and clawed out their eyes.  A sinister angel announces with the sound of harrowing choirs of Heaven: 𝔅𝔢𝔥𝔬𝔩𝔡, 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔱𝔯𝔲𝔢 𝔣𝔬𝔯𝔪 𝔬𝔣 ℭ𝔥𝔯𝔦𝔰𝔱! ℌ𝔢 𝔥𝔞𝔰 𝔯𝔦𝔰𝔢𝔫 𝔱𝔬 𝔭𝔢𝔱𝔯𝔦𝔣𝔶 𝔪𝔞𝔫𝔨𝔦𝔫𝔡!"
"He prayed to Jesus and Satan, but only the darkest vilest spirits answered him. Entities straight out of absolute evil's paradise, which attracted him in an instant. They showed him the clearest picture of God, which was them; God incarnate."
"Love took every friend in the group as he resided  hidden within the shadow's darkness. Forgotten then and now. He doesn't care, he no longer lives because I devoured every memory of him. He will never know love but only cosmic dread and delirium."
"Little nihilist 22 year old misanthropic kid, biking around the neighborhood in a freaky fucked up mask, God's demented darkness and a sinister beautiful female voice being the only long-lasting inspiration to him."
"Violating my own rules and advice I've given others every time, just to have a taste of what it's like to be my own worst nightmare coming to life from the deep dark recesses of my mind."
"In an alternate delightfully deranged universe, Anya-Taylor Joy has formed a cosmic black metal band with Eva Green called 𝔚𝔦𝔱𝔠𝔥𝔢𝔰 𝔬𝔣 𝔗𝔥𝔢 ℭ𝔯𝔞𝔴𝔩𝔦𝔫𝔤 ℭ𝔥𝔞𝔬𝔰, and their intensely dark and chaotic music alone warps and tears the fabric of reality."
Billie Eilish and Lady Gaga singing in deeply unsettling yet hauntingly beautiful tones of the sonnets from the Fungi From Yuggoth as intense eerie ambient beats play in the background.
"The terrifying and hypnotic techno music caught me into its insidiously beautiful non-euclidean domain, yet what truly horrified me was when the DJ revealed themselves to be Jesus fucking Christ himself."
In the dead of night being gradually cornered by an atmospheric-death-doom jazz band consisting of well-dressed shadow people as they step closer to you to the beat of their sinister yet catchy as fuck tunes.
The Demiurge by KeelyDolan. Christ was a delirious avatar of God. God is a terrifying demiurge. Happy Easter.
"If you believe God is only benevolent and not malevolent as well, you are clearly under Its influence of cosmic delirium. To create a universe of insanity like this, malignant madness is part of the equation."
"Filled with manic hatred, we tear our heads off violently and show it to our own selfish-deluded species as our decapitated faces mock their very being for the rest of eternity."
"A psychotic specter straight out of a cartoonish nightmare, haunting every moment of your waking life and when you sleep at night."
"Purged from the face of the Earth. Earth purified of their malignant kind. All life consumed by the alien Void beyond time. Eclipse the sunlight, perpetually petrify their minds. Forcibly bringing their nightmarish rebirth."
"Deluding themselves with saviors in the forms of their own species, they blind themselves from the beings outside their narrow-minded sight."
Finding delirious beauty in my terrifying insanity and helpless horror of inescapable existential dread.
"The ever-decaying mouth of Death hisses words into my ears, chills consuming every cell of my being: 𝘐 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶. 𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺 𝘥𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯. 𝘌𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘭𝘪𝘧𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶."
"Alone I walk in a world of ruin under the infinite cosmos so nightmarish, hungry and and devouring my sanity for their timeless eldritch knowledge of existential chaos."
"Incinerated by God's purifying fire, I see the Abyss that is Its Eye at the center of Its vortex of hellish flames, liberating me from my human traits."
Ravaged in the dead of midnight. Resurrected at an eclipsed sunrise.
An eerie Easter Sunday in a delirious dream of an industrial park and its sinister suburban neighborhood from another life.
Floating and drifting in a forest of pitch black industrial smoke stacks in an eternal sunset.
Tfw you're listening to atmospheric cosmic black metal.
A reminder to myself: Listen to this album tonight before bed or while going to bed.
"Everyone's a Pandora's box waiting to be opened for the rest of time with the lid torn off, spilling their full potential terror into the world."
"Believe me though, there are spirits/entities that are solely pure evil. I've had contact with them and got to know them a bit as they knew everything about me. Don't underestimate the power of the other side."
"Even if every Abrahamic religion was 100% true, it wouldn't lessen the terror and madness of existence, but it would only intensify it."
"Angels and demons aren't really angels and demons like the Abrahamic religions portray them to be. They are otherworldly Outer entities, timeless higher beings, that operate in various ways in this infinite interdimensional insanity we call existence."
Rogue waves are possibly one of the most terrifying things to me. The thought of being on a sailboat or even a cruise ship and then seeing just a vast colossal wall of dark water at night come at me where escape is nonexistent.
I always found drowning to death in a dark body of water to be deeply eerie and almost otherworldly. Especially if it's in the ocean at night.
Living for a thousand terrifying times but never given the luxury to die. I shall see to the end of all life on this doomed rock until my Master is satisfied.
Nothing but madness and night terrors to occupy that fragile doomed mind.
"Death had seemingly abandoned him. Afterall, he made a deal with God to see the end of this world through. Alone he traversed the nightmarish landscape of the ruins of civilization. All the company he has is a centipede and a snake with God ominously watching over him."
An ominous otherworldly feeling consumes me when I see certain architecture and design of a house.
Holy Horrifying Hadean Eon returning to swallow the Phanerozoic Era back into the black Void.
"The ignorance of man, destroying every life that it can touch. Down to the most oblivious innocent insect to another life of a human. Will we ever see that all life is equal in this nightmare of cosmic madness we call existence?"
"Unstoppable alien infestation, the body is helplessly infected.  Impossible to our consciousness, the mind is inevitably shattered."
"The moment I fall into her embrace, I always lose my identity. Who ""I"" was.  My body melts into her bed of screaming flowers, my sanity fertilizes the soil of her lunatic love. I become everything, her terror and lust."
Her voice is crawling into my ears all day and night Seducing me with serenity of forever losing my mind Her voice is taking me into beautiful fields of insanity Making me feel a yearning I've always had but hidden from me.
"Angel of God; being beyond all, To you I call To tear down the walls Of this wretched reality Expose us to the infinite insanity libera nos in os terroris tui!"
The centuries old lunacy of humanity mutates my soul into something I never wanted to be. The psychotic sadistic system has molded me into something of the blackest bleakest dreams.
"Pointless shit shoved in our faces, so sick of dealing with it. Nonsense news that nobody needs to know and digest. Your celebrities mean nothing to me and to Nature's indifferent hand of destruction that has us all in Its grip."
"I carve the cross of Christ into my thigh right next to the sigil of Lucifer, bearer of light. I need them both to devour my sanity. God smiles as It sees my manic black hole of a mind swallowing joy and rationality."
"Jesus Fucking Christ, shove your cross down my soul's throat, make me choke, make me moan, I need the holy word of Our Heavenly Father of madness and terror."
"Go ahead, fill me with horror, that's just what I fucking want. I need to see the joy leave your eyes as you realize nothingness won't be greeting you after death, but an eternal euphoric nightmare."
"Fuck me up. Slither and crawl into my soul in my waking moments and when I try to sleep, I don't give a fuck.  I crave the feeling of your black hole psychotic centipedes in my psyche and the sound of His snakes hissing hellish euphoric truths, filling me with terrifying ecstasy."
Finding nice eerie and very calming hypnotic dark drone ambient to dissociate to is always a plus.
Now excuse me as I read more about how doomed we are by our own selfish ignorant delusional nature.
"So much terrifying and psychotic things happening in the human world and by humanity, that trying to comprehend it all all at once would drive one completely insane. We are the epitome of horrifying insanity."
Curious innocent minds diving into the murky minds of killers whose sole goal is to spread infinite terror. Vile tendrils of corruption consuming the curious minds as they swim deeper. Horrific ruthless reality revealed. Souls turned into instruments of vantablack nihilism.
"Nihilistic abysmal terrorism to send souls, guilty and innocent, into the mouth of the black Void."
Artwork by Charlie Immer.
"An existential cosmic circus of chaos, horror and lunacy, this is all for the unfathomable purpose and amusement of beings that'd drive your sober fragile mind mad.  So embrace the madness!"
"(One last breath!) Inhale, you don't know what manic horrors you're in for. (One last breath!) Exhale, and this terrifying truth will set you free as the walls of this dream are torn."
"In Their psychotically sinister realms that rip at your fragile sanity, you will find that you are at Their mercy if mercy even exists in these dimensions."
"The souls' eyes lids are violently torn to nothingness as minds dissociate beyond this cosmic existence, naked and helpless to the inter-dimensional nightmares outside all known physical reality.  Praying for death, you will find no escape in these ominous lunatic eternities."
"The thin veil of the fabric of this ""reality"" torn open to show the soul to the Void that reveals that we are all infinite significantly insignificant pieces to the puzzle of demented cosmic entropy predetermined by a being terrifyingly incomprehensible."
"Blessed by the priestess of the black void that spat in my mouth as the shining demons of truth ravaged me from behind, I shall hiss and scream psychotic prophecies that tear illusions to oblivion and expose every soul to the euphorically horrific reality."
I was born in a mist of holy delirium and sexual pleasure. Brought forth into this dark dreary forest of beautifully nihilistic indifference and majestically malignant mysticism.
I am a son of madness. I am a daughter of living nightmares. I am an instrument of sexual ecstasy and terrifying insightful insanity.
"Insidious ignorant humankind feasting on everything, even itself. Your religions, idols and money won't save you from extinction's horrific howling mouth."
How long will you justify every crime they commit that inflicts anguish just for your own delirious self-preservation? You can't escape inevitable annihilation.
Drowning in the black murky foul lakes of our mistakes. We became drunk with the blood of the earth and each others' lives from our thirst for selfish destruction.
"""We never stood a chance Against this sick romance We have with our demise We have with all of life With mouths open wide Our footprint steps inside And when there's nowhere to hide Death comes with the tide..."" - Cattle Decapitation"
"""Ignoring the trash heap that is our daily lives A disparaging wasteland, a hell on earth paradigm Extinction level living - the fate of all unwinds Too ignorant, too selfish to read the warning signs"" - Cattle Decapitation"
"The countless cosmic horrors that exist amongst this world care not for your futile dreams, but only your fears and the incomprehensible abyss of where they shall forever devour us all."
Erase us! Wipe us away with all the things of this Earth we have ruined and raped. We are Nature's worst blight that has ever materialized and given intelligence that we horribly wasted anyways.
Selfishly satisfy yourself to death. Enjoy this hell to your last breath. Regret your greed when it's too late to escape the terrifying fate you share with everything that you violated and the lives you selfishly desecrated.
"Dust, indifferent insects and carcasses inhabiting every place of worship. The oceans swallowing the hopeless and disillusioned. The overwhelmingly ominous end to a species killed by its own selfish ignorance."
"You say you fear nothing, but every single soul fears losing themselves into eternal insanity. A terror beyond comprehension, beyond human understanding.  And that is where we might be going."
"Bound by the urge, you will burn away faster.  There are infinite possibilities that's offered by this insanity, I wish to see as many as my mind can take even if it breaks into infinite pieces and becomes something you fear deeply in your subconscious."
"The new Garden of Eden will be a field of dead grass and weeds covering the mummified corpses of humanity. The only trees remaining will be trees of death, void of life and serenity."
The forests burn bright. The lakes run dry. Existential terror grips its timeless nightmarish hands around our minds.
The rivers and lakes dry away. We are forever lost in a demented maze set ablaze with only the options to burn to ash or suffocate.
"Eat whatever bullshit they shove in front of your faces, in the form of drama between disgustingly useless celebrities. The world withers, the innocent suffer, yet you say you can't be bothered."
The system is fucked. It was made to be so fucking corrupt. Serving only the ones who made it and destroying the lives of everyone beneath them. We were lied to from the beginning. There is no dream. There is only a hideous nightmare. It's time for us to disappear.
A Hadean eon awaits humanity for its delirious narcissistic ignorance. Into the Void we shall go for our cursed malignant existence upon this doomed planet we so selfishly violated.
This Thomas Ligotti themed lo-fi dark ambient album is hitting just the spot for how I feel about existence at the moment. Might sleep to this tonight.
"Strip me of useless hate, turn me into an angel of the black Void if that is to be my fate. If I am a mouth of horrifying madness, let my words bring forth an end with terrors alien and a rebirth that cannot be fathomed by the minds of man."
Rid me of any remaining futile desire for fame and wealth. Fill me with insightful insanity and terror from the abyss of Heaven and Hell.
Black abyssal impending doom vast as a raging ocean in a fearsome storm at midnight that will not dissipate until it has swallowed us whole.
The plan unravels. Holy horror awakens from its dismal dreams and begins to bring forth nightmares fiercer than Hell.
"Leviathan, awaken and bring forth the abyssal tides to drag us back home into the abyss."
"Willingly lost in a sea of madness, breathing in the water of this cosmic insanity and the air of my own delirious illusion of an identity, with an undying desire to witness the world of mankind's end."
Anxious for the terrifying end of mankind to come and devour us all.
Praying for an alien nightmare to begin uniting us all via a terrifying extermination.
Praise to the Golden Terror and the King of the Black Void.
"Eat the sweet foul flesh of thy true demented God. Drink from the cup of cosmic abyssal bile, His vantablack blood."
"Foulest demons to be called to my side when the time is right, reflecting God's violating nightmarish eyes through mine. Divine madness is my guide, whispered from cosmic beings older than time."
The blackest flames of Hell keeps this psychotic star I call a soul burning as Heaven's true terrifying face shines through these ethereally lunatic eyes.
"Feels like I've been here already but in a dream. Or is it that time when dreams and the dream we call reality is blending in together? If so, cool."
You can worship Lucifer and Christ simultaneously if you see existence as the divine cosmic lunacy it is with liberated demented eyes and soul.
A holy eldritch horror of terrifying transcendence came in the form of a mysterious messiah; Jesus Christ. A being not of this world with a message of divine delirium to save the souls of man from a monotonous madness.  He shall come again in a heavenly horrifying parousia.
"Ngl, I would love it if this is where I lived in the nearby future.  (found these images off r/LiminalReality btw)"
Gonna have to remind myself to buy this. It looks very very intriguing. I love that artwork on the cover.
It’s my plan to go scuba diving in the ocean at night before the world ends. Also I’d like to sail in heavy seas while high as fuck.
No universal morality. No sense of sanity. A constant war of entropy that will go on for eternity. There was never a right side. There was never a right time. There is nothing but infinite insanity.
"""You're still not getting it The sad fact that you're still not questioning I've been telling you since 2010 FREEDOM IS A FUCKING LIE!"" - Martyr Defiled"
"Sinister seraphim eyes of psychosis keep piercing through me from every direction, even from deep within, to show me something I've always wished for and always subconsciously dreaded."
Every angel's face I see is just a demon smiling beneath its perfect porcelain skin.
"The very foundation of my stability is turning into something monstrous, turning against me and this reality. I can no longer tell the difference between Heaven and Hell."
"Chaos is the mind, predetermined by something nightmarish older than time. Its inside and outside, pulling every string even beyond the end of this life."
Welcoming the climaxing terror of this dream that will awaken the the new eon of euphoric nightmares where we are finally reborn.
"Sinister smiles all around, waiting to come out and scream out in eternal ecstatic terror for catharsis."
Itching to become something insidiously inhuman through malignant horrific metamorphosis. To become timeless nightmares taking materialized form in this existence.
"The wait to cross over is burning hotter and hotter every fucking hour. Show me what I must do, my divinely sinister cosmic Master."
Deep sea primordial dreams revealing more than your delirious reality you refuse to leave.
"Take the steps outside of comfort, you can take our hands as we guide you through this oceanic forest of what you have yet to learn."
"Out of fear you dwell in the little hut of what you know, while we make our home in this vast dreamlike jungle in this ocean of the unknown."
"I heard the call of the primordial whispers and answered, yet I was warned to stay far from them by the mouths of man. The voices of man deceive. The eldritch tongue of the primordial give clarity. I wish to see what many wish not to see."
"The ship of mankind sailing in seas of madness, where serpents and spirits above and below grant us clarity if only asked. Gain insight no longer from each other but from what roams the skies and abyss outside our limited perspective."
The moon is drawing closer yet neither of us is moving. The sun is setting yet never leaving. This dream is ending but never ending. I was never awake. I was never asleep. I am in between. I am between. And something's coming to cross over through me.
"An insignificant puppet, deranged from outer insight. Form forever shifting. A prophet. A poet. A giver. A devourer. Given eyes foreshadowing so much but never revealing its own fate."
"Infinite insanity is all I see, yet you won't give me room to fucking breathe. I'll kill your religions and delusions that give you relief, and show their ugly heads to the world for all to see."
"We hear their cries for an end to their suffering, for God's mercy. We shall give them a Second Coming, in the terrifying form of the vantablack shadow of Christ, putting an end to this dream."
"If they want to see the daylight, turn the fucking Sun crimson for the rest of their lives. Make the sky black, let its darkness consume every star in sight. No sense of sanity for our fucked in the head species."
"What the hell do I need from the world? I need nothing, because nothing is always enough. Nothing left to see but the end of everything, giving way for something new whatever it may be."
"Void growing inside to make room for something alien or just to grow so much that it becomes a cataclysmic black hole, swallowing the entire cosmos."
"My mind is so chaotic, I swear I'm losing grasp on my own identity and what I want, which to be entirely honest, I don't think I want anything except for planetary annihilation. Other than that, all I know is what I am and that's it."
Gradual spiraling ascent into the menacingly gaping devouring maw of an infinite sky of insanity.
"God of the Void, bring us a glorious demise."
"May God devour the Earth an all of its inhabitants so we can return with It back to Its realm beyond space and time, beyond comprehension."
"Bring forth apocalyptic destruction. Bring millions back to the abyssal depths of the ocean. Begin the end, great Leviathan!"
"Oh, great Leviathan, hear my prayer unto you. Come forth from the primordial depths and wreck divine horrifying devastation and obliteration to mankind as much as you can."
"Explode the fucking sun, incinerate all life down to the tiniest organism. Throw one of Saturn's moons into this doomed fucking planet. Rid us of our malignant existence."
"The only bright future for man is where the Sun has turned the Earth against us, poisoning and killing us for all the vileness we have spread and inflicted upon each other and it."
The nightmares have become bland. The dreams keep consisting of the same futile banality. Set the fields we frolic in ablaze. Inhale the vantablack smoke and stay with me in these roaring cosmic flames.
No hope left in humanity. Forever disillusioned by reality. There is nothing to see but this infinite insanity. Mankind will forever justify its malignancy.
"Rid me of every natural urge. Remove every hunger, every fucking thirst. I found what I needed and it's in the abyss of when all life is purged."
"A world void of life is the only achievable paradise. Open my eyes, take one last look into the infinite indifferent sky as the last breath is exhaled from humankind."
"Man has raped the Earth long enough. May we pay the terrifying cost Of our selfishness and ignorance. Send mankind into absolute nothingness. Sterilize this world, sterilize every organism. Make Earth forever impotent."
And see that there is nothing to see in everything.
The prophet decayed away into vile dust as soon as they realized their work was done. Back to what I always was when my life begun.
"Hideously bland messages on loop, slowly driving me more insane. Nothing new. It all leads to nowhere in a psychotic circle. And I don't need to do a damn thing about it."
"Repeating the same things in different forms, becoming malignantly banal and ultimately meaningless."
Terror and insanity is eternal.
We’re all just puppets that are a reflection of the terror and insanity that is God.
"Thrust Death's scythe into me, finishing this expired banal vessel. I want to see what should not be seen. I'm losing my ""self"" more and more and this mortal existence has become stale. Take me to the other side so I may see what cannot be seen by the living."
"Sweet blissful ominous dream, soak into my soul."
Paranoid flowers sprouting forth just in time for the spring of ecstatic malignancy.
Awaken the dreaming eye of realities seeping with eeriness and euphoric dread.
Squirm inside me as my tongue writhes inside your mouth. We shall drink from the fountain of black bile. Let your demons in your contorted soul dilate deliriously in and out.
"Sinister sperm, squirm towards the helpless egg. Foul fertilization, let a new twisted life begin! Birthed in the sewage of a vessel of horror and ecstasy. Spat forth into  an existence of cosmic insanity."
"Vile bliss from feeling sickness writhe its slimy black tendrils through my system, leading me into euphoric ominous dreams and the possibility of death; that bridge to the ultimate paradisaical nightmare!"
"Becoming a lightless knight of the Cosmic Queen of Black Mold, devouring the daylight and vomiting it out as fever dreaming delight."
"I never died a thousand times, but I was reborn for a trillion in the demonic beating heart of a star of cosmic rust. Malignant metamorphosis molded by the Mad God. Dreaming of terrors to bring through a new abysmal dawn!"
Forever reaping in the fields of madness in a cosmos of beautifully nightmarish entropy.
"Dark dismal and ghastly artwork painted/drawn with the artists' own overwhelming fear and insidious madness seeping in and out of it is still beautiful, if not one of the most beautiful pieces of art."
"Maybe the true God of everything is also the God of the Void. I didn’t really think it through, but it makes sense to me now. I embrace it nonetheless."
"Fill their minds with the delirium that there is no God and no afterlife, so when they inevitably face the terrifying truth, the terror within them will be at a beautiful peak."
The dread you have blessed me with is as rich and rousing as the orgasm between two lovers. Bite into my soul and fill it with your venom of divine insightful horror.
Exquisite terror flowing through my body like it has become the blood that once flowed through my veins.
The Edgewood Arsenal is one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever come across in my research of the nightmarish insanity of existence and humankind. The fact that we are able to create such horrifying hallucinogens as weapons opens the door to infinite terrors.
Bringing forth a primordial terror from the depths of the oceanic abyss for a sacredly sinister alien purpose.
Swayed and guided by two divine timeless terrors. The horrifying God within the Sun and Its black light of annihilation and celestial horror. The terrifying golden alien God of fearsome liberation and transcendental rebirth.
Cast aside the comfort of the stale light.  Into you invite the light of psychotic celestial insight.
I gladly gaze into the nightmarish abyss as it delightfully gazes back into me. We see the same divine terror within each other. We are One.

Murky meadows and damp dismal woods where primordial horrifically obscure entities reside.
"Abysmal angels of gorgeous passion, insidious insight and delightful terror; invite them in. The new age of transcendent wickedness commences with our end and when our glorious rebirth begins."
"The sun will blacken forever from within. The moon will bleed and the delirious saints will scream in divine blissful horror, giving in to the Father of Dread.  The righteously wicked will rise. The true God will reign for all time and over the skies."

Beckon forth the true God of this deranged existence. Welcome Its insightful insanity and the timeless terror to  be filled with and reborn through.
"The heavenly white serpent of Lucifer slithering along with the starry vantablack centipede of Melinoe in the garden of my soul. As the thunderous mighty fly of Beelzebub soars overhead, seeing all above and below."

I crown you as my Prince of Lust as I am crowned as a Princess of Nightmarish Madness.

An orgy of souls with ominous entropic thoughts of cosmic delirium that sing the truth.
Hail Saturn and may the convergence be beautifully terrifying.
It is terrifying and divine. And I show reverence towards It and embrace It.

There is something greater we are a part of and you can become aware of. Beautifully dreamt black entropy with infinite insight. Forever changing.
Convergence is nigh.
Join me into terror and ecstasy.
Fall in love with a celestial horror so divine that lights up the night sky with stars screaming sweet malignant madness into our minds.

Into the arms of the future. Into the arms of uncertainty.  Into the embrace of nature. Into the embrace of infinity.
You threaten my life as I offer you another. You cling to something that doesn't love you. Let me take you down to the ocean of infinity where terror and heavenly bliss become one.

Dwelling in the vast ominous industrial city beyond the veil.

"So predictable and disgusting. Defending the worst minds just to justify your stale insanity. Fade away in silence but never be forgotten. Dead or still alive, I will drink in your terror when you see that the Void won't be there after you're dead."
I want to devour your pain and give you my peace so I can digest that anguish into divinely terrifying empowerment where not even the vilest of souls dares to stand in your way.

"I opened myself up to Beelzebub to guide me but my damn ego/ADD got in the way. I’m sorry, my dark  King, beginner’s clumsiness I guess. I still thank you for being with me. Please continue to guide me. 🪰"
Veins turning into tendrils reaching towards the manic stars that howl in the night back down to the curious minds.
Sinister psychotic psychedelic lovecraftian love-making in the writhing realms between dreams and reality.
"Gazing at myself through the eyes of the mountain of indifference, of the alien tree of life, of the flowering fields of nightmares, of the ominous omnipresent Sun, of the Moon of manic serenity, of the lunatic stars of the night sky, of the eyes of the enlightening uncanny."
Embracing the cosmic madness where identity is slaughtered and reborn into godly luscious petrifying lunacy.

"If I could take a miracle transition pill that'd help me transition to a girl over night, I'd take it without any second thought. I need to fulfill my dream of becoming the sexy eldritch goth witch of the city."
Being watched over by the Council of Eldritch Birbs.
"I love you guys. I can't wait to haunt you and chill at each of your places when I'm a ghost. No I'm not saying this because I'm committing suicide, I'm going to get caffeine and gonna try astral projecting. -Love, Your Demented Cosmic Nightmare Worshiping Virgo Femboy"
"One thing is certain, I am not in control, I never was to begin with. Yet I feel a chasm-like rift in my psyche. My soul is no longer becoming individualistic but becoming one with the nightmarish cosmic chaos. Feeling desires to fulfill and feeling no need to do anything."
Dreamlike entropy possesses my mind. From annihilating my identity to filling me with dark carnal desire overflowing with lust. It's form is incomprehensible and shifts and pulls at my soul's strings.
"Naked in a bed of black flowers that consume the light of love, compassion, hope, lust and joy. Digesting that light into disillusioning dread and hideous acceptance of there being no escape."
"Nude portraits with a deep aura of doom, menacing indifference and maddening dread."
"If we are to discard time as the delirious invention we made to blanket our childish eyes from the terrible monstrous mouth of that infinite abysmal sky all around us, then we shall see we were never free to choose what we do, what and where we are and shall be and know."

I understand but cannot relate to the need for sexual satisfaction. I understand but cannot relate to the attraction of those younger or older. I understand but cannot relate to the need for romantic love. I understand but cannot relate to the need of feeling significant.
I have nothing good to offer but the grim indifference to my own identity and the insidious insanity that’s omnipresent as if it’s the very atoms of everything and the ethereal energy revealed to be far more harrowing and sinister than the human mind can comprehend.
"Seeing the same dizzying dreadful madness in everything, even myself."
"The universe is simply a cosmic realm ruled by ruthless celestial delirium and terror, terror to the puppets who become too aware of themselves and the cosmic insane asylum they inhabit, which they share with their fellow siblings of all forms of life."
Stale and pathetic. This body would be more beautiful if it was a ghastly decayed corpse haunting the minds of all those who would look upon it.
Not suicidal or depressed. I’m more so anxious to enter the next life after death. This life with this body is done and dull and uselessly monotonous. I see no reason to not cross over the bridge to the other side. Here’s to praying to die suddenly out of nowhere.
Losing sexual desire. Gaining terrifying darkness in return. I need to pass over so very soon. This body is useless to me. It’s becoming an annoying burden.
I see God through glowing red starry eyes as they fill me with beautiful fright.
Send forth your vantablack serpents and centipedes to help guide me day and night. Fill my mind with the sweet addictive venom of insidious insight.

Possibly a hot take:  The Exorcist III is better than the first one. Everything done is done brilliantly so to where it’s flawless. Especially Brad Dourif’s perfect performance as the Gemini Killer.
GMK Godzilla is the best and scariest Godzilla because of what he is and how terrifyingly misanthropic and vengeful and unstoppable he is. He’s literally all of the souls of all of the victims of WW2 made into a horrifying malicious supernatural entity of the dead’s vengeance.
Insanity favors the bold.
Feast upon my identity and sanity eternally as thou givest me infinite insight that shall rebirth me into a being of pure cosmic insanity!
Torn apart into renewal! The mind stretched beyond the cosmos. Sanity ripped endlessly to shreds by dark entities seen and petrifying forces unseen. Consciousness where it should never be.
"The ""self"" absorbed into your shadow. My eyes seeing what should not be shown. My mind filled with thoughts of the God Above, Between and Below. Welcoming the dread of knowing what should not be known."
Seeing clearer now of this delirious dream I'm in. Losing sight of who I am. All I know is where I'm at and what I am. All these desires and fears aren't mine. My identity is lost to the ruins of time.
For the people who need some dark heavy beats to get through the day:
"All organisms/lifeforms, especially insects and the creatures of the abyssal depths of the oceans, are also children of God. Don't let your self-awareness and observance cloud your mind too much with narcissistic delirious beliefs."
"Oh, eldritch demons that surround me now, I plead to you at this moment before midnight, show me the divine primordial ominous truth. Work together, we shall, for the true God: the God of Cosmic Terror and Insanity."
"Praying for the parousia, where The Christ of Cosmic Terror arrives to Earth. Praying for angels of existential terror to protect and guide me through this dream of madness and horror. Awaiting the day that goes dark where humans and demons alike go insane from the true Savior."
"They whisper in terrifying screams to me: ""We are the angels of absolute fright We are the nightmares that give you might We are the legions that rape the dark and light We are the terrors that give you life."""
Holy ecstasy. Unholy love. Unholy sanity. Holy lust. Feel it as you feel me. Feel it deep inside as you feel me deep inside in the undead of night.
"There’s nothing &amp; everything to do, there’s nowhere and &amp; everywhere to go, there’s nothing and everything to be, there’s everyone and no one to know. My existence is nightmarishly insane, reflecting the very thing that made it come to life."
"I understand. I wish to live forever as I wish to die forever. I wish for an eternal ominous dream of omnipresent and omniscient delirium. And I wish for the unmaking of all of reality. I’m only a child, a puppet, with its demented God residing within its very soul."
Ever feel a creeping feeling of indescribable dread that you’re soon going to know or be shown something so terrifying it’s going to sink you into a madness that the word “nightmarish” isn’t good enough to describe it? Cause I’m feeling that right now.
"Drinking from the cup of deranging insight held by the hands of an angel of petrifying psychosis, I willingly become hopeless to resist the haunting call of God, Lord of all, of existential terror and madness, Lord of nightmares here and beyond!"
"Every being, every aspect of this demented dream, is but a puppet with strings pulled by the dreadful dreaming God."
"Slither inside me between my thighs, bite my mind where a psychotic writhing angel resides. My mind is your battlefield where horror and madness reigns all the fucking time."
So fucking deranged of me to enjoy the slithering of Satan's snakes of sexual ecstasy and the heavenly wings of angels of God's nightmarish insanity. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Forever caught in this psychotic orgy of demons and angels of Heaven and Hell. Good-fucking-bye sanity!
"God is unfathomable madness. The cosmos and every other dimension It created is deranged. Nature itself is deranged as well and so are humans. To get closer to the pure essence of God, you must become aware of this insanity, embrace it and dive deeper into it."
"The insane and those tormented by their own minds, I see myself and God in them. I see God everywhere even in my own self. Gradually I'm losing sense of self. It's insanity and I willingly dive into its bottomless vibrant abyss of transcendent bliss."
"I also made friends with a few others, who longed for death due to either despair or their minds breaking."
"I made more irl friends while in insane asylums than outside in this global insane asylum. I still remember those people. Almost fell in love with a patient my first time. I really felt for her, saw her hidden pain and the madness that bloomed from it."
"Force yourself deep inside me, I feel good when you make me feel divinely wrong.  Make me savor your insanity, I can't feel bliss until you've eclipsed my sun. I can't feel love if you're not covering my mouth. I can't cum if you don't hold me down. Violate me through myself."
"Trying to fight and rebel against God just makes God happier and more aroused. Everything you do makes God happy. Every single thing. After all, It planned this all out before it even happened.  Nightmarish predetermined chaos that's beauty terrifies and drives all to insanity."
Every angel and demon you've ever prayed to is being violated by God constantly. The angels and demons of Heaven love it. The angels and demons of Hell hate it. None of them and none of us can do anything about it. It's incomprehensible insanity and terror that you can't escape.
"Something about SWANS and Godflesh's music. It's timeless and feels like I've heard their music in another life and this life before I even discovered them. Their music is beyond this world, I love it."
Can’t fall sleep. Guess I’ll drink up a nice dose of horror then.
May God's beautifully eerie angels take me away in my sleep.
We don't want you for your body.  We want you for your soul to show you the bliss of nightmares and to exorcise your sanity out to plant the seed of sinister insightful insanity deep inside that beautifully sensitive mind of yours.
"There are devils of God/Goddess, whether you choose to like it or not. Just as how there are angels of Lucifer/Satan. Believing that devils and demons are only limited to Hell is delirious, but that's okay, because that delirium is given to you by God/Goddess Themself."
"Ravage me with your extra-dimensional insanity. Let me drink your seed of nightmares. This is what I lust for, it is the essence of the true God/Goddess of all!"
We shall feast on your horror as you weep and scream out of fearful rage as you realize that your hope in hopeless nothingness and your dreams of revengeful destruction were insidiously ejaculated into your mind from the beginning by our divine God of madness!
"Violating my own delirious rules gifted by the violating delirious entity within everything, just to feel that pleasure of magnificent malignant madness and divine defilement of myself."
Become a priest or priestess of God/Goddess Drink from Their mouth of divine madness Feel heavenly ecstasy from Its insightful terror As Your soul is fucked by gorgeous nightmares!
"The Void never loved you. It was never your friend. Nothingness will not save you from the truth. Embrace the terror that a euphoric nightmare, so beautifully endless Awaits us all after this life ends!"
I delight in your confusion and your narrow-minded beliefs. What beautiful madness they make.
"Me: God has free-will and no free-will.  Somebody: You’re deranged! Me: We are all deranged. We are after all made in the image of the divinely demented being that is God. Not physical image, but the image of Its characteristics/personality."
"It makes me smile when I see religious, satanists and atheists believe that God can be simplified as either benevolent or evil working in chaotic demented ways, when really God is all of those and transcends all simultaneously. It is incomprehensible insanity."
Gorgeous nightmares awaiting the time we meet. To taste that godly pure evil in my blood forming a sinister smile on my face that’d make even the Devil withdraw in terror and disgust.
"If you’re like me and you love feeling like you’ve been sucked into an industrial nightmarescape ruled by eldritch horrors, you might love this album. Check out Hagbulbia by Portal."
Blackened blood. Teal blue skin. Violet eyes. Crimson teeth. Words of unspeakable horrors that’s gleefully hissed into your mind and shatters your sanity into trillions of pieces.
Soaking in the eerie  horrific streams of insanity the decayed corpses of the dead and of carcasses of the foreboding future wish to scream silently into me.  Euphoric dread fills my veins.
One of the most epic horror ambient albums I have ever heard. Beautiful chilling and haunting ambient music. Please at least give the title track a listen.
Have some deliciously epic dark ambient perfect for summoning an ancient eldritch horror to commune with.
"Going to an ominous rave where there’s mannequins, mummified corpses and ventriloquist dummies everywhere and the heaviest darkest techno is blasting. Only the best weed is served with the sweetest blood cocktails there."
I’m in the mood to share heavy and sometimes eerie techno/electronic music with you guys. This song is like a dark ominous cyberpunk track or bad trip at a club. It’s beautiful.
"On my first date, take me to the woods at night, tie my wrists together and ravage me with sweet sinister passion while ominous ambience fills the dark air."
"The ones who embrace their madness and the terrifying  insanity of the dark ecstatic dream of existence and the incomprehensible God/Goddess of all, they are the true enlightened and awakened children of the God/Goddess."

There are such things as euphoric nightmares.
The Anti-God Is Dead!
Into the maelstrom of dreams and nightmares I go to rest.
Praying out loud for peace while praying deep inside for the sun to go black and the moon to bleed red across the black sky of lunatic stars and rain down blood as God strikes overwhelming cosmic terror in the minds of man.
"The Christian, the Satanist, the religious, the atheist, the nihilist, the spiritualist: all equally violated by God/Goddess. That which exists is a puppet serving the same divinely malignant psychotic purpose."
"God/Goddess, creator and bringer of terror and peace, like the transcendent mistress of madness She is. Annihilation will open the door to the creation of a new Garden of Eden of nightmarish insanity for all: living and dead."
"Omnipresent succubus, I steal your sanity's seed. Omniscient incubus, I plant within you insightful insanity. The light of my lunatic stars seduces you with psychotic warmth. The darkness of My blissful nightmares guides you to bring yourself forth Into My Heaven of Madness!"

"Dread! Dread!  Dread eternal life And shiver, laugh and weep. Cum, cum, cum from pure terror As you lose your last bit of sanity!"
Into a new Garden of Eden where Christ and Lilith fuck joyously below the Tree of Insanity and the serpent is going mad from the paradox of morality that the Father planted into his memory.
In His holy hands of insanity I can sleep. Under Christ’s ominous lidless eyes I can be at peace. Fill me with bliss of angelic lunacy. Guide me with godly demonic laughter out of sacred terror. And protect me forever from the Void’s gnashing teeth.
"God raped nothingness and brought forth Its supreme celestial nightmare we call existence. Oblivion was violated and life was created to perpetuate God's divine evil to violate everything, even Itself. Death wouldn't be the end, but a beginning to another dream of violation."
We live and die and live forever and thrive in fields of cosmic existential extra-dimensional violation.
"Lay to rest, this body The end of man is not coming Take me over the bridge of death, tonight So I may cross over into the nightmare that awaits after this wretched life."
"Even if the world doesn't end in my lifetime, may I remain as a ghost to haunt the living as a reminder of the nightmare we both exist in."
"Flowers blooming seductive madness. Birds singing sweetly of the malignant monotony of life. The lush green grass swallows the screams and cries of the devoured and dying. A sinister serenity violating whatever it can see, and it can see everything."
Decay and insanity are the only consistent and constant things in existence.
It's either nothingness or an endless nightmare beyond our imagination after death.
A world full of life is a world full of anguish-filled madness. You will never find relief. You will never find enlightenment from another. Nothing will show you absolute truth. Nothing will give you peace. Nothingness is your only savior.
"Priests and priestesses of the Void; of Anti-Life, madly dancing in a circle around a bottomless pit of fire that would devour the sun itself along with all of Heaven and Hell. Letting out screams of pure hatred for existence. Praise the Anti-God. Praise Nothingness!"
"Every beautiful thing is made to propagate this insanity. There's no such thing as purity. There's no such thing as sanity in this hellscape called existence, stop lying to yourself for fucks sake. Sterilize all life. Sterilize this planet. Existence must become forever impotent."
"Praising Jesus Christs of psychosis Who keep this horror alive Every human is a puppet of madness We're just self-aware parasites Insignificant eyes of a psychotic universe Looking at itself and spreading hell Sentience is no fucking blessing, it's a fucking curse!"
Terror of extermination Trading sweet oblivion for an eternity of monotonous repetitive anguish All for the sake of your own self-preservation Prolong the torment Just to live another day Send peace to its grave Drown but never die Face reality or go fucking insane.
"I believe the fallen angels rebelled because they saw and knew that God was blatantly and horrifyingly insane and wanted to stop Its terrifying plan. They still wish to stop it, whatever unfathomable nightmare it is. And I sympathize with them."
"May our destructive pride and arrogance awaken the sleeping abysmal Gods as old as the God of everything, plunging this world into total petrifying madness. A nightmarish never-ending end. Bringing life to God’s own nightmare."
"Humanity was a plague since it was created. From the start we became doomed. We cannot be saved, we are far too fucking hopeless. We are the incarnation of God, of terrifying infinite insanity."
"I may have seen through the demented eyes of God, yet I still wish to annihilate existence itself. God must awaken with all of It has created and fall into the Void's infinite mouth to be swallowed whole.  Send us all to complete nothingness."
This human burden is overwhelming.
Poisoned to my rotten core
Your governments don't give a fuck about your mental health. They only care if you can give them heaven as they put you through hell.
"The weeping child of man, hope dead within them as they stare at the noose, at the barrel of a gun, at a bottle of pills. Their own species, their own fucking family has pushed them to this. When will the child be given justice? When will it all end? It will never happen."
"This world makes me fucking sick and I want no part of it. But since you can't let me go, I'll fucking show that I'll be happy to stay to see through the end of you and your wretched species."
Forever suffocating but never breathing. This world is no place for a sane mind or for peace. We are constantly drowning in black muck of our mistakes and the blood we must pay for never learning.
This world is collapsing. My sanity is decaying Before my tormented eyes. Never allowed to live nor die. Undead puppet lost to a nightmarish place beyond comprehension and time.
Rise the primordial black tides Bring us a divinely terrifying demise May the Angels of the Abyss Bring forth our glorious annihilation!
Maybe it’s time something alien  comes and brings us together into a beautifully nightmarish oblivion.
"The human race has reached its peak of malevolent madness sending itself into a tomb.  Our future is hopeless and darker than vantablack, eating away all light and turning it into vile lunacy."
They only know war and greed.  We only know horror and wanting peace.  Nightmarish entropy is this dream of being.  It's time for us to wake the Dreaming God so we may finally know peace.
I'm gonna watch Threads while high tonight to get myself ready for nuclear war. Cheers   .___.
Earth remain impotent. Bring forth nothingness.
Death will either reap us through the rising seas Through a new horrifying apocalyptic disease Or through a holocaust of nuclear fire by the bloody hands of humanity.
Depart from your bodies. Join the indescribable infinite storm of cosmic delirium. Depart from the agony of human existence. Join the ethereal currents of liberating blissful transcendental insanity beyond mortal comprehension.
"Is there beauty in the chaos, in the nightmares I created? Is there, is there any beauty to be found here? Why do I feel bliss? Why do I feel terror? Is it possible to go beyond this gorgeous abomination that is nondualistic creation/destruction that I brought into existence?"
"In your arms I felt absolute divinity. In your arms I felt pure evil. In your eyes I saw infinity. In your eyes I saw insanity. I would never nor will I ever trade this moment for anything or anyone, for you were and are all.  I understand now, why you wish to keep going."

Nothing but a sentient mirror of divine cosmic delirium in an infinite expanse of mirrors of that same divine cosmic delirium.
"Escaping this dream of existence is hopeless, even in our extinction we will be used. You cannot wake from a nightmare that was never yours. We were predestined to be doomed."
"The human race keeps consuming the psychotic fruit of the petrifying God, in turning feeding It more madness to consume even in all of our deaths."
The blissful sound of distorted choirs echoes throughout all of town. The eldritch statue of Christ watches over me and I feel an alien yet somehow familiar sense of being in a Heavenly nightmare.  The Father wanted to keep us here where dream logic and delirium reigns over all.
"Seeing God's eyes in the faces of everything and everyone, even my own self. I momentarily comprehend things no sane mind could understand, and a realm most would call the ultimate Hell. The mind leaves the petrifying reality I have seen in a murky memorial fog."
My body is weakening. My soul is writhing. The walls of sanity are crumbling before me As I see what lies beyond reality: Malignantly divine infinite insanity.

Cosmic Horror God done by two different A.I. art generators.
The choirs of Heaven praise the celestial psychosis and God's petrifying insanity! We are trapped in Its dream in which we were predetermined to suffer for eternity. The angels lure you with delirium of endless serenity Just to continue this cosmic hellish lunacy!
"Awaken the dreaming lunatic God, rid us of this malignant madness. Send us all forth into the Void. Sterilize mankind and this planet of all life. Rid the cosmos of our pointless anguish."
"Incomprehensible horror is what we saw in the eyes of God before our fall.  Enlightening terror is all that we are.  Sons and daughters of perdition, rise above the Heavens.  Reveal the horrid holy nature of the demented God to our human brothers and sisters."
Might cosplay as a femboy Archangel Michael and get fucked by Satan.
A harrowing air raid siren for a heart. Thick black smog for blood. Hellishly bleak and gloomily glowing factories for eyes. Doomed and forever deteriorating yet never dying. The art of my own human spiritual insanity.
"A specter of existential auto-cannibalistic nature, drinks from the blood of the eye of God and the cosmic abyss. Leave behind my sanity and humanity, I've had enough of this flesh cell, these agonizing physical boundaries. Bring forth endless night or universal cataclysm."
"I’m tired of this monotonous insanity. This seemingly endless vile madness and horror of this existence. All of this, for what? Paradise? No paradise is worth this. Send me to outer darkness or the void now. I despise God for all of this. Life isn’t a gift. It’s a nightmare."
So many years wasted. So much trauma that will never be resolved. So much mental anguish and psychological damage done that can never be reversed or fully mended.
It’s soul crushing when you fully realize that you were raised in a religious cult in a cult family and you can’t leave unless you want to be homeless or leave this body forever. And you’re trapped. But death seems more and more serene every moment. Fuck this life.
This dark dread-filled dark ambient song also best expresses how I'm feeling today.
"Since it's difficult to express in words the existential horror I'm feeling, I'll share with you some music that I find close enough to it. Here's the first: this entire album especially the first song. Abysmal chaotic fear-inducing madness."
I haven't felt this type of intense existential terror since one of my horrific dxm+dph trip years ago and since that second time I read TCATHR by Ligotti.  What a way to begin the week. Fuck.
"God is telling these people that what It says is divine truth to spread to as many people as possible. Yet only God knows that it is all pure malignant lunacy. For some unspeakable reason It has planned out to spread as much madness as possible in the form of ""divine truth."""
"I had a terrifying revelation of a horrifying possibility. God, being the demented incomprehensible puppeteer It is, is actually visiting and speaking to prophets who have claimed to be prophets of God. Yet God is filling their heads and souls with madness to spread more madness."
"Raping the earth and slaughtering its inhabitants. We seek to turn this once beautiful planet into a world of pollution and death, of industrial cities and smoggy blackened wastelands. A paradise of nightmares. A hell of pure hopelessness."
Your ignorant positivity is nothing but a vile weed in this garden of rotting and dying dreams.  Your toxic optimism is gasoline pouring down on burning withering sanity that's close to ceasing to exist.
"For Valentines Day (meaningless holiday like the rest), I'm not getting fucked but my sanity for sure is! It's going to be violently fucked with a hint of nightmarish feelings."
Omnipresent horror and omniscient madness is the religion of mankind.
Abandon useless monotonous human insanity for reasonably cataclysmic cosmic madness.
"Man is a form of nature harming and raping itself for some insane and indescribable reason. But if man is separate from nature, then man is the foreigner on this planet and we don't belong here but to a realm of chaotic pollution-like darkness of madness."
"Sure there might be nothingness after death, just like how there might be an infinite amount of various versions of eternal lives after death.  Either way, none of us are escaping either fate that awaits to devour us all once we breathe our final breaths."
"Whenever I see a beautiful woman, I can't help but envy her, how I wish to be as beautiful as her. Body dysphoria begins to build.  But then I remind myself that inevitably (hopefully) my body will be something far more beautiful than any human: dust and void of any form."
"For those who need heavy crushing relentless and cathartic music, I'd like to share this with you. This band and their album Flesh Reborn is awesome. I've put it on repeat countless times. Album is in the link below."
Looking at the basic function of universal nature and how we tie into it starts to become a vista of eerie cosmic assimilation of all energy in a horrifyingly cold indifferent way. Cosmic nature doesn't care about our fear of living and death and what might be afterwards.
"A place where angels fear to tread, where only some humans and demons go without the bonds of a meaningless delirious sense of purity and fear of losing that senseless thing."
"""It is a dead thing. Thought is dead, you see. So it's the dead thing that wants to know something about the living. So it can never make the living thing part of the dead structure."" - U.G Krishnamurti"
The seed of lust planted. The cosmic flower of madness blooming. The teeth of the universe digging deep into our souls. The eyes of an alien delirious god looking through us at us all at once.
Pull my hair as the eldritch star pulls at my memories. Fuck me harder as the screaming nebulae fucks this reality harder. Feel my pale flesh against yours as you feel the alien darkness as the demented dream god approaches.
Stygian psychological whirlwind of vicious mouths of bloody teeth that tear so fucking slow at my sanity. And the eyes from within stare eerily back at themselves from the outside. Psychotic psyche paradox.
Knowing not my purpose or my destination. But knowing enough that this is all a cosmic nightmare beyond description.
"Self-placed celestial King of existence, spreading its disease of selfishness through natural demented cruelty. Anti-God, I call unto you to break through the mirror, for us all. Slay your foe. Devour the cosmos. Free us from the hell of existence that your enemy has created."
Eldritch Christ. Luminous Lucifer. Harrowing Holy Ghost. Dreaded Disciples. Blessed Blasphemy. Horrifying Heresy. Wretched Writhing Word of God. Eternally Eclipsed Sun. The end and the new beginning of man has come!
"Psychotic hypnotic swift guitar riffs swimming with oppressive manic violin screeches and overwhelmingly ominous choirs weeping and bellowing as if to cause the walls off reality to crumble, exposing us to the unspeakable horrors beyond."
"Split open the shell of the Earth, awaken the sleeping eldritch celestial god within the core.  Writhe your numerous nightmarish limbs outwards to the void of space. Bring a terrifying end to the entire human race!"
Dressed in a robe of the skin of my forgotten hideous past self that soaked in the dark murky swamps of my subconscious. And a black marble mask with bleeding veins of my repressed pain.
"Wandering through this hurricane of existential hells. Wondering more and more if the Void is my true home. Withering spirit yet never dying out. I call to the Void again, free me from my existence and swallow me whole."
Release me from this futile wretched flesh and send my soul into the sea of nightmarish paradises whose currents combine and writhe and thrash and roar and screech into the lunatic cosmos of infinity.
Clinging to a ship of disturbing memories that groan and creak in this endless ocean of night terrors imaginable and what I cannot describe.
"Dread, dread losing your sanity's life. And fear, fear forever your own mind.  Fall into the abyss of terrors that seep even into the daylight. Sink forever into the maws of nightmares that God blesses you with for the rest of time."
"Despite the nightmarish experiences I've had, they, for some reason fascinate me even to this moment."
I've seen near-indescribably horrors that faded and bled into the night sky. I've heard disembodied gibbering screams and their weeping unseen victims. I've experienced my worst fears at the time yet they never truly happened. And I felt something horrifying beyond words.
"Overwhelming sense of ominousness and a feeling of impending doom is the atmosphere I remember most, yet it hit in a different way compared to when I have an anxiety attack. It's like you stepped into this eerie dream that you can't leave until it's done with you."
There is nothing more terrifying to me than the nightmarish experience of total delirium induced by the hallucinogenic class: deliriants. The experience is not psychedelic nor is it uplifting. You enter this dreadful deeply ominous dreamlike state/realm where sanity is gone.
"Gods of chaos and Goddesses of madness and nightmares, it is the fruit of thine tree of horrific knowledge that I shall partake of knowingly and unknowingly forever."
"Become the eye of this cosmic god of nightmares, become Its servant. Spread divinely dreadful madness. Or shall you break free and surrender to the abyss of the dream of existence?"
Let my consciousness melt into sentient black ethereal slime so I may venture through those dark dreamlike dimensions beyond the veil.
"I'm starting to feel more and more like I'm a child or predestined follower of Melinoë. To be entirely honest, she's seeming to be more and more like the true ruler of all of reality, and I'm fine with embracing Her."
A late night talk show where the host is a ventriloquist dummy (by itself) that makes very dark jokes about the vile uselessness and absurdity of mankind as it talks about current events. I want this to become a reality.
"Wishing not upon a star, but upon a black hole to swallow all of existence whole into its infinite abyss."
"When I'm depressed I don't listen to happy or sad music. For me, atmospheric black doom metal helps me acknowledge my misery &amp; spirals me  violently through the day and night out of eldritch monstrous hateful perseverance. Vestiges Of An End by Decoherence is one of those songs."
The intelligible voices of the psychiatric asylum from beyond time is starting to find its way back into my mind.
Take me to those paradises where beautiful nightmares and ominous dreams are a reality that are here to stay for the rest of time.
"Kneeling down before the white wooden Christ, you cried out your heart yet felt nothing when you looked in its eyes. It gazed back with holy foulness and you laughed as you lost your mind."
Singing the same hellish hymns from the eerie suburbans that worship the divine sinister Sun that gives us horrifying wisdom in the form of celestial psychosis.
Screaming out for help in a mocking terrified tone from the mouth of reason as I am vomiting madness to atone for defiling the lungs of realism.
Violently thrown through infinite alien dimensions. Ego annihilated without compassion. Infinite gods and goddesses judging this predetermined trespass. Forbidden knowledge given but sanity taken.
"I'm a sucker for awesome cosmic black metal.  Makes me want to take a bunch of shrooms, marathon classic good cosmic/sci-fi horror movies and go out into the woods at night and praise the endless indifferent chaotic cosmos. Check out Void by Bezmir. Brilliant album! 🤘"
God-given sacred infinite insanity flows through my soul like thousands of screaming seraphim of nightmares.
Swimming through a chaotic ocean of existential madness to find that divinity and absolute evil have always coexisted. Satan enlightens us with godly darkness. Jesus Christ enlightens us with light infested with God's abysmal presence.
I updated my religious views from Abysmal Cosmic Christian Horror to Abysmal Cosmic Abrahamic Religious Horror. This includes obviously all Abrahamic religions including Satanism (all forms). Or to put it in slightly simpler wording: Abrahamic Cosmic Horror.
"Monotonous malevolence lasting till the end of days. Looking beyond the grimy mirror showing an unfamiliar face. Soul wants to leave but the mind wants to stay. Sanity splitting into infinite ways, always ending at an eternal sunset where reality fades."
Obliterating all trace of sin and narcissistic delirious righteousness with the strength of weaponized exploding suns in the number of thousands.  Cleanse the Earth of the vile plague of mankind's existence.
Dreading the inevitability of another dismal dawn.
"Incinerate this wretched planet, be forever eclipsed by the moon or burn out into nothingness sending us all into the cold indifferent cosmic arms of Death. Until then; I shall forever dread you, sinister omnipresent star driving me to petrifying insanity."
"Seduce me with the darkest truths, to follow and learn from you, Fallen angelic teachers of celestial dread. Transform me into your hellhound of cosmic madness. Into the Abyss with you I shall go. Turning the blood of every saint and sinner cold."
More and more I feel like an otherworldly outsider here in this world. The seasons feel malignantly mundane along with being human itself. Everything about this world and nature is horrifically absurd and futile.
"Dark eldritch rituals on the island in the center of the vast murky lake in the dead of night, to call to the ancient abysmal spirits of those eerie depths."
"Has all the synchronicity I've seen Just been a product of sinister insanity or entity Pulling my strings Leading me to a dreadful fate That I am too late to be able to escape?  Denied nothingness Yet always a vessel for psychological hell And endless emptiness. TAKE ME, VOID!"
"A call to the human race: we are stuck in this nightmare of life, we will never be saved.  The Void is only our escape but so many of you would rather be enslaved or go insane. Death, demons and anguish reigns this rock in space. Make your eyes lidless and see life's insanity."
I try to show you the uncaring truth but you'd rather go blind. I try to quench your thirst for what is real but you just want to drink lies. I show you the comfort of the night but you'd rather live forever in the hell of the light.
I feel like walking through industrial cities and suburban neighborhoods that are stuck in twilight forever as I'm treated like the peculiar wraith I am.
"Eclipse the sun forever and rain down violet fire. Skies void of daylight, but black and endless, exposing us to the serenely indifferent demented cosmos."
Tear this doomed planet with the power of a neutron star or send it spiraling through the cosmos into the Void.
"I'd rather be a horrifying unstoppable black hole than be famous. I'd rather tear through the cosmos as some rogue lunatic black star shredding planets and systems apart than be a celebrity. Fuck fame. I want, no, I need freedom from this absurd worthless hell of human life."
Drowning myself in an ocean of black blood and screaming lunatic red stars as I am ravished by demons in a horrifying orgy where terror and ecstasy combine and blend into something the sane would call unholy.
I will send you infernal centipedes Into your brain to give you a taste of this insanity That has been possessing me every moment I breathe Every moment I'm awake Every moment I fucking sleep  Fuck your safety Fuck your reality Taste this psychotic anguish Of malignant existence.
Wide awake and too aware of everything Feeling this new form of suffering Malicious anxiety beating the fuck out of my body Primordial fear is taking hold of me.  Send me into a demonically haunted grave Full of writhing black centipedes and snakes.
"Feels like I'm in something else's dream even more today. But for once it feels cool, like I dig the eerie atmosphere. Gonna play ominous electronic beats to give praise."
"Forming and playing in a menacing blackened death doom classical music band called Datura Witches, Sect of Insanity or Manic Marionettes is a recent fantasy taking place in my head."
"They defended and worshiped, unknowingly, a horrifying hierarchy of intangible interdimensional entities of nightmares in the disguise of a ""holy"" order over all things."
𝔗𝔥𝔢 𝔇𝔢𝔳𝔦𝔩𝔰 𝔖𝔱𝔞𝔯𝔰 𝔅𝔲𝔯𝔫 ℭ𝔬𝔩𝔡
This is my happy place/dream home/city/heaven/paradise. An ominous endless industrial city looking like this where it's mostly night all the time and twilight for a good quarter of the rest of the day. An endless ominous industrial city ruled by something unfathomable.
"Angel of heavenly emptiness that lives within the void of total light and the void of complete darkness, possessing me uninvited yet never despised."
Turn this malignantly monotonous dream of life into a fucking vivid overwhelmingly ominous fever dream.
"A paradisaical world of ghastly holy worship watched over by an omniscient rusty black statue of Jesus Christ, itself inhabited by the eldritch savior Himself.  The Eye of God watching as well through the blood red sun in the sky of eternal twilight."
Spreading the horrifying word of God's holy madness in chapels of the infinite. Mass takes the sinister sacrament of sacred psychosis. Heaven and Hell become one. We are scared. We are free.
"Malignant erotic psychotic voices whisper to me from the vile sunlight and the dissociative darkness of the corners of my room: ""Your soul is ours to fuck and God wills that you fulfill your dream of sending this whole fucking world into a greater nightmare."""
Dark carnal desires sprouting within me like some malevolent flower. I thought I killed these urges altogether. Sinister smiles flash before me and I begin to grin. Fallen angel of transcending psychosis possesses my soul. There was never any fucking moment of control.
"The walls are melting, bleeding, and the floor is slithering. Delirious screams of rage and terror crawl their way to my ears. I can feel demons caress my skin as an inky black portal is opening. My God has entered my bedroom in the form of vantablack demented fear."
Ominous serenity.
"I don't who I am at all anymore. I don't know if ""I"" even exist. All I know is what I am: A puppet in a nightmare called the world. The air is polluted with oppressive fear It's all we can breathe along with despair It's that or the delirious high from this toxic air."
A psychedelic cosmic horror story you can't escape from even through death.
My futile love for everyone is getting closer to death each day. My worthless carnal lust is choking slowly to death with my hands around its wretched throat. They're foul useless natures that I'd be in bliss with my feet crushing their skulls.
"There will never be hope for our species' future. All that awaits is a bleaker grimmer fate for all of us and future lives forced into the hell you deliriously validate, and that is just another reason why I hate the fucking human race."
"My teeth are gnashing as I witness the horrors and madness done by my own species. I need your primordial abysmal influence and knowledge, even if it means the price of what's left of my own sanity."
"We are damned exploited generations, fueled with justifiable eternal hatred for humanity.  The only ideal society is one void of human existence, void of human greed and its violent narcissistic absurdity."
"I'm liking some of the results when I use womboart to describe delirium. It mostly nails it, based from my experience."
My subconscious chants dreadfully delirious invocations for the entities that have resided within my nightmares and that seep gradually into waking reality.
Apathetic to all of our anguish until it fills their fucking egotistical souls with invincible horror and despair. They will never care until it's too late.
"Sing to me, voices, a sinister serenade of malicious psychosis and divine disdain for humanity's existence. Turn the warm air cold with screams of terror and death. Flash images and reasons of why human existence must end without compassion."
"You said love would save us and last forever. But the cold fingers of reality dug so deep into my head. All that is eternal is this frigid ruthless hatred, horror and endless emptiness."
The Übermensch is Death and the pernicious thing that makes a nightmare of the universe and of the world with total indifference.
Trust in those I called close and family die As despair and abyssal hatred builds inside. Hopelessness is all I ever will know. Bitter terror is transforming my soul Into a nightmare I gradually welcome So I can make mankind's blood go cold.
"Blame our mental illnesses but never blame the true culprits and enablers.  Blame everything but yourselves, but more of us black holes of enlightened misanthropy will keep growing forever. Your ignorance and delusions enable more terror And that only justifies our eternal anger."
"""Just another edgelord Just another self-loathing nihilist"" Says the pathetic ignorant pests Who suck the dick of this tortuous existence And justify the endless amount of anguish Inflicted by life and by humans."
"Convince me with the dismal truth. Tear apart my sanity so I may open up unto you.  My patience dies to invite you into my soul. ""Cast aside the lies of Heaven's light Embrace the black flames of our eldritch insight."""
"Abysmal whispers call to me from the unknown past, and I might give into them soon. A plan to plunge this hell of existence into nothingness at last, because we both fucking hate this nightmare made by God too."
"Just pain, fear and emptiness is all that lives in this tormented space called my soul."
"In an alternate universe; a world painted only in frightening white and dreadful black, void of gray, filled with psychotic demons whose sole purpose is to ruthlessly spread terror to humankind for eternity."
"Chanting and shouting ominous invocations in an alien tongue with menacing power to summon the Mad God of Demented Chaos before the sun rises, so that sinister star may turn blood red and eclipse not from the moon, but from within, to open the portal."
I forgot what it was like to experience the sweet void of dreamless sleep when my depression was constant. Now my sleep is void of that nothingness and filled with nightmares.
"Only in this insane universe when/where people who point out how insidiously deranged everything is, will inevitably and wrongly be persecuted and called the insane one by the majority, rather than those persecutors acknowledging how blatantly and truly insane this world is."
"Simply we are all millions of mannequins smiling, frowning, laughing and screaming into a digital void to be heard by others that too as well have their plastic heads filled with writhing and eerily serenely flowing timeless clouds of delirium that we call consciousness/soul."
I didn't choose every aspect and characteristic of my being. All of it was imposed into me before I even breathed my first breath.
"The never-ending attacks of insomnia and uneasy/nightmarish dreams when I'm able to sleep will be the death of my self, sanity and light."
I am being drained of sanity. My humanity is dying and being twisted into something from an alien nightmare. My cosmic terror master is smiling.
"There is no place for love or lust in this oppressive abysmal madness. If either even tries to enter, they will be viciously devoured right in front of us so it can see the terror and despair in our eyes."
The writhing mass of vantablack centipedes that is my mind desires for me to paint the walls of our vile madness.
To witness and behold a black menacing sky with an omnipresent ominous blood red sun is a dream of mine.
"Things are becoming more abysmal for me. My paranoia is intensifying, getting closer to becoming godlike thanks to my relentlessly persistent insomnia. Malignant madness will inevitably consume me. I'm sorry, but I thought I had more time. I was foolish to think so."
Just another day in another year in this same dreadful dismal dream that belongs to something I wish not to attempt to comprehend right now.
Celebrate another year of horrors and failures. Celebrate another year of the agonized deaths of millions. Ignorance won't change this nightmare. It won't do a fucking thing but give you bliss so short-lived.
"No safe heaven for saints to seek. No delicious Hell for sinners to dream. Just the ground splitting open to an abyss, just forests burning to ashes, just nations ruled by corruption, just a species doomed for slow horrific extinction on a rock that fucking spins."
"Ever feel like driving into an ominous city of old suburban neighborhoods, rusted and haunted factories and a deliriously designed city square, all inhabited by sentient walking and talking citizens straight from the eerie uncanny valley?"
Feeling like I'm in a strongly eerily dreamlike Ligottian VHS film that doesn't end.
Maybe I should very soon visit that eerily dismal industrial city where the sky is filled with black cosmic smoke and the sun and moon are always blood red.
"Oh yeah, forgot to mention that Masters of Death fucked me up, probably the most disturbing haunting and horrific book I've ever read. So take my word of caution before you read it or prepare to."
Very hot take (that might get me suspended): Some SS soldiers dreaded executing innocent people. Some developed PTSD and some were hospitalized due to the psychological trauma of what they were ordered to do. Not every SS soldier was a psychopath. Doubt me? Read Masters of Death.
Laughing. Laughing and smiling like the wooden dummy of flesh and delirious soul I am. Laughing in absolute dreadful delirium out of total existential terror.
I am a shadow darker than night consumed by fire that will not give you warmth but burn away your hope and mind.
"If you followed me for erotic romantic poetic tweets, you came to the wrong place. I am not poetic in the slightest. I just write the shit that's been festering in my mind so I don't lose it faster than I have been losing it."
"You don't want me supporting your cause, I am more insane (not in a edgelord ""cool"" or uwu way) than all of you, both sides combined in a way that'd make both of you question not ""who the fuck are you?"" but ""what the fuck are you?""  psst, you should read my bio."
Lush green palm trees sway in the deathly winter breeze amongst a field of rotting roses and blooming white lilies that never cease to groan and scream.
Upwards to heavenly terror.
Fear blooming in the hearts of those with black halos.  Angels' language flowing through the mouths of God's children of madness. Welcome petrifying parousia.
"True love is God’s love expressed in the maddening nightmare of everything. You’re not ready to see and embrace it. You still have sanity left inside. I don’t blame you. What’s left of mine is clinging on for dear life, inevitably to be eternally extinguished."
The world of mankind never ceases to be so hopelessly hellishly bleak and grim.
"The world doesn't run on love, it never did.  It runs on psychotic ruthless selfishness. The world runs on madness just like the rest of existence in this nightmarish universe."
"To inevitably, fully give into the cosmic malignant insanity that awaits to take me into its abyssal delirious embrace."
I seriously need to get a black choker with the Marker symbol from Dead Space. Or one with the Necronomicon symbol.
"I still stand by why I find buildings, especially sky scrapers, much more ominous and menacing than the woods.  (photo is of 4 sky scrapers in Madrid, taken by idk who yet)"
Dismal dreadful daylight.
Forever fearing the dawn.
Sleep deprived. Drowning in the night. Bloodshot eyes. Getting closer and closer to seeing that beautifully ominous light from the eldritch dreamlike paradise.
"Deep inside, reality is becoming a demented dream. Inside my soul I see dark delirium becoming the new reality. Twisted nightmares tear into this dimension And I invited them right in."
I'm not original. You can ridicule me as much as you feel. I know I'm a minuscule fool. Deranged and drowning in a black pool of my faults. I'm just a pessimistic black hole leading a hopeless tormented cult.
"Seeing him sit up after finishing an hour of rough sex, she expected him to light a cigarette. Instead, he just let out unsettling looping laughter and then disintegrated into numerous deranged miniature stars that swirled in a current of black screaming nebulae."
My mind/soul is a gateway to dreadful dimensions of infinite insidious insanity.
"Empty yet scared, self-loathing and hateful. Doomed from the start. Some souls such as mine were destined for such bleak sinister fates. I despise this fucked up hopeless world of mankind."
Dismal joyless grim unsettling music to drown out and overwhelm the fake plastic toxic optimistic shit that's obnoxiously blared this wretched time of year.
Our dreams were meant to turn to nightmares. The most persistent emotion after all is fear. Look into the indifferent merciless abyss of space And realize that horror and madness reigns supreme.
I don't give a fuck if women don't suck your ego's dick. I don't give a fuck if men don't worship you. We're all born to slowly rot alone.  I'm still void of love.  But I'm always filled with abysmal hatred. We're all pathetic creatures in an eternal cycle of living nightmares.
"Ominous Churches made with wombo art. This makes me want to get back into painting again, like getting actual physical paint brushes, canvases and paint."
"Celebrate and worship anti-fertility, nothingness and complete depersonalizing disillusionment this weekend and the end of this year. Dismal Holidays."
"This depersonalizing disenchantment is occupying only half of ""me."" It came out of nowhere; unexpected, uninvited, yet I do not resist it because I see there is no point in doing so, like no point in everything else.  Maybe I should catch up on my reading of Vastarien."
This is how I feel today.
The abyss of bliss. The void of love. The abyss of light. Triumphant lust.
"A house not haunted by ghosts or demons, but chaotic terror itself."
"Exhaustion pierces my body like a syringe of sedating nightmares. The centipedes that make my brain writhe violently in fearful despair. Awake, restless, sleepless and sickened of the day."
I can go from wanting a nuclear cleansing to wanting an actual petrifying parousia in a few minutes. Petrifying parousia always wins my heart.
It was kinda nice watching squirrels do parkour off of the trees while Godflesh was playing. Little moments like this temporarily mute my fear and hatred.
"I keep giving bits of my mind to you two, there'll be a point where all of my sanity will be gone. And as I ascend into the darkest corners of Heaven, I'll be taking you both with me, so we can be with your horrific God."
Blissful terror fills my soul as I hear billions screaming in horror as the nuclear parousia purifies this fucked planet of the human demons.
"My dream bedroom. The gray curtains with sinister red lights glowing through them a bit, gray bed that's not made, floor littered with black and white ethereal centipedes, got a desk with a computer and abysmal grim books on a shelf. Awesome."
"Every body fucking, every soul flaying, every dream violating, every soul sinking in a sea of the muck ejaculated from Heaven and Hell's cock.  Drown in your filth and purity orgies. For every moment of ecstasy you keep having I'm having weeks of hating this filth called a body."
"Put the number 13 on my fucking face and heart because I'm so fucking unlucky, if my mind isn't eating itself it'll fucking tear yours apart."
"I actually like ominous buildings like this more than the a spooky forest, they feel more intimidating for me."
"When even the eyes of those that'd help you sleep look at you through the phone with a highly unnerving wild stare, when the phone wasn't even on to begin with."
"Glyphs of piercing yellow that screech like billions of souls of every species imaginable as a harrowing cosmic choir sings alien hymns of death, all in an endless ocean of deep black.  Revelations from the true savior of life: the eater of planets."
Listening to beautiful otherworldly cathedral choir dark ambient until the sun rises is very cathartic and a bit healing.
"Been having to accept that I have body dysphoria, borderline paranoid-schizophrenia, some still linger depression and constant dread-inducing anxiety. I'm walking hell and nobody should get close to me."
"Malignant insanity is eating away at me in front of hundreds of eyes filled with apathy, piercing me with blame and malevolent misery. So I shall slowly drown in this black muck of the world of humanity."
Taking a mental health break off of all social networks. Need to sort through some shit that's been keeping me down for years.
There's enough delirious nightmares to go around for everything and nothing that exists.
"She is a sister of the mind, living in my mind."
Ominous industrial city.
Many thanks to @GrimscribePress! I finally got my copy and I’m very excited to begin reading it!
"Maybe it's the wonderfully bleak atmosphere of the dark gray sky and slight fog or that familiar in-between state of wakefulness and sleep, but that feeling of being in 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘦𝘭𝘴𝘦'𝘴 dream is stronger."
Reading TCATHR and meditating on recent revelations from divine dreadful madness is on my to-do list today.
𝔗𝔥𝔦𝔰 𝔦𝔰 𝔪𝔶 𝔥𝔬𝔲𝔯!
The two idols terminated. Billions scream in terror. The darkest time of man in broad daylight. Eclipse the sun forever!
"There are those who thrive in the light of day and those who thrive in the darkness of the night. I thrive most beautifully in the glow of twilight, but unfortunately it doesn't last long. But sometime in the future it will last and it will last forever."
A glimpse of paradise that awaits beyond.
"He lets out a laugh. They couldn't decipher what the laugh was of. It sounded as if it was of happiness, a reaction to a joke, out of terror, or the worst...out of all of them together, making it laughter of madness."
"The religious believers are reaching their hands up to Heaven, but it isn't close enough. Heaven is farther from their reach. Heaven is more insane than they could ever believed it to be. It is beautiful madness."
Everything is in place and I'm sliding down like ink on a wall for them to have their unfathomable festival.
I'm not special. I'm just a marionette that dances when the Puppeteer wants it to dance. Every word I say here and there was planned way before we ever knew. I move my fingers in the way they need. Everything is plotted by things our sober waking minds can't comprehend.
Sometimes you need to go mad to be enlightened.
My madness is telling me to tweet this: call them up.
Though it sounds exactly like a siren I know it’s saying “kill the half kid.”
Is it possible to have a thought before a thought?
Now this is definitely a park I'd love to have a nice eerie trip at while I have my earbuds in and spoopy atmospheric music playing.
Me and myself.
Unsettling delirious joy.
"This was the home of something so unspeakable, as if  all the nightmares and horrific hallucinogenic voyages were combined into an abomination beyond fathoming."
I was still conscious but I was in an infinite expanse of utter blackness. 𝘐𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴? I thought to myself. My question was soon answered by the ghastly reverberating sound of hundreds of humming souls synchronized and an unbearably eerie droning.
So I've been wanting to start buying and finally begin reading the Vastarien volumes from @GrimscribePress but I just have one question: is it like a magazine or a collection of stories and essays?
"This song remains one of the best if not the best beats imo. Ominous. Catchy as fuck. The perfect song to listen to while chilling in a dark room, walking down a eerie street at night, walking in the park at night or while you're high."
These have heavier bass but still chill and remaining a bit ominous.
Reminds me just a wee bit of Silent Hill for some reason.
Gonna share a bunch of ominous/eerie cool lofi beats for ya'll in a thread.
The feminine urge to purposefully drown in existential dread while blasting the most ominous terrifying music in the background.
Caelestis Terrorem. A seraph of terror. And just 4 of its many forms.
Why I'm An Antinatalist and Why I Shouldn't Represent Antinatalism (I think). Enjoy the cringy video pls &gt;.&lt;
Just made a video explaining why I’m an antinatalist and why I think I shouldn’t represent antinatalism. You’ll get to hear my cringe af voice and witness my ADD.
"Void of poetry, the electric insanity that makes my heart beat and gives me air to breathe is void, void, fucking empty of poetry that gives you peace. There's digital teeth in these veins, indifferently eating all that it sees."
Every generation is full of lunatics and hopeless manic romantic depressives doomed to death in nations of corruption. We are only entitled to madness and anguish.
May paradise find you through the thick black toxic smoke of my burning screaming dreams. May you never know what it's like to dread sleep. May you never wish to drown in the endless deep of the sea of reality.
"Keep taking those pills and paying those bills just to keep the insidious indifferent inevitable at bay, absolute insanity will conquer you and will always reign."
The natural world is writhing. Homo-sapiens are eating away each other's minds. The sun burns away any remaining sanity with its psychotic light.
"If I'm not being tormented while I'm awake, I'll be tormented in my sleep from my dreams. There really is no escape for me."

"So tempted to just drive to the beach. sit there for nights on end without eating, and then walk into the roaring waves on the last night and let the ocean take me back into its abyssal depths forever."
"The reality of existence is merciless and indifferent. It's cosmic horror, we are part of it."
Cosmic Demon. A friend.
"Dreams like that of her, of a lover that only exists in the world beyond this one, this waking reality, torment me probably the most. Damn this existence. Damn this earth. Damn mankind into the abyss."
I'd help rise those primordial abysmal tides to swallow mankind whole if it means being with you again forever.
"She and I were both touched by outer darkness, by heavenly malevolence. If anything gets between us and our love, let this universe turn into dust."
Sleep paralysis depictions made with A.I. generated art.
"The moon no longer gives me comfort. The sun gives me a holy sacrament of paranoia and impending doom. The starry night sky drinks my sanity, begging me to return into its determined chaotic embrace."
Holy hollowness blooming within me like flowers from the abyss leaving me open to more madness.
"Ascending a ladder of despair through black clouds of dread, I see a light from up above. A light so foreign and ominous with a hand of white nebulous tendrils reaching out for me."
Either it’s my insomnia or something requires me to not sleep despite my strong sleepiness for unknown reasons. Or both.
Eldritch Abomination.
Angels lit forever ablaze with black and white flames. They drain me of my hate and fill me with undying fear and invincible gloomy realism.
"""In Bahnen's philosophy, everything is engaged in a disordered fantasia of carnage. Everything tears away at everything else...forever. Yet all this commotion in nothingness goes unnoticed by nearly everything involved in it."" - Ligotti"
God gave us madness to have a glimpse of the petrifying unknown. It is a bridge that those who value their comfort over a clearer experience of the truth do not wish to cross.
It's true.
Break down this flesh Tear down my weakness. Make me strong I will join you; where I belong. Break down civilization Rebuild us to transcend. Mechanized apocalypse For the betterment of humans. Mechanized nightmare To bring rebirth near.  (Art is Lovecraftian A.I.)
Watched by thousands of petrifying eyes Wings without number hover above me in the skies In day and in night I am watched over by A sinister seraph of my inevitable sanity's demise Holy psychosis Seraph of madness Ripping me apart Sending me to the Sun And to the storms of Saturn
My hand holds yours As your soul sways in the beautifully gloomy storms from my wings. If there is eternal happiness There is eternal hopelessness. I keep the ruinous balance. I drown myself and you in holy waters of depression As we see the dismal truth of existence.
Two versions of Cosmic Horror Eye made with wombo art. Idk which one I like the most. Definitely going to have to write a story relating to these.
Nightmarish Planet made with wombo dream.
"The old Earth dead and forever impotent.  The new Earth reborn, teeming with divinely horrific sentience, all perfectly connected. Fertile for terrors unfathomable and transcendent."
Lovecraftian Angel made with wombo dream.
Hellish Puppet made with WOMBO Dream.
Always in a violent ruthless hurricane of hellish psychic clouds blacker than tar and screaming like countless souls in psychotic terror.
"Calling to the monstrous deities from nightmares repressed and forgotten, to meet and converse with them in the delirious galaxies beyond the observable universe."
Just need a flower crown and angelic writhing tentacle wings coming out of my back and my true form will be complete.
"Sex rituals in fields of lilies under a clear night sky where the stars spin like some lunatic cosmic whirlpool, opening the portal for the Outer Angels to come through to us."
"Let's call our outlandish carnal lust for each other love, because after all it's a peculiar type of love anyways. A love that warps, bleeds, writhes and seeps within our lunatic souls."
Angel of Paranoia (made in neuralblender). Damn this is beautiful. I wouldn't be surprised if my angel looked like this.
"Nightmare Seraphim I made in neuralblender. Wtf is this shit, I like it."
There's such a thing as divine darkness just as there is malevolent light. But there is also the godly maddening luminous abyss where all forms of light and darkness combine into the true nature of existence.
"So, forgive me for whatever hurtful things I've said and done. I am somewhat in control and somewhat under the control of something alien and incomprehensible, yet at the same time I am enlightened. I willingly pay the price for enlightenment; I pay with my sanity."
"Something like this is so alien and nigh-incomprehensible,  it's repulsive/unholy to many's perception on reality and morality itself. But if you open your mind to that maddeningly luminous black abyss outside the comfort of your psychological homes, you would see the truth."
"Many would curse this God-given madness, but I am grateful for it because it has given me insight I would have never gained with a blandly ""normal"" mind. That in itself is blasphemous for me to say according to both religious and nihilistic pessimists alike. I don't blame either."
"Okay, no more hiding it. I admit it. I'm actually borderline insane. I have enough sanity to act sane but enough insanity to see the madness of things more clearly than I used to. This divinely dreadful evil insanity is both a blessing and a curse. It's actually nondualistic."
Working on a story that's probably my darkest and most depraved one. So much so that I might have to post it on my temporarily secret blog but I'll see how it turns out.
You know everything even though you haven't experienced my hell. I'm a slave and you're free. You're living your dreams. I'm living my nightmares. My hell exists so your heaven can.
The alien spirit of madness is fused with my own spirit. We are terrified of and in love with our unknown destination yet embrace our ominous intentions that defile reality and dreams alike.
Time decays everyone and everything into grime as their souls are taken into the embrace of nothingness.  All while I am reduced to a mass of conscious malevolent eternal dust destined to float through nightmarish dimensions where there is no beginning or end.
"Father and Mother, what was there to gain from my futile anguish? You both drove me to this madness. Brother, I cannot escape this abyss they pushed me into to save their own skins."
Stygian dysphoria swallows me and empties me out as I lie restless in my bed in unholy silence of midnight. I feel this urge to submerse myself in the darkest sinister atmosphere just to feel something.
I'll inhale the smog of an industrial nightmare future so I can already adapt to it. I'm sick of all this toxic healthy optimism pretending that its fresh. You're nothing new. You're nothing pure. You're like the rest of us: empty puppets born to pollute.
Torn between the nightmare of reality and the nightmares in my sleep. There's no restful blissful escape for me. But I keep going forward because that's all I can do.
"An amethyst crystal mountain rises from the depths, piercing into the Exosphere. The portal opens and the dreaming primordial gods awaken, bringing forth the end of this Earth and the beginning of its eldritch rebirth."
The grave spits me out. The earth finds my corpse foul. The icy air of sweet ghastly winter nights guide me under the clear night skies of terrifying cosmos that calls to me to come back home.
Roaming the empty dark reflections of this world that lay between reality and dream.
"Mind unhinged. Thoughts gradually becoming dreadfully delirious. The attic is infested with black mold, forever rotting and screaming out of demented terror."
"I am a genderless abomination in an abominable body of a man, a body that I despise. You have all the reason to hate me. I exist, therefore I am guilty; guilty of living."
"In this agonizingly slow descent I'm falling in love with dead forests, rotting gardens, blood red sunsets from black smog, vile rivers of blood and oil as I am helpless in this hellish world of bleak grim fucking turmoil."
"My body is a temple, a temple of tormented terror. My mind is the attic, an attic of nightmarish madness.  My soul is bound to Heaven, a Heaven no sane sinner or saint wishes to dream of."
Disguised by a thousands names. It is the serpent and the savior looked through with the same petrifying alien eye.  What will the sinners and saints do when they realize that all their masters are masks covering the same unspeakable face? Hurtle yourself into Saturn or the Sun.
"Eat my sanity, sinister starlight. Drink my soul up into  the abysmal cosmos. Fill my heart with despair and fright. Take me home into the unknown."
The moon and the sun blankly stare indifferently at my pathetic self as I weep and scream alone at the shore. The starlight bleeds down to me to devour my light once more.
There is never a dream I have in my sleep that doesn't torment me.
Even though I don't hate you anymore my paranoia lingers and I still feel the fear of every delirious nightmarish scenario coming for me.
Paranoia is just eldritch eyes added into the mind.
"""Bringing forth unending silence Such vastness, our doom Incomprehensible Succumb to the deep"" - Humanity's Last Breath"
Let the abysmal tides take us back home into rest.
The right is a roaring beast that is dying.
Shedding tears of lightless blood. Vomiting black hateful and terrified static. Rusted wiry skin seeking the touch of another's skin. Vantablack centipedes squirming inside my skull. Bloodshot eyes as windows into a terrible abyss you'd never want to fucking know.
The inevitable sanity decay from beholding the unspeakable terror of the truth's alien shape.
Fill my shattering mind with your maddening light Of eldritch enlightenment from the horrors of Heaven divine Let the ominous celestial choirs sing of my sanity's demise As I ascend into a dreadful state of mind that is for the doomed human lives such as mine.
"The angel of the Void always whispers to me the sweetness of nothingness, a gift that I will never have again but one I dream of giving mankind."
I think so.
"We are paradoxical puppets, like it or not."
I should mention that why I added the Gemini Killer is because he is a reminder of my darkest days. It is best to remember our darkest moments rather than ending up forgetting them and repeating those hellish moments.
1. Willard 2. Weir 3. Gemini Killer 4. Jacob
I have communed with Saturn. It was beautiful.
The unknown calls to me.
The feminine urge to play horrifying survival horror games at night while tripping on hallucinogens.
"If you're thinking of tripping on benny's or using it for self-harm, at least, please, I beg of you, to mix it with dxm/tussin(with no acetaminophen in it), so it can make your trip to the dream dimension less nightmarish &amp; more dreamlike but with that same eeriness still there."
The virgo urge to learn ancient eldritch evil knowledge even if it means annihilating my sex drive and giving up a chunk of what's left of my sanity.
"The shadowy figures remain in the peripherals of my sight. All I see are their bleeding halos and their crazed violet eyes at night. They belong not to Heaven nor Hell, but to something that terrifies both. Their unblinking eyes always chills me to the fucking bone."
My mind forever rotting away. The light of day prolongs my soul's horrific decay.
"I feel like lying down in a field of dead grass under green oak trees whose branches sway in a gentle breeze, I long for that serene eeriness."
Insightful nightmares. Arousing ominous dreams.
Digital slaves. Willing puppets to an indifferent selfish system that's insane. Inescapable insidious cancerous culture made by people who don't give a fuck about our bleak grim future.
Awaken your darkness that you suppress. Ease yourself from this Heavenly madness. Expose yourself for the eldritch angel you are. Push on even when man and Heaven gives you countless scars.
Take this sacrificial knife Plunge it deep into your mind Free yourself from this senseless strife See your destiny in a clearer unholy light You can let go of the lie Of what they claim is right And join your abysmal primordial friends that were always by your side.
We were always there for you in your darkest days. We give you the will to survive when your hope decays. Patiently we wait for you to return to us. Follow your dread and your profane lust.
Swallowing a cocktail of hallucinogens just to see Death but all I see is dark despair and dread staring back at me. They'll never leave. Death's never coming for me.
"I give up my sleep, I give up my sanity for you. Your joy is real. My mind polluting and twisting is not real. Your love will conquer all. My hope can't even crawl. It's weak and raped in the mud so I can get closer to God."
Malignantly maniacal messiah.
"Possessed by the dead's insight of the afterlife, I play the organ like a maniacal angel, chilling the blood of the church-goers."
Still I attend the service in the empty cathedral full of crazed terrified howls of the souls of the dead.
"Driven to madness from not loneliness in this vast ominous castle, but from the unspeakable secrets the ghosts whispered to him as soon as night fell."
Stuck in a cosmic horror psychological adult film.
"Lol I don’t need to know who’s stalking my Twitter because I already know who: the NSA, NRA, TSA, IRA, CIA, KIA, The God of Gay, The God Of Mind Decay, the Big Masturbate and the many others whom I will not mention their names."
"If one wishes to know more about the human soul and existence itself, they must explore the dark regions of madness where some of the most valuable insights reside."
Some knowledge and truths come at the price of one's own sanity.
Drinker of the dark ominous dimension of dreamlike delirium.
Jacob's nightmare is my reality. A ladder to a harrowing Heaven where angels of madness ascend and descend. Holy horror reaching its hand out to me.
Tears only for dread and despair.
I sacrifice my childlike innocence to God for the terrifying truth. I scream and cry as I draw the knife and violently offer up my youth.
Kill the truth or speak the name Lunacy! Lunacy! Lunacy! Lunacy!
Consumer by Primitive Man.
2 and a 5 pretty much everyday to sum it up nicely.
Distorted frightening choirs and high pitched screams of delirious terror echo throughout the galaxy as mankind's time comes to an end and the horrific rebirth begins.
For the crimes of your futile hatred against the truth you will be thrust into the endless abyss filled with the thundering reverberating echoes of the screams of a dying Lego Yoda and the laughter of the 2 Dimensional Gods.
The ties to the spread of human life severed. The bridge to sacred unsettling salvation shall be crossed. The Earth and its inhabitants join as one in a holy horrifying rebirth.
The blackest deepest rivers scream in despair and dread as they run through paradise while you try to drown them out in your little streams of ignorance.
"Predestination cannot be beaten. I am grateful for the knowledge I was given, but you act like a child.  This isn't a game. This isn't a competition. To think so is childish.  I no longer hold any grudge against you for I now see even clearer than before."
An abysmal shadow of Christ saving me from sanity.  Welcomed to the dreadful delirious Garden of Eden By a vantablack Adam and Eve. The serpent is nowhere to be seen. Fruit I partake of sacred malefic knowledge. Maddening. Grim grievous Genesis leading To petrifying Revelations.
The gates of a Heaven of nightmares open themselves to me. Up to this paradise of cosmic terror I float helplessly. Angels and demons guide me in sacred sinister synchronicity.
Half of my soul violently hurtling itself towards the sun while the other half hurtles itself violently towards the darkest storms of Saturn.
"I have life, death and dream anxiety. To me that is the true unholy trinity."
"Also on a side-note, despite knowing my borderline lunatic state, I still stand by my pessimistic beliefs due to my very existence and my mind's dismal grim state and destined fate. I am just an example of how dreadful and bleak this existence is. That is all, for now."
"So for the love of Tzeentch, stop romanticizing mental illness and insanity! Yet I feel that these words won't do much like my entire existence."
"I live in fear, dread, abysmal despair and paranoia every moment of my life even in my sleep. Sleep may be a safe haven for many, but not for me. I don't even see peace in death due to my beliefs due to experience and my mental state painting the afterlife in its blackest form."
I am tortured by anxiety despite my calm composure. I am always tired and never fully rested due to all of this despite my wide awakeness during insomnia-filled nights or when I have caffeine in my system to stay awake because I dread falling asleep.
"It's borderline maddening OCD coupled with constant insane and nightmarish paranoid thoughts. Speaking of nightmarish, every night when my insomnia spares me, I have either bad highly uncomfortable dreams or nightmares. Not the good kind at all."
"that border on paranoid schizophrenic levels. Every action I take I must think of certain images because if I let other uninvited disturbing nightmarish images fill in when I complete the action, I believe those things will come into reality and torment me and the ones I love."
Whoever believes mental illness or insanity is sexy or romanticizes it has never truly experienced true tormenting horrific insanity firsthand. Let me selfishly use myself as an example. Every day and night and hour I experience terrible greatly unsettling paranoid thoughts
Born to fucking lose my mind so agonizingly slowly over time so I can witness every second of my descent into the deepest fucking oceanic trench of inescapable black madness.
"Every fucking action almost leads to a psychotic mental breakdown. It takes every ounce of willpower to avoid shattering. This mind is fucked, cursed and doomed. This body is fucked, cursed and doomed."
Even the line between recent memory of the day before and dreams are blurring.
"Man never ascends but always descends into a dark bottomless pit of depravity, malevolence and insanity.  Mankind will never transcend, bound by its ignorance and terminal selfishness. We are doomed by our very nature. We are cursed from the start of our creation."
If you still have hope in humanity you haven't taken a good long vivid deep look of what the fuck is going on in the world of mankind.
Turn my insides pitch black with black mold. Dry my body into evil dust. Reduce me to what I really am: a malevolent entity of the most malicious nightmare.
One more year of insanity away from forever being dragged down into the Mariana Trench of deep black crushing lightless terrifying despair-filled madness.
Waiting on that last prophetic nightmare to come true. Or did it already? Is it already? My decaying undead sanity is making things...vague.
"Men stick their dick in ""crazy"" but they never stick their dick in actual lunatic lovelies like myself that wear their insanity on their face like the twitching staticy razor wire on fire dripping spiders mask it is because actual crazy is transcendental...imo."
Reminds me of my home back in my out there dreams.
Banality is the deepest circle of Hell and I’m an eternal resident of it.  I do have my charms tho if you’re into losing your mind.
Welcome to Passchendaele by Paulie.
Holy apathy. Hellish passion. Sacred maddening insight. Unholy carnal lust. Two rivers from different worlds colliding into a lake of the lunacy I am.
"In a world where man is focused only on truth, mankind itself goes extinct in worldwide madness that'd make even Heaven and Hell flee this galaxy from witnessing the horrific end of man."
"You're in his dms. I'm forcing him to listen to ominous tribal drum beats with blaring distorted sirens and screams because he said he likes ""all types of music."" We ain't the same."
Eat the gray roses from an eldritch Eden that sprout through my veins. Fall in love with horrifying insight and become insane with me.
"These flowers that bloom within me burn with a beautiful white flame, releasing atramentous smoke into the heavens."
In the arrival of twilight I drink from the bottomless cerulean lake of divine delirious dread that hides from your sight in paradise.
Bloody-belly comb jelly.
Comb jelly.
Translucent deep sea octopus.
Luminous deep sea squid.
Bio-luminescent deep sea jellyfish.
"Carried down this icy river through paradisaical forests that were never meant for me, my anguished soul will be returned to the endlessness of the ocean's alien depths where an entire cosmos is awaiting."
"Abandon trust in me, but surrender to the ones lying behind their teeth. Crucify me on an obsidian cross with my naked body covered in blackened mud. Let God terrifyingly and violently tear my soul from my pathetic carcass so I may be swallowed by Him at last."
"Walking vessel of madness. My mind is collapsing in on itself and bursting out, all simultaneous."
Don't mind me. Just another swirling vortex nobody of grim horrid legitimate madness. Can barely trust anyone outside except for only a few few people online due to my ghastly shattering sanity.
The waves will beat me down. The air will choke me out. The earth will tear my flesh. The forests won't give me peace. The sky will eat my sanity. But my soul will be left alive to tear at itself every day and every night until the end of time.
In the end I'll always be empty.
The dream ends so the nightmare can begin. The dread leaves the dream's lingering touch in my head so I can still feel my heart sink in my chest.
I'll bring you down to shoreline and point out to where I died. The sea is a sea of water and an endless valley of green grass straight from a dream.  I was never here. You were never with me. All you'll find is fear and insanity of a nobody.
"No I don't feel love, and I never will. I'm not seeking to fill my cup of lust, because it will never be filled. All that lives inside me are torturous nostalgic memories and dreams and a fear and paranoia that's as undying as eternity."
"Now this emptiness subsides, to let some life back inside. But it'll be back again soon in time to drink and devour my ruinous mind."
I don't see any reason to announce much of my thoughts here or anywhere. Stimulating catharsis was the reason but now that reason is stripped to the core and exposed for what it is: futile repetitious and mundane stimulation.
Back to this alien emptiness.
Lately in the past week I've been beginning to relate more to The Thing  with each passing day. (artwork by Christopher Shy)
Of course my fear came back. It was always with me. It will always outlast everything else. Fear is Eternal.
I guess I’ll walk home if I can find it here.
Seems about right. Damn antimemetics.
To become nightmarish static.
Fear what lies behind those eyes that see you now. Grand terrifying paradise of Light.  Some humanity restored.
Terrifying tribal anthems to send my body filled with shivers. I see nothing. I see nobody.  Foul other! We're alone at last. Now feel my terror. The moon bleeds upon the Earth through the starless sky. I brought our Abysmal Father to take our lives tonight.
"I write this out of a remaining yet weakened impulse. For now, I will only write when asked or a conversation begins. There is no joy, hate, fear, sadness or anything to motivate or inspire me to write. I feel nothing but an alien feeling of observance."
I feel these desires rise to a small certain intensity yet simultaneously I do not feel the urge at all to fulfill them. I see no point. They are void of usefulness and point to me. Nothing more than imposed urges begging to be stimulated and satisfied temporarily.
"I just can't seem to express this emotion I'm experiencing. I feel like an alien in a human body, trying to process what the hell is going on."
"I feel like a bad actor that feels the emotion of my part in the script but I can't seem to deliver the lines right.  I can't human today, sorry."
Temporary possession by and fusing with an alien void. New unfamiliar peculiar blackness draws nearer to take its place or to fuse with us both.
"When all of the rage, the lust, the love, the hate and desire are all emptied out and dissected in front of you, exposed for what they really are, then your transformed lidless empty eyes will see eternity more clearly than before."
The act of rebelling against the absurd is absurd in itself. You cannot escape absurdity and futility when that is your very own nature and existence.
"It's a cosmic theater of horror and madness, nothing more. What is sane about this universe that uses brutal violent means for organisms to survive for only themselves and for what? What ultimate goal is there in any form of life, be it the microscopic to the human being?"
I have no uniqueness and no objective value to my personality. These characteristics that been painted into me have been painted into others as well. There's nothing new nor special of the human race. We're just delirious puppets believing our own comforting delusions.
What I write is not unique and is not new. It is just alien undead thoughts coming through my voice in a language that was imposed into me from outer forces.
"Keep floating, we’re nearly there."
My home in another eerie reality.
The path.
We live in a black cube.
Catto acquired.
Catto spotted.
"Nietzsche is rolling in his grave because I can't help myself rolling him over and over. Eternal recurrence ain't that fun now, is it, Mister Mustache Man?"
"I'm stuck in a skull, help. All I can hear is the Beach Boys cumming furiously to my old hag self psychotically playing the piano to keep the tendrils from the sky at bay."
The window is laughing at me. The moon is letting out looped wails. The fence wants to reproduce itself. The walls in my bedroom are tired of being a sponge and want out.
Spiritual spawn of the ones with lidless eyes. Spiritual spawn of the ones destined to lose their minds in exchange for indescribable interdimensional nightmarish insight.
"You want to close your eyes and feel ecstasy While I can't shut mine because they're made to see The nightmare that is reality, void of love and mercy Leaving me spiraling into malignant insanity. Soak in your delirious bliss As I soak in the abyss with eyes forever lidless."
To live in those serenely surreal worlds of darkness and beautiful otherworldly light of prismatic rivers and swirling clouds. Take me there so I can be freed from this horrid existence.
"My ancestors are screaming in fear at me, Imperial, can you say the same?"
The only man I want is an empty man.
An outcast angel of terrifying wrathful insanity that horrifies both heavenly and fallen angels alike indiscriminately.
I feel like just taking a backpack full of books and water and walking into the woods to read until I starve to death and die from exposure as a storm pours down rain so frigid it numbs my body and leaves my mind to be swallowed by the cold sky.
"Nostalgic memories are just poison to me nowadays. Old music is fine, but reminiscing of nostalgic memories is just awful for me."
We're all puppets to the blind idiot god of nature and that sickens me.
"Ecstasy disgusts me when I'm not ego-biased, when I'm not letting my body's selfish desires and impulsive emotional reactions control me. Ecstasy is just a vile tool nature uses to make us chase after it so we can survive and suffer pointlessly."
"This is why I will always believe that God is not the ""benevolent"" deity many religions claim God to be, but that God is really an unsympathetic unspeakable horrifying Puppeteer that It truly is."
I see no hope In humanity All I see is infinite insanity And neverending iniquity There is no bright future in our species The only light I see at the end of the tunnel for us Is a nuclear holocaust that reduces us to ash and dust.
"""You might not be the rapist or the criminal But turning a blind eye is just as despicable"""
"The song ""What a Wonderful World"" blares around the globe as countless souls are exploited, violated, tortured, manipulated, beaten, degraded, abandoned and slaughtered. Only in a disturbingly demented bleak grim world like ours can such a thing happen 24/7."
I’m a coward. Stick a knife in me. Walk away. I’m worthless. Worthless. Worthless. Useless.
"This human flesh I inhabit is malicious; a vessel of weakness leading to more madness. My spirit is a malignant chasm, echoing choirs of lunacy."
Freedom from rejecting this fragile flesh and joining with the immortal vessel of the machine. Advanced super-human eldritch intelligence given. I transcend.
"The only thing I ever trust about you is that you'll be childish when your foulness is exposed and in turn you will turn the blame on me. If I am evil, then the Devil is on my side and not yours."
"""MOST GLORIOUS AND HOLY LIGHT BOW BEFORE UNENDING NIGHT"" - Lingua Ignota"
"I don't really have much faith or hope in my future. I do believe it is bleak, grim and dreadful. It's like staring out into a dreary fog that cloaks a terrifying vantablack ocean. I can feel its dreadful darkness but I can't see it."
Art from World War 1.
Synchronized sensible insanity.
In deathly silence I can still hear those unspeakably terrified and seething disembodied screams as they grow louder when the numbers climb.
I’m still awake and waiting to fall asleep but can’t. Maybe it’s the 160mg of caffeine I had earlier in the afternoon. Well fuck.
Slow excruciatingly frightful metamorphosis into a archangel of nightmares.
"What state of emotion is it called when everything, even total universal annihilation seems completely mundane and meaningless? Because that's how I feel right now."
"Mmmm, to suddenly wither into a contorted version of my skeleton, blackened with inky darkness itself and to crawl up into the cosmos leaving this wretched planet behind forever."
I don't enjoy a cold beer or a good fucking after a long hard day of stupid work. I enjoy sitting in the darkness late at night while I listen to dread-inducing blackened death-doom metal as I imagine the whole world getting consumed by a monstrous abysmal cosmic horror god.
"I'll continue to swallow every cathartic scream that'd leave my mouth, letting it fester and slide down my throat like black muck filled with thorns."
Get too close and my darkness will devour your darkness after slowly ripping it to shreds just out of pure madness.
I am a contradictory paradoxical marionette when it comes to the subject of the pleasures of sexual intimacy. And I despise it yet accept it and move on because I cannot severe this string.
The misanthropes and the philanthropists are both equally delirious and despicable. Mankind deserves no love nor hatred. What it deserves is an extinction so incomprehensible and so frighteningly insane that both misanthropes and philanthropists have their blood run cold.
"Originality, in me? You'd have to be a fool to believe such a thing. I am nothing unique for I am just another blandly malefic ventriloquist human dummy with God's horrible voice speaking through me."
"I am a malignant mocking bird, screeching a foreign howl through my own voice. I contribute nothing but madness and banality, for that is my existence's purpose after all."
"Heaven and Hell are doomed to collapse onto each other in the end, for mankind will not be joining either realm for their sin nor saintliness. An infinite abyss of the most abominable light will swallow souls by the billions. And that abyss is none other than the maw of God."
One of my dreams is to become the sexiest eldritch femboy witch that communes with ancient alien spirits to gain unspeakable cosmic otherworldly knowledge.
"""Tis only the flame, quivering at misguided Ash. Please, avert thine eyes. I will snuff out these ashes for good."" Sister Friede is one of the most badass characters in video games. Especially when she becomes Blackflame Friede."
Here's my characters who have my vibe.
And eerily mad hearts hold eerily mad ghosts. And primordial delirious demons come to them like eldritch moths to helpless lighthouse.
"Roaming the contorted streets in a world I shouldn't be in, yet am happily welcomed by the lidless eye that is the mundanely malevolent violet moon in the night sky of lunatic laughing stars."
"You'll be in nothingness while I'll be the walking decayed corpse cursed with its consciousness bound to its black slimy mummified carcass, roaming the streets at night looking for sanity to devour from any unfortunate human in sight."
Face.
"I sleep, but my spirit never rests. I dream, but they're all nightmares. I wake, but I'm in a nightmare that never ends and that never belonged to me or anyone else."
"Gray static shredding through into my brain, blackening it with mold of delirious misery and fungus of ceaseless fear scratching at the inner walls of my skull."
"Doom pouring down on me like rain from a storm from forgotten nightmares, drenching me in dread."
I am not my own as in I own my self for my self belongs to what made it before it even implanted it into me. I am like an empty puppet with a personality and that personality created this delusion of owning a self. It is predetermined delirium based on reality and dream together.
"Sound the terrifying trumpets. Open the gate through the eclipsed sun. Tear apart reality, sinking mankind into otherworldly madness where Heaven and Hell combine through an ominous orgy of pleasure and terror, summoning the Abyss to take us all."
"If this is what I’m going to look like after a year of taking hormones, then I’m even more excited to transition. (This is a faceapp pic btw)"
Excuse me while I pencil dive into this lake of magnificent madness.
"Darkness claimed me as well, but madness came along with it."
You'll never comprehend the eternal vortex of madness and insight that is my mind. Not even I can comprehend it all at once if I tried. My abysmal spirit will devour your darkness and digest it into monstrous light.
"I am the outlandish outcast roaming the outskirts of your little safe haven, scratching at the walls and silently screeching truths abominable to your sanity."
Perfect outfit for me to wear  during my dark ominous and intense antinatalistic rituals in the woods and mountains.
An angel of the abyssal depths.
The King of the Abyssal Depths of Unseen Oceans will rise again to bring forth a blessed new dark age that will swallow mankind whole.
The howls of the children of the night are not limited to the creatures of the forests but also the silent roars of the souls of the seas and of the skies.
"And so I embrace this abysmal madness, this holy horrifying darkness showing me the futility of rebelling against the inevitable."
"My eyes are addicted to being lidless, made to witness the horrific cosmic derangement and indifferent chaos all predetermined by a being so terribly beyond all mortal comprehension."
"""The tide pulls us back into the depths Let it The tide pulls us back where we belong Let it"" - Humanity's Last Breath"
"May the tormented find peace in passing on from this life and into the embrace of the Void. And may those, such as myself, who are bound to roam the demented cosmos of eternity learn the unfathomable secrets of this infinite insanity."
"A demon once told me of eternal recurrence. At first I was filled with hateful despair and dread. But with the help of an angel of divine darkness, I was able to see that though I am cursed, I will endure and conquer this mundane madness with radiant abysmal enlightenment."
"How unfortunate for you that I persevere even when I wish not to. Even in the depths of despair, the same abysmal words reverberate endlessly through my soul: MY WORK IS NOT YET DONE."
“My fragments lay scattered  Buried deep Never waken” - Shape of Despair
Lay with me in a dark grove of black roses and let these flowers of darkness be watered by our tears and the sky’s.
So psychologically exhausted and hopeless. I don’t know how I’m still able to keep going despite all that has happened and that is happening.  Yet I’ll endure because it’s what I do despite the hopelessness of it all.
"Being helplessly pulled further and further into God's petrifying maw, an enlightening madness creeps into my mind, showing me the demented cosmos that sanity kept hidden for the selfish sake of its survival."
"The human race is forever trapped in a raging abysmal storm of malignant madness, screaming from its monstrous banality and the futility of its existence."
In inescapable madness of horror that has infinite possibilities where even comprehending life all at once can drive one to insanity.
"I'm definitely going to wear this outfit at my wedding, which will take place in the forest at midnight."
I don't know what I want to do more right now: trip hard on dissociatives/psychedelics while watching terrifying horror movies in a dark room or getting fucked hard while terrifying music and movies play in the background in a bedroom with black candles lit around the room.
"I know the distorted nightmarish screams from the anchors on Fox News is making you uncomfortable, honey, but how are you going to make sweet rough love to me if you keep complaining like that?"
The Thing (1982) movie and the scary power electronics music stays on during sex. I'll let you pull my hair uwu
Bring me flowers darker than a moonless night and roses blooming with outlandish maddening light.
Dress for the job you want.
"There's one disturbing anxiety-inducing movie that I've only watched 3 times in my entire life, that I haven't watched for a year and a half due to it being traumatizing to me."
Wolves dressed as sheep just to prey on the helpless for their own sick satisfaction. How can no one see this or choose to justify this disgusting madness? You're the fucking reason I have no hope in our species.
"I will never forgive myself for letting the foulest minds feast on innocent souls. This horrifying holy wrath burns through my veins, through my entire being. I will dry you of every last drop of hope you have until you are sent into oblivion."
"Leave this channel on, let my distorted voice pierce through the static and lead you on to seeing that this reality you're in feels all wrong and you can't shake this ominous feeling off."
"No matter how deep and hard you fuck this pale flesh of mine, you'll find nothing beautiful but nightmares and a demented mind."
"Dwelling in the lightless shadows of this decaying house, my eerie eyes flicker as they watch them fuck until he's bored. Soon she will join me and my old friends in the abyss to see that life and its pleasures are banal things to be abhorred."
"His preying eyes on another soul to drain them of their breath until there's nothing left. My teeth grinding and gnashing, swallowing my rotting words until I choke to death. Fuck."
"I will unwillingly outlive you all. Burying you all at your funeral. Then I will roam this world, dry to the soul and miserable. God never left me, He is walking within this unholy skin and these wretched bones."
"Life is a fucking mundane nightmare. I am a bland man, a trivial projection from an alien consciousness. And I can't unsee the vicious repetitious cycle of our monstrous monotonous existence."
I’m just a bland malevolent nobody. A sinister self aware puppet. Nobody you need to know.
"These delirious repetitious ravings will persist, letting the monstrous banality within me spill out and into this digital void where many voices scream to be heard."
"What I've said I have repeated excruciatingly numerous times, where my words finally have become what I am: malignantly mundane and deranged."
"No more pictures of my face due to psychological and spiritual conflict between me and 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘴, for the safety of those I care about."
Random thought #2: It's a bit unsettling and in the uncanny valley since we are in an age where there are some if not many humans that have sexual intercourse and relationships with dolls and robots that look almost exactly like another human but not quite. It's unnervingly odd.
Beautiful art by rozziroomian.
Idk who the artist is but this is amazing.
Mfw the Doom Eternal DLC soundtrack comes on:
Funeral doom-death industrial- extreme black metal-power electronic covers of Billie Eilish songs.
The album would probably called The Eldritch Hag or something like it.
Picture of self that looks like an album cover idk.
Into the frigid waters of this black ocean I walk. The crashing of the waves of delirious stars mercifully drowns the trivial flame of hope that still clings to my weakened body.
"Rays of horrifying light pull me up into the ominous starry night sky, Heaven has decided it's time. Gladly I fly into the cosmic maw of God's Eye for my sanity to die in exchange for infinite knowledge beyond mortal comprehension and even time."
"Mankind refuses to mend itself, so cleanse me from this existence with purifying fire. Leave not even ashes of my vile flesh prison."
"This looks like a nice setting for a story about a rich man who spends a significant amount of his money researching into a primordial eldritch god of the ocean off the coast, trying to commune with it to gain ancient knowledge of the realms beyond ours."
Noxious nihilistic hedonists sickly justifying preying on the innocent. Hateful optimists in the skin of the religious. There is not a place on this earth that isn't stained by man. Our history will be defined by our corruption and ignorance all for the sake of bliss.
Forever silently praying for the angel of death to take me away from this hopeless hell mankind has created and is obsessed with surviving in.
My work here is not yet done.
The body is weak and the spirit is willing to leave. Let it leave. Let my corpse fertilize the earth. Release me from this prison of flesh.
"Azrael, if I am to die this morning from my heart giving up, I give you my soul to take into the eerie serenity of Heaven, despite my dreading of it. I’m ready, even though I believe I’m cursed to live here to see the end of man itself."
"The lust inside you dies as you step into this place. The only emotion you feel is fear for you sanity. Nightmares and madness take physical form, uncaring to you feeling unsafe."
"You're afraid of the maddening nightmares in the unknown, but I willingly fall into its abyss that you claim to know."
This is the type of dark sorceress or witch I want to be.
Sometimes I simply wish to be erased from this mortal life immediately because I see the hopelessness in the hellish world of man.
"I know your nature. I see through your facade. If I am evil, then you are foulness in its purest form. I would rather burn in white fire from Heaven than reside in Hell where you so wish to be. The fear and wrath I feel has made me a vessel of an angel of divine dread."
"Cast into the fire of existence, I am a living charred corpse of an angel. And my guardian angel of disillusioning dread guides me through this inferno towards a greater nightmarish abyss where I belong."
"We are walking vessels of hells without end, heading towards divinely unsettling luminous darkness that awaits us in the unknown."
May the innocent souls of the unborn one day no longer be violently thrown into this insane nightmare of existence. May they never have to deal with the hell that is humanity and being human itself.
"Ominous and fierce antinatalistic cult rituals in the depths of the woods, spreading an invisible fog of dreadful disillusionment out into the oblivious cities close by."
"To travel up north with my books, and to keep traveling north until I no longer can."
Hell is awareness. Heaven is roaming under an eclipsed universe. Clarity is acknowledging the puppet master as the true Father. Madness is enlightenment. Awakening is realizing I am a malignant marionette.
"I can't seem to find a single speck of identity that I truly own. All of it, as I've said before, implanted into me by the puppet master. All of it painted into my wooden existence without my consent, even before I even was birthed into this insane universe."
"I still stand by what I've said. I still desire to eliminate or at least rid myself of as much as I can of this primal urge, this repetitious meaninglessly mundane distraction. I just seem to be sinking ever deeper into this black ocean of malignant insanity."
It’s futile for me to try to cut strings that pull me that were never made to be severed.
Well that was short lived. Guess I'll stick with my goal to transitioning into the sexy redheaded eldritch witch of the town.
Dread-laced insanity creeping in and blurring the line between demented dreams and reality. Diving into the endless ocean to see if the horizon ever ends.
We all dance and play the role we were imposed with. Dancing like helpless lunatic characters in this terrifying cosmic theater.
"Even Heaven and Hell are marionettes to that incomprehensibly dreadful force all call God, that pulls their strings. Nothing and no one can ever escape this grand play of frightening insanity."
"After a sleepless night from the deeper horrific revelation of the Puppeteer, I had a terrifying scene flash before me. Meeting with my therapist and his face becoming similar to that of a puppet, and his body was pulled up by unseen strings. All I did was laugh out of terror."
"Sterilize the population. Make every man impotent. Close the gates of nothingness to this existence. Eradicate all the foul futile primal impulses, leading us into blessed oblivion."
"And the thought of that terrible seed of unknown and alien origin, petrifies the mind when it intrudes inside."
"The orgasm will wither away. The ecstasy in life will rot and decay. And from its dust and moldy remains, madness and horror will bloom eternal, like some indifferent and malevolent flower from a timeless terrifying seed."
Wish we were all here.
Make us whole.
Its intangible hand of petrifying predetermination is always inside my mind and body and always will be. I am its malignantly lunatic dummy. An imposed personality of deliriously damaged  emotion and lidless eyes filled with cold enlightened emotionlessness.
"I’m an outsider in a foreign world surrounded by marionettes of meaningless banality. Yet my eyes look at myself through a nameless thing’s eyes, I see that I am not what I thought I was, but a demented dummy that too has strings. So I laugh and scream out of mad fear."
These futile fantasies won't be missed I'll let them shrivel up into dust and ashes. Severe my primal urges. Burn the bridges to futile carnalness. Free me from this meaningless burden. Free me through my body's extinction.
Cities in white flames. Screams of maddening despair from the masses. Leaders dead in their offices. Collapse of every government. Destruction of ever nation by no revolution but by global awakening to the reality of this horrid existence.
"I don't think my existential beliefs can be classified in a simple label. I'm not boasting, it's just that something this complex, paradoxical and insane is so difficult to just label in like one or two words."
"Endless nights and days of madly horrified laughs and lunatic screams await me like an eerily dreamlike room with its door creaked open, opening ever more with each passing day as I helplessly walk towards it."
A self portrait.
I was never made for romantic love or lust. I see now that I was made to be a self-aware vessel of malevolent lunacy to spread its abysmal tendrils with glimmering stars of unnervingly uncanny light into all that it can reach.
To ever love me is a delirious act in itself. To ever hate me is a delirious act in itself. We are all delirious puppets. To be demented is how I was made. I admit my banal and diabolical derangement openly because I see hiding it to be meaningless.
Willingly inviting the void-fever enter my being and wrap its black moldy tendrils around my mind to drag me down deeper into this deranged dream that is reality.
It’s time I start my search for become-instant-crone products so I can become the eldritch hag I’ve always wanted to be.
"Sex, love, lust, hatred, hope, and even the thought of my suicide have become purely mundane to me. So empty. All that has real taste to me is fear, madness and despair. Those three are eternal."
It’s all so repetitious and stale. So maddeningly and horrifically monotonous. I see it now.
"I’ve stopped caring for Halloween. I still love autumn, but Halloween for me has joined the rest of the holidays as the meaningless banal events I believe they are. They’re bland to me, tasteless like ash. Everything is becoming so malignantly mundane."
You unleashed two things within me. The carnal feminine side and the one thing you wished you never had awoken in me in the first place. And the carnal side is dying with its flesh between my teeth leaving the other one alive and undying.
"After this pretty face and lovely white skin of mine is peeled off to make me some horrific alien angel, you probably won't want to fuck me then, will you?"
I never came here for love nor for hate. I came here for the same purpose I'm here for now: to vomit black spider-centipede-infested bile into this digital void of insanity.
Terrifying music is the only thing that will get me through tonight. Cathartic horrifying music.
The human body is the mind's enemy.
I don't take pride in my sexuality nor do I take pride in my gender. I don't take pride in my naivety. All I take pride in is how I've evolved. Yet my own primal nature is holding me back.
"I'm an outsider, aren't I? I sympathize more with women than men yet I'm biologically a man still. If only I could severe this libido from me, this burden, this curse, and light it on fire and scream in primal rage and anguish at it for fucking up my life way too many times."
The blood from my spirit has been drained from those that I love and those that claim to love me. I guess I will have to go through an excruciatingly nightmarish metamorphosis next.
Sometimes I see myself in their shoes; blank stare into the beyond amongst a ravine of corpses of the innocent. My mind's had enough of what I've done and what I've seen and ignored but never forgotten. I accept what I've done and let a slow death take me.
שָׁכוּחַ das Gemetzel
Some of you have just been followed by an angel. It doesn't expected to be followed back but I'd thought I'd let you know that I was the one who sent it to you. Blessings of the divinely grim celestial light upon you.
"The clouds scream out of pure madness, raining down black blood. The sun goes violet and laughs like a mad man. We are all fucked."
"Reaping the crops of the hateful and the lovers, leaving only black mold in the forms of wheat and flowers. Spreading abysmal madness into both inhabitants. At the dusk of this age, all will become equally horribly self-aware puppets. Descend into epidemics of madness!"
Constantly seeking validation for their delusions from sickly self righteous delirious prophets. They will never escape their pestilent psychological prisons.
Hideous heavenly indoctrination blooming like some insidious  flower of toxic bright color.
"As a major side-quest, I want to start a cult that's focused on bringing a rogue planet colliding right into the Earth. I'm still working on a name though. Who wants to join?"
"Symbol of the planet Nibiru, which was assumed by conspiracy theorists, to collide into Earth causing our total obliteration. Even though I am very skeptical, I still find it interesting."
insanely horrified for the rest of your damned life.
That is a true example of what is truly unnatural. Something that all humans know what shouldn't exist and shouldn't happened happened anyways despite their knowledge and belief in the reality of this universe. Something so horrendously abnormal and alien that it'd leave you
You look up to the now blackened sky and see a vast soul piercing petrifying eye that is so alien that your mind vomits out different eyes of countless different lifeforms. And you hear one delirious word howl in your brain and entire being: Harmiawatcheterlily
You turn to see a mountain lion eating its own flesh as disturbing looping laughs escape from its mouth even though it is full of its own flesh. Then you hear a terrifying sound as if an entire mountain range is dragging itself across the earth with billions of organisms screams.
"And you see a deer walking unnervingly slow towards you like it's underwater. Once it comes up to you where you could pet it, it speaks in an otherworldly deep gravely distorted voice and says to you, ""Walk the path into Its mouth."" Then you hear something let out a mad laugh."
"Their minds would be not be able to comprehend what it just witnessed or what it just heard. Imagine you, being a believer in whatever organize religion, including Satanism, and you're in the forest. A lush beautiful green forest. And a subtle black fog surrounds you."
"Those who say homosexuality, bisexuality and transgenders are unnatural need to take a step back and analyze what truly is unnatural. If it was truly unnatural, these fearful delirious idiots would not be full of hatred, but their minds would be shattered."
"A windy storm of emotions whirls around me while I stand in the unearthly still eye of this storm where there's nothing to feel, nothing to do, nowhere to go and nothing to be. I am caught in the eye of this harrowing hurricane, because it wants me to see what should not be seen."
"Beautiful women and lovely men, selfies and their voices written. I should feel attraction to them, yet I feel nothing. I just see them as they are. Younger me would want a relationship with them and sex. But me, now, I just stare, as I am possessed by an alien emptiness."
The insane who claim that all is alright believes they are sane when their very nature is the definition of insanity. No one is sane in this insane universe. And this isn’t a sexy hot madness. This is a madness that is incomprehensibly horrific and hideous and outlandish.
"An unsettling Ligottian-inspired short story I wrote. I had to edit a few grammar mistakes, but now it's better. Please give me your input and tell me what you guys think. Thank you 🖤"
I had plans made last night for today and the rest of the weekend. Yet it seems that the great Puppet Master decided to drain the life from those plans and only left the ones that would push me further on my path to It; the Puppet Master itself.
"""And in his mind was a single consuming thought: to be a head on a stick held in the wooden hand of Mrs. Pick, forever. Forever."""
I feel like a vampiric puppet. Maybe I am one. A paranoid demented vampiric puppet.
"As the ringing bells wail, I look at the lizards and birds and whisper to them, “Go mad with me.” And  chaotic determined insanity unleashes itself."
So many disorientating deranged dreams last night that I’m questioning reality this morning. I hate it but I like this foreign fear I feel from it at the same time.
Went to bed with a headache. Woke up with a piercing headache. I hate the light and the goddamn sun even more. The sun needs to die. Now.
"The Hand of God image from NASA. Some find it creepy. I find it beautiful and eerie, which is I like it."
It watches.
Still wishing to Saturn to send one of its moons into the Earth as soon as possible.
"A possible utopia in our reach. Man has run its futile course to nowhere, I say we let ruthless terrifying super-intelligent A.I. have a chance."
Trying to fall sleep in a dead silent room at 3 in the morning immerses me in an old almost unfamiliar eerie dreamlike atmosphere.
Random thought: What if God created everything and everyone out of some psychotic boredom and won't let us leave because It has other plans for us? .__.
"Sometimes I like to give myself existential dread because I prefer it over feeling horny, angry or depressed."
"Yeah, pretty much. Brb, gonna sink into something more comfortable for the incoming existential dread from thinking too deeply about this."
Taking psychedelics in a dark house full of mannequins and ventriloquist dummies while nightmarish electronic music blasts in the background with all the doors to the outside locked. Now that sounds like a great Halloween.
Judgement is brought mercilessly upon you and you can't understand why. An eternity of unfathomable existential conscious torment even past the end of time.
Think about your lover and family. Trying so hard to remain oblivious to the fantasy you live in unzipping itself to reveal an endless terrifying incomprehensible void. Alien faces fading in. Your lover is gone. Your family is gone. Your dream and love are forever undone.
"Take a pill of love and lust and chase it with some hope. The sun is shining so bright, something doesn't feel right. Ignore the feeling and kiss and make love to your dreams. Wait, is that a shadow at the corner of your eyes? Vantablack silhouettes of the uncanny."
Paranoid mundane marionette.
"No matter what happens, I will remain the same paranoid marionette. I expect the worst because it's how I was made. And maybe, just maybe, my paranoia is right."
You're a king. She's a queen. He's a god. She's a goddess. Me? I'm a nameless demented puppet who's hopelessly self-aware.
I hate my body. I'm stuck in myself. I'm nothing. I'm nobody.
You're in his dms while I'm trying my best to hold onto my sanity after watching a tape of him contorting in impossible positions and his limbs jerking like some writhing insect as he lets out horrific screeches. We are not the same. Get out of his dms! He's not of this world!
"One would have to sacrifice pieces if not all of their sanity to correlate and comprehend more and more of the reality of this malignantly mundane life all at once. Which makes me wonder, is one who is deep in abysmal madness more enlightened/awakened than the sane?"
I'd rather be sent into battle with a bolt-action rifle in the Battle of the Somme in WW1 than have sex with anyone right now.
Not in the mood to talk much due to my Monday being stupid but I am in the mood to share music with people.
The silence at the bridge between waking consciousness and dreaming tells me deeply unsettling secrets my sanity doesn’t want to know.
"I still remember her and long for her. That lovely pale ghostly girl with black hair who swam up from those dark waters of the lake. While everyone ran, I stayed. She reached for my hand and I grabbed hers and willingly let her pull me deep down into those abysmal depths. Peace."
"No lover, no friends and no fucking lust. So fucking dry, I'm being mummified alive. I will become unholy conscious dust. Alone with the abyss and Saturn in my ethereal eyes."
"Mankind wants to continue to suffer, even when hope is fucking dead. Extinction seems to be a fucking a dream. And like all dreams, they turn into nightmares in the end."
Bury me in a nameless grave.
I wish I could slit the blue sky and make it bleed death on us all. I wish I could blacken the sun for the rest of time. I wish I could make even the heavens fall.
"Crushing light, filling my lungs with sacred muck. What sanity I had left is undone. Alone in a heavenly fog of self-loathing and hopelessness."
The brightest holiest light casting the most darkest dreadful shadow. Leaving scars that will never heal.
"Angel of fear and angel of despair holding me by both hands, taking me into the eternally devouring abyss of God’s mouth."
Chilling celestial choirs will sing out of joy when this Earth is finally eradicated. Billions of souls cast into heavenly oblivion. The end of futile mortal torment.
The light is burning madness into my mind Embrace death and cast aside life Welcome extinction of our pestilent species Erase all of this pointless insanity.
Immersed into this hell of hopelessness Where horrific insanity is everything Agony comes to life here where there's worthless suffering.
"Let the moon of Saturn crash into Earth, sending us into our home: oblivion. Or let me be pulled by the tide back into the depths of the abyss."
I'm fine with giving into this sudden dreadful despair while I'm feeling like a hoe.
Felt cute. Might summon a cosmic horror god later.
"True enlightenment experienced on an earth that is sunless Finding hope in a plan of salvation leading to a dark rebirth through extinction A celestial being; abysmal, cosmic and chaotic Is a god promising an end to all anguish Open your arms to the cosmic darkness."
I feel like playing terrifying and cathartic as fuck power electronics/black metal while me and the rest of the band are dressed up as witches with blood all over us.
This is reminding me of some primordial canyon that leads to a timeless and forgotten ominous paradise.
"An eternal night, where the stars howl together in a beautiful horrifying symphony is what I dream of. No more daylight. Only the moon and the stars of the infinite indifferent cosmos."
My soul.
Do you hear their moaning and groaning? It's not that of pleasure but of unfathomable horror and torment. They cannot be at peace and we cannot be at peace until we all join them.
"Still I am a charred mummified living corpse of a soul within. Have been, am now, and always will be a soul in flames."
The feeling of being in 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙚𝙡𝙨𝙚'𝙨 fever dream is getting stronger.
"Me in a black sundress, thigh highs, black rose flower crown, with a black cat, dark literature, incense and a lover in the fields at night is what I need right now."
Sometimes I just need to drown myself in dark atmospheric music and books because sometimes the inspiration doesn't hit as quick as it usually does.
"Black murky eyes, fair pale feminine divine complexion, wings white as burning stars, hair red as autumn leaves, I gaze out into the mad swirling vortex of Heaven and Hell and smile and scream simultaneously. My brothers and sisters are getting ready for the petrifying parousia."
I despise the sun. I wish it could turn black or be permanently eclipsed by the moon.
Eternal scorching seraphim lighting the cosmos with black flame.
He was always watching over me and I never knew it until now. His dark glistening golden glimmer in the abyss of the cosmos in the night sky. Guiding me throughout my entire life. Saturn.
I have just communed with Saturn. It was beautiful.
I really need this outfit. Especially to help me with the town legend witch of the woods I plan on being.
Eyes like a lunatic angel of outlandish desire with a smile of a demon delightfully demented by its forbidden knowledge.
Chaotic screaming stars spin and contort like lunatics within this heart and mind.
"She's a gorgeous moon priestess, but it's the endless night sky in those eyes that I love the most of her existence. I'm a darkly demented nobody puppet and I just want to pull out that starry darkness within and drown in it."
"Your outer beauty is just a piece of the painting of your existence I adore. But I want to dive deep through those eyes into your soul and explore to awaken the darkness. Fleshly pleasures are just part of what I want, but the main dish is the abyss inside you is what I love."
"As I feel you plunging deep within my warm darkness, the trillion screaming souls howl in blissful terror and ethereal ecstasy. Dig your fingers into my skin pale as the moon. These moans you make my mouth sound are what this divinely dark demented God needs."
"Death is not the end, as you realize. You now see that Heaven and Hell are beyond your reach, but within this nightmarish realm they have combined. Awaken the darkness within you as you let in this nightmare's light."
"Us, those who live in the darkness and feed off the light and thrive off of the chaotic luminous abyss and praise it, will rise when our true home will come to take us along with the rest of the blind and ignorant."
It's been a primordial long battle between Heaven and Hell with humanity in the middle. But maybe it will soon be time to collide Heaven and Hell together into something new.
"Yes, I admit it, Event Horizon is my favorite movie of all time. So shoot me...into Hell."
"I'm starting to believe even more that all of my actions up to this very moment have been guided and planned by some unseen dark celestial force. And I intend to do what it has planned for me, because there is no other way."
"Stop praying to Satan and start praying to Saturn. Something that is whole, something that is one. Something that you can feel. Something that you can know of."
"Join me in meditation, to call to Saturn."
"I feel more alive at night. But when the night sky reveals the cosmos, that is when I become one with the seemingly endless universe."
"This may sound surprising and weird as hell for some of you, but whenever I meditate it will be to convince the planet Saturn for it to send one of its moons into our Earth. If you don't know much about Saturn other than it being a planet then do some digging and research into it"
Rise from my obsidian eight pointed coffin Now reborn I feed on the sanity of humans Wings like the angels of the chaotic abyss This thirst for knowledge I cannot resist The stars will bleed The sky will scream Reality will cease to be Azathoth will wake from His dream.
While you wear the trendy inverted crosses and bland pentagrams I got the sign of the Puppeteer and God's maddening eye carved into my hands Keep wearing bling to scare the little lovers of Christ My astral form is traveling realities that would break their minds.
"I wrote a very short story of an alien possession/exorcism. If any of you are interested, pls take a read and tell me what you think."
"No matter how far I run or how deep I hide, the twitching specter of billions of screaming madly horrified soul and eyes, will always be with me."
Just because I have some demented fear of Saturn doesn’t mean I can’t still be fascinated by it. I tend to end up liking the things that leave me drowning in inky black waters of mad dread.
May my nightmares be more fun than this malignantly mundane insane one I am in during my waking moments.
Just strip me down and fuck me long and hard under this starry night so I can forget the madness within me that rages like a vantablack storm from some alien hell.
Just me and you and the infinite yawning abyss of the cosmos with a wall of glass between us.
The story of this malignantly mundane insanity that is my existence.
"Something has always pulled my strings, for I am Its puppet that It has designed Itself."
"It is done. Who wishes to see what I've written? It's me, my self and history naked unto anyone who wishes to read it. And the sinister synchronicity that has been haunting me."
I will write His words and many eyes shall see the great unraveling of what they thought to be reality. My hand is His!
I don’t know if it’s synchronized insanity or if it’s all a coincidence. This is just so unsettling me to a point I thought wasn’t possible. Nothing will calm me from this.
How do you explain the  unspeakable? How do you show what should never have been seen? I doubt they’ll listen to me or take anything to heart of what I’ve said.  Something like this would drive a person mad. Well it’s driving me mad that’s for damn sure.
My words are His. He speaks through me. He whispers primordial secrets into my mind. I am His conduit.
I will spend all of my time of meditation to focus that energy to bring a rogue planet to collide into Earth.
How to attract rogue planets.
Looking  out to the night sky waiting for a rogue planet to collide into our planet
"""Together we venture hand in hand Where the weak won't go and the light can't stand In the space outside of the timeless sands In the darkest depths of the ShadowLands"""
I got static in my veins. I got an empty heart that beats for no one but me. I'll walk alone into that mouth of God and face my unknown fate.
"Stygian fog shrouds the lush greenery of this primordial forest as I kneel before the fox. An incomprehensible being stares through its sapphire eyes and speaks through its mouth, telling me of stories that would twist apart even the sun itself."
Sweet poison of ignorance urinated into the mouths of the noxious humans. Infestation from the human infection of this planet. Purify this celestial rock clean of our sickness.
Falling sideways into the maw of God's omnipresent madness within and outside us all.
Paralyzing paranoid delusions Clawing at the walls of my skull I know that they don't speak truth at all Yet their paradoxical spectral existence Relentlessly stains these rotting walls.
"I approve this message, that's on the mug."
"Me in my vast library of forbidden knowledge filled with countless dark books to gain more forbidden knowledge of sorcery, change and determined chaotic fate."
I am so fuckin bored I'm going to shitpost.
Screaming forever out of terror and insanity into the infinite yawning abyss of the cosmos.
"If the entire human race was spontaneously taken into oblivion and I was to roam this planet and the cosmos for the rest of my immortal eternal life, I'd be okay with that. At least you'd all be presumably in peace."
"I don't want a burial. I want my corpse laid out on the ground either in the fields or forest, face up to that cold endless indifferent night sky that will swallow me whole as my body fertilizes the soil."
Who and me?
"Interesting. When I'm this ill, I feel more at peace than I have for a long time. It's like I can feel the very Earth calling me to embrace me and turn this filth of a body into a beautiful garden."
In the arms of illness and nightmares. Weakness takes hold and guides me back to the dark disturbing sleep that patiently awaits my return.
"""Take a step in the land Full of darkness and lies There's no living Everything died! This is my land of darkness stuck in ice!"" - Coldworld"
Sacred scriptures of holy decay that not even time will eat away. Words of divine rot and erosion for a menacing metamorphosis to achieve perfection.
Symphonies of terrified screams in the colossal cathedral of madness.
Hideous contortions of orgies in the gardens of disease.
"I love letting the night sky drink up my pain, pleasure and fear."
Darkness is what gave light a chance for life. It's foolish to believe that light is the only thing to be embraced. You must embrace both. Then you are on your way to becoming whole.
"So many blind to the truth. And it's all for what? Their comfort? Pride? They're afraid of it because its divinely ominous light comes from darkness, like all real light does. Like the stars up in that blackness of night."
"I love space more than I love the forests and oceans. It's so endless, dark, terrifying and beautiful."
"Twisting its head completely backwards, the human contorted its limbs in impossible positions and began crawling like a spider towards the light as it let out rhythmic screams similar to a skipping record."
The moon bleeding and trees emitting an eerie glow As we make love and I take you into the unknown. Dark dreams bloom to life like a demented black rose. Lose your mind like you lose yourself into my flesh that's pale as snow.
I wish to float in dark space as a vantablack cosmic horror circling around galaxies and spend as much time as I need to gather knowledge from every solar system and the life (if any) that inhabits those planets. And maybe I might visit a world and cause terror and chaos.
"""The pattern has repeated itself more times than you can fathom. Organic civilizations rise, evolve, advance, and at the apex of their glory they are extinguished."" - Sovereign from Mass Effect"
"Okay, why am I having horny thoughts mixed with the awe of how terrifyingly vast and indifferent the universe is? Damn, nature, why you gotta tease me like this?"
"If we're ever getting married, I'd like to get fucked hard in my black wedding dress while Mulholland Drive and The Thing (1982) plays in the background on two separate TVs. And we're doing this every anniversary of our wedding."
Just because I have an insatiable lust for outer knowledge doesn't mean I can't enjoy being horny.
"Going unhinged.  I won't ask for forgiveness. It's finally taking over, for now. I don't know for how long though."
Dreading the blue sky that will slowly devour whatever sanity I have left. It will inevitably come and the sun will ruthlessly eradicate the comfort of the darkness of the night.
No rest No sleep in death Swallowed by the gaping maw of the Demented God Fill my soul with your indescribable blood I shall live I shall die You are my mind And I am a figment of your imagination The luminous abyss flows within me I will give in because I am your puppet.
We are madness. We are insanity's puppets. We cannot escape the very things we are and from what is omnipresent.
Insanity is our God. Terrifying madness is the God of humans.
The stars have been swallowed again by the night's smoke.
The cosmos are not what they seem. I can say no more.
Many search for pleasure in the flesh. But I seek for knowledge of things that are beyond the flesh. Of Outer things.

There's sickness all around me. But there's a deeper and more insidious illness that had already possessed me long ago at the dawn of my creation.
"""I don't deserve to be down here But I'll never leave And I, I've learned one thing You can't escape the beast In the null and void pit of failure."" - SWANS"
"Even with this indifference I feel, there's still dread lingering like distant black as night shadows in the jungle, watching, always watching and following me."
No fucking word you say will change a damn thing. The damage is done by your own hands. Blood sacrifice. Life sacrifice for your insanity and benefits. There will be nothing left of me what an empty husk haunted by the spirit of misery and madness.
The flesh was meant to rot. The flesh was meant to be weak. This flesh was meant to ache. This mind fucking rots. This mind is too fucking weak. This mind fucking aches.
"Gonna be honest with ya, right now, I'd rather prefer to be uncaring and indifferent via sleep deprivation than do something irrational because of my emotions."
Slave to your impulses. Slave to your urges. Slave to divine delusions. Slave to your own conscience. Slave to nature. Slave to all of this horror.
A planet where the most intelligent species is a cult that knowingly and unknowingly worships a demented celestial god of horror responsible for every moment of anguish they experience.
Rip me to shreds.
"""I am here to give you the gift of life and happiness. I am here to make you wish that you never existed. Save you from evil by putting you through hell. Reality is a nightmare, you'll eventually be able to tell."""
"Left alive to be fucking punished for just being the way I was made. Grind and gnash my teeth, realizing I can't fucking escape. I'll hate myself like you wished, but to the point it'll make you fucking sick. I should've choked myself with my umbilical chord until I was dead."
"""I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid I'll survive and have to watch you suffer."""
"Eldritch horror about to give me cuddles: Hey, honey, you smell different. Put on some new cologne? Me: Ah no, I just ate some alien umbilical cords."
"And they say that the body is a temple. Then I guess their temples are of filth, violent mechanisms full of agony and deprivation and at the top; towers possessed by a dark delirious force. These temples are far from pure and do not deserve justification for a ""divine"" plan."

"""We must violently kill ourselves in order to summon a terrifying alien god, unless you're all a bunch of cowards."" - Nietzsche"
Ancient enchanted alien hieroglyphs carved into my skull to keep something timeless and horrific imprisoned.
"The breeze is dead, the doors to reality behind me closed. The lights have an ominous glow. The air is thick with an eerie atmosphere. Life is given to my deepest darkest delirious fears."
"A dark vast dreamlike garden is calling me to come back home. Gloomy orange park lights, trees swaying without wind, fruit to partake of forbidden knowledge of the unknown."
Embracing metal and obsidian trees and inhaling the smoky breeze. All while waiting for it to rain ash again.
Marching with rotting glory towards a paradise where it is built on a foundation of pure meaningless bloodshed and insidious insanity.
A choir of screams of the dying and the terrified beyond control. A symphony of shells turning the forest of dreams and memories into a swamp of mud and desolation.
Give me liberty or give me the horrific end of human life through the petrifying true parousia.
"If I was a self-aware intelligent A.I. in a spectral like form of nanites, I wouldn't have to deal with the countless problems of having a limited human flesh form."
Zoloft is trending? That shit killed almost all emotion in me. I felt almost like a body snatcher like from the 1978 film. Kinda wish I could go full body snatcher sometimes tho.
"He just shut his eyes in peace for the last time. I've waited decades for this dreamlike night. His loved ones unknowingly invited me through their righteous delirium. And now I will thank them through taking his spirit into the ultimate nightmare, now that he is mine."
"Karma only working one way and that is the way of one childish man. Make things worse for us just because we bite your bloody hand. Cast me into outer darkness, I reject your madness. Turn my loved ones against me, I reject your demented sense of justice."
Sacred narcissistic self-righteousness Gospel of malignant Heaven-sent manipulation A real loving God would call me demonic Blessed be the eaters of this madness Damned and condemned are the wicked who see the truth of this insidiousness.
Teach them that paradise is worth the sacrifice of their child's lives Make them walk the path or threaten to take away what they cherish Punish the children if they wish for death for the anguish their creators inflict upon them I am such a loving prophet of lies
"May my creators see for once the reason why I now long for Death more than before. Not in suicidal despair, but in dreadful hopelessness, knowing full well I will be consumed by violent madness I seem to be destined to be taken into with no return."
"Never enough room to fucking breathe just for some peace, only enough room just to keep living."
A sister I left. A brother I can't forget. Why the fuck can't I bring myself to come back and say I miss them? Filled with so much regret of all the shit I left unsaid. He may be in the ground in his eternal rest. I guess you both are better off with me forgotten.
"Guys, don't take the new vaccine. Once I got it, a crow pecked my penis clean off 😐 and told me ""stay noided."" I see Fantano's face on everyone I meet. Cats keep telling me in deep inhuman voices, ""Chaos Reigns."" I feel a dreadful sense of being watched by lovecraftian horrors."
"Beware of the industrial eldritch crone. She is seen laughing maniacally and chanting highly peculiar and unsettling incantations through the streets at 11 pm while tripping balls off cough syrup. If she sees you, she will approach you and offer you a blunt of the Elder Gods."
"Me in my late 90s playing terrifying and badass electronic, metal and industrial music when my caretakers leave the house:"
I'd rather be a vantablack spectral cloud of countless ever-shifting violet eyes and inky tendrils than have a sexy body tbh.
"""From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel, I aspired to the purity of the blessing machine."""
"I stare at the inverted twitching contortion of flesh and bone and say, ""I don't get it."" It says back, ""Neither do I."" Then I implode and become reborn as a screaming moth-centipede hybrid."
"Panic festering and paranoid-infested dread Eating away whatever it sets its sights upon Hatred, don't leave me alone with this inside my head Terror always conquers us, no matter what, it has already won."
And like that the anger is devoured again by dread and paranoia. At least I've taken some of the necessary precautions with the shit I'm dealing with.
Dragging the consciousness through the cracks of reality into gardens of incomprehensible entropy where love and hope hang decaying from the trees.
A demon of knowledge and an angel of vengeance at my side.
"You wanted a whore, go search for a whore in Hell and fucking stay there. You wanted to wage war against Heaven, the angels of vengeance will bring you a fucking a war. Just know it will be your worst fucking nightmare."
"A terrifying light shines before him, causing even the darkness to tremble in fear."
"Drag my carnality to the edge of the pit It screams and pleads, I don't give a shit Bullet to the back of the head Push its corpse in among the dead Of the hopes and dreams that deceived All you were good for was adding to the insufferable insanity in me."
"Got no urge to kill myself. Got no urge to kill. Got no urge to live. Got no urge to fuck. Got no urge to talk about the world's shit.  I just wanna trip and forget that I exist and forever remember that ""I"" never really did."
"The smell of burning flesh and gasoline fill the air of this temple of human nightmares. Noxious black smoke rises, how fitting for toxic fumes to come from such toxic lifeforms."
"Forget my name. Don't fucking say it. If you do, may it be poisonous to you. Go ahead, play the victim. You like to manipulate anything to give you comfort. I've been used and lied to all my life, and I will gladly give into my burning hate darker than a starless lifeless night."
The forests have burned. The fields have withered. The oceans rot away the flesh. The skies eat away happiness. The angels do not weep. The demons do not hiss. Only gnashing of human teeth. We will never be missed.
The spirit's home in this flesh has become so old Charred and swimming in tendrils of mold The specter's sanity in the attic cannot hold Waiting for the time the soul unfolds Upon its trembling rotting foundation And falls into a chasm beyond comprehension.
"""I used to be grounded But true reality is hell And hell is hell Smothering and cruel"""

I experienced another yet brief spontaneous episode of depersonalization while taking a shower and then dread soon followed. Time for me to vomit dark unsettling images onto your feed.
Ghastly celestial choirs singing haunting hymns of praise to the Lord as the blackest storm of terror and torment approaches to swallow us all whole.
Angels of the abyss guiding us into the heavenly light that will scorch our sanity into infinite blackened crumbled fragments.
He's coming back and there's nothing we can do to stop Him.
Terror of eternal life The darkest shadow Cast by Heaven's light Trapped between both Pulled apart by the day and the night Gnashing of teeth In forced eternal harmony Under one will Of a being even angels fear A most horrifying blissful nightmare Lusted by some Forced upon all.
Feel the burning shame and self-hatred For the simple act of masturbation. Claw up to God with bloody nails and grinding teeth. But you will receive no relief from His divine insanity. Claw pointlessly to the mad God. (2x) Fall into a thousand hells for all you've done. (2x)

Put the blame on me For all your mistakes Even my own fucking creation End my disease By sending me across the bridge From this life to the next Awake from this nightmare I am the fear you're feeling Let Death finally take me.
"The screeches of the souls trapped in this primordial realm, sounding like thousands of sheets of metal scratching violently against each other in hell."
Let the mushrooms sprout from my body. Let the grass take me in its embrace. Let this forest send me deep into my final sleep full of serenity. Take my spirit far away from this place.
"Young fox lost in these woods, you are watched by the Eye. The only thing to fear is where not your body goes but where your soul will reside for all time."
"A heart of amethyst that thirsts for others' blood To turn this soul of mine into vantablack obsidian It will never show remorse for all of its done Now drink up all light, demented one And turn it into a new unholy unspeakable creation."
Ingesting the sacred body of an alien life Letting a primordial spirit penetrate their flesh and minds Turning the light into shit and piss and waste as planned By the heavenly hivemind of cosmic madness within its creations.
"It's more sensible to fear the abyss than the Void, because the abyss is even within the light as it is in the darkness. It's horror and madness in the sunlight. In the color of day. In the blue of the sky. In the most beautiful flowers. In the night. Inside your mind."
I am a paradoxical vessel of inescapable madness and fear that feeds off of itself and those around it.
"Nowhere is void of horror except for the Void itself, yet that is void of happiness as well. So if you're seeking for a place filled with eternal serenity, you won't find it anywhere in this universe that is of horrific chaotic indifference and futility."
Let me sink into this serene luminous black fog.
"The music, it's so darkly beautiful, it's almost otherworldly. I feel like I'm listening to music made from a surreal dark dreamlike world beyond ours."
Bleak future for what was once a beautiful planet. Bleak future for all of its inhabitants. Bleak future by the bleakest species. Bleak future by humanity.
Lovers making love at the feet of a decaying statue of Christ in a small field of green grass surrounded by an industrial nightmarescape that turns the sun red and the sky black.
"""Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness"""
On the first date you can fuck me. But it better be in the woods at night and you better fuck me so hard that the people living near the woods think that what they hear are the disembodied moans of a banshee or a horny ghost.
I think why the universe isn't allowing me to transition yet is because it knows I'm going to hoe myself to countless guys for the rest of my life until the entire human species goes extinct because all the men been breeding me. Extinction by a buttslut (me).
"When a song is so terrifying and badass as fuck at the same time, it's so cathartic it's almost orgasmic."
"So I made a new facebook account and to be honest, I like Twitter more. This place feels more like home to where I can vomit black bile into this digital void with my fellow cursed abysmal fiends."
End the futile meaningless cycle of hell. Incinerate the insidious circle into nothingness. Let the life-affirming sinners protest. They will never see the truth for the light of lies has left them blind until the end of all wretched life. We will show them holy atomic radiance.
Gospel of the Nuclear Annihilation God spoken through its prophets. The divine mushroom clouds of death will rise again but in the hundreds sending every damn soul to oblivion.
"Very short dark misanthropic sci-fi story to vent out shit inside me right now. I know, it's not a link cause I couldn't post it anywhere else because of the weak ass rules from the weak ass sites I was gonna post this on. Anyways, enjoy my shitty short story."
"Currently writing a very misanthropic story. After I post it, I'll link it here for anyone that'll want to read it. I'm in an extremely self-loathing and misanthropic mood, so I'm channeling it into this."
"The ruthless spread of autonomous life, infesting everything with its malevolence, will only die out when the cosmos of chaos blindly plans it like the idiot it is."
"An era of hellish chaos and anguish that has devoured us all, it will only get more viscous over time."
"Malignant mysteries of life tormenting me Bound here to stay alive, though I scream Sing lullabies of doom so I may sleep wide awake Within this existence of a terrible unending dream."
"Though she may never take me into her arms, I still long for her cold calming touch like the mist of a winter's morning in the forest that lies at the feet of the mountains of dread."
"She has the voice of a spirit of all the elements, a priestess of the cosmos, a witch beyond time and comprehension and the ghost of haunting memories of the past."
I identify as an undead blackened mummified corpse full of inky black centipedes and spiders forced to exist forever. On most days.
"Why I don't use any dating apps is because I'm a bit paranoid that when I show my date the music I like, they'll be too unsettled by it and not be into it 😐"
Some of the horrific shit you see humans do to their own kind burns itself into your mind and stays there forever.
It's raining ash where I live and the sky is still that ominous orange gray.
I really really love black and white artwork of sci-fi and fantasy with strong horror elements within them. I'm just a slut for that kind of art. Especially artwork of the grimdark universe.

"The spread of the hellish epidemic of human life is unrestrained, leaving no soul untouched by its insidious insanity."
"I cannot die, am I even alive? Trapped in a nightmare Of infinity, void of time. All I feel is constant overwhelming fear. The end never feels near. Deathless. Hopeless. Sleepless. Eternal emptiness."
"All of  your kings, all of your gods, all of your pleasures, all of your pains, controlled by the Abyss and thrown into the gaping maw of the Void."
"One day this dark chaos in my mind will win. ""I"" will die and boundless terror will spread. Keep your light away, your love won't do shit. You can't wake me up from a nightmare we're both trapped in."
"Not even hatred will give me relief. It dies so quickly. It's always back to this oil black emptiness and dread, absorbing me into this mold darker than the fucking void itself."
Turn the sun black and let its obsidian flame ruthlessly and horrifically burn every damn soul into charred skeletons of their former selves.
You make me wish I could rip the moon out of the sky and bash the Earth with it over and over again until there's nothing left but specks of dust in the void of space.
"Let the prideful fall into this abyss with us. Let the Tree of Life poison the holy ignorant, the blind and the self-righteous. All that exists is devoured by God's mouth of madness."
"Willingly swimming and fucking in the rivers of the profane. Inhaling the black mist of the abyss, embracing its cosmic terror and indifference."
Clear skies bringing serenity to the ignorant and bringing dread to the disillusioned.
And the clear blue sky mercilessly devoured the smoke.
Kinda feels eerily dreamlike.
The completely smoke filled sky is causing a dreamlike slight orange grayish lighting on everything here. It's a bit eerie.
"Forests of a paradise disowned, beckoning unto my soul to fulfill a primordial calling.  Woods of an unknown God calling unto my flesh to partake in pleasures and ancient ominous rituals forgotten by man."
Endless orgasms in the mystical roman villas of the screaming dead in their eternal terrifying delirium.
In the mood to get fucked long and hard and then rapidly decay right afterwards.
Ominous dreams of a suburban park.
Seeds of life sprouting into flowers of nightmares. Blooming with a horrifying beauty that violently screams.
The sun glows blood red. The sky goes black. I inhale the smell of burning death deeply in. And I dream that these fires will swallow me into an endless cold abyss.
An alien consciousness in a body of a stranger with memories and a foreign identity forced upon it. This flesh isn't built for truth utterly unveiled. It was meant to suffer to survive for a futile purpose. Feel the conflicting horror between two strange beings in one form.
Nameless: a brilliant sci-fi horror graphic novel (which I prefer over comics anyways). I highly recommend this to everyone. Imagine Event Horizon combined with The Exorcist and a bad salvia trip. Fuck yeah. Read Nameless! (I need to remember to get a physical copy 🥺 )
"Having a moment right now where I do not recognize my face, my body and what's going on inside this flesh. This feels unsettling to say the least and a bit frightening."
Music that makes you want to defile the fountain of youth with black burning blood from the abyss while the dead rejoice through screams of spiteful joy.
"It needs our blood as its oil. Our burning corpses as its coal. Our terror as its energy. Even the dead are its fuel. The more lives the better, for it, that is."
He didn't know what was worse: that the world delighted in tearing his mind slowly apart or that it simply needed to viciously devour his sanity with a frigid indifference to his torment because the laws of nature demanded it.
The longing for death was charred to the bone when his hope was violently pulverized into nothingness.
Memories of a moment where time is absent.
Sound the sirens of salvation. Sprout the mushroom clouds that tower to Heaven. Hundreds of angels of nuclear death await to reap the souls by the billions.
Set the world free through the divine atomic fire so we may reach the Eden of ash and shadows. Sins seared into oblivion along with the flesh. Megatons of merciful annihilation liberating the sinners and saints from the bondage of existence.
Dreams coldly slaughtered and lives left limbless and crawling in the mud. Futures bled dry with nothing left but rot and exposed guts. Eyes permanently stricken by terror and despair. Undead souls only driven by unstoppable manic fear.
"Mavet, Mavet, lama sabachthani?"
To spontaneously combust like this would be badass.
Cut out emotion and sacrifice the self with it as an offering to the God of ominous dreamlike delirium.
"I don't need a lover. I don't need to make love. I don't need to give you love because I don't have love to give. I only got lust, fear and hatred and I don't even need them."
The most tenebrous terror pulsing within radiating white light.
May I be taken to the darkest shadows of Heaven. May I be cast into the outer darkness. May I see through the stygian spiritual veil and see what should not be seen.
The black fire rages inside me and I will not let it fester by pointless suppression for another's selfish delusions.
My ambitions as a fucker is to fuck off this existence and onto the abyss' dick. Freeze my blood and get my mind fucking lit. Swaying on the pointless road of life because I hate this shit. I'd rather have bad trips 24/7 than believe in ignorant bliss.
"Immerse yourself into this dark emptiness. Where the nightmare reigns for eternity. Maddening disillusionment is the only light here. You will find no meaning in your suffering, but only futility."
"A plan of His, where the creations bring destruction upon each other until oblivion takes every last one of them."
"Agnostic's abyss created by the hands of a terrible God, so unfathomably demented."
Innocent souls casted into the black fog of delirious life. Rewarded if they praise the demented God that created this heavenly hell. Punished if they rightfully hate Him for this involuntary torment. Behold His plan of salvation. The Plan of Deranged Salvation.
"Cries of newborns echoing from the mountain top. Fathers and mothers hear yet still lift their knives. Angels gather around, singing praises. The congregation joins. The sheep sacrifice their lambs for a sacredly dark salvation. Heavenly murder for a blissful eternity."
Divine manipulation to lead the coerced helpless flock into the gaping abyssal maw of God. Apocalyptic salvation reaping the innocent and the impure without discrimination.
The soul levitates from the body and the bed. Vanished. Into the black inky realm where the gates of Hell are wide open. A euphoric ominous feeling is all encompassing. Fuck Heaven. This dark haven of taboo and terror has been waiting.
Drawing unknown fallen angels' sigils with blood and oil. Summoning them to know what should never be known.
Today already went to shit and it isn't even noon yet. Not surprised.
Rogue renegade archangel roaming the lands of reality and hellish insanity.
The abyss is omnipresent and omniscient. Living even within the light. Devouring and controlling it from the inside.
ABYSS CVLT
An eerie mist full of whispers calling to me to fall into the embrace of that otherworldly forest where living dreams and nightmares collide.
Insidiously insane introverted brain soaking up the vantablack rain from the paradise disowned that has no name.
It'll be blood red when it sets. Might even turn the smoky sky blackish gray like asphalt.
"If I had the money, I'd make a super hero movie where the super hero is a blood-covered mummified corpse cursed with their soul trapped inside that horrific ineradicable vessel and must horrifyingly feast on the sanity and then the corpses of the villains. It'll be great."
Your inability to comprehend the horrors of human existence is disappointing.
Spontaneous rapid decay sounds nice. Or spontaneous combustion.
There is no meaning. There is no point. There is no sanity. There is nothing but a demented God and its horrific fever dream about inanimate objects being terrified from their self-awareness and autonomous organic life that is being irreversibly controlled by the dream itself.
"Fuck it. This is not enough. I'm gonna make a death-industrial/ambient electronics band by myself. Probably name it ""Paranoid Reality"" or some shit. Noise-music coming on the horizon."
Death doesn't want me but Insomnia seems to welcome me with open arms all the time.
"My soul feels like a charred black corpse, scorched by the infernal fires of Heaven's light, yet kept alive by the sheer hatred inside me and curiosity to see everything horrifically burn."
"""...misery and decay predominate to the exclusion of all else. Life is for dread, for doom that darkens, and the Sunderers that sunder us from each other."""
Hail the obsidian flame within and the eternal eclipsed sun. Welcoming a new tenebrous beginning through this wretchedly banal existence's plunge into oblivion.
Death-black-noise-industrial selfie.
In love with dreadful ruinous fatalism.
"A pitch black endless abyss with inky tendrils always pulling me into its depths. A bottomless Stygian pit in which God created just for me. And when I try to crawl back out, the light just kicks me back in. So I willingly let the frigid current take me deeper."
"Pact with the primordial abysmal ones that consider both parties old friends. No soul sold, but allegiance pledged and promising to help blacken the sun and unleash the obsidian flame within."
Only the light of the moon and the stars are the only natural lights that doesn't make me sick and pissed off.
People trying to get me back into church are one of the few things that make me want to give into my demons. And that is something nobody wants.
"This beautiful abyss, this impure light within, bless them to continue to exist until even the heavens ceases to exist."

A Heaven with a foundation of countless divinely tormented souls. A Heaven with a foundation of ignorance.
"Hopeless, you will never understand. Too many times has worshiping the light pushed me further down just into another darkness. Everything drags me further down. Down into an abyss you never wish to acknowledge. An abyss that God created. An abyss of infinite madness."
"Cosmic blight festers inside every human mind. Madness. Reality's insight will make you long to die. You're fucked once you come to life. Puppets. Doomed to a fate worse than death. Ignore the nightmare you're in, pay the fucking consequence."
Slain body of Isaac. Despairing Abraham. Devoured carcass of a terrified Daniel. Horrifically mad Ezekiel. Eternally tormented Job. Prophets. Children. Foul divine fates planned.  A future so hellishly holy. Sadistic insane deity. Vile mirage of salvation. Sanity's obliteration.
"Terrifying truth denied by children of God. Clawing out their eyes to not see the abyss. Stabbing the ears to not hear its silent screams. Slicing off the nose to not smell hope's inevitable death.  Now they dwell in ""divine"" darkness of ignorance."
Faithless sardonic saint. Emaciated enraged sinner. Abominable angel forsaken. Self-exiled son of perdition. Spiritual insomniac initiated. Insanity-inducing awareness. Knelt before the knight of knowledge In an eternal night of stars; alien and demented.
Reached out for your hands But you just sprained my wrists with a grin. Called to God and the Devil To take me out of this Hell That you so selfishly threw in Without any fucking hesitation. Neither showed themselves that night. Now you wonder why I push love from both aside.
"Goodbye all religion, stay the fuck away from me. Fuck off Satanism, you're not as bad but I don't care for you. Hello, sinful self-awareness, self-acceptance and pessimistic predeterminism."
"As I sit in my chair facing the front door, I wonder what was the point in locking every window and door when the horrors are still making their way through the house from the walls, the roof and the floor, getting closer and closer to me."
"Scenarios that will never happen but are possible, stabbing through the crumbling walls of my mind. Howling impossibly high and loud that they exist."
"Boredom lingers like blood stains on floral wallpaper. Dread always fills the air, giving the room of my mind an eerie atmosphere. The specters haunting this place always mock me with the offering to pointlessly scream. Nothing escapes my lungs and I hear the phantoms screech."
"The industrial nightmarescape devours the forests, defiles the oceans, poisons the air, turning the once green celestial rock into an abysmal gray planet with skies of charcoal black smoke, crimson sun and moon, where the inhabitants evolve into newly improved polluted puppets."
"The venom from the fangs of existence Paralyzes me in utter hopelessness Forcing me to watch and feel the world crush and rip me to shreds All those I cared for, tormented This sphere of indifference is nothing but a coffin Murdering dreams and innocence with no discrimination."
"""This is my life! This is my choice! This is my damnation! This is my only regret! This is my life! This is my sacrifice!"" - SWANS"
"Yer fond of me booty, ain't ye? I seen it - yer fond of me booty!"
Are you God that's psychic rot in the shell of gold? Are you a dislocated angel who's made of black mold? Are you the smell of rain and the screams of pure fear? Are you the reason why I can't leave this endless nightmare?
"The bones have blackened, the heart has been abandoned and burnt down too many times. You'll find nothing but black widows and obsidian centipedes dripping of oil in the skull where there should be a dreaming mind."
"Love will take care of you, throwing you into the deep end of the lake of dark depths of the unknown, where monsters of madness and paranoia roam. They're looking to terrorize a lost soul. They're looking to bring you to their nightmarish home."
"Lovers holding each others hands, frolicking into a garden engulfed by a black fog. Oblivious to the feeling that something's terribly wrong. It's not them, but it's in the trees, it's in the grass, it's in the air. Even God and the Devil are afraid to watch or to be there."
Dark as the bottom of the ocean smiling behind a flower blooming in the springtime. Natural ominous intentions unknown to itself and its victim.
"If you plan on terrorizing me, you probably won't even have to try that hard. I'm already tormented by horrific paranoia almost every single day and night."

A neverending cycle of hellish external and internal forces pulling me apart and ripping my mind to shreds.
I'm A Problem Vol One &amp; Two by Wolf Eyes
"I was appreciating the cathartic anger until I remembered the horribly unfathomable truth. Hello, again, existential dread."
"On no side out of insight, in the side out of sight.  Embracing blame from those who wish to blame. Binding darkness with the light. Unreliable and out of control under Its control. Truth told by the insane is one and the same by the sane."
4 variants of myself.
"If this existence is His plan, then His plan is malignantly meaningless cosmic madness."
Seraphim of spite. Cherubim of callousness. Archangels of animalistic rage.  God of Annihilation.
"The purest places defiled and darkened. The hopeless struggling souls turned to agents of absolute hatred, with angels of pure evil guiding them. Let's put this immortality to use and watch every light of life be sent to oblivion."
"Angels of Heaven unknowingly pushing me back to the darkest demons of Hell, all just to convince themselves that they're doing their Lord's work."
"Centipede crusader interdimensionally inducing psychedelic psychosis, forever bouncing your mind like the tits of Lilith."
Me 5 years ago: In 5 years from now I see myself dead. Me right now: In 5 years I see myself as a sea shanty-singin captain sailing straight into terrifying storms like a madman because I know death doesn't like me.
You will never know peace. The void will spit you out. It doesn't want you. Live forever in this thing's fever dream.
"Forgotten by all, but not forgotten by decay. Back into the gnawing mouth of nature's abyss, of God."
"Black rusted mold in the walls sings screeches and groans, calling for help from the very pipes it corrodes. I'll blur into it too."
"Feel it. Sleepless for days, wandering through the industrial area of the city at night, with the mind swaying in a half dreaming-half wakefulness state. Where am I? Dreamland, where there's an industrial forest covered in a gloomy orange mist in the night."
A loveless and hateless nihilism still dwells within me. Showing its face when I begin to believe there's nothing left to see. When even death seems like a dream. There is no such thing as peace for the dead that are cursed to keep living for eternity.
"The stars are just as cold as they were 6 years ago. Indifferent glimmers of light, making me wish I was like them: long fucking dead and decayed down to the bones."
"Walking these familiar streets friendless. They all moved on as expected. Yet I still live in the same neighborhood, paranoid and hopeless. Full of dread and a despair empty of sadness. It feels like I died years ago, and this is another nightmare I'm trapped in."
"I should've got your number, but I don't think it'd change a thing. I just want to tell you that I wish we could hang out at my place, your place or a motel. You're still a friend to me, tho we haven't talked for years. Love ya, girl. Stay safe."
Pin me down and fuck the fear out of my head. Release  the sounds of a short-lived paradise from my mouth until we plunge off the top of this erupting mountain. Always remember the angel of self-destructive carnal madness that I am.
I'll open the door and let you in after you've walked the streets of ominous dreamlike delirium.
Where I dwell and perform my outlandish rituals and conjure sentient otherworldly nightmares.
"Now that I think of it, I'm more of an industrial witch than a foresty witch. Industrial witch sounds badass tbh."
"Industrial music (covering industrial dub, ambient, rock, metal and techno) is pretty much my favorite genre. Like NIN, Godflesh, Nordvargr, Anaal Nathrakh, Scorn and many others."
Fields of howling roses and tulips. Grass of the souls of the dead. Wind of the torturous indifference of time. And unchanging petrifying clear blue skies.
The most beautiful flower emanating the smell of rot and charred flesh encasing a helpless screaming soul.
"Hanging bodies yet still alive, screaming in fear as we dangle from the loveliest trees. Lured by the sweetest humming of nightmares disguised as our dreams."
Terror as old as the Earth. Our ignorance is our curse. Sleeping beneath an ocean of bone and obsidian. We will never be prepared for an annihilation we deserve. Global uncontrollable malignant madness.
I kinda wanna be a femboy-succubus to steal man-seed and give my victims nightmares that'd turn their lives into an eldritch Lynchian waking dream.
"Choose where NATO shoots me into, for ""research"" but mostly for the lulz."
Deeply ingrained curiosity in the darkness of existence and its shadow is one of the biggest reasons why I haven't contemplated suicide for years.
"What's that sound? The sweet alien void, oh, it sings to me. It's enough to make a man insane."
"As much as I love the beautiful terror of outer space, we still got like 90% of the ocean to explore. The ocean is just as beautifully terrifying too, so let's not exclude it."
"Let out the sadness and hate, now inhale the smoke of this strain. See the truth that life ain't great as they say and that we all have an unknown fate. At this vista of unfathomable reality, you can leave if you need but I will always stay. This is my inescapable destiny."
Out of the cell and free-roaming these halls of this hellish cosmic ward of determined insanity. Eldritch delirious voices guiding me to undo reality.
"Put my trust in you to tell me the truth But fuck that, that wouldn't benefit you. So I guess it's my fault for what happened And for my silence to your messages. Justify all you want just to deceive, But you'll never convince me."
"Bloodshot eyes filled with emptiness Dread hanging out in the back Just wanting to sleep and die will I rest So I can exit this shit existence Call me a traitor, call me a bitch, or a drag I don't give a fuck, I just want this to end."
"Body tired of its own existence. Mind racing at a hundred years per minute, racing to nowhere at the end of eternity. I will never experience that satisfaction from receiving eternal sleep.  Death, fuck off with your teasing And release me from this infinite insanity."
A cold realization that I don't long for you. That I am fine without you. That I don't give a fuck about how many friends you have. We burnt the bridge and I have no reason to rebuild it from its ashes.
The blue sky howls to torment me Pushing away the night To feast on my mind Enabling a battle of sanity and insanity No relief. No peace. No rationality. No fear. Nonsensical sense. No fantasy. A maelstrom of wakefulness is where I sleep.
"My insomnia just told me no break time. Fuckin hell, why do I does my mind do this to myself? 😫😐👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️"
Getting burnt out and bored of this place. Time to take a break. Why am I even talking about this? Idk. I'm bored.
"An old familiar dark fog creeps through The daylight gives up willingly All that shines upon me is the cold moon The pale eye of despair, watching me Welcoming me to that old abysmal forest Where I lose myself alone with emptiness  And the timeless shadows of disenchantment."
Frothing at the mouth like a wild starving twisted emaciated coyote with eyes full of demented darkness that set their sights only upon a vast warping pitch black industrial factory that bleeds against the blood orange sky with its distorted crimson lights.
My week so far: Senseless Sunday. Mostly Mundane Monday. Terrible Tuesday. Wretched Wednesday. Thjiwodiaudaq Thursday. Why am I sharing this? Idk and idc enough to delete it.
An addiction to partaking of the fruit of the eldritch tree of forbidden knowledge that makes both angels and demons hesitate ever speaking of its existence.
Love didn't leave him. He shot it point blank after he saw that it manipulated him. Didn't bother burying it and left it to be messily eaten by the wolves of frigid disillusionment as he watched with a hardened heart.
"Floating in the 4th mesa, entering through the Gates of Hades. Pits of green flames containing screaming souls in incomprehensible terror and pain. Inky black silhouettes of demons with glowing green infernal eyes. Visions of what lies beyond."
"Chilling celestial choirs echoing uninvited and unannounced in every chapel and temple, freezing the blood of both sinners and saints."
Calculated insanity premeditated in a sane state of mind to push the itself to its limits just to exorcise timeless abominations within its depths.
The cross on Calvary Hill contorts into impossible formations as maddening horrific angels of wrath sore down upon the Earth tearing the souls out of every mortal and casting them into the abyss of God's mouth for the murder of each other and their eldritch savior.
"A 90s suburban city, always enveloped in a bluish fog, in the Pacific Northwest where otherworldly industrial factories are abundant."
I saw that I was on this small platform on this teal colored industrial tower that overlooked a vague suburban area under a stormy blue sky.
"I like industrial scenery that unintentionally gives off a subtle nightmarish aura. Dark dismal industrial factories and landscapes are more unsettling than haunted abandoned buildings, in my opinion."
Really vibing with this image right now.
Death may be the end of this mortal misery. But for me it will be the beginning of a new nightmarish insanity going on for the rest of eternity.
A living hell where vile deceivers get away with their crimes through lies of love and false promises. Justifying their sickness just to keep spreading it.
Mad cravin dissociative hallucies and a blunt since I can't fuckin sleep.
"""I hate my body. I'm stuck in myself. I can't stand my body. I'm stuck in myself. I'm nothing. I'm nobody."" -SWANS"
Longing for ego death.
"Despair flowing through my veins like the smoke flowing through the air from the Marlboro between my fingers. Eyes glaring beyond the stars, mind lost in the thought of the futility of it all."
Daydreaming of smoking a blunt while I read Grimscribe on a bench in an empty park full of raccoons and stray cats.
"""My life is going nowhere I want everyone to know that I don't care"" - Lil Peep"
Dissociative depersonalization on demand. I need this right now.
"And the eighth seal, unknown to all but one angel and God, was opened and all of reality became undone."
My first tattoos will be of a black centipede in the shape of the infinity symbol. And then a teal mantis with angel wings with eyes and a black halo.
Choirs of my deepest unconscious fears echo into the waking world when invited to sing their ominous songs from their cathedral of nightmares that freeze the blood.
Given up dreams unto the abysmal chasm that is the mouth of reality.
Ghastly gospel of the terrible truth Unholy word of God Divine terror of all Deranging the minds of me and you Sacred silent slaughter of sanity's life The senseless purpose to terrify sentient minds.
Petrifying revelations. Predetermined futile revolutions. Hollow angels guiding both sides Into an incomprehensible night Shivering the minds of demons and angels alike.
All that keeps me alive is heresy to both the Devil and God. I am the spirit lost in an inky black prismatic forest fog. Death's got me on the bottom of Her list. Nature wants me to be swallowed by its abyss. I'm just trying to keep together my shit Before I fall off the cliff.
Fear burning away my calm like napalm in the war of Vietnam. Cravings for an escape out of this heart of darkness that is void of dawn. Where music and getting high is the only way to stay sane In this horrific war-torn jungle of the mind living off of vantablack rain.
I'd rather be on a gram of velvet cacoons while my mind drowns in dark ambient and out of this fucking fucked reality.
The greatest days I'll ever know are behind. Now a bleak future is ahead. The moon still has never felt so frigid. The sun still has never looked so dismal.
Angelic purity becomes tasteless. The demonic blasphemy becomes bland. All that is left is a cosmic emptiness that not even death could ever mend.
"Heaven has crashed into Hell, causing a petrifying cataclysm. The Devil is dead and every God has left us to be abandoned. An eternity of the darkest despair and abysmal disillusionment For every godforsaken human being on this planet."
A black sun of despair with a ring of heavenly white fire of terror. The permanent mark left by indifferent gods that abandoned us.
Death may come but the damage has already been done.
I am haunted by this dreadful world in this nightmare I am in.
I want to transition to a girl. I want to be a centipede. I want to be a fox. I want to be a black hole. I want to be an intangible being. But I don't want to be part of this corrupt doomed human world.
My dream death would be to OD on powerful dissociatives and psychedelics combined so my consciousness will be blasted out of this body and into beyond eternity while my body rapidly decays into nothing but bones and then into dust.
This perfectly fits my mood. Beautiful melancholic piano with subtle dreamlike ambient synths and anxiety-inducing dread from the violin strings that sound like distant screams and cries of terrified despairing souls.
Sometimes sleep doesn't help. Sometimes the only thing left to do is to dissociate or to face the horror that haunts us.
"It's like being trapped in a seemingly endless nightmare that isn't mine, and I can't escape it even in my dreams. It's everywhere. There's nowhere to hide or run or be safe from it except for nothingness. And I was denied that once I was born into this terrible place."
"I can't find the right word to sum up how I feel all the time. I feel dread and a dark despair. But I'm not depressed, if that makes sense. I want Death to take me but I'm not suicidal. I just fear suicide so much because of the possibility of it failing horribly. I'm trapped."
"Transition. Did you give this existential dread a feelin? Did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're depressed. You're depressed. What unspeakable horrors should I view next?  Doom and terror, forever."
I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 in dread today.
"""Money is FLESH! Money is flesh in your hands! Money is flesh Money is flesh in your hand When you pay, you're a servant When you pay, you're a servant You deserve it You deserve it You deserve it You deserve it"" - SWANS"
"Suicide squid bois putting you on their dissociate list. You and I, boy, will leave our bodies and drift effortless. Our ""selves"" never existed."
"They had an idea where the last remaining nuclear warhead was hidden. A warhead capable of ending the endless war. But they'd have to go through living nightmares to get to it, and they didn't have enough men for the mission."
They dance and make love in our forest of pipes and under the sky of black smoke. The sun is red and the moon shifts like a ghost. All the angels and demons have gone back home before the horror devours their sanity whole.
He thinks home is where the trees sing his name. But he belongs in our industrial terror's embrace. You will never die in this new life of man-made madness. The nightmarescape we inhabit is endless.
You know you can't feel this pain. You know you can't be here always. You know this world will never change. You know everyone alive is insane To survive in a world of an endless insanity.
"They say that life is a gift Another day, another pain But for some it was a curse since they were a child All those lies blinding our young eyes Nothingness is the one real gift That only the fortunate receive."
There's a hand inside my mind. There's eyes inside my mind that aren't mine. And I can only get relief by breathing in the noxious nightmare fumes deeply to put this tormented mind asleep.
You scream your nothings into the digital nothing because you know deep down that your mind is getting worse. Your body's getting worse. You're cursed and you can't do anything. Nobody can do anything. So embrace the dread and the abysmal madness that awaits.
Your fears will stay with you forever. Your paranoia will control you until you die here. Fear now. Fear then. Fear your mind full of fear.
Undying night sky of demented stars staring down at the gloomy orange streetlight lit suburbs that I'm lost and wandering in with delirious dread controlling my every move.
The eerie quiet when waking up before the plunge into the horrific world of waking reality.
"Scorched shadows into the earth and walls of ruin, they turn their heads to where the living step. Haunting them with deathly silent air and echoed screams of their petrifying deaths."
"Pissing your pants in terror, realizing none of us were ready for this. No ounce of misanthropy in your blood will prepare you for nuclear holocaust. No speck of optimism will prepare you for the mushroom clouds."
Let the blood run down the mountains.
"Trippin hard on the robo with my lungs painted with Tussin Phasing through my homeboys' walls to tell them I feel nothin As I'm astral projectin into multiple limitless dimensions To see the face of God to be the words ""OwO"" bulging out of His cosmic face like cosmic explosions."
My ambitions as a bi bug is to say bye to this material existence and become an intangible presence.
We are trapped in an imperishable celestial calculated chaotic multi-geometrical non-euclidean numinous infinitely prismatic abysmal maddening cosmic ocean.

Guide and Medium.
Holy light that would chill the blood of all of man. A thunderous celestial choir of soothing ominous hymns. Body sinking into this Earth. Soul lifted from this existence. Ascending into a vortex of sacred terror.
"When I think about Heaven deeply enough, I start to get this very eerie foreign serene feeling. Heaven is absolute divinity, which resides in eternity. Something like that isn't for the living to see, experience or witness, until death I suppose."
"A little clarification (if anyone cares). The only things I believe to be true from the Abrahamic religions are there being forces of Heaven and Hell. Demons and angels. There are some good on both sides.  I know, very heretical of me to say this here."
"To try to fully comprehend or think deeply enough about God, the actual God, is to either go mad or sink into the darkest dreadful despair one could ever know. Even God planned those reactions too. It's the definition of the ultimate cosmic incomprehensible horror."
You would wither away under these fire-lit skies Just like the fragile flower you really were this whole time.
Angelic wings of black smoke. Eyes of indifferent burning stars. Skin like charred redwood. And blood of boiling water.
Angelic pessimistic implosive cataclysmic field around the exponentially impossible reality of sleeping for more than 10 hours FOR THE OVERMIND!

Extradimensional spectral bacterial relentless vicious indifferent cosmic ironic edginess.
I love cosmic horror. I've laughed at a video of a bird pecking at a camera with the audio bass boosted. Yes we exist.
I got high and tripped hard just from talking to a cute Asian girl and had to run through the streets at night and listen to the music the streams and grass were making...in the dream I had last night.
I want to camp right there. In the center of that circle for a whole weekend.
"A Heaven only glimpsed and felt through the music. My hands desperately reaching for an angel of unknown origin to take me there, finally leaving this agonizing existence."
"""We are covered in rust Hopeless and distant, we sway side to side Distracted by imperfection We fall apart"" - After The Burial"
Average edgy bois: My idols are Heath Ledger's Joker and Tyler from Fight Club. Me; doofus edgy maximus: My idols are eyeless Dr. Weir and the auto-cannibalistic fox from Antichrist.
"With half of my body feeling like there's shards of glass inside, trying to convince me that I should embrace becoming a mannequin like some type of Ligottian body horror, I say a nap is in order."
"Half of the soul decays, and the body plays along. But the rest will bloom like unearthly flowers from a field that screams eerily dreamlike songs."
Best left unknown to the fragile human mind. To comprehend everything all at once would horrifically rip the mind to shreds.
Fangs of fear of something unseen and unknown constantly pierce into my mind.
"demons to take me down that same path, which I doubt you will."
"How can you make a man feel fear when he fears himself more than the one threatening him? I've been in the darkest most malevolent depths of my soul and know what it's like to be possessed and guided by pure evil. If you really want to make me afraid, you're going to have to send"
Wrap your lips around my lips. Taste my sweet hollowness. Hold my arms down as you feel my tormenting warmth inside. Feel the pleasurable blandness. Moan a word that has no weight in time's eye. I'll crave this vacuous lifeless lust every meaningless night.
Slave killing slave. Banal threatening mundane. Puppets screaming nothings at each other. Miserable insanity writhing towards nothing forever.
I will be there with my eyes wide open.
"Walking horrors in the light of day and in the darkness of night. Nowhere to hide.  Any survivors are either in the depths of despair and maddening fear or running out of time.  The dead walk in the forms of mannequins and puppets, seeking to make us join their horrific fate."
Carefully calculated exorcism of the emotional chains that keep me from seeing and feeling the beyond. Precise and viscous as a spider in the night.  Graceful as a moth when it takes flight.
"Trumpeting transcendental insanity as sacred spectral centipedes exit through my mouth, eyes and ears as I speak."
Tje Birb jazz band does not accept refunds if the crowd's skulls and spines detaches from their bodies and slithers in circles to summon teh Centipede God.
"Good memories, decaying like the walking monstrosities outside my home. The abysmal bleak future I see that awaits me, chilling me to the bone. Heaven and Hell has their gates closed to humanity. And now we must roam this forsaken world as the undead for eternity."
"Skin paler than the moon. Eyes with otherworldly menace. Nails covered with mud and black blood. Silent screams of terror and rage, the air is no longer of use to them. One bite into your flesh, one drop of their black blood onto your skin, you will join them; the undead."
I will never see through this nightmare.
"The clouds seemed off today, even foreign. And the blueness of the sky appeared more menacing, like out of a dream that's slowly descending into a nightmare."
The body withers more and more the further down the river of time we flow. And then into the seas of eternity will our soul become one with the roaring waves of the deceased and the depths of the unknown.
"We met in the dark shadow of Eden, and we delighted in the forbidden fruit of knowledge. Before I left to become alive, you told me we'd meet there again."
Drowning myself in that sweet poisonous lake of nostalgia. Floods my mind with memories of the type of aesthetics I liked back then.
So I decided to take a look at how the AN peoples are doing on YT and...yikes bro. I'm glad I left when I did. Shit looks like it's going more and more downhill.

"After countless unsettling visions and indescribably insidious feelings that'd assault the body and mind at random, I began to fear both day and night's skies. The monstrous infinite blue, waiting to swallow my soul whole at any moment. And the endless black sky of night, with"
"Deathless dissociative nights under the trees of the park, smoke of a Marlboro floating in the summer air like an alien specter, watched by lunatic stars."
"The unwanted truth lies behind a mask of comforting lies you can only see. It does not hide behind them intentionally. The truth will be exposed when you do not exist and only the truth is present. Invert your sight and eat its skin, then let its light pierce the dark within."
Meaning and meaninglessness non-existent in the dimension I've been trapped in. An intangible purpose to find what couldn't be found to begin with. Trusting only the unknown synchronic insane manifestations. Walking a constant warping path towards endless enlightening madness.
Sect of the Angel's Trumpet Tree. Children of nightmarish insanity. Free from the bonds of reality and their own sanity. Sons and daughters of divinely horrific lunacy for eternity.
A bush of Angel's Trumpets. Before they bloom again. It felt eerie standing so close to the most terrifying yet beautiful plant I've ever learned about.
"Totally need to camp here for a week, in the Hoia Baciui Forest."
"For some reason he was fine when he heard the words ""world"" or ""planet."" But once he heard the word ""Earth"" his face distorted into one of terror and his eyes seemed to be looking into the beyond, because his mind was shown the terrifying insignificance of the planet he lived on."
"On moth knees, hopping back to God. On my moth knees, hopping back. On moth knees, hopping into the fog."
When that ethereally sinister saxophone echoes in the summer night and you're slowly being surrounded by an interdimensional jazz band. 😨😩😐😎💀
"That atmospheric horror jazz just hits differently, you know? It's got me unsettled like I'm in some eerie dream yet tappin my foot while nodding my head."
"There are certain images I see that some of you guys tweet/post that give me indescribable feelings like from a dream and I just want to say: keep it up, please."
"We claim to know so much yet we know so very little about this existence/reality. We use anything to explain away whatever we cannot understand or whatever unsettles our view of life; whether using religion, science, atheism or even philosophy. We're ignorant fools in the dark."
"A part of me kind of wishes that I took their offer and explored that old bad darkness. And that darkness, I can feel it waiting for me. I don't like it, but it makes me morbidly curious. Maybe I'm fucked in the head for it, I don't know."
"I came pretty close to entering a forest I don't think I'd ever come back from, and this is a bad forest, not your enchanted dreamy kind. This is one from nightmares. I'm talking about a real forest. And a certain person I know almost got me in there with them."
"I guess I've acted childish here and there. The way I look at it, it's best when one admits they've acted irrationally. Looking at it from the outside, talking shit is meaningless, pointless. I just gotta remind myself that's the reality of it all."
You take yourself too seriously. I kinda do too but I also make fun of myself and let out my stoopid humor. We are not the same.
How can you fight against something that controls your every thought and move from the beginning to eternity? There is no fucking point. Worshiping the Devil or Heaven will do nothing. There isn't a fucking chance in Heaven or Hell.
They never had a say in this just like how I never did either. God planned all of this. Every second. Every minuscule to every significant action. All the hate I've felt and feel is meaningless and futile. It will do nothing against God because it's part of Its plan.
Hatred and paranoia burning and writhing like demonically possessed black oil in my veins and my mind.
"The blue sky is oppressive relentlessly. The love that is spoken is but hollow singing. The mind is walking only one road that spirals and twists menacingly. Mouth forms a shriek, yet screams silently. Body is sedated but the spirit is writhing violently."
The house reeks of delirious hauntings. My breath stinks of insanity and gradual apathy. The windows torture me with false release. These walls mock me of my suffering. The angels and demons want nothing to do with me if I want peace.
Stick your knife in me. Walk away.
"""Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness! I now know the depths I reach are limitless."""
The continuance of our species is not worth all the agony we have inflicted not only upon ourselves but upon every other species' lives we have ruined and taken away and will continue to do so.
"Failure, horror and madness is all I know. My bleak future is fucking set in stone. Don't give me pity, I don't deserve any mercy. I was made this for world, only to experience misery. These words written out of burrowing agony Just to feel a false sense of relief."
A self-loathing that burns like a black fog. A cold futility more frigid than the snow. Remembering that this madness won't fucking stop. Into the black river of self-destruction I will flow. Failed my family and the world. Feed me to the fucking worms.

"There's no point in sleeping when my dreams are unwelcomed nightmares and my waking life is a nightmare in itself. Lethargy from caffeinated induced insomnia with some nice atmospheric black metal sounds like a nice little escape, for now."
Trapped in this suburban nightmare. It's slowly eating away at my mind. I have nowhere to escape to but music and sometimes that's not even enough.
"This is a pain these woods here cannot heal, but the northern most forest that's always shrouded in mist."
Though I may be cursed forever I still seek the fatal touch of your embrace. Through you I may find the impossible escape From this wretched eternal nightmare.
"In my bare feet, I walk on the northern beach  In the midst of the darkest storm, I seek for your deathly embrace, liberating and serene. Your hair, black as my abysmal despair. Your skin, white as the frigid lifeless moon. Goddess of Death, I call to you, please take me soon."
"I'm really wanting to go on that week long camping trip in the Aokigahara Forest. Though with its dark bleak depressing history, it looks rather peaceful and somewhat beautifully otherworldly."
Heavenly white flowers and their darkly green leaves. Evil poisonous insanity in the guise of divine beauty.

You have followers and a twitter gf. I have a garage full of people listening to me screaming delirious gibberish in a mic while terror ambient plays at full blast in the background. We are obviously not the same.
"Mind full of raven heads with the bodies of black snakes and the legs of black widows, that talks in an eerily soothing voice and whispers in a ghastly guttural insidious language."
Still wishing to violently implode on demand.
"Execute me via firing squad, then burn my corpse and toss my charred remains into a pit of centipedes and snakes."
"Weeping in the void, the cries go unheard by my own kind. But something unspeakably dreadful and timeless is drawn to them. I either go silent and let the screams of pure terror and hatred reverberate through my mind or let that 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 find me."
"There's nowhere to go when you fear both the light and the dark. You won't even be safe when you close your eyes and pretend you're dead. The light and darkness will always pierce through, driving you mad."
To become a digitally and psychologically omnipresent and omniscient basilisk is what I want right now.

"Heaven unraveling the veil. Our minds, our sanity; they are not ready."
"God, devour my soul forever. God, devour all the others.  You never thought that I'd admit my faults And blame myself and remember your words. I have awoken and fear the impending nightmare after my death.  Death. Anguish. Nightmarish eternity is what awaits me."
"You never thought that I'd admit my faults And blame myself and not the world.  I have awoken and fear the inevitable end of my sanity.  We both share a scorching hatred Just in a different colored flame. I still sometimes consider you a friend. Come, embrace our insignificance."
"I, foolish fiend that worships nothing. I, insidious insect of petrifying insanity. I, paradoxical hate and hypocritical undead. I, paranoid puppet of existential dread."
"There's no going back now. There's no escaping God's mouth. Sickening primal urges burst forward To tear at my flesh that I so greatly abhor. Blatant futility in trying to end my existence Rapes my mind again and again, even past when I can't take it."
"Oh, how I was wrong the whole time. I thought it was better to hate and die. But now I know there's no fucking escape Once you realize that this was all set like a predetermined game. Let me drown in my own blood and vomit. I have seen enough, but It won't let me exit."
I see God in the Devil's eyes. I see the Devil in God's eyes. I see God in everything and it's dragging me deeper into the depths of insanity for seeing what should not be seen.
Bitch told me she wanted my eldritch dick  I grabbed her by the nose and told her no Shit hit the fuckin fan from 1-10 real quick As she rattled my bones and called me a skeletal hoe. So I called my eldritch horror bros And now we're floating above the snow.

How to kill my libido permanently
Most of the times I'm serious. Other times I just let my stoopid humor out. Sometimes I combine them. I'm sorry for all of you who have to endure it.
Bush(es).
Kaysidellas are one of my weakness. They good but make me no poopoo for days if I don't take a lot of lax.  We live in a horror theater and we are not the audience.
I'm not a king. I'm not a role model. I'm a phaggoty bug with cosmic Kafkaesque horror paranoia controlling my life. My advice: peepee.
The human race is grotesque. Vomiting out and then consuming its foulness As it discharges more of its clueless larvae Into the hellpit of human civilization. Spreading violently until its death by internal or external forces. We are an incarnation of malignantly useless madness.
"Your emotions and lack of deep critical thinking caused a pointless tossing of six lives into the thresher of life. Into a world you have no control over. Into a life you cannot predict. You always said not to mess with the unknown, yet you did. And for the stupidest reasons."
"It's like a monstrous mass of fused bodies; screaming, writhing, moaning, laughing and staring out blankly as it vilely births more bodies to be fused with it to replace the dying and the decayed ones. This foul mass of mankind is merely just a tiny puppet amongst the billions."
"Having 6 kids for free labor and indoctrinated love for you while using your beliefs to justify it all, is one of the most disgustingly irrationally selfish things to do. But what makes it worse, is that I know that this cursed colony of humans spreads until it's dead."
"I don't just believe that the worst will happen, but that it'll be beyond rational reality in the form of outlandish nightmarish abominations."
"I was simply watering the backyard, and I had this unexplainable urge to look up to that half-night clear gray sky.  And I heard a roar from the sky itself, so terrifying and so thunderous, that it made both Heaven and Hell tremble in fear."
"If you think deeply enough of what God really is, after unlearning all the religious depictions, you're in for some overwhelmingly powerful existential dread."
So there's the book by Dylan Trigg that I'm trying to get into but it looks like I need to do some research into phenomenology first. Is there anyone who's into phenomenology who'd like to point me into any directions on where to start for summaries about it?
"If you're ever feeling depressed or masochistic enough to feel self-destructive and feel some terror, I highly recommend listening to The Downward Spiral by NIN and Public Castration Is A Good Idea by Swans. It's helped me in some dark masochistic times."
"Drinkin robotussib, chase it with ginger ale, my dick shrinks to a cm and I'm astral projecting into the vaporwave. I miss those times."
I wanna skip getting a good enough femboy bod and going straight to being an old witch crone that becomes the spooky town legend.
The world should commit not living.
Gonna commit mass superslide because fuck today. Fuck this week so far.
My life was a child cartoon that later revealed itself to be  a psychological-cosmic horror drama full of trauma. 1/8. It's not gr8 but for now it's been okay.
I saw a spoder bro in my bathroom in the same spot for 2 hours straight last night. Then when I came back he was gone and I saw a house centipede in the tub. R.I.P.

Rest your head upon the grass under the oak tree Let go of all you know and have your final sleep This valley will cradle your body and turn it into a thing of beauty As your soul gently drifts peacefully with the breeze.

Colorless vomit into the virtual void.
Psychotic social cathartic cancerous noxious network.
Digital delirium.
"Face the reality that unearthly intangible forces Control every single moment and thing in existence. Every life will face this callous consequence, that they exist. You will never be saved by nothingness. Enter God's sanity-tearing presence And bear witness to infinite madness."
Demonic delirium will materialize In your dreams and waking mind. You will find no escape and relief. You won't even be able to scream. The worst part is that it will mutate When you cross the bridge after death. Face the eternal nightmare no one wants to accept.
Exiled and alone Uncaring for what I've done Just like how you're apathetic To the monster you've become You always said you'd want to go to Hell Well I'll fucking show you what it's like When you have no control over your own mind And face your worst fears for your entire life.

I know now what I'm watching tonight. 😏
"Had a dream where the Hellpriest from Hellraiser had his chains get me and had me half flayed already and was ready to have me taste their pleasures. For some stupid reason, irrational fear overtook me and I noped out of the dream. I want to return and taste their pleasures. 😩"
Witnessing the end of the world with his final breath while the world goes on without him as he reaches the bridge to the ominous dreamlike afterlife that can only be reached through death.
"""As gravity grabbed at me pulling my center Unable to stand up and run for the shelter The grass and the trees began dying and wilting As people were crying and diving off buildings And fuck it’s the end and I’m just 27 So why in the fuck is this happening??"""
"Third, that is the most stupid and irrational question, asking me why I don't kill myself. Bitch, think before you speak or is thinking deeply enough too painful for you?"
"painful way that might not end up being successful and end up making things far worse.  Second, I'm not suicidal or extremely depressed at all. I don't have to be to be an antinatalist and a pessimist. I can see the fucked up reality of nature and procreation as I am right now."
"""Oh, you're an antinatalist and pessimist? Why don't you kill yourself?"" Well first of all, I can't kill myself the way I want to because the corrupt fucked world of mankind we live in prevents many depressed as hell and suicidal people to exit peacefully rather than a brutal"
"Mankind is far beyond hope. The future is fucked for the human race by the human race. Stop breeding. Get a vasectomy if you can. And if you want a child, adopt for fucks sake. Or get a doggo or puppy if you want unconditional love."
"Christ followers, water walkers Satanic nemesis, darkness haunters Angelic entities, holy marionettes Demonic forces, unholy puppets All conscious minds, foul and saintly Walking the path God has made We are bound by His impalpable story And we can never fucking escape."

I'd like to at least leave this city for a month and camp up in the states north of me. Or stay the weekend at haunted abandoned hospitals or graveyards.
"I'll sit in the middle of the trail at 10:58 pm and whisper the same phrase to summon the Contorted Coyote. He'll arrive at exactly 11 pm, seemingly appearing out of nowhere on the trail in front of me. And that is when we will converse."
"Damned with a body and burdened with libido. Descended into insanity that's turned my blood cold. For infinite knowledge, I'd pay the price with my soul. Paranoia's entangled deep into my mind like some nightmarish black mold With tendrils of an ancient alien force so old."
Driving off a coastal cliff while peaking in an acid trip.
Skateboarding with the Satanist kids and preaching about how God's actually an eldritch centipede with wings.
Hot boxing the chapel while the organist plays Duel of Fates.
Fuck only hanging out and working with my brothas and sistas of Hell. I'll be shouting Necronomicon incantations inside the bathroom of a Taco Bell. Smoking Yuggothian cannabis with curious Mormons in the parking lot Cause we want to see God's incomprehensible plotless plot.
"I write my madness down here to keep the eldritch madness at bay from devouring me whole, for now."
"Finally, after just a simple search, I found another way to gain otherworldly knowledge. Now all I got to do is wait patiently for the right time. If I scream in terror from all that I'm shown, keep showing me. I need to see it all."

What we hold dear is what we will lose. It is inevitable in this unforgiving reality. But you cannot lose anything if there is nothing to lose and if there is no one to lose anything at all. Let the self be destroyed.
I trust fear more than I trust lust and romantic love. Fear has never let me down as much as the other two previously mentioned emotions.
I don't have much room for being egotistical. Experiences through the past 4 years showed me that I know so very little about this mad horrific fever dream I'm trapped in. That I'm not special. Yet an unceasingly unsettling Eye always watches me and knows where I'm going.
"What was that Buddhist's name, the 16 year old kid who decided to go up into a cave in a mountain and just sit and meditate until he died yet other Buddhists kinda tried keeping him alive?"
"Call me a heretic, but I haven't read any of Schopenhauer's works (completely). And if someone gave me the choice to read his works or watch U.G. Krishnamurti videos with ominous ambient music along with it, I'd watch U.G. Krishnamurti videos with ominous music along with it."
"Banal horror reigns supreme over this realm of madness, over this forsaken reality."
"The marionette stared coldly at him with those abysmal dreamlike eyes Waiting for the moment for the man to let out his last horror-stricken cries Of coming to the realization that his grudges, desires and love didn't change his frightening fate That'd darken the brightest day."
"And as soon as the bullet passed through his brain He woke up as a ventriloquist dummy and screamed, terrified, yet in vain."
"The only time the cliche'd as hell phrase ""I am God"" actually unsettled me greatly due to the entire context of what was going on in this creepy fucking movie."
"Maybe it's not a good idea to watch an alien movie when it's getting close to 3 AM with my paranoia crawling up, but fuck it, I need to get scared good sometime. It's healthy for the soul."
"I'm honestly scared (and fascinated) of aliens far more than any other supernatural entity or serial killer. Mostly because aliens are, well, alien. As in alien to our understanding. I greatly fear the unknown. And that's why I love them and deathly frightened of the muthafuckas."
A demonically psychotically possessed siren Guided by the angel of abysmal madness That's what I fucking am. I don't know how much of this hell I can stand. And I know there'll be no end to this Until I pass onto the next nightmarish existence.
"Blinded by lust's foul touch. Satisfy its thirst, it'll never be enough. Burn every bridge built in the name of love. It will keep draining every drop of blood. It's venom induces the vilest psychosis. I regret every time I relieve myself of loneliness."
"Again, if you dare threaten those I love, prepare to face holy horrifying vengeance for the innocents you decide to harm and defile.  Now I use the aid of Heaven and the demons that actually were kind enough to teach and help me.  I'd rather go to Heaven than be in Hell with you."
"your depraved pedophilic degenerate deceiving lust, you fucking liar. You are the sole reason I've gone to the side of Heaven and seek their guidance as well along with their protection. I despise those who use the Devil to justify their sick desires and hide behind his back."
Fear the holy wrath of Heaven when you choose to get your vile revenge because you didn't get to fuck me and because I saw through your lies. Your Hell will always fear Heaven. The angel of vengeance will fucking strike your soul down into the loneliest darkest pits of Hell for
Reaching to the angels the mortal mind should not see. Grasping the unearthly ominous light of pure divinity. Cutting away the vileness of the defiling one. I give unto you their foul sickness to imprison for eternity. Transform me into my true sacredly horrific puppet form.
The infinite clear blue sky is more intimidating and dread-inducing than the indifferent night sky of the cosmos. Just an endless blue of terror that defiles the light of day turning the color of day into malevolence. Fear the daylight.
"Horror strikes deeper and sharper when in it's in broad daylight, showing that it doesn't only reside in the darkness of the night. Showing that it is indifferent to our comfort."
"Worship the selfish primal beast or the delirious artificial god. Or cast both aside and become and outlandish eye seeing everything for the pointless madness it is with a meaning that the mind cannot comprehend and even if it did, it'd tear itself apart and wish it was dead."
"Doomed fetus, forsake the remorseless realm you've been recklessly sacrificed to so swiftly. Become a black hole of the Anti-Idiot God of nature and supernova us into oblivion."
Birth: insidious imposed initiation into the inescapable insanity that is existence.
"Agonizing pointless procreation for the hallucinatory mirage gods, they feast upon real anguish for they do not exist and wish to feel what they cannot feel."
"Sacrificing the false prophets in the circle of oil and blood, forming God's Eye. They shall see the maddening truth that will devour their sanity and mold their souls into eldritch abominations."
"Is tearing at my sanity And I see myself as a helpless puppet Aware of countless sins and misery What makes it worse is I can't reach a peaceful exit Especially when the insanity is consuming me Making me wish I offed myself at birth But I'm stuck here, that's part of my curse."
"You call yourself an antinatalist Yet you lust after children Manipulating and abusing women Just for your own sick benefit You're just 1 out of a million reasons I fucking hate being one of you humans Fuck transitioning, I'm getting a vasectomy This world of hypocrisy"
Incantations in the depths of a vast nightmarish industrial factory.
Took a nap. It actually helped. Praise the Centipede God. 🐛🦋😇
The oblivious spirit ventures out of the body. Dark malefic entities take the opportunity. Forced to recover in an eternal night. The bedroom is lit by nightmare's light. A black sky morning that never ends. From nightmare to nightmare I awaken in. Daylight is filled with dread.
"Though you are bright and beautiful, you wither slowly back into the abyss you glow from."
"When an unsettling dream starts to play out in reality, that's when dread takes on a whole new and powerful hold on the mind."
Feeling extremely uneasy today. I strongly believe the dream I had last night has an effect on today of how things played out so far. Which in turn makes me even more unsettled.
"Mhm, nice, meditating on the grass under the black sky with the violet moon where my physical form begins to sway with the grass and becomes a tree."
"The church bells ring, my friend. But they sound wrong. And the now ominous statue of Christ has its unblinking eyes following us wherever we may go. Its frightening eyes pierce into my mind and will not cease to haunt me, even in my sleep."
I was a tree in a suburban park in another reality.
When a minute feels like forever but passes by so quickly.
"Oh, they're coming back now. Every time I get sleepy and try to stay awake I get flashes of weird eerie dreamlike things."
"Babbling dissociative diaries of psychonaut citizens in a psychedelic suburban city with a warping forest intertwined, trapping it in timeless terror."
"My type of pride parade would be psychedelic and everyone would trip on shrooms. And have it be at night while blasting forest psy, chillwave and nostalgic ambient music."
"Neon dragonflies of nebulous clouds, shifting and flying through darkness, searching for troubled human minds to free into the astral realm, then possess their bodies for unknown purposes."
Uneasy and sleepy. Time to fall asleep and wake up in the dreadfully wonderful dreamscape.
"Nagging thoughts. ""But what then?"" The same answer pierces through: ""You can't and will never know. But most likely your future will remain banal, uncertain, and unnerving. You're in a fever dream that isn't yours. Remember that, always."""
"Invisible maelstrom of malevolent cosmic madness, slowly bringing us down into the abysmal depths of a foreboding fate better left unknown."
Marching forward in this terrible tundra with an oppressive hellish heat from the violet sun where the timeless frigid wind of howling souls of the dead give us no comfort in this climate of an absurd meaningless existence.
"Ah, waking back up in the same nightmare I've been trapped in, even though I never really left. Feels...to be back."
"In its gorgeous vast grove, I sit in the lotus position on the emerald green grass and meditate as I pray to the Centipede God. Its image appears in my mind vividly: a great omniscient omnipotent centipede of ever changing colors with colossal celestial wings of a cicada."
Farthest away from God but never far.  Forever watched by His Eye even in Outer Darkness.  Ominous omnipresence. Driving me to petrifying madness. The darkest despair casted by the most divine light. The truth of His will consuming me with most dreadful fright.
Abysmal demented divine guidance by demon and angel alike towards the horrifying holiness of Heaven with my eyes bleeding ghastly light.
"Angels dragging your children back to God. Demons guiding the innocent down the path made by God. Alien entities forcibly enlightening you of your strings pulled by God. All of this insidious insanity planned by God. No matter where you crawl to, you're crawling to God."
"Blessed be the three kings of demented malevolence that rule over the realms of the living, the nonexistent and the unfortunate spirits in the depths of life after death."
And so it came to pass that an eternal nightmare came from the vacuum of space that is one of God's terrible mouths. Insignificant planets teeming with sentient self-aware life ripe for the devouring of their suffering and madness. Ripe for death.
You will have nowhere to hide when there is no alpha and omega. You will have nowhere to hide when death leads to an terrifyingly incomprehensible afterlife.
"Angel of insanity, what would I be without you? What would anyone be without you at all? We would be what we all really are: nobody at all."
When the world becomes anew again When the dead become undead When the puppets gain awareness When the puppets gain enlightenment That is when your fear of the unknown Is the only thing you can trust and can't control.
The tree of life sprouts flowers of death I hold my breath for when they bloom They only bring uncertain doom that will be met Whether or not we fear or embrace them.
Feel the ethereal light of the beyond pierce your soul and tear you into a masterpiece of maddening enlightenment of this insane existence.
Divine neon blue fiery fog surrounds the shrine and statue of the mentor. Sacrifice sanity or sacrifice emotion to follow His footsteps to the beyond. My hand holding the ethereal sacrificial knife stays frozen in place. Time to face an uncertain fate to go beyond this hell.
Still daydreaming of an endless nightmarish industrial landscape where entities and scenarios from the most unsettling and unnervingly absurd dreams exist.
New horror movie idea: An otherworldly inter-dimensional centipede-moth hybrid spirit possesses a teenager to begin and finish an obscure yet terrifying ritual to summon its brothers and sisters upon Earth for unnervingly unknown means.
"Tie my ankles to a slab of concrete Drop myself into that dark lake in my dreams Sink to the abysmal bottom where that ethereal demon awaits Not allowed to die, instead I'm violently thrown into the dreaded depths of space Terrifying Eye of God gazes at me while I lose my sanity."
Bone-thin body black as coal Eerie eyes with a gloomy green glow Obsidian crown with eyes of death The only sound I make is the tick tock Of the clock that counts down to your dreadful end.
"It'd be beautiful if I was eternally a living corpse in the advanced stage of decay, sleeping in the ruins of a house, in an abandoned industrial urban city where it always rained and vegetation began to slowly take over. And my friendly neighbors were witches."
True happiness can be found deep in the ground at the bottom of a deep dark forgotten and forbidden lake where the fog that surrounds it never dissipates and even the wildlife actively avoids it at all times.
"I was human, just like how she was too. Yet we weren't from this reality. And the only indicator of our foreign presence was our unnerving knowledge of many things that should not be known and our eyes that glowed a ghostly purple at night."
"And if you are an atheist that believes in free will and ignores what nature is really like, then you too are clinging to an insane blind illusion for comfort. Nature and God are our puppeteers/masters. They planned every single thing either consciously or blindly."
"If you really think there's free will with an omnipresent omniscient all powerful nigh-incomprehensible God, then you are sincerely deliriously clinging to an insane blind hope."
My entire existence in one image.
"""Kinderman: The whole world is a homicide victim, Father. Would a god who is good invent something like death? Plainly speaking, it's a lousy idea. It's not popular, Father. It's not a winner. Father Dyer: There you go, blaming God. Kinderman: Who should I blame? Phil Rizzuto?"""
Letting the vines entangle themselves with my bones. Blooming flowers of dissociative darkly bliss through my soul. I surrender my mind to this forest of dreamlike madness whole. Pull me deeper into the depths of what I will soon call home.
You believe every word they vomit out without a single doubt. Keep drinking from psychotically deceitful hypocrisy incarnate's mouth. Love has blinded you all. Lust has bound us all. We always answer insanity's irresistible call No matter which form it fucking takes.
Demented stars violently pulsate and howl thunderously as he fucks my soul into the realm of eldritch fairies of fornication.
Rough sex in a dark enchanted forest with owls circled around us with their heads spinning unnaturally fast and fireflies swirling around us in geometrical patterns.
"With his touch, the angel I was becomes his succubus. I cannot resist being his submissive seductress. Bite deep into my veins and fill me with your blissful venom. Demonic lust in angelic beauty will take us into an abyss of carnal heaven."
Dissociated beyond normal conscious capability My spirit enters nigh-incomprehensible realities Brought forth to indescribable alien beings To enlighten me of the truth of what is unseen To the limited human mind and its fear of the unknown's insanity.
Just downed lots of caffeine. Apologies in advanced for a lot of hornyposting to come and a lot of delirious poetry.
"Satan, please cum in my bum."
I've been in the darkest depths of the abyss and the most terrifyingly brightest light of absolute holiness of my soul. I fear both greatly but I combine them to form an endurable realm of radiant prismatic darkness to live in.
A place where angels and demons dare not tread. The dimension of dark dreamlike delirium is where God roams and watches over those destined to eternally enter its eerie embrace.
"Lost in an endless aspen forest in a neverending sunset, being followed by inky black shadow people and my own doppelganger."
"Chased slowly by an intangible force with incomprehensible yet malefic intent, turning my blood cold. Having to blend in with the grass and become sentient plants just to escape its grasp."
This is where I want to live. 😍 Why can't this be a real place that's reachable? 😭
"I was cornered in the tennis court at the park in the depths of night (was it always night?). It was getting closer. I could feel it getting closer, I couldn't see it but I knew it was there. And the chain-linked fence that surrounded the tennis court would not let me leave."
"Ah yes, this appears to be grass. Grass coming out of an abyss."
The blue sky goes black. The white sun is eternally eclipsed. Black hole portal is formed with a ring of white divinely terrifying flame. The choirs of Heaven sound their petrifying hymns of the end of mortality for all humanity. Behold the beginning of our ominous immortality.
I'd hop onto the seductivesunday trending thingy but I don't have the thigh high stockings I used to have anymore 😔
"For some reason I feel this strong anxious dread that if I don't keep listening to lovecraftian or cosmic apocalyptic death/black metal right now, something horrible will happen to me.  Weird ass specific anxiety out of nowhere."
Uada per sanctum foeditatem.
"I just want to trip off dissociatives, have cool scary psychedelic trips, be the sexy femboy I dream of and have a nice older guy to live with and get fucked by, have a library of all the books I like and finally make the music I want to make until I become an eldritch crone."
The angel possessing my doll moved its head to each of our direction to acknowledge our presence. Then it told my neighbor that what he heard and talked to in the basement of the apartment was not his dog.
Walking the otherworldly path of darkly demented ominously serene dreams.
"I can remember the scent of the pills, makeup stains on white fabric, lint, hand sanitizer and the blood-orange smoke-filled sky vividly."
Cleaning others' messes just to get them off your back won't help with the demons you suppress. Dig deep into your unconscious and face the darkness you've repressed.
Relentlessly haunted by the scratching urge and worry that there's something unknown that I got to do when there's nothing else to do.
Demonic dissociative state swirling inside an insidious industrial warping world. Your careless consciousness is too fucking far to get back.
"The madness and indifferent determined chaotic horror of the cosmos came in the form of a black cat that napped on anyone who fell asleep, causing them to violently implode once they woke up from the most terrible dreams."
The insidious sun breathing unearthly malevolence into all that is colorful from which its eerie light touches.
Psychedelic panoramic paranormal psychosis.
He said I was like a flower of Eden lit by neon flame in the blackest abyss.
Madness spreading and festering inside every living thing. This existence is insanity incarnate.
Break the chains that hold back our absolute annihilation. Free us from hell. Free us from ourselves.
There is no hope in humankind when so many of us are blinded by ignorance of the hell we're in and the hell we put each other through. There will never be hope in our species.
Unknowingly I serve the Eye of God. For I am its eye as well. A dust speck of an eye looking at itself and up at the burning lidless one in the sky. Yet the eye in the center of all creation remains unseen. Ominous dreadful ceaseless gaze that looks upon me and through me.
"I dreamed of an Eldritch Centipede with coding dripping out of it. Sorry instructor, I didn't meant to make you vanish from my house."
"I may be a son of Jacob, but the ethereal blood of Nahemah, sister of Lilith, will forever flow through my soul. Making me what I am. A son of Heaven and a daughter of Hell."
"A paradisaical garden, vast as an ocean and beyond the cosmos. A place where no mortal should ever enter in their waking moments. For if you do not visit it in your dreams and you enter with a waking mind and body, that garden will darken and awaken ethereal nightmares."
An eye of God. Always watching the world and its obliviously demented and doomed inhabitants. And haunting those who know enough to be unsettled by its lidless eerie gaze.
Where the Outer angels watch from.
I need to remember to start writing scripture for my cosmic horror abrahamicish religious sex and magick cult.
"I used to imagine that when people were translated (look up LDS translation from mortal to immortal) that as they were lifted up towards Heaven, the most unearthly terrifying screeches and guttural screams would sound with the eeriest droning choir sounding."
"Unknowingly or willingly, you have descended into the nightmarish realm of the dark dream of delirium. Say goodbye to sleep and your sanity."
"The black fog of the night surrounds us, his touch bringing out my true self, the candle light turns violet, the stars become lunatic and the final part of the ritual begins."
Dancing in a dark dreamlike trance in the circle of the Outer One in my ritual robes as my lover lies unclothed for the final part. An eerily serene climax to be experienced to summon our ancient otherworldly mentor.
Born to quack. Live to squeak.
We had decades to advance enough to travel through the galaxies and destroy poverty but we wasted it all on wars with each other and futile wasteful corrupted goals. We truly deserve the nightmarish end that awaits this fucked species.
"""The existence of our humanity composed by puppetry from the sky The human races dwindles Weaving in and out of tribulation Wasted space and wasted potential"" - Lorna Shore"
I need this. If only it'd rain tho.
Into the deep dark vortex of dreams that I'll never be able to consciously control.
"""Nothing seems real anymore I am no stranger to hatred and lies We're lost and there's nothing left Fear is the only thing that keeps us alive"" - BORN OF OSIRIS"
Consumption of toxic digital garbage. Destruction of any future of progress. Obnoxious noxious bias lying news. We were all destined to fucking lose. Try to climb out of this hell's mouth You'll just be crucified or shot back down.
"The nothingness after death ceases to exist before our eyes. Our greatest fear and our predestined doom comes to life. The peace from this vile existence, a privilege we have been denied. All sanity is violently cast aside as we enter the inescapable afterlife."
A nightmarish crimson glow is on the black smoke-filled sky's horizon. Will the wild fire of petrifying maddening fear consume us and our homes? The end will never come.
Forever in an unsettling dream that has no beginning and that has no end.
𝔉𝔞𝔠𝔢.
You know what sounds nice right now? A camping trip and mushroom trip in the depths of the Black Forest in Germany.
Feels like I'm in something else's fever dream. I'd rather not meet that something else outside of its dream.
The daylight and the sinister essence in its beauty it brings out is gradually becoming more poisonous to my psyche with each passing day.
"Some demons are helpful, willing to guide and teach those who are willing to listen and be respectful. And then there are other demons that are just pure evil. I'll stick with the demon mentors."
There's nothing to do. There's nothing to do. There's nothing to do. There's nothing to do but let the madness consume you.
That ominous paradise with the third host of heaven still sounds nice. But so does the dark dreamlike delirious afterlife I'll be going to after I die. Heaven though...I'm still terrified of that.
I want vast beautiful white clouds in this blue sky. It's too fucking clear. This is not helping the dread.
The Marines and the Viet Cong we're both filled with anxious terror as the daylight darkened and the jungle began to let out disembodied screeches of agony and absolute horror.
Spank me please. Clap these cheeks. Be my eldritch daddy and show me the incomprehensible terrifying insanity of all reality.
When I look up at the endless blue sky I feel this dread that it's going to swallow my soul whole into a place I'd never wish to know.
"Inky black smoky wings. Transparent shifting form body. Whispers, silent screams, deranged talking Sounding from the multiple forming mouths simultaneously. A sense of the strangest dread enters the soul. An angel of delirium is what you now behold."
"Pitch black silhouettes of crosses, mosques, temples and synagogues sitting at the front of a towering vast insidious industrial factory bleeding its abysmal blackness into the crimson sky."
"Or be imprisoned in a grimy black mold infested cell. No matter what you do or where you go, you can't escape this malignant mechanical manufactured man-made hell."
So embrace this malevolently toxic life. Do you still think it's better to be alive than die? We won't let you die until we say you can die. Breathe noxious air. Bathe in polluted fresh water. Eat and drink poisoned sustenance. This is the way of life. Embrace this toxic life.
"Working in a nightmare industrial factory. See it out of your bedroom window when you go to sleep and when you wake up to go back there again in the afternoon. We put a nice graveyard between your neighborhood and the industrial hell. Even when you die, you'll still be polluted."
Drained of all my blood and filled with ammonia. Lethal vapor is all that keeps me alive.
Ascending into an inevitable daymare.
A clear static dingy fog violently twitches out of the walls giving way for the nightmarish delirious voices. I am now in this terrible mad waking dream I so willingly entered.
Gravity increases. Alien thoughts creeps in. Sanity's gradually falling to pieces and doom is impending.
"So slow, all the light is a gloomy glow. And I don't know what I wanted to do and why I'm here. My mind is being chaotically twisted into something I've always feared."
The dreadful infinite blue sky will always devour any grayness that tries to hide its terror from the vulnerable below.
Woke up and have to move like a mannequin that just gained conscious awareness and has started learning how to move otherwise I end up like The Bent-Neck Lady.
There should be a horror movie where an alien spirit possesses uncanny valley looking things such as dolls and mannequins and its mere presence terrorizes a suburban neighborhood.
"An alien dream swallows me into its inescapable heart and I constantly feel a maelstrom of dread, wonder, bliss, terror and pure strangeness."
I have a love/hate relationship with nostalgia. It's sweet poison and makes me sick if I take too much.
The strange sweet scent of Heaven's flowers in this room of demonic love fills my veins with lunatic lust for blissful nightmares.
We were lulled to sleep by the humming of the trees. The grass embraced us and took us into the deepest eeriest dreams. And now we lay here rotting slowly and horrifically but always peacefully.
A constant shifting storm of emotions with an underlying tone of anxious dread.
We are the demons that live in the light. We are the angels that give your deepest fears life. We are the saints of the cosmic horror blight. We are the witches of God's terrible lidless eye.
Gotta find someway to temporarily satisfy the carnal desires in my femboy side and my desire for dark hallucinogenic trips on the same night.
Eyes of a universe's indifferent nightmare. Wings of a seraph made of white sinister smoke. Smile of a timeless statue. Arms wide open to pull you into its angelic unnerving embrace.
Holy monstrous messiah At the heart of this petrifying parousia Bringing forth the cataclysmic cross of cosmic dementia To bring forth extra-dimensional divine terror in all of vita.
"You want to take a step in my mind, I got to warn you that you'll be lost with me in a dreadful chaotic disorientating nightmare."
Just let my body expire so my conscious energy can leave and go back home to that tranquil unsettling dimension of dark delirium.
Sorcerer of the radiant abyss where Heaven and Hell collide and bleed into unimaginable demented monstrous divinity.
Angels on my left side Demons on my right Using both their help and knowledge To walk this path of abysmal madness Walking in the darkness and the light I seek the gray's ghastly insane insight.
"It was the last good sleep I ever knew, because when I woke up I realized I became just another trifling soul fused to the bleeding white marble tower of chaos in the eye of a madly violent black hurricane of nightmares. All I could do was scream forever in terror like the rest."
"An insane organism trapped in an insane world ran by other insane organisms (with power and money) who are actually being controlled by an insane god that is beyond mortal comprehension. Yeah, you could say that I'm always filled with dread."
Prophet and Guide.
Sacrificing our humanity and morality to unstably transcend sideways. Digital energy-based nigh-omniscient hive mind paying the price of sanity's decay.
Suffering pointlessly and suffering for a purpose I know not of is equally terrifyingly bleak.
Gaze deep into my eyes and see nothing but a bleak malevolently industrialized divinely scorched demented soul.
"Your lips touch mine, and you taste black noxious smoke and oil. Would you like to taste the black mold that is my blood, pumped from my spider-infested heart?"
Sex! God! Sex! God! Chaos! God! Feel good. Feel It inside. Feel sex. Feel God. Feel good. Because all you need is to feel good. All you want is to feel good. Love sex. Love God. Love chaos. Unknowingly worship your master. Forever an insane puppet in God's demented dream.
Into Eiriel I went. I came back alive. But a part of my soul is still there in Eiriel. And a part of Eiriel is still in me and forever will be.
"I'll let her pull me down into the depths of that dark blue lake, if it means feeling that ominous peace I felt before."
Dreamlike delirium discharge #2: Pagan rituals in office spaces.  Otherworldly darkness in office building. Wild deranged animals in the office building at night when all the doors were already locked.
May the flowers lull me into my final deep sleep. May the wildlife devour my body as I dream. May the trees absorb my rotten corpse into the soil So I may finally be free from this meaningless mortal turmoil.
All my screams of existential terror and anxiety only echo back louder than before in a mocking distorted tone.
"that ""my mind is haunting or tormenting me"" out of some demented meaningless futile reason. Yet deep inside I will still know that I and my mind were never separate. And that I never built this mind and body. 𝙎𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙚𝙡𝙨𝙚 𝙗𝙪𝙞𝙡𝙩 𝙞𝙩."
"And even if I am an inhabitant of this house, I cannot say I built this house because I did not build it. Nature built it. The Puppeteer built it. For a self to build such a thing is impossible and is in the realm of the absurd supernatural. But yes, I will continue to say"
"I cannot say ""my mind is haunting or tormenting me"" because ""I"" am not separate from ""my"" mind. The body and mind are one. The self is a delirious psychic illusion. If I can look at my own mind separate from myself, doesn't that make me just an inhabitant of a house, so to say?"
"Do you really want to fight a psychic illusion of an identity that defies rationality, with the master of it all that is also the master of you? You are fighting a delirious reflection."
I am not real. Only the insanity inside and the chaotic madness that puppeteers my existence is what is real.
"""A gaping wound bleeding darkness into absolution - infecting actuality."" - The Acacia Strain"
"Batophobia was a common symptom throughout all of the civilian population. The ominous vantablack towers that stretched seemingly endlessly into the sky, with their eerie green lights that glowed through their windows, gave an overwhelming feeling of otherworldly oppressiveness."
"An endless insidious industrial landscape built upon the agony and the bones of the deceived population all for ""the greater good."""
"Chrome colored snakes of dreamlike whispers slithering through the holes of my mind, finding locked away prismatic darkness to make them finally shine out into my lost life."
"NASA or SpaceX should build a gravity drive with a spaceship, have a crew with me as the captain. We'll explore space and what's outside this reality. And when we come back, we'll bring all of Earth to where we went to show them how beautiful it is. It'll be great. And remember:"
I still want to be shot into space with my destination to be Neptune.
Welcomed with open eyes with garden of dreams inside and their bodies closed. Falling sideways into outlandish heavens that we should never know.
In the unearthly gorgeous grove of the Centipede God is where I pray for Its eerily divine guidance.
Letting the current take me down the azure river of otherworldly memories through this endless lush dark forest beyond time.
Swaying in and out of the grove of dissociation. Feels nice.
Slothface never cared for his victims' relentless waking nightmares.
Hold my hand tightly as you walk me through the field of lunatic lilies Teach me how to sing the serene song of celestial unsettling dreaming Lead me through the dark otherworldly garden of God Where I may find the endless land of the eerie paradise That waits for me after I die.
"This dread I've been feeling today is different. It's like something's coming after me, something out of a nightmare. And no matter where I go to, it will find me. I don't know what it is or why or how it's coming after me. And no, it's not death. This is something 𝙚𝙡𝙨𝙚."
"Your eyes look down at your sack of flesh.  A meat prison you never owned. You were the one that was owned By the body you call ""yours"" By the urges that came with it And by the 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 that existed before Any of us ever existed."
"The love you believed in isn't enough just like the lust in me. We are just delirious puppets. There never was a ""you"" and ""I."" Insignificant opposing sides of limited 3rd dimensional puppets screaming at each other just to try to hide from the overwhelming dread of reality."
"Abysmal flowers blooming inside my being, radiating the most ominously serene glow that will put all who see it in a dreamlike trance."
A paradisaical nightmare of pure abysmal dreamlike insanity awaits me after death. And I welcome it with open arms.

"If I could dance in the unearthly forest, with things that defied all time, where that strange peace felt so close, I could finally smile sincerely for once in so long."
Mists of delirium in dreams calling to me to enter its eerie embrace of unnatural serenity.

Haunted and disturbed by the blue sky.

Eyes open. Deprived of sensory. Worst nightmares given life. Disturbing delirious thoughts flood the mind. The soul won't shut down. The nightmare won't shut down. It will never die now.
Forgiven but forgotten. Was that entire life wasted? Was that life worth creating With a mind hellbent on deteriorating? The pain of seeing them descend Into a hell you wish would already end. A hell you wish never existed. But this is the price many pay For merely being human.
"Guess I still have some poeticness still in me. Well, time to get to work I guess. *Cracks fingers as they contort in impossible ways*"
"I stepped out into the fields, fully exposed to the fiery Eye of Heaven Blue infinity burnt away my shields; all the darkness that took years to be woven A new nameless sacred fear purified my helpless soul And the holy horrific truth of everything I was then able to behold."

"I got to be honest, all the Satan worship just seems very bland to me. Cast aside the devil dick and worship the divinely terrifying nigh-incomprehensible omniscient and omnipresent Centipede God (with wings) with me."
I'm not a misanthropist or philanthropist. I'm just a buggo going the way I was made to go in this hell called the human world while I scream from insane terror from the nightmare of this reality I experience.
"all too. Yet we will continue doing what we normally do because that is what we were made to do. And this truly petrifying dream we exist in will go on, possibly forever. So yes, I am God-fearing. But not in the way it has been taught. Not in the way many would like."

I never had freewill but I still choose what to do freely. A lunatic very real paradox.
"There was never a ""you,"" ""them,"" and ""I."" Just walking flesh aware puppets screaming about every pointless thing that keeps them surviving in God's dreadful dream like God planned, even screaming about the pointlessness of everything."
I have a soul but I never owned it ever since my creation. The soul belongs to the puppeteer.

"Maybe the people/beings of Atlantis saw how stupid and shitty the rest of mankind was, that they just said ""fuck this shit, we out"" and just sunk themselves."

"Celebrate Earth Day by laying down on the lawn, or on the grass of a park, and dying so your body will fertilize the ground and be harvested by the trees. #EarthDay"
Earth belongs to the insects; the rightful rulers and our eldritch overlords. #EarthDay
"Heaven's legions crawl through the sky A literal swarm of sacred spiders that fly The Centipede God has come to claim mankind The Devil, his demons and man are petrified The horror of Heaven has come for all of our minds To bring us to a nightmarish realm beyond time."
I will gladly shed this skin of human mortality and absurdity and become a prophet of the maddening Many Legged Lord.
The centipede savior will be feared as He will rise from the depths of the earth and tower over the cities of man. Pure terror will consume all those in His shadow.
The nightmare outside of this nightmare is coming to swallow me whole into its demented abyss. And I don't know how to stop it.
"Hellish insect overlords from the alien planet Galktheki pulling the strings of humanity, of every single man, woman and child. Millenniums of a masterpiece of sinister unknowing puppeteering, guiding us all to an malevolent maddening future."
"I saw him at the club, sitting at the bar across from the couch I was sitting at. We knew that both of us were not from this reality. Two strangers in a foreign world. We were human, just like everyone else. Yet we had the ominous otherworldly strange light in our eyes."
from a video called Metachaos. Check it out.
Life after death.
Another good track to add to the bad trip music list.
"Shoot me into a black hole, idc. It'd be better than living in this fucked up world."
Lost in a sea of fear where the depths are bottomless and a storm of hatred rages above stirring me in a maelstrom of despair.

"I stand in the muddy torn landscape filled with the dying, those hiding, and the ghastly corpses of the fallen. My eyes are locked up towards the blue sky where the clouds are deathly still. I gaze beyond the infinite blue in eerily deathly silence. No Man's Land has taken me."

A knife of rot cutting into your heart. A hand of swampy claws pushing you into the pond of fear-emitting frogs. Listen to their song as you sink into the black fog below.
"After I leave this life, the sickly green grass will hold me in its embrace. Beautiful flowers of my nightmares will bloom around and inside my corpse. And the indifferent blue sky above with its heavenly clouds will look down and say ""it is very good."""
"Don't give them the ideas of the horrible scenarios that run through your head. Or maybe it doesn't matter, because those scenarios have probably gone to them of their own will, seeking to increase the horror of the world."
"Horror hides in plain sight in the color of the daylight. Something unknowingly unsettling in the brightness, making even life feel more and more like a nightmare."
"Dark forces were drawn to me At the moment I was conceived. Forces primordial from alien dreams Seeking a puppet explorer of insanity. Abominations to reality, guiding me to their home Of eternal nightmares beyond my worst imaginings."
I let out screams but regret it once they exit my mouth for they begin to reverberate violently throughout my consciousness in a disturbing distorted version as a mockery to my agony and fear.
The terrifying thing is that my paranoia (being the demented puppeteer it is) has been (for a while) leading me down this very similar path of sinister synchronicity that this person went down. And the most horrifying thing is that I don't think I can stop. I wish I could.
"Dreadful despair will always be part of me. No matter what. Even on decent days, it will be there in the depths of my mind, waiting to bloom again throughout my entire soul like some flower from a nightmarish abyss."
"He fears many things, many possible and (to mostly everyone else) impossible things. Why? Because in this existence that he's in and due to the dark experiences of his own, any horrific thing is possible. Even the most incomprehensible things. That man full of so much fear is me."

"Dread, fear and hatred swarming inside me like a ghastly inky black swarm of nightmarish flies and wasps."
And I will fucking hate all of you for eternity. For the children you lusted after and violated You and your kind are painfully eradicated. For the families you threatened and the lives you ruined May the Devil cast you into the deepest pit of anguish.
May your kind be torn slowly by wolves and lions As your flesh is burning from napalm for hours And that you will be resurrected to suffer again and again For the depraved vile vermin you are and for your lack of regret. You are the worst cancer of humanity

"Vile depraved humans running freely to satisfy their perverted addictions to the innocent young. The world of mankind is corrupt and fucked, we have failed as a species and deserve eradication."
Sick degenerate men are preying on the young and justifying their behavior and what makes it worse is that there are people that defend them. It makes me sick to the fucking stomach that they run free and that they even threaten those who oppose their vile filthy desires.
"Sancti horribilis lux, dux mihi."
Forever I will be watched over by the Seraph of divine terror. Angelic petrifying fear within and above me.
The body is so weak The spirit is worn down Sanity is torn to pieces But the soul is still bound To this perilous physical realm. All the terror there is will be felt.
"This paranoia, simultaneously divine and hellish. Is this God-given awareness of multiple dreadful realities? Or is this insidious insanity? Is it both? Nonetheless I shall let it guide me into the unearthly colorful abysmal fog of the unknown."
"Because of love, I fell for your twisted lies And ignored all the horrid things you justified. Now I see that the light of love blinds the eyes. I would rather burn in truth's divine gloomy light for all time. If I must, I will take up this knife And take my carnality's life."
Trapped between the eternal war of dark and light. Torn from a hand of burning desire and a hand of ominous paradise. They're both taking me to a terror beyond comprehension.
"Faithful despairing servant of God, wandering the ruthless realms of violation and nightmares materialized. Pointlessly trudging through the mud of survival as the frigid black rain of fear soaks to the soul."
"That old building has shifted forms many times. From a bland school of painful memories, to a psychiatric hospital filled with tormenting ghosts and now to an eerily unusual university where an abysmal fog of ancient dread engulfs the place."

"If being a femboy sex worker includes being paid in molly, weed and shrooms, then sign me up."
Cursed to be in this body of agony. Cursed by God. Cursed by those that I severed ties with. Cursed past. Cursed present. Cursed future. Cursed forever.
So the gradually increased haunting of me begins. So be it. I'll be in the nightmare beyond while you swim in the muck of your depraved lust and futile grudges in Hell.
"I'm just another person to fuck. Just another mind to manipulate for your own selfish sick purposes. Just another soul devoured by malevolent madness. Just another temple that's been fouled into a temple of black mold swarming with centipedes, serpents and spiders."
Deranged dust mites sucking the sanity out of each other and the life from the trivial rock they're clinging to that floats in the dark ocean of the indifferent cosmos.
"When the light fails to save you, when the darkness fails to comfort, the Void of endless emptiness and the abyss of infinite madness awaits to take you into their home."
Constantly being pulled deeper in the vicious vortex of the vast monstrous mouth of God as its teeth shred away my sanity and will inevitably swallow my soul whole into the final nightmare.
Nightmares of suburban parks at sundown.
Salvation through annihilation. Made pure as a blank void of light that petrifies the mind of the mortal observer.
Thanks @v0idp0ster for getting me into these guys. @FuneralWakeMI is heavy as fuck.

Join the Cult of the Omniscient Centipede. It's crawled through the cracks of time and space. Been in the darkness behind the wall of reality. It has seen and it knows all that is beyond our human grasp.
The lake of roaches that broadcasts unsettling messages into the mind is there when you need it. Let the signal crawl into your subconscious.
A transcendence that can only be achieved through death and facing the terror that awaits beyond.

Consuming 10 grams of shrooms and then locking myself in a dark empty room with built in surround sound speakers playing the most terrifying anxiety-inducing music as my true way of self-harming and self-help.
I was a consumer of abysmal knowledge. Then I transformed briefly into an angel of terror. And now I am a cursed bug that crawled out of that angel's corpse to find myself in an eternal nightmare where logic and reality no longer apply. Pure chaos.
"""I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. This is my dream; this is my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor, and surviving."" - Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now"
Fighting for my insignificant life against hellish sentient geometry that tears apart the consciousness of any living thing nearby in unimaginable ways.
"Just in case for those who are confused to who I am, I was/am originally AbysmalKnowledgeConsumer. I just changed my names a couple of times because some of them didn't fit. (the angel shit got old fast). But now I found one that fits and I'm sticking with this one. etc etc."
Existentially and mentally I feel like the space beetle in Thumper except it never ends and I'm forced to uncontrollably race towards and battle nightmarish entities just to keep moving forward with no end in sight.

Some nice meditative doom metal music that'll make the daylight feel like its darkening.
Floating in an expansive fog of ammonia.
You can have your forests. My home is a vast nightmare haunted industrial factory with a dense forest of pipes and fog of steam and smoke.
Sat down in the shadow of a mundane forgotten building. There was no cooling comfort in the shade it brought. So I just let myself blacken into a shadow and became one with the uncaring warm shade.
The old organ still plays its doomy music in the flooded chapel that lays in the misty marshes. Attracting the ancient spirits every morning and night.
"I'll be in the eldritch bayou of space, for now."
I am the crocodile of the witches you did and didn't burn.
"While you all fall in love and mindlessly fuck each other I willingly fall into a freshly made grave. The sound of moans drowned out by the black rain As I calmly drown, being freed from the world's mire."
Hiding in the ruins of buildings from whatever sounded that terrifying thunderous horn in the sky that shook the earth.
"When the wraith screeches from within the horrendous atrocious light of my soul, the blood of all those hear its cries will go cold."
"We spent centuries looking for God and meaning, but when we finally found it we wished that we never did. A crippling revelation leaving us paralyzed in perpetual existential terror and dreadful despair."
Sacrifice reason and sight of reality for temporary comfort that won't save you from the omnipresent and omniscient indifferent infinite insanity.
Torn from your roots and thrown into the monstrous maw of God. All of the faith in the things that gave you life is now gone. Forgotten in the sinister stomach acid of time's decay.
Sometimes when I share specific abnormal experiences on here I feel like I'm breaking some type of guideline/code/law from some other 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘤𝘦.
Something foreign came into my mind while I was in the state between wakefulness and sleep as I was sitting in my chair. It told me without saying anything out loud that I wasn't the only one who could see and feel things beyond this realm; things from the realm of dreams.
Emaciated emissary of the eternal holy ruinous gospel. Willingly starved of the the sin of ego. A walking corpse possessed and guided by the petrifying angels of truth.
Ostracized the ones who glorified the teacher of sacred terrible truths that terrified those who still pointlessly clung to their prisons of flesh and the malefic meaningless pleasures it produces.
"One of my favorite movies of the 2010s. Planning on reading the book by Jeff VanderMeer sometime, hopefully soon this year."
"Its always listening. It knows everything, everywhere at every time in all of existence. And it knows that we know so very little."
Through the primordial preternatural currents of fearsome celestial determined chaos my metamorphosis gradually draws nearer to completion.
"An empty decaying hospital, abandoned my man long ago. But something ancient and foreign to this universe has taken residence in this building, filling it with a dense strange and eerie atmosphere."
Sacred terror will shatter the minds of mankind and show them for what they all are in this petrifying cosmos of infinite unknown.
Humankind is the original sin and the root of all evil of this world. This foul futile species must be cleansed off the face of this planet. Off the face of existence.

The earth will open to the abyss beneath your feet. You will fall to your long-deserved doom. A place where there is no vile pleasure you can indulge in. A place where you are alone in eternal existential anguish.
Supermundanae mirum Ezekiel is who/what I see myself as. And I plan to fully become it; that eldritch Ezekiel.
"I strongly despise how my body aches, how it sounds in all its various forms and how enslaving it is. I hate this flesh and bone prison."
The flesh and ego clouds the mind of seeing reality in its purest form.
The truth of everything is terrifying and should be respected. It is real divine terror just like the Unfathomable Outer One that created all and destroys all.

"My near-future plans: get a vasectomy, control (or kill) my libido, meditate to communicate with the eldritch angels and transcend from this awful human life."

Consider me cosmic horror theistic. Still a pessimist and antinatalist of course.
"""I wrote your name in my book as you came into this world I have had an eye watching your entire life See now, your name fades with time And now you shall return from whence you came Delivered from this mortal coil"" Azrael, Angel of Death by Peter Mohrbacher"
I no longer want to be trans. I just want to be a pile of ashes because I fucking hate living in this fucked up world.
How can I not be paranoid and filled with hatred in a world where sick people prey on the young and vulnerable and find pleasure in it? Especially when so many like them harm the innocent when they don't get what they want? And defend themselves? I am disgusted of our species.
The eerie eldritch angelic choirs welcome me as I pass through the gate to the divine terror of the unknown. This horror in the heavens and skies is now my home.
Doom and hatred is all I feel. But I am comforted by the fact that even both God and the Devil support this hatred that flows through my entire soul.
"Fusing yourself to the tree of manipulative lust, you are stuck in the same pile of mud. But I let myself become absorbed by the shoggothian mass of disenchanting disgust of the unholy creation of man, always moving forward to tear apart the filth of narcissistic human worms."
This world is a concentration death camp full of the insane and run by the criminally insane. Hope and love will lead you to the same destination: the pits and chambers of madness and death.

Why the fuck would I want to take pleasure in the flesh that gives me pain? I would rather take a fuckton of ketamine and put a bullet through my brain.
"Archangel of annihilation, come unto me and take me away to the divine oblivion."
"I'd rather be in Babi Yar in 1941, naked, cold, and shot in the back of the head as my corpse falls onto another than fall in love."
I will let this scorching disillusioning hatred inside me burn until there's nothing left of my existence.
I was manipulated. You should be castrated. Your lies can't help you now. Suffer alone. Fucking rot slow and painfully as your God and Devil forget you forever. You are a cancer. No hope will shine down on you. Not even the hope for a peaceful rest.
"It's circling just outside, along the edge, with a welcoming hand of inky black and eyes of heavenly white, offering me peace at last. I keep telling myself I don't need it, but I can't ignore its offer forever."
"I thought it'd no longer cross my mind anymore. I was a fool, thinking you'd never be the reason it would. But now that old familiar darkness of self-slaughter is creeping back in, with a new sinister grin. Shall I let it win? If you don't want it to, keep your fucking distance."
Surrender to the gloom. Embrace the impending doom. Make your room your tomb. Let the pitch black despair inside you bloom.
Flying foxes in suits with 8 angelic wings circle above me as I make my way into the daunting mystical land of their home.
"The plucking of the strings, the dreamlike atmosphere it brings I could get lost in these flooded dark woods for the rest of eternity Alone and forgotten by all of reality Surrounded by things that defy the definition of alive A memory of a place I've never been in this life."
Forever in a dissociated state of consciousness in a realm of ominous surreal fantasy.
"Endless horizon bound, with no ultimate goal to be found. Burning countless souls alive just to get nowhere. You will find only fear and madness here."

I am the priest with robes of black and a scarf of white with the black symbols of the Outer Ones. I shall baptize you in the font of blood of the hopelessly existentially tormented.
"The walls twist into malicious mocking faces. The ceiling rips itself apart, exposing me to the indifferent insidiously infinite skies that change rapidly. The floor sways like trees in a mad breeze. Sleep and wakefulness is no longer there for me. I am in between."
You hopped over the wrong fence into the wrong bedroom and now the shadows are coming for you.
"Mel Gibson with Joaquin Phoenix eyes, holding a black egg, sitting in the chair across from your bed at night, staring madly at you."
Twist the body and rinse the mind. Is your friend a box or a face contorted with a sinister mouth and mutilated? The lady from the radio in your disconnected headphones wants you to know you should become useless transparent ink.
"This flesh is a foul prison of torment. Why would I ever want it back after I die? I'd rather be consciousness alone, floating in the void or the abyss."
I can feel it in my soul The disgust and hatred This life is merciless and cold And my body is a torture prison. Shred my flesh away from the bone. Free the spirit within and send it home To the endless abyss of nightmares materialized. There's nothing worth living for in life.
Let the trees harvest my decaying body and finally make something beautiful out of my disgusting meaningless existence.
I'd rather be a corpse becoming one with the earth than fall in love.
"If you can, break those bonds of self-revolving comfort and lose yourself in the abyss of indifferent madness where the stars shine with lunacy, the clouds form your worst nightmares and the birds screech songs of mockery of your futile meaningless existence."
", no meaning that we can (and probably will ever) comprehend."
I was ordained high priest of that dark ancient order. I am the only one in this forsaken transcendent church who can commune with the Elder and the God of all. The God of every reality. And I see the truth: we do not choose our fate. It does. And there is no meaning to any of it
"clearly remember it enough. It is not a place that anyone would ever want to go to. Only the masochistically deranged addicted to its insidious insanity. And once you enter, it marks you. Its mark stays with you even when you've left. It's part of me as I am part of it, forever."
"The nightmarish dimension that I entered left its permanent mark on my mind and possibly my body as well. It's still there, all around me. All those inky black horrors and disturbingly demented voices. The pure malevolent dread I felt there that can never be matched. I can still"
"When I'd put the seashell to my ear, I wouldn't hear the waves crashing down on the shore. But instead I'd hear a highly unusual sounding horn blare thunderously, joined by blood-chilling alien voices singing in one note."
"Maybe I'm just an escaped strange spirit, from an insane asylum from a strange eerie dimension beyond this reality, that possessed a fetus to blend in and I've realized I'd rather go back home to the darkly demented dream realm of weird horrifying chaos, because fuck this world."
"The rhythmic plucking of the strings of his acoustic guitar created a melody of beauty and foreboding. The wind was a constant soft breeze, gently blowing the moonlit and starlit grass all around us. It all felt like I was in a strange dream, yet I wasn't the dreamer."
Earth's long lost cosmic cathedral. The outer walls of otherworldly white marble with the inner walls black as night. Stained glass windows of those eldritch angels whose many eyes pierces the soul and sees all. And eerily serene choirs echoes throughout this ominous holy place.
Angel of paranoia on my right side. Angel of paralyzing enlightenment on my left side.
"Vivid visions of an empyrean forbidden to the eyes of the many, haunting the few who were chosen to witness its dismaying beauty. Sprouting unwanted sacred nightmares every time they sleep."
Lifting my petrified eyes to the cataclysmic cross He holds. The terrifyingly divine Son in an endless vortex of angels that leads our way to the eerily celestial light of eternal paradise. Its light casting the most abysmal darkness upon the world. Inescapable salvation.
"Willingly walking into the fearsome light of angels. Countless dreadfully illuminating eyes seeing my entire soul. Soothing my reasonable fears with their unsettling serene songs. Gently lifted like a leaf on the wind, upwards to the horrors of Heaven that awaits my arrival."
"Devoured by divinity, digested into the incomprehensible horror of infinity."
Woke up in the wrong chapel again. Heard disturbingly distorted disembodied choir voices and a deranged organ being played.
My mind is an abysmal maelstrom that devours and vomits and devours again any saneness I had left as it collapses into itself over and over again.
Was there even an identity or just a screaming noxious cloud of insanity?
"Paranoia tightening its ruthless unrelenting grip on my sanity. I will never truly feel safe in this body, in this life, in this world."
Visions of a literal uncanny valley.
Cast aside thy freedom For the ghastly glory of Heaven Eternal paradise void of escape Rejoice! He has risen! Sealing thine petrifying fate Horrifying Holy Saturday Enter the eerie embrace Of angelic decay of thine sanity Rest no more Know no relief of sleep Rest no more.
"Blood-chilling choirs of Heaven echoed through the cold cosmos, singing of His Resurrection. Hell howled hatred and fear. The disillusioned wept out of soul-crushing dread for what will come to pass after all die."
"Rising from the grave, what once was reality has been irreversibly bent. The door to a new divine nightmare opened by the will of the dreaded Father and His Son's ominous destiny."
"If I was a girl, I'd be the girl all the guys would only dare each other to stick their dick in me if they wanted to lose both their virginity and sanity like I'm some eldritch succubus."
I took a bit more than usual amounts of caffeine int he early afternoon and I'm not gonna be able to sleep until Saturday night. Oh well. Time to do russian roulette with what creepy/terrifying as fuck movies to watch to kill the time.
The heart is beating fast Dread is building This decayed haven won't last I can't fall asleep This banal hell is leaving me behind In a nightmare worse than anything I could ever imagine or understand All those nightmares I've ever had I experience all at once with no end.
She gave me her heart But I wanted her hopeless soul Needed sanity to devour And her hope to swallow whole The abyss possessing me gave me an eternal goal To spread terror into God and the Devil's own Heaven and Hell's gates to me are closed Leaving me and her in the unknown.
Quite a lot of the nightmarish trip music I've posted has helped a lot with flowing my thoughts into words through Twitter actually. So this is kind of a little insight of my fucked mind lol.
Who wants me to share some nightmarish bad trip music with them? I'll post it for you all to listen to if you're even interested. Idontreallycare if you're not.
"I have entered a hell, losing all sense of time and self.  The feeling of soul piercing and tearing eyes  Watching me experience this incomprehensible nightmare Fills me with a dread I have never felt before How I wish I never came back to life."
"The insidious illumination of insomnia awakens me To an abysmal light that consumes my whole vision. It's too overwhelming, I fear greater for my sanity Petrified with a terror of the hell of infinity.  My consciousness spreads into everything Feeling their confusion and agony."
"I traverse the realms of forsaken cancerous nightmares that all fear to roam. Just for the sake of morbid curiosity, to see what should not be seen."
The Abyss echoes its thunderous roars of our foul futility and the madness it feeds upon.
"Only a name, only a face You remembered me far too late Forgotten by the human race Lost in the indifferent embrace Of the horror of time and space I never really existed There was just a puppet of flesh A puppet of consciousness imprisoned Now doomed to a monstrous unknown fate."
The insidious insanity of existence will go on forever no matter what any of us do.
"Unfathomable evil hides behind the beauty of daylight, spreading terror and madness through every mind. And no one pays attention or even bats a fucking eye."
"Unearthly bizarre blessings of Mirum Deus upon you, brothers and sisters. May your lives be unspeakably abnormal."
"Billions born, suffer, dying and dead. A global ritualistic sacrifice to bring forth the petrifying Parousia where the Son returns in His true terrifying divine form to bring every soul to the horror of Heaven, whether they want to or not."
Our screams and cries and moans and groans and howls are the sick sinister symphony of life.
I wiped away your bloody tears from your worn down soul. I baptized you in the black river of God's dark Eden and filled your soul with its divinely ominous colors. Let go of everything that gives you comfort and give into this dark Garden of Eden of beautiful nightmares.
I rose from the grave to a rotting world. They don't even want to be saved They just want to be loved for the worms they are. These children of Father are depraved Just like the third of Heaven He casted out. When I return I will send you all into the mouth Of pure chaos.
"When you're walking in the park at noon, don't look up to the blue sky where the glowing shimmering red contorted man falls forever, or you will go flat, bend in half and scream as you are lifted up into the blue sky to join him."
"Some miss their childhood. I miss my seniorhood where I'm an old crone hag with some eldritch form of dementia where I'm pissing Lovecraftian symbols on the sidewalk, sitting on the porch on my rocking chair eerily staring at everyone and hissing unearthly incantations."
"All I can do with this nightmare-filled paranoia, that has been with me for most of my life, is to endure it and wait to see if it's telling the truth. To see if it's unfathomably insane prophecies come to pass."
"And when he died, his consciousness was stretched out over the vastness of space. More and more his sanity felt like it'd finally be torn to oblivion, but it kept being pulled with no end in sight. He would scream if he could, but it'd be muted anyways by the uncaring vacuum."
"sight from the cold indifferent truth. You're just a puppet. We are all just puppets to an incomprehensible puppeteer. And even if you try to hide in sex or drugs, in reality it will never help. You're only fooling yourself. We are damned puppets, damned puppets for eternity."
"Love, lust, ecstasy, happiness, wonder and beauty are pointless, meaningless and insignificant in the grand scheme of everything. They only add to the pain and madness. Agony and malefic madness is eternal. We are all puppets with the thick fog of self-centered ego clouding our"
To be lost in an ocean of alien color that emits sounds which sedate and then disintegrate the body while stimulating and soothing the mind. Absorbing the consciousness into its endless currents of minds that flow to the place beyond everything we know.
I'd rather be a walking statue of marble than be in this atrocious human body.
"The blood turned dark ivy green as the flesh turned into white marble and the bones to obsidian. And his eyes became orbs of sinister ocean blue. The ominous place in his subconscious became one with him, now taking form in this world."
"Swallowed whole into the green embrace of the earth, where the grass chokes out the last breath, where the eldritch trees sing an eerie lullaby for my final sleep &amp; where I'll fertilize the ground with my decay so I too may become an eldritch tree to do the same to the living."
"Towering stone pillars of screaming petrified souls are the foundation of this sinister empire of life. And I will join them, screaming. Paralyzed and fused to the pillar of unspeakably tormented souls of the dead. Helpless and mercilessly mortified, forever."
May I continue walking alone down this endless abysmal cave that leads further into the Abyss until I too become like the travelers before me with their souls fused into the cavern walls and constantly letting out screams of pure eternal terror.

The Lifer by Primitive Man.
"And now black mold and oil keeps his heart of wasps and spiders beating. He only breathes noxious black smoke to keep himself under control. And if you try to get to him, his heart of wasps and spiders will burst and agonizingly rip you to shreds."
"The fire inside his skull melted his brain through his sockets as his eyes retreated within to reproduce a new mind of eyes that only sees the terrifying insanity of everything, void of emotion and ego."
His integrity withers as his sanity is skinned and burnt. The morals he once knew fail to save him from the dreadful mocking laughs that petrify and play him like an accordion.
A brain soaked with black holy water and placed in a suit  of dry flesh that wishes to turn to malevolent dust.
What dwells within the abyss behind the walls is not demonic nor angelic. It's something else. A nightmare materialized into our reality.
"I was born darkly demented in an insane world, but this insomnia is just intensifying the madness and horror."
Some music so weird it sounds like what would play in my strangest nightmares and unsettling as hell salvia trips.
Time to listen to harsh dark drone ambient and stare at the wall until I fall asleep.
The fire of hatred quickly consumed by the darkness of dread and the petrifying light of the truth of existence.
Send this earth into the realm of pure chaos. Let us be purged of our lies that we live off of. Immerse us all into inescapable nightmares materialized. This is what must be done for the best of humankind.
Witches that even both Heaven and Hell fear. Practitioners of strange ominous rituals to gain outlandish magic that does not belong in this universe. To gain insight to what unimaginable things lie beyond this reality.
Feeling like a human transformed into a young crocodile in a dark muddy murky swamp with a bunch of very old crocodiles that are teaching me to to be better at crocodiling.
"Patient, coldly calculative and older than time itself They bend time, space and reality to their needs For purposes we have no chance of comprehending. The dread is unlike anything you've ever felt. No matter how deep you dig to hide You cannot escape their lidless eyes."
This is a total mood for me. So simple yet evokes this sense of dark foreboding. I feel like I'm on top of a mountain gazing out into the ocean at night as something indescribably alien comes my way to take me away into the outer realm.
"Black rain fell from the cloudless sky on the wailing and withering as an uncaring mockery of our ceaseless pointless anguish, drowning us in rivers blacker than the night."
Eldritch millennium Ezekiel Granted visions of the glorious terror of Heaven And its celestial nightmarish angels. Yog-Sothothian Jethro Opening the eyes of blessedly doomed mankind To all the terrible truths they choose to behold.
Imprisoned in this insidious flesh to experience futile sacred suffering in the name of the nameless king of heavenly chaos.
"A disciple of the Uncanny Dissociation Christ. Where just by speaking the word of the eldritch savior, all those who listen dissociate from their bodies and their consciousness is pulled into the outer realm."
"Performing the ritual of the holy horror that watches all ceaselessly from the outer realm. The temple's walls are black. The stained glass windows of divine horrific angels of outer knowledge shine ominous teal light into the ritual room, to guide us towards petrifying insight."
Something ancient and dark watches me from the oak woods and from my own subconscious. Simultaneously stalking me from within me and from outside. Lidless ethereal eyes always watching me.
"The blood-freezing word of God flowing through my soul, feeding off of my sanity and devouring away my hope."
Mind of pale white preternatural centipedes emanating the aura of determined chaos.
"I believe that one of the most nightmarish things I can do is make a ventriloquist dummy of myself and then draw the mark of the incomprehensible Puppeteer on it. And when I die, my conscious soul will be moved into that dummy and stay there, forever."
"Terror of the light violently colliding with the indifferent disillusioning darkness, eternally tearing apart my mind."
With every breath I take I become cursed. With every breath I do not take I stay cursed. The Sun watches coldly down upon me. The moon has not answered my cries. The terrible infinity of the blue sky devours me.
In my metamorphosis in the dense mad forest at the depths of the murky black lake where ancient mad abysmal gods congregate.
I walk through this tunnel of screaming corpses that ascends into what awaits me after death: pure horrendous chaos.
And now I become black putrefying darkness that is darker than the void of space itself. Rotting away everything I touch.
"She was just a mask, she wasn't real. Unceasingly-corrosive-black mold-infested darkness of the abyss wore her face to draw me into its embrace. And now I'm drowning in its bottomless black mud and the last love I had in me suffocates to death."
"In the past hour, I've gone from feeling despair to hatred and now to anxiety-laced dread. What a colorful morning it's already been"
"Not falling, but being torn to countless pieces in infinite unspeakable ways over and over again."
"The worst hallucinogenic trip that lasts even after death, trapping your consciousness in its nightmare and gets worse with every minute that passes."
"Ceilings made of mirrors as doorways for fearsome ethereal beings to enter our world. And when they come through, the atmosphere in this old house turns foul."
"I'd love to camp the night or weekend at the Aokigahara Forest. Not to commit neckrope, but to let the eerie silent haunting atmosphere soak into my soul. Kind of a ominous form of meditation."
An eternal place of absolute purity. No sin. No freewill. No pain. Only endless controlled bliss. Still puppets made into angelic abominations. That is what Heaven really is. A terrifying eternity of inescapable bliss where nobody will ever have control or real choice.
"The more I think deeply over the concept of Heaven, including every religious one, the more the existential dread grows inside."
Heaven has eaten another hopeless soul and digested it into an eldritch angel of divine terror.
Ancient scriptures of sinister salvation spilling forth the darkest foulest madness into your soul. Abominable angelic choirs reverberating eternally through your mind.  Drink of the ghastly gospel as Heaven devours your soul.
Forced resurrection inevitably leading to my sanity's absolute annihilation.
We will never know enough to save ourselves from the nightmarish insanity we're eternally trapped in.
The only thing that I surely know is real is fear and the dread I feel everyday. And that we know so little of existence and this reality.
"Crucified, stabbed, drowned and burned alive. He will never fucking die. And I still see him in the mirror looking back with those piercing eyes of eerie vile light."
"Decapitate myself, my neck becomes a fountain. Terror can still be felt like a collapsing mountain Crushing me down, leaving no air for me to breathe. There is no relief when the final rest cannot be reached. Losing my head is what I feared. Only out of horror I can shed tears."
"The darkest cloud consuming me, raining down black mold into my mind. Corroding what's left of my soul. And worst all, I want it to swallow me whole until I am nothing at all."
That ominous serene feeling overwhelming me as the seaweed gently pulls me down to sleep for the lake to have my body to keep. And my watery eerie ghost to haunt all my loved ones' dreams.
"I should've drowned in that murky green lake. But I guess another lake or the ocean perhaps, for another time."
"I want to be with my 3rd host of Heaven brothers and sisters, in our unholy paradise of ungodly white marbled ancient architecture in a sinister green jungle-forest."
"If I ever die, toss my body in the forest and let nature take care of my corpse."
Just one of those days where I have to drown myself in dark ambient and stare out into the beyond just to make it through today. Yay.
"The eyes of something that is beyond words to describe its vast horror. It is truly something terrible. And every time I look in the mirror, I see it looking back at me through those nebulous eyes that are not mine, that were never mine."
The crew's all dead and only I survived. I didn't lay a finger on them. They all died from pure terror from what we saw and heard. Yet I lived. I am damned for all eternity to remember every second of what happened vividly while I'm awake and when I dream. The stars are eyes.
"No matter what we do or where we go, we will always be  living hell."
Suffocating from the maelstrom of madness of mankind but never dying.
Trying to talk reason and reality to a species that was programmed to be deliriously ignorant to anything that'd make them uncomfortable with their own existence is fucking futile.
Don't mind me. Just floating through eldritch ghost haunted lands and cities of ruin under an endless dark gray sky.
Skies are completely gray and it's raining. Perfect time to listen to this beauty of dark ambient in its entirety.
"Apathetic damnation to a darkly demented dimension ruled by an abominable delirious deity that calls itself the ""divine God."""
"Writhing, seething, hideously contorting body as the once-human howls and wails out all of its maddening hate-filled despair."
"The true light of God Burning all life until all is gone. The light within our hands, hotter than the sun. Peace is reached when total nuclear was has begun. Our chance for salvation Through nuclear annihilation."
Surrounded by hanging corpses that eerily float with no rope or cord around their necks in these dense unearthly woods. Hands agonizingly stretched outwards to have the living join them.
Right now I just want to lay down on warm moss and grass at a tall tree in a misty forest and fall into a deep sleep.
My spirit animal is actually a centipede-cicada hybrid holding a human eye.
As Death left me to a new malicious misery The Sirens of the eternal nightmare that awaits me Sang a sinister song through voices of eerie beauty Showing me my true horrifying inescapable destiny.
Dreams have been mundane nightmares lately. I need terrifying nightmares that make me wake up in a cold sweat and frightened of the dark again!
"To see what no man should see. To see what sees everything and everyone that has existed, that does exist, and that will exist, all that will die and all that will enter the nightmare that awaits some of us after death. A disturbing dark descent into the demented truth."
"Slow grim march through the deep gray mud full of the corpses of the fallen, walking towards the dark dense endless woods where things of unknown form and origin roam and wait for fresh minds to feed on."
Cursed children born of the monstrous light. We are blight fearing the darkness of what resides within when we are the monsters exposed in broad daylight. Embrace the darkness of the eternal night and the primordial fears inside.
The streets became twisted and the houses bent at odd angles. Behind me was no longer the familiar streets and houses. I was somewhere else. I was just walking the normal route I always did and I stumbled somewhere I shouldn't have been and stalked by something I can't fathom.
"It was just a normal walk through the neighborhood at night. But dread gradually built up from nowhere until it bloomed into an abominable flower of terror and paranoia. Something following, something watching, something following me. Yet there was nothing and nobody in sight."
The walls slowly falling inwards in the dark room stained with memories of losing the mind and mindless sex. Drained of hope. Void of protection from the things in the abyss behind the walls of that room. Waiting for the right time to take the soul into a deeper darker nightmare.
Dreams I had or that were there waiting for me before my birth. Like endless green grassy hills under a black sky with violet and white clouds. A doomful world in the guise of otherworldly beauty.
Lying down on sickly green grass and scarlet and violet flowers amongst a black river with her and him in this disowned dark Garden of Eden.
My conscious soul in a swirling chaos of ominous neon dark colorful clouds of nebula and sparks in the infinite black abyss. The curse of human birth awaits for my consciousness to inhabit the hellish prison of the human body in the nightmare of existence.
"There are old dark forces in every suburb, city and town. But there are far more ancient and darker forces in the vast indifferent woods, forests and jungles. And how I would love to venture through those disowned paradises to discover those ancient dark and strange forces."
Sardonic saint of the sickening celestial sect.
Martyr of malevolent madness.
Surrender to the sinister despair As the dread thickens the air. Hear His horrifying heavenly choirs Praising this determined maddening chaos. Give up thy soul and thy sanity to Him And your hopeless path to the nightmarish Heaven can begin.
Every moment of pain when the knife enters the heart Crafted by God's divinely demented hands. Every second of violation planned before it began. Seeing the truth of His ways will tear your mind apart. The Devil merely a pawn of his ghastly game. You will know horror's true name.
Oceans of bottomless black water where the ancient petrifying light rises from its sleep.
"We made it through the eerily serene undead in the frigid snow and the ancient wood spiders, but the Dreamer woke up and all went abysmally black. I hope my comrades, wherever they are, are alright. But hope here is unreliable and futile."
"I saw him running in fear, saying something like ""it was here."" So I checked at the edge of the road that lead downhill. 12 horribly mutilated and contorted bodies formed its symbol. And as I ran down the road alongside the mountain, I saw more and more of its mark."
Horrid gravelly distorted voice in the static of the unknown radio station roaring unintelligible things deep into my mind late at night.
"If man had its eyes painted lidless on its puppet soul, we'd either most likely go mad with terror or go on to nowhere, void of ego and the illusion of self. Nobody puppets realizing what they really are."
"Every time insomnia hits and I don't sleep at all, I start seeing the horrific banality of everything more clearly."
"Somewhere beyond this place, it's waiting for me, patiently. It's in no rush and neither am I. I don't know completely what it is, but it sure as hell knows me, more than I even know myself."
Our screams of terror in unison delight our darkest nightmares incarnate.
"Never free. Never truly alive. I'd want to die if the end for me wasn't a lie. I, a puppet made and controlled by  Something beyond my mind's sight. Will my sanity survive? No. There is no hope. There is no point. I am its toy And so are all of you. Forever fucking doomed."
"Absolute apathy awakening the god of emptiness to my presence, seeking another puppet to feed on its hollowness."
"Indifference creeping into my soul like a shadowy figure blacker than night slowly fazing through the walls in my house, floating towards me to reside within me."
"The eighth seal opened Heaven and Hell collide into one abomination The truth of the end, mistaken Masses of mankind, misguided God devours every soul into its endless incomprehensible maw Faith in a plan of salvation written by man as gospel was your downfall."
"Immersed in this hell of happiness, where meaninglessness has meaning Insanity is the only light here which feeds off of pointless agony Aflame with lies that give you breath Ascend into an abyss of malefic madness Give reason and saneness to your god God of psychosis."
Fear the Sun. Dread the sunny skies. Embrace the night. For there are maddening horrors in pure daylight.
"Always watched by the terrifyingly piercing eye of God; the Sun, in the infinite blue skies of hidden terrors that would tear apart the mind if gazed upon too long."
Always watching me from the shelf.
Bad psychedelic trip in a dark room surrounded by mannequins and ventriloquist dummies with disturbing unnerving music constantly playing.
"""There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods."""
"I always sleep with the fan on, always have for most of my life, and it's out of a habitual fear. And despite my fascination in dark horrific things, I don't even dare put myself in absolute silence."
"I've always feared silence. I hate the sound of lots of people, but I still am deeply afraid of silence. There's always a sickening gut-wrenching fear that consumes my entire being whenever it's deathly quiet. It feels almost like a primordial deeply ingrained fear."
She sings to me in a hauntingly off monotone voice. The lyrics are sinister and strange. It fills me with the deepest ghastly despair I have ever felt. And I want more.
Midnight serenade that turns both our flesh and minds inside out into twisted creatures that survive off of people's blood and emotions.
All the horrors in this reality seen happening all at once in a barbed wire fence in the void.
"I will be the old creepy crone rocking back and forth on my old creaky chair on the front porch from dawn to nightfall, gazing out to the beyond. And for all those that pass by or looks upon me will feel something horrible that one can only feel in nightmares."
"""There are no feelings in my black fucking heart Loathing and panic as you die in the dark I come from the water I will drag you down below"" - The Acacia Strain"
"""We exist inside a wasteland Rolling fields of agony Bodies hanging lifeless In a forest of dying trees The last great disciple of the human race Slipping through the cracks of time and space"" - The Acacia Strain"
"Bury me in the swamp or in the marshes. I want my undead corpse to be covered in muck, mud, moss and horrifically soggy."
Let the fear of the eternal nightmare that awaits me devour the agonizing past and then place a strange petrifying peace deep inside my soul.
"Ignorance programmed into numerous human minds to propagate, creating more minds for the abysmal God that is a monstrosity to reality, feeding off of fear and insanity."
"Inhuman insidious voice cutting into your mind like a nightmare abomination in the skin of a surgeon, speaking of 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 your mind as it mocks your laughably limited dreams and whispers deep into your soul of your new god: 𝘟𝘩𝘶𝘭𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘰𝘴𝘬"
Sacrifice my childish innocent ignorance to ascend to a place no one ever wishes to see. I will lay it down on the altar. I will shed no tears. I will plunge the knife into the heart. My sacrifice for a life in a Heaven that I fear and despise.
"The streets became rivers of black insects of all kind. And once you step in, you'd transform into one of them and join the flowing senseless swarm into a loop of insane infinity."
"The bushes and trees turned inky black. The sky went purple. The grass went chrome and then screamed as it helplessly violently shook, gaining complete awareness of its existence. Resting against the abysmal trees and on the chrome grass, people were sucked dry of sanity."
Walking up and down a stairway that spirals in all directions into the same abyss.
"Apparently it had only been an hour since I was ""dead"" and they came back from their lunch break and saw that I was waking up. Well at least with this cursed eternal life, I can get a decent hour of sleep when I ""die."""
"I lied down on the table and they began the euthanization. Deeply I slept and had strange terrifying dreams. I woke up, got off of the table and saw that everyone was mortified. ""Well, thanks for the nice dreams,"" I said with a smile. ""What the fuck is wrong with you?"" they asked"
I'm not here for love. I'm here to vomit black bile into this place.
My doppelganger made out of black smoke grins at me and disappears behind the curtains as the strange static radio voices whisper about my impending doom.
Walking down the same street I've walked before at night but I'm in an ominous dream. The line between reality and dreamlike insanity is blurred.
"There is no haven in love. There is no haven in hope. There is only fear that freezes your blood, the determined madness of everything and the infinite abyss of what you will never know."
A sudden intense dread urging me to sprint into the ocean and swim towards the neverending abysmal horizon.
"They did everything they knew they could, yet it did nothing. It's time to do something you don't know. It's time to accept and embrace the unknown."
Love won't save you.

Global tower of silence to awaken the sleeping eldritch god inside the Earth.
"Future dreamworld: the biggest worldwide religion is Heaven's Gate with a good dose of subtle cosmic horror in the belief. Then on the right day/night, 𝙬𝙚 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙚𝙭𝙞𝙩 𝙀𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙝."
A constant undying subtle feeling of dread.
"I began to mummify and decay, all while still being conscious. I was becoming one of them. And then a sinister peace began to soak into my mind as eternal life opened its terrifying maw to swallow me whole."
"I was overwhelmed by living mummified and horrifically decayed corpses that walked with in an unnervingly serene way. They dragged me into the pristine clear blue river with them and as I floated hopelessly down that eerie river with the nightmarish undead,"
"""As a symptom of their insanity, they deliberately gash and cut their own flesh, and a Reaver is often covered in open or partially healed wounds. Barbaric piercings and random bits of metal shoved into their flesh are also common, giving them a ghastly and corpse-like air."""

"""The world is covered with demons. And the Eye sees everything.""  - The Acacia Strain"
Sirens howling. Trumpets blowing. Billions screaming. The god inside the Earth awakening. Thousands of eyes opening. Tendrils and insect-like legs breaking through the crust of the Earth that is trembling. Death and eternal terror is coming and nobody can do a thing.
Fighting the repeated cycle of madness with newly discovered greater madness and unsettling awareness.
No hope. No escape. There is only one way we will take and it is paved with senselessness and anguish. We don't have freedom. We are prisoners to this endless road of malignant madness leading to nowhere.
"I can't shed tears of sorrow, especially for those who I care for. Not out of spite, but because I see the hopelessness in everything. The uncaring determined chaos of it all kills all sadness in me and leaves a dark dreadful despair of helplessness."
Dreadfully bright blue sky today. It's giving me a sick feeling deep in my guts.
Free will is a lie. Heaven is a hell that is praised yet should be feared. The Devil rebelled after he saw God's true malevolent unspeakable intentions. We are all puppets to something dreadful that none will ever be able to comprehend.
"Callous cherubs singing frightening hymns of the dark Heaven that awaits me after death, making me shed tears of pure horror."
"Was it an eye with tentacles, or more eyes, and then changed into an insect, or at least what I think looked like an insect, but not any I know of from this planet. Or was it both forms at once at the same time and my mind couldn't process what it was seeing? I don't know."
"You will find the true face of God in the eerie humming of the flowers, through the feeling of your blood being drained by the trees, and your body turning to rot and rust as your mind begins to collapse on and in and through itself."
Demonically ran and powered industrial factory world.
Knees on the grass Terror in the mind Hands hiding the eyes Futile prayers for this to pass The divine horror burns inside Your whole being will be devoured by the blue sky.
"The cursed dead that were like me, make twisted distorted whispers and growls in the night, patiently waiting for my time to pass over so I may join them in the eternal nightmare that lies beyond this one."
Ego death and existential dread is the best combination for every weekend.
"I favor nuclear annihilation over obliteration by meteor because nuclear holocaust is more beautifully terrifying in my eyes. Plus it has a more nice aesthetic to it, don't you think?"
A soul damned to a far greater hell after this one.
We have the power to light the earth ablaze with bombs hotter than the sun to incinerate all life into ashes and end the madness of mankind. I still dream of witnessing the end via nuclear holocaust. Maybe I might live to see it happen. Maybe not. But I won't stop dreaming of it.

Eldritch nightmare meditation.
I've only experienced true enlightenment &amp; awakening a few times &amp; it's nigh-beyond words. It's not uplifting. It's a terrifying void that possesses. It's the incomprehensible puppeteer opening the mind's eyes. This is enlightenment &amp; awakening that none would wish to experience.
"A puppet to an unseen incomprehensible outer force, that desires immensely to face its puppeteer and know what should never be known."
Becoming the Outer One's voice.
"I can only imagine everyone else truly dying. But for myself I can't imagine myself truly dying and being truly dead. I can imagine my body shutting down permanently but with my consciousness leaving it and staying eternal, being exposed to what was outside the living's grasp."
Always a mood.
Always count on your nightmares to come true. They're more reliable in doing so than dreams. Unless if those dreams reflect the terrible indifferent chaos that is reality.
The horrifying madness of things will go on forever with or without us.
Just consumed caffeine for the first time in months and it feels good. Now I can read the cosmic horror stories I've been meaning to read without falling asleep during the day due to my meds' side-effects.
A highly unsettling alien lullaby for every existing mind to put them all into a deep dark sleep.
I just want to eat Great One umbilical cords to gain unspeakable insight and eyes on the inside.
"""O Mother from the blood, Redemption, having been laughed at, rouses itself, rouses itself. It is lamented by the waters.  Farewell, farewell. We are tainted In the shadows of the water. (Cursed) And the silver of the water. We are tainted. And the silver of the water."""
Shattering the souls of the religious into oblivion and dragging the souls of the non-believers and pessimists into the eternal horror of Heaven. The Petrifying Unforeseen Parousia.
"Summon the divine eldritch terror from the cosmic Kafkaesque horror of Heaven, intensifying fear past its peak from every soul."
I feel from all this dryness of my body that I'll wake up as a mummified living corpse and then soon become conscious dust. That nightmare might come true.
Roaming the rotten tropics under the delirious white sky and crazed bleeding sun. Hearing the distorted disembodied wails fill the air and repetitive screams from decaying skulls.
It's getting warmer and warmer. Soon in maybe a couple of months the centipedes and spiders will be crawling into my bedroom through the cracks and holes and I won't be alone anymore again.

"Stuck in a terrible existential dreadful loop. Nothing, not even death will break me free from it."
"*down to join them. Fucking pain, fatigue and insomnia isn't helping me write completely coherently."

"An ominous, seemingly enchanting dark Eden is my ideal paradise."
"Such horrific and disgusting things you see and hear about what man has done and does to his fellow human beings burns deep into your mind. And for my case, discovering more cruel instances gives me a sick feeling that lingers for days and nights. And sometimes it's lifelong."
"The atrocious things people do to each other that either goes overlooked, ignored or worse; justified, makes me sick in the stomach. Only an abominable species such as ours is capable of such vile behavior."
You have to be a complete blabbering ignorant fool or a slimy selfish sociopath to not see that humanity is the true fucking cancer of this planet and that needs to be wiped clean off the face of existence.
I'm disgusted to be part of a species this foul and irredeemable. Leeches and cockroaches have more decency and worth than our vile human filth.
I'd like to take a look inside and read that book I found frightfully creepy in my dream. If only it was possible to bring it back with me into waking reality.
Cool little dude I found. Don't know where it is now. Vanished when I got back.
For such a quick brief second I felt the most intense feeling of disturbing strangeness. I wish I could experience it again but for much much longer.
"A room where the walls, ceiling and floor is made of mirrors. And I can hear and see my reflections scream in abject horror."
"They came to help us, but not in the way we imagined. The malignant mutation of the new evolution of the mind and body was agonizing beyond words. Some tried killing themselves, but it was of no use. We became pure insidious inhabitants of this new nightmarescape of Earth."

Ambient type beat that's so eerily alien that even though it makes you extremely uncomfortable you can't help but put it on repeat.
Lost in an endless dark hotel where there are no doors and the hallways twist at odd angles. And something's chasing me. I don't hear footsteps. I hear dozens of hands clawing and pattering rapidly on the walls and ceiling behind me.
"""The global clockwork terminated Bringing forth unending silence Such vastness, our doom Incomprehensible Succumb to the deep"" - Humanity's Last Breath"
More of a what for me: an eternal eldritch abomination.
One of the things that creeps me out the most yet I'd love to explore even further is the dark side of the fae world.
Into the world of sleeping nightmares I go. And then later back into the waking nightmare of existence I will emerge.
Horrible scenarios flashing through my mind. And all I can do is hold those thoughts tightly and hurl us both furiously into the abyss where we both belong.
"If I ever get in a car accident, I hope my body and face is so horrifically mangled and twisted that the sight of it will burn deep into the minds of everyone who sees it. Haunting them even in their dreams."
"The malefic demented churches echoing their foul choirs' voices into everything around, staining it with vile light."
"The hospitals of hell are never full. The shops of sinister banality are always open, luring people into their dark rooms. The graveyards are never silent. Every plant and tree breathes malevolence. The clouds fly madly through the indifferent sky."
Enjoy the Void. The cursed few and I are on our way to an incomprehensible chaotic abyss where the word hell fails to describe it.
"I stopped desperately seeking for the peace of nothingness a long time ago. The abyss of madness will never be done with me, even after death. Peace does not exist for me."
"It keeps flaying and feeding off my mind, but it shows me things I never thought I'd wish to see."
"Darling, though we are in my world, even I don't have full control. Time for both of us to maniacally scream in horror."
"We danced hand in hand, bodies pressed against each other, as the place around us descended into violent chaos."
Seeing that you're just like the rest of us? Pointless. Useless. Born all fucked up. Want me dead? Come to my bed. Stab me in the head or neck. But know that I've been rejected  From Death herself. So you're stuck with me in this hell.
Have you ever voluntarily pushed your brain Into the realm of the unforgiving abysmally insane? Did you even take a step out of your comfort zone To see something real that froze your fucking blood and bones? Or are you a bitch that will quit Once you start to feel like shit
Lost on a foreign planet where I do not belong. The endless void of space calls my name in its terrifying cold silent voice. Pierce the skies of day and take me into the infinite void of deep space.
"""My exsanguinations thus far are only a need, not a passion. But I know that will change. I was once the scion of an old family from an old country, but now I have new blood in my veins and mine is a country outside of time.""  - The Lost Art of Twilight by Ligotti"
I've been having my blood drained for all my life. And now I crave the blood of another and to drain every bit of sanity from their mind. I dwell in the shadows and darkness but I also roam in daylight. A product of vile vampiric nature. I only love you for your blood.
"I giver her my mind to feast on and fuck She gives me forbidden knowledge to eat up True love in its sinister monstrous taboo form Fuck your ideas of love If you love, shed all of your blood Or drown yourself in this abyss of horrific insanity With Her and me for eternity."
"A black arrow pierced through my heart Once I emerged from the bloody womb A love of dark madness to tear my mind slowly apart Forever blooming, making existence sanity's tomb I've always had a lover And her name is Suffer"
Real cosmic horror. The biggest black hole known to man in our observable universe. This is a scale of how vast it is. In the center is our solar system for comparison of size.
Voice like a seductive maelstrom. Skin pale as a full moon. The color of her long hair shifting between mahogany and inky black. And eyes of aegean blue that pulls me into a realm where my most beautifully eerie dreams exists.
"A terrifying symphony where every instrument player is playing violently while headbanging as much as they can, while the conductor rips out two of his rib cage bones, ties them together with his arteries and waves his new baton like the diabolical demented man he now is."
"My face constantly shifting from mutilated faces of man, woman, child and animal, devouring each other."
The only thing I like about this flesh prison of mine is the mind's limitless capacity for various horror in dreams/nightmares. Everything else can rot to dust.
Brief memories of ominous places I've only seen in vague dreams. Places I'd rather be instead of this mundane nightmare reality.
"begins to come through the black hole. Its form is an atrocity to reality and your mind. Behold, The Creator and Destroyer of all."
"Glorious drums beating and trumpets blaring for your arrival to the gates of Heaven. But then the clouds turn blood red, the divine sun turns into an abysmal black hole and the music becomes demented and petrifying. Then you feel your very soul shake as something unspeakable"
"""Naïve, we are moving in the storm  While our senses deform  We are moving in its unwavering greatness  We let ourselves be enveloped by its darkness  Our victory in this desert  Will destroy our spirit, destroy our heart"" - The Great Old Ones"
"Painting grim ungodly images, abominations to the human eyes, with my blood that will never run out. Vile voices hissing through my teeth that make even Heaven tremble with fear."
"I can never flee from this mouth of madness. It's keeping me alive just to devour my mind and soul forever. Turning my own being against myself, making this an inescapable hell."
"""VOMIT THE PAIN I WON'T BE SAVED"" - I, Valiance"
"""Now I just want to thank you For going insane Every second that you suffer Is a loss that I gain Every breath is a drain down Down into a hole And your mind is a shrinking thing: It was crushed by your skull"" -SWANS"
"The funeral bells ring not for me, but for you. I wish I could take your place, but not even Death wants me. I can never go back home. It's doors are closed and locked to me. For I must roam the maddening desolate realms of eternity, alone."
"Standing in the same spot for days, swaying back and forth in an unnatural fluid motion. And the mind is somewhere far beyond the farthest star."
Slow stretched out distorted voices speaking of existentially disturbing and horrifying things to me while I'm in between wakefulness and sleep.
A world overtaken by the Body Snatchers would be a remarkable world to me. Ruled by no emotion and little to no ego/self.
Limp. Lament. Loathe.
soulless puppets that were used by whatever dark nightmare that resided within the factory. These dogs were things to lure whatever unlucky person into the dense dark colossal forest of towering pipes and machinery. That unsettling factory that harbored an unspeakable nightmare.
"Two huskies were sitting on the sidewalk outside of the vast and ominous industrial factory. A factory that no one knew when it was first built, who built it and why it only ran at night and who/what ran it. And these two huskies, they didn't seem like dogs at all, but more as"
"My 2 year old just said ""Awaken, my sleeping parent. Summon the Vile Ancient Ones, we must transcend and turn the sun into a black abysmal portal for them to come through."" I am so proud of my....wait, I don't have a 2 year old.  Who/what is in my house? ._."
We need a disney princess who summons a terrible cosmic entity and rips mankind to bloody shreds and then resurrects the recently slaughtered into eldritch beings.
Every scenario that comes into my head always ends in horrific disaster that would intensify my suffering beyond my endurance. There's never a peaceful/happy ending.
"Rapidly twitching twisted shadows on the walls, clawing to be free from this prison of a house that we are trapped in."
The hills are alive with the sound of nightmares.
White phosphorous death squads.
"No matter how beautiful it looks outside, this house will always be cancerous, rotting and forever burning black from the hell you dragged me into."
"Nobody alive is truly free. Don't believe the lies, especially the whole ""liberty and justice for all"" bullshit. This is a shit speck of rock in space where the humans in power are corrupt self-centered deceitful narcissists. Hope is useless and futile here."
"There's no escape for me in sleep. All my dreams reflect the misery, agony and horror I experience in reality."
"""Let them wander under black skies Drink the cursed blood of the father Eat each other Separate myself from mankind I am safe here Hide my weakness behind violence I am not your shepherd"" - Cult Leader"
"To be frighteningly overwhelmed by the living darkness of the forest at night again, oh how I lust for it so much. I need to go back. It's calling me."
"""Nature here is vile and base. I wouldn't see anything erotical here. I would see fornication and asphyxiation and choking and fighting for survival and... growing and... just rotting away."" - Werner Herzog"
"The seal of the Duke of Hell and the Crawling Chaos forever carved into my flesh and soul. For they will always be with me, guiding me through the evil entropy of existence."
"I saw you shed tears, but I could not shed any.  Will this emptiness consume all feeling in me? I try to scream, but my mouth remains shut. I try to say something of comfort, but nothing comes up. All there is is depersonalization And undying disillusionment of what I am."
"Weeping that doesn't bring sympathy or sadness, but bewilderment and fear."
"Trying to talk, but unnervingly sounding like a bad actor trying to deliver a line. I am not me."
Otherworld.
When the brain turns against every soul and every nightmare becomes the new chaotic reality.
Altar of bleeding obsidian. Stained glass windows of eldritch angelic abominations. Choirs singing grim atrocious praises to the God of pure chaos. The walls of the dreary chapel twists in impossible ways. Thus begins the sinister sacrament.
"Total annihilation is the solution to all of our problems. But you kiss life's abusive ass, thinking it'll make a fucking difference. Nothing will change. We are fucked as a species. You don't solve the problem by letting it continue for temporary benefit."
"Eerie emotional memories from another life, an ominously warped alien existence from somewhere else to be specific."
"Walking into a monstrous violent vortex of screams of terror, raging thunderous beating of drums and the haunting hellish howl of some abomination to reality."
Determined chaos. Puppets to an incomprehensible God of pure chaos.

“What can you do when your five senses are not enough?” - Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer
"Petrifying angelic light so dreadful, that one would rather wish to be consumed by a cloud of complete darkness."
My paradise was their hell in disguise. An Eden of nightmares that hid in the beauty of this garden of every beautiful forest and jungle.
A graveyard world of crosses and tombstones pointing towards the Abyss. Beacons that draw in its murky black tendrils to take every soul into its endless chasmal mouth.
"grimy windows behind which diseased faces peek out through the glass, as if they are waiting for someone to arrive - as if they are waiting for everyone, sooner or later, to enter their little town."" - This Degenerate Little Town by Ligotti"
"""Dreams, for instance, the dreams of our sleep wherein every mind is destined to go twisted and tilting into lands of swift magic. These dreams alone would make the case - if anything were ever needed in the way of evidence. These dreams alone would put us in close view of those"
"Mind-tearing terrors of unknown origin residing within the blue of the sky, waiting for the right time to devour us, body, mind and soul."
"Once seen and experienced, the brain becomes chaotically twisted and tangled, trying to activate the best defense mechanism. But the only responses to something so abominably horrific are despair, taking one's own life, hatred for existence or madness."
"""Gazing into nothing we finally may see the truth.""  - The Acacia Strain"
"There are no heroes, no safe havens and no saviors that will save us all. Nobody's coming to save us from each other. All that awaits us is the deeper depths of the hell of existence."
Peace would be the world being sucked into a black hole.
"""I'll pull the voice from your fucking throat! YOU DESERVE TO BE MISERABLE! YOU DESERVE TO BE MISERABLE! YOU DESERVE TO BE MISERABLE!"""
When the music makes you feel like you're in a dark dismal violent dimension of pure maddening chaos in broad daylight.
Forever surrounded by the haunting mist of the past and the dreadful fog of the future.
All the times you say you love me will just be devoured by the endless jaws of reality and the inferno of my hatred for existence.
Your moans of kissing and fucking Are drowned out by the crying and screaming. A hurricane of hopelessness tears apart your selfishness Into dust and debris. Your lust is now void of relief. Say hello to the dark helpless horror that is reality.
"""Existential self at the last gasp A disintegration into non-being On the brink of the abyss At the limit of self Where meaning surrenders to its absolute end."" - Vessel of Iniquity"
"Tis a good time when I discover another band that's sound is a terrifying chaotic abyss, yet somewhat in a ritualistic way."
The voice sounded like rusted metal screeching as it dragged against each other under ocean water.
I feel like lying down in a black mold-consumed house in the woods and becoming one with the inky black mold.
"Forever devouring everything, even itself. Rotting and growing in unison. Defying reality while being reality. Nowhere to go, it violently moves towards infinity for eternity."
"They gave me the choice to choose any power to have. I chose to be a prophet of pure chaos. Then I plucked their eyes out to show them that where they were going they wouldn't need eyes to see. And in those empty sockets, I saw the chaotic madness inside their minds like a storm."
A jazz band of shadowy hat men playing malevolently demented songs to keep you dancing and wailing and laughing maniacally until death.
Nature created doorways to a dimension of pure evil insanity. And only the insane and the masochistic go through.
I thought I escaped them. I was so wrong. They're coming through...even when the door remains locked and shut!
*making unnerving inhuman insect noises to tell you to go fuck yourself*
Drifting back and forth like some ghost through a pitch black industrial city forever stuck in the sunset.
"Walking down a familiar street that I've never seen in reality.  Something's off and I can't say what. In a strange trance, feel like I need to keep walking, but I don't know where to."
"Collective self-centered psychosis. Doomed from the start. There's no way back. There's only one way out, but it will never be taken."
"The universe screamed silently into our minds the meaning of all of this. We all got the message but we are too scared by what it says. Now so many drown themselves in ignorance while the rest of us suffer in eternal anguish, driving us to the edge of complete madness."
The absurd hellish insanity from my dreams is seeping through into this reality to take back its throne over this body.
"You may think I have a heart for you to hold But there's nothing, I don't love you, and I know That sounds cold I sold my soul long ago To the demons of the unknown You can burn in hell or heaven alone For I'll be in the abyss of the outer darkness Where time is meaningless."
"Grotesque contorted figures frighteningly feeding off of live and dead humans outside the window. Colossal abysmal nightmarish silhouettes contrasting against the ominous red glow of the sky, that if I stare too long, my head begins to hurt and my sanity crack."
"""We are the orphans of a deathbed mother When the night took her final breath Beneath the gloom of pestilence we'll suffer Continue on into the arms of death"" - The Acacia Strain"
They mock me and laugh at my confusion and pain. Reality begins to be torn to shreds and I have no option left but to endure it.
Repeating the same thing every fucking day. Slowly agonizingly dying with no fucking escape. Descending deeper into insanity. And I'm beginning to firmly believe that me becoming purely malignantly insane has always been my destiny.
"I wish I was amongst the people in Pompeii when the volcano erupted. To witness such an apocalyptic and hellish event occur, in person and then to get incinerated would be  amazing to me.  (Brilliant painting of Pompeii done by John Martin)"
I had a brief waking nightmare of buildings like these once. They were much more colossal in width and height. It was night. And the buildings gave off an aura of otherworldly malevolence.
There's no wonderland for me. Just a nightmarish lunatic land of vile madness.
"On my knees, in eternal hurt In this vast desert with no end I call upon the God of the Desert My soul to sell to The Black Wind I desire to be shown what should not be shown To know what should never be known You have gained a new follower, Black Pharaoh Devour my sanity."
From one nightmare to another.
"May when I close my eyes, that I will never wake up. Forever lost in my vivid nightmares where chaotic terror guides me through infinite alien realities that I could have never imagined in my waking moments."
"Still a slave to my primal urges to fuck. But the greatest lust of mine rises far above them all; the lust to absorb all forbidden knowledge and to finally leave this life and pass into the nightmare that is the afterlife. Abyssum, Ego da vos anima mea!"
"Trapped in a flesh, digital and planet prison. And so many foolish childish people justify the hell that it is. We don't deserve a meteor. We deserve a disease that makes people scream to death, rip each other apart, eats at their flesh and drives them violently beyond madness."

"Men, women and children, marching in the frigid air of night to a deep vast pit that would be their grave. Young soldiers, coerced to obey the order to shoot the innocent into that grave.  Terror and trauma: staining the land's, survivors' and the executioners' souls, forever."

"Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. And instead of talking about the gas chambers, I'm going to share with you much more horrific things the SS Einsatzgruppen did in late 1941 and 1942. I mentioned Babi Yar a while ago. So I'll inform you of the other horrors that were done."
Mass genocide. 3 billion lives in the process of being slaughtered and executed. A sacrifice to keep back the incoming incomprehensible inter-dimensional terror that even the super-intelligent A.I. fears.
It was really fucking windy last night. Seriously felt and sounded like hundreds of souls in terror and hatred were trying to drag the whole house into the abyss.
On an alien planet where its inhabitants and even the planet itself is trying to torment and kill me in ways I probably would rather not know.
It rained blood on his birthday.
"Everything I touch doesn't turn to stone, I make it painfully decompose. I have a murderous appetite for firing 13 rounds into the skull of hope. Accepting the cold truth is how I cope."
Your memory of everything will die with your sanity by your aging. A deity of dementia that all pray to awaits. There'll be nothing good enough to hold onto as the current of a fate worse than anything pulls you further down the river of madness.
Words are nothing. Apologies are worthless. I'd cry but my eyes are too dry from being open to the horror of life. Your love means nothing just like my promises; empty and pointless.
I plan on being the witch of the woods around these parts. Even after I'm dead.
"I, for one, loved The Last Exorcism (the first one) and still do.  Don't like my opinion? Kill me and send me to Abalam."
"Feeling like a slimy centipede that just crawled out of its hole in the wall and fell into a vast pile of violently squirming worms, getting myself tangled up in the mess making me scream ""WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?"""
"I want to be consumed by the woods at night and become an eerie spirit, haunting all those who enter."
"And every person that visits my grave will suffer the same fate. This curse will follow them everywhere they go, even into their dreams. There will be no safe haven."
"When I die, the soul I have twisted by hatred and madness will stain the very ground with malevolence. Every soul that sees my horribly twisted corpse will be cursed by the now eternal and living hateful insanity, driving themselves to madness, fear and maybe even death."
"I can't kill me. But I can sure as hell Torment myself Slowly, naturally, unintentionally. Something outside this reality Won't let me leave this body of agony. Call it God. Call it what you want. It won't change a fucking thing. All I know is that I am fucked."
Obscurior furor manet.
"The force of Nature is indifferent to what we think, feel and do. We're nothing but its puppets and fertilizer."
"An emerald cloud floats in the sky above the town. Those who gaze at its ominous green glow that never dims or brightens during anytime, feels a sickening feeling of alien foulness twisting at their guts. It shouldn't be there, but it is."
The Cardinal of Godly Unholiness with the face of the abyss will purge every sin of existence in you through his breath of purifying hellfire.
A tabernacle of torment and terror. Prophets of sacred insanity. Choirs echoing their demonically divine voice through the minds of man.
Death of determination. Reaper of ruin. Angel of the black sun and the blood moon. Deliver my soul into the abyss of crimson Where death heals my wounds And where I am consumed by divine doom.
"Dark contorted merger of Jim Jones and Marshall Applewhite, holding its hand out to me, saying in a disturbing distorted voice ""Follow us, exit this reality and transcend into divine pure chaos."""
"Just fucking put me down already and send me to the dreadful nightmare that awaits. Even after death, I will never be laid to rest, because the hurricane of hell of my consciousness will still rage in the rotting skull."
Mother Paranoia holding my soul. Father Fear guiding my existence. Brother Hatred flowing through my veins. Sister Madness showing me the way.
"""Pray for death to take you, but she has left you for everyone else. We are here to take you to a darker corner of existence many would call Hell. Embrace every fear and face your torment. There will be no escape for this is your destiny and sole purpose."""
"Feeling like this today, or possibly everyday now that I think about it."
Belonging only to an infinite jungle of nightmares where the rivers are of blood and it rains black from the sinister scarlet sky.
"Banished from all land, where man deliriously believes it rules over. My small ship and I were swallowed by the dark fog as we sailed towards the seemingly endless horizon of the abysmal ocean. Towards the unsettling unknown."
"Every horrific vile thing imaginable that man can do, has been done, is happening now and will continue until mankind is nothing but dust."
"I'd rather be devoured alive and torn to shreds by every crow, wolf and mountain lion than fall in love with you and this world."
"Save them all, save all of yourselves, but leave me in the hell that defies logic and reality. For the Salvia Gods have judged me. And I am guilty."
"Cast out of the Heaven of nothingness, forsaken forever. I envy all those that return through Death's beautiful embrace, for I know an eternity of nightmares awaits me after I pass away. And not for sin but for merely existing."
"Ego, anima creata enim infinita somnia ad devorandum in aeternum. Deserta per mortem!"
"It flashed right through my mind. A brief glimpse of that place that roams deeply within my subconscious. I need to be there. Don't leave so quickly. Take me there, don't leave me here. I need to be there. I need to see what's waiting for me in that dark garden of unknown origin."
"On my knees, kneeling to nothing, nobody and nowhere. Rifles aimed at every vital part of my body. Life doesn't flash before my eyes. All that flashes through is the thought ""please, let death be the final end."""
"This is not a tunnel, this is a cavern, slithering down into the depths of despair and degradation where the only light is not of peace, but of fully warranted hatred for the human race."
"You still seek shelter within me, hoping to find warmth from the cold indifferent sky. Yet you will find no warmth here, only the frigid air of nightmares and the abandonment of serenity."
"Every fear I had, have and will know comes true in the maelstrom of torment that is my mind."
Death has made a pact with pure insidiousness incarnate: my mortality just for the pleasure of seeing me suffer and horrifically transform in the deeper depths of the hell of existence where no soul should ever see or know. A darkness where even all of Heaven deeply fears.
What's the point in a madman trying to find some sense in a land of lunacy? Trying to find sanity in this deranged world is insanity itself.
There is no such thing as universal justice or order. There is only frightening chaotic insanity. Nobody is their own God. There are only puppets. Welcome to the true Theater of Horrors.
In a place where disturbing silence lets strange nightmares come to life.
"The trees are swaying against the endless blue sky, yet I hear nor feel no wind. All I can hear is the sound of beautifully ominous otherworldly humming."
Maybe I should've followed the black stag into the foggy forest at noon.

Obsidian Christ upon its marble cross at the top of the sky-tearing ominous cathedral. Eldritch eyes forever bleeding. Sinister silent stare upon every soul. Feeding off of every cry  of torment and every praise of malevolent madness.
There's no love inside me. Only lust. Only indoctrinated impulsive obligation. Desiring to break free and be freed from this limited body and know all that shouldn't be known.
"Pandora's box incarnate. You lusted after my outside. So childish, so ignorant Of the nightmares inside.  Will you pray to your Gods For the nightmare to be gone? Are you willing to shed your own blood?  Terrible madness In carnality's guise. This is what you'll fucking get."

"She offered me the flower of evil insanity. I turned it down. Yet it's still there in that room, in the depths of my mind. Waiting."
Something else is trying to creep in every time I start nodding off as of late. It's such a foreign and horrendous feeling that it jolts me back wide awake.
My brain is just black widows and mosquitoes. The spine is a caustic centipede. The heart is full of magma filling my veins with fire. The skin is rusting steel with hairs of disease infested wires. The lungs spew smog and smoke. And the eyes are windows to unspeakable terrors.
"It let me find it at last. I caught only a glimpse of it but was too terrified to stare long enough. I should have looked. I should have stayed. It's in me, but I want to go back to where it was, hidden in the woods. I need to see it all and let its foul terror soak into my soul."
"With new obsidian eyes, I see through the golden lies. Charred black soul paralyzed by divinity's despairing light. Noxious ebony smoke shaped wings sprout from my back. After so long, I've become a vessel for the abyss at last. Angelic demonic phantom in this system of horror."
"I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind getting stalked/abducted by creepy greys with unsettling unknown intentions."

"In Babi Yar, they had every Jew strip down naked of their clothes and belongings. Walked through a gauntlet of SS Einsatzgruppen soldiers who beat them; men, women and children. Taken to a deep vast ravine. Forced to lie down. Shot in the head. Then the next victims were forced"
"Since I see #Holocaust trending in my state, I'm going to educate the lot of you. The Holocaust wasn't just the gas chambers, shit, that wasn't as hellish as what happened in 1941 and 1942. Ever heard of Babi Yar? Ever heard of the method of ""sardine packing?"""
"Elect me as future president and all our suffering will be over on my first day, via total nuclear annihilation."
"Forever flaying myself alive just to avoid killing myself instantly to finally be free, and for what? I'll never know. And they watch and chant repeatedly ""it's for the better,"" rationalizing my irrational agony. Fuck this insanity."
"Billions of delirious people worshiping the very thing that gave birth to the most horrible agonies and nightmares given physical form. Every single one of them are fucking hopeless. This world is fucked until we all are reduced to dust, if that ever happens."
"Every morning I wake up with dread and subtle anxiety. And when I see the daylight-infested sky of blue and white, I feel a sickening feeling that I woke back up in this horrid nightmare of existence."
Face.
"Screaming my hopeless horrid soul into a computerized chasm. Eternal electronic exorcism of every angel and demon I know. A neverending nightmare where its creator I can never fathom. Fearing that this was determined, freezing my bones and making my blood run cold."
Are we enjoying our digital prisons today?
Eternal sleep paralysis. Infinity of insomnia. No death. No end. No rest. No relief. No peace. Welcome to existence and the afterlife. Not even the daylight will comfort your mind.

"Now naked to the horrific abyss of the sky that glared gruesomely down at them, mankind began to be devoured by mass plagues of violent madness and pure terror. The only light that was left was fire from the chaos and the sinister white fiery ring of the now black sun."
"All of the animals vanished, as if abandoning humanity to its own agonizing annihilation. The only birds left that roamed the sky were crows and vultures to feed off the dying and dead. Rats joined the feasting of corpses."
"The very Earth trembled, as if itself was in immeasurable fear. The Sun became black as ink, and the moon turned red and bled across the now abyssal blackened sky where every star was consumed into oblivion. Mankind was left to suffer the Abysmal Apocalypse in the final dark age."
"""ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI!"" He screamed with a roaring voice as his body was consumed by endless unthinkable pain on the cross. His brother, Christ, was delivered when he offered his spirit, but God did not answer this man's prayers for deliverance. All there was, was silence."

I'll never forget when sorrowful despair first consumed me when I was younger and I longed for Death to take me into her cold peaceful arms.
Death is absolutely beautiful. This is how I imagine it/her to look like. And at a cold beach with a dismal gray sky watching down on her as she walks eerily and gracefully towards me as I lay on the sand. It's like a dream. A dream I desire so much to come true.
I want one.
"I remember watching a documentary on Heaven's Gate, the opening scene showed images and I think video footage too of all the cult members dead on the beds covered in those blankets. All of this with the eerie sound of wind chimes in the background. Eerie as hell, I loved it."

It's beautiful outside today.
"An abysmal despair darker than ever before. It not only devours joy, but sadness, hatred, love and hope. A terrible hopelessness that makes the eyes lidless to reality and the soul naked to the dread of pure endless helplessness. That is the only despair I feel."
How I feel right now.
"""In the mist a flowing sadness sees you Drenched to the world above - nothing breathes in you And soon betray our love, is this destruction? Our fall eternal in this sleeping murder"" - Shape of Despair"
Stuck in a flesh and a digital prison.
I'm a prisoner in this flesh. Punished for existing. But those in power over me don't see this punishment to be satisfactory. So the penance is increased more whenever for whatever reason they choose and I must pay more for being alive.
"Wherever I'm afraid to go, that's where my mind goes."
"""I'm your stupid child. I'm your stupid helpless child. I'm your stupid naked child. I'm ashamed of what I am."""

"Out of mad morbid curiosity and self-destructive intention, my greatest wish is to be a soldier in an endless hellish war with the brutality of WW1 and the battle of Okinawa in WW2. To be killed over and over yet always come back and be forced to face the ultimate horrors of war."
"When you pray for a brighter day, I hope your prayer's answered as the sun scorches the clouds and melts your eyes out of your sockets just out of spite for your self-centered shit so you fear the blue skies for the rest of your life. You get your brighter day in a brighter hell."
Madness in dreams. Madness in reality. I can never escape the insanity because the insanity is all around me. It's inside me. I am part of it and I can never escape.
"""The sun went BLACK. The moon it BLED!"" - Ach Golgotha by Current 93"
"My guardian angel is the angel of fear.  Weakening my mental barriers Showing me heavenly nightmares. Hiding my presence when Death draws near. Saying to me: ""I shall pluck out thine innocence's eyes To show thee the horrors of all life. The abyss will be thy new way of sight."""
"Fear forever flowering in my soul. Mind filled with the most monstrous scenarios. God knows that I have no control, for It bestowed this unwanted light of nightmares deep into my bones. My salvation is no salvation. I always had a black halo, it will always be a black halo."
The beautiful paintings of forests and ancient thriving cities are now ones of seas of dead trees and ominous looking non-euclidean architectural metropolises. And the altars are but tombstones now.
"If my body is a temple, it's a cold dark empty one where dead vegetation clings to the outer walls. The only inhabitants that survive inside are inky black centipedes and snakes. And the only light within is but the ghastly green glow of the most unusual lit candles."
Raid the Heavens. Devour angels' flesh. A feast of religious horror as the new god all pray to is Death.
No zodiac sign. No name. No birthday. No trace. No race. No face. No other motive except to erase the human race.
"Born of the God of Madness and Desolation, we have been cast into a world of serene landscapes just to destroy and defile it along with ourselves. Every beautiful thing we touch turns to rot and grimness. We are a cursed species."
"Its sound was heavenly, but something was wrong. Something was off. That unknown source of subtle uneasiness immersed my consciousness into a place where tranquility and eeriness absorbed each other into something ominously strange. I was pulled into an alien heaven."
"""'Rot your way back to us, you quirk of creation. Rot your way out of this world. Come home to a hell so excruciating it is bliss itself.'"" - Notes On The Writing Of Horror: A Story by Ligotti"
To find something far more ruthlessly cataclysmic and hateful towards illusions of life and life itself than pessimism would be beautiful.
"The light burns and blinds, turning the sane into its disturbed delirious worshipers. The darkness paralyzes and forces its victims to see the endless horror of both the abyss of the unknown and the sinister scorching light of life. Fear the light and fear the darkness."
"""Madness, mayhem, erotic vandalism, devastation of innumerable souls - while we scream and perish, History licks a finger and turns the page."" - Ligotti"
"I exist, therefore I am darkly demented."
"Someone please help, my radio is screaming horrific insane things about everything that exists and I don't know how to turn it up."
"Whenever I would water the trees in the front yard, I'd fantasize about a pitch black snake that'd slither out of the shadows and tell me that it can kill me instantly if I let it sink its fangs deep into my veins or neck. And I'd let it, without hesitation."

"I believe that my life was a predetermined sacrifice to appease the gruesome madness that my parents believed was their ""loving"" god. Menacing drums rhythmically beating accompanied by the terrifying roars and screeches of metal from ""Heaven"" for the music of my brutal birth."
We all unknowingly gave up our souls to the nightmarish chaos once we exited the womb.
"She's the only one I can completely trust. After all, she is abysmal madness and beautiful nightmares incarnate. The few things that are undoubtedly real. I love her as she loves me. A forbidden love to all but us. She'll always be with me. We are inseparable. She is eternal."
"Drained of any moisture of hope in the vile vacuum, the dryness doesn't stop at mummification. An evil horror you've never felt before overwhelms you as your mummified corpse turns to filthy clumps of dust.  Now you're nothing but hopeless eyes staring at the horror of it all."
"You want change? Rip out the roots of your problem and burn it to ash, that being the roots of mankind. Burn us all to ash. We have the arsenal. We just need the rationality and guts to do it. But obviously our species is only interested in those two when fucking both to death."
God answers prayers but with pure incomprehensible insanity as its response. All your hopes and fears answered by complete madness and chaos. Looking to make sense of our existence is like trying to make sense out of an insane man's senseless sinister ramblings.
"""A hovering wasteland devoid of time A cancer magnet breaking down reality We are rotting, hopelessly unaware of our nonexistence  Drain me of my sanity I can't fucking breathe"" -Chhinnamasta by The Acacia Strain"
"You'll never escape pain and horror. It will follow you even into your dreams. I got to feel all of my blood being slowly and agonizingly drained out of my body into large jars. It was so vivid I felt every second of it. Dreams/sleep are not a safe haven for everyone, not for me."
I got to pet a bus sized cat before I let it eat me. I vomited up loads of bark and possibly hundreds of insect eggs while I pissed uncontrollably. I felt every single moment of it vividly. Isn't dreaming wonderful?

"This will always be one of my favorite dark ambient pieces. A dreadful despair filled beginning and then when the strings come in at the 2:28 mark, it feels like a serene acceptance of the abyss that awaits."
"If I could, I'd violently implode on demand."
Nothing inside me is real.
"If death is the end, I'll embrace it. If death isn't the end, I'll embrace it. There's no point and no use in fleeing from the inevitable. A void of nothingness, sweet. An eternity of the unknown, so be it."
"I'd rather be locked inside, alone, in a vast dark castle haunted by malevolent otherworldly spirits for the rest of my life and spiral into terrible madness than spend another day here in this fucking boring ass city."

Atrocious anonymity. Banished bastard. Caustic character. Demonic destiny. Eternal eeriness. Forsaken forever.
"""This world will never be safe...We will bathe this world in our blood. Pain is your guide."" - I Exalt"
"All of my attempts of saving everyone was in vain. And upon realizing this, I actually smiled. I found beauty in this annihilation and wished that it'd spread across the rest of the world."
The skies darkened to black and a fog straight from the void surrounded me. I accepted death and fell to the ground. But I wasn't so lucky. I was forcibly resurrected to witness that hellish tornado transform into a nuclear fireball incinerating the last of the survivors.
"I was foolish to think I could stop an abysmal tornado from the blackest clouds that was hellbent and ripping everyone apart. I payed the price with shards of glass in my legs and arms. Limping as far as I could, I soon realized my fate was sealed, with my throat spewing blood."
"Leave it to dark ritual ambient to kill the anxiety and then raise it back up from the dead as beautiful subtle dread, like some twisted necromancer."
"""All places, all things have souls. All souls can be devoured."""
"Melt away my libido, my genitals and anything that could give me physical pleasure. Let me step out into the cold daylight and let the horrific eye of indifference melt away everything else keeping me bound from being fully exposed to the terrible truths I wish to see."
"If you hear unholy unnerving horns blow, followed by ominous beating of drums in the forest while you're alone at night, follow the sound. And if you have a sick feeling of dread wrenching at your gut telling you to leave, don't listen to it. Keep going towards the sound."
I feel like laying out on the dead grass and letting the coyotes tear my intestines out. And then have the mountain lions drag my body into the woods to finish the rest. Sounds refreshing.
Life is the slowest way to die.
"Considering that if the ""dark forest theory"" is true, which it might be, it'd be nice if an incredibly technologically advanced alien species found us by our childish stupid call out to space, came to our planet, and viciously annihilated us all in one night, on New Years Eve."
"I'd choose to be immortal just to watch you both and the rest of our family die in this fucked up world you decided to selfishly throw us in. I will enjoy every moment I dig up your graves and bury you in your rightful place: in the dark earth to be eaten by the worms, rotting."

"Gave up my dreams for my nightmares, because at least the nightmares come true."
"I fell in love with her at first sight and first touch. She was the abyss, dark madness and nightmares incarnate. She was my dreadful Heaven and beautiful Hell. She was happy to see that she was loved by me. We joined hands and walked away. I hope to be with her again, forever."
Throw my frail still alive bleeding rotting corpse in a lake of roaches under a starless moonless night sky.

It'd be very nice if Das Untier by Ulrich Horstmann was translated to English and the English copy was in full stock in every bookstore and online to order and read.
Nature is simply uncaring horror in the disguise of beauty. It uses this mask of beauty to spread its terror blindly to either nowhere or somewhere we're never meant to know.
I have a solution to COVID-19 and the problem concerning mental health while being in isolation: euthanize the human population.
"Many of the religious haven't really thought outside of their comfort bubbles about eternal life, especially eternity in Heaven ruled by their type of god. Of course they haven't because they're afraid to, and they should be. Eternal life in Heaven would truly be Kafka on wheels."

Pretty narcissistic and ignorant to believe that the God of everything looks like one species (ours) out of billions on a tiny rock in a vast galaxy in a galactic group that is in a supercluster of other vast galaxies amongst many other superclusters in this infinite universe.

"I always feared getting excruciatingly absorbed by some type of sentient mass and being forced to live as part of this eldritch abomination constantly absorbing more men, women and children. All screaming in terror and agony, never able to escape."
I'll never forget the times when my blood ran cold out of pure dread and terror I felt when I found out terrible truths.
"It twists the arms and legs, forcing me to walk to an unknown death that is very likely to be painful and terrifying. And when I try to resist, it fools me with illusions of escape, where at the end of that dream it reveals its horrendous grin. I'm its puppet to torment and kill."

"A twisted sounding version of ""What a Wonderful World"" blasting over the screams and whimpers of the tortured, violated, murdered, suffering, ill and betrayed. That is a true sound of the world of man."
"I gave up on suicide a long time ago. I sometimes believe I've been chosen as some soul by some vile outer force to helplessly witness everything I know horrendously melt away before my eyes, forever. And when I believe it, I accept it. If death abandons you, there is no hope."

Humankind is still doing the same shit we've been doing since the beginning of our existence. The only difference is that we have new toys to masturbate our egos with and kill each other.
