Imbued atmospheric sepsis, my contribution
to this assembly of disorder
Infiltrating insidious species specific disease
Capitalizing casualty hoarder

I am the history of adaptation materialized
Judge, jury, trial and error
I am the one you look for under your bed at night

Hell born unspeakable terror
No God would ever have created me
Nothing could be so insane
This nature that makes us - inherited disgust
Animal and inane

Inside of you

In the host I will spawn - multiplying, dividing, fucking taking over
All that you know is gone - corruption of phylum, genus, kingdom, order
You cannot go on - I am the scythe that's cutting you down
Pandemic - scourge, human bodies are purged

Within the minds of every one of us
Lies of piety, truths of lust
Deep inside of everyone alive
A plague that can't be denied

Poisonous. Parasitic. Infectious. Pestiferous.
Endemic. Indigenously malignant. Contagious.
Alone, a plague. Together, a curse.
Ravenously consumed, pre-humously doomed.

We shit where we eat and we eat it all

Within the minds of every one of us
Lies of piety, truths of lust
Deep inside of everyone alive
A plague that can't be denied

Turn us to ashes
Reduce us to dust
We cannot perish
Fast enough
