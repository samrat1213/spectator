Pain is my reward from psychotic tendencies
Pain I give to you
Pain relentlessly
Torturing has reached a level no one's ever seen
Suffer for your life
Rabid force extreme
Rage is my obsession driven by my cruelty
Rage is my release
Rage relentlessly
Ravaging continues through my scattered lunacy
Malice for your life
Rapid force extreme

Demented aggression

Hate is the reason I embrace these fantasies
Hate engulfs my mind
Hate relentlessly
With pain and rage and hatred relentlessly

With pain
Rage and hate
Beatings come faster
Beatings last longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Beatings are forever
I don't think you'll live 

Don't think you'll live
Don't think you'll live
I don't think you'll live

Pain is my reward from psychotic tendencies
Rage is my release
Hate relentlessly
With pain and rage and hatred relentlessly

With pain
Rage and hate
Torture coming faster
Torture lasting longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Torture is forever
I don't think you'll live 

Don't think you'll live
Don't think you'll live
I don't think you'll live

Left as a pummeled mound of waste
Rot and decay under the sun

<i>[Solo: O'Brien]</i>

With pain
Rage and hate
Suffering is faster
Suffering is longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Suffering is forever
I don't think you'll live
