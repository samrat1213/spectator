What do you hope to prove? Other than the fact your species deserves a permanent fucking extinction.
Unlike other life forms, humans are worthless.
Make way for my offspring of darkness.

This onslaught was pure amusement, a senseless massacre.
Not a single thing more, for the seekers of peace will only find it in death. 

I do not need assistance to rule this world, everything will grovel at my feet.
The only thing I find valuable about your species, is the noises you make when you die.

This onslaught was pure amusement, a senseless massacre.
Not a single thing more, for the seekers of peace will only find it in death. 

Simple minded shit and piss filled sacks of meat and blood.
Not designed for rebellion, but the perfect specimen to experience pain.

What do you hope to prove? Other than the fact your species deserves a permanent fucking extinction.
Unlike other life forms, humans are worthless.
Make way for my offspring of darkness.

I will create a kingdom in my image.
But to rebuild, one must first destroy.
Your destruction will be instantaneous.

Mindless psyche, controlled and channeled through a series of religious tactics.
Futile humans. Delicate, empty, vessels of emotion.
