The excitement is stronger
You can taste a disinfected scalpel
As you cut the abdominal tissue
It's your choice!
Slow perpendicular cut
Made with a surgeon-like precision
Haemorrhage is minimal
The tissue of peritoneum is to daylight
Perfect anaesthesia eliminates the pain
Operation covered by means of sleep
Only slight uncontrolled convulsions
Caused by the next cut
Bent over human figures are
Penetrating further
The next organ is exposed
Little blood-drops cover aprons of
Surgeons equipped with instruments
The next part of tissue is torn
The fountain of blood spatters their faces
The trial to stop the haemorrhage
Is not successful
But the operation goes on
Still new explorations
You are completely taken in
Your dream is fulfilled
All organs are torn and mixed
Sick show cost you
The segregation of organs
But it's not the end
It should be cleaned up
The corpse has to be removed
The operation ends
All traces are cleaned
Hospital-like cleannes

Slight convulsions and you wake up
It was all pathological dream
You vomit with yellow pus
It's a sign of passing anaesthesiaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
