Arise
My shining beacon
A burning mass revealing nothing more
I created the sun to conceal whats behind
A destroyer of worlds

The seas increase
They will not fall again

Destructive forces annihilate the earth
Swinging the giant rock towards the stars
Upon the wrecking ball encircling the sun
Our mortal coil dissolves into the flame

The seas increase
They will not fall again

Under the ruthless sun you'll burn
In the fire and flame of your self-righteousness

Arise
My shining pillar of hate
A burning mass revealing nothing more
I created the sun to conceal whats behind
A destroyer of worlds

Abominations
In my inferno you will burn

Scavengers
The worlds worst disease
Like maggots laid in the seam
Consuming all until the corpse dissipates
This lifeless vessel exhausted
A victim of our own hate

Abominations
The destroyer of worlds is upon us now
No judgement for your failure
Just execution

A trial by fire
Annihilation of man
No judgement
Just execution
