I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And not dare this to get better

So all throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of one pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way
You took my breath away
Distracted by the view
I fall right into you

If you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

'Cause if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need my love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever
