Space is being ripped open, like this feeble human flesh
Altering the development of beloved history

Rewrite

Not ready for parallel shift traversing
They pass through the gate, plunge into the void
Watching the deeds practiced by one another
Is this a timeline truly worth being destroyed?

The magnitude of my conception is inconceivable
A product of true perfection here

Ribcage breaking from the inside out
Oh how good it feels to finally be set free

Witness the intimidation so we can use it at our will
The continuous electro pulsating field keeps on turning
Only organic materials may pass through with out harm here
All other forms of this life will dilapidate into nothing

Not ready for parallel shift traversing
They pass through the gate, plunge into the void
Watching the deeds practiced by one another
Is this a timeline truly worth being destroyed?

The magnitude of my conception is inconceivable
A product of true perfection here

Ribcage breaking from the inside out
Oh how good it feels to finally be set free

Witness the intimidation so we can use it at our will
The continuous electro pulsating field keeps on turning
Only organic materials may pass through with out harm here
All other forms of this life will dilapidate into nothing

My uprising, my kingdom, my most astronomical event since I created time
