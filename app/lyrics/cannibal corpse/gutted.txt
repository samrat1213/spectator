A tale of the deranged, this savage brutal being
A shocking way of life living on human offspring
Murder of the innocent,
His pale grey face, expressionless
Horrid dismemberment

One person's torture is anotherâ€™s pleasure
Malformation, a diseased brain

Unsuspecting, slowly dying, as his knife invades the child,
Screams of pain, no one hears, blood splotches now appear,
Ecstasy through each cut, now the body twitches
The gutted little torso ready to be cooked 

Isolated in his own mind
The need to kill now possesses
His body self-mutilated

Between killings, ejaculation,
Cut off appendages of former victims,
Sexual violence satisfaction
Disembodied corpses, spewing gore
On his body, soaked with their fluids,
Various digestive parts and assorted meats

Plunging his fist down the throat,
Ripping out the guts, internal extraction

The entire body bleeding, the heart stops pumping
The child lying dead, just another gutted infant
To satisfy his hunger, temptations of the flesh
Voracious appetite
Killing to release pure souls to the heavens
Justification of his killing
Self-torture, stiffening pain
He sees the faces of the dead
Guts are strewn from the children
Splintered bones, poke through skin
Gratification through castration
Roasting parts for consumption
