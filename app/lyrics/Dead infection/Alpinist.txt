Two alpinists were climbing up to the top
They were halfway up when suddenly
They tripped and went down

One of them went down vertically
Onto his stretched legs his head stuck onto his backbone
The second one pushed his neck into his midbrain

They survived the fall but died on the way to the hospital
In the place where they fell a monument
In the shape of a sled was erected
Because a year earlier a guy died there sledding

Two alpinists were climbing up to the top
They were halfway up when suddenly
They tripped and went downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
