Prossessed by evil hell
Satan's wrath will kill
He will take your soul
Cast you to hell

Demons dogs domain
Keeping me insane
Evil curse my soul
Burning away

Satan's hell will burn
Terrored cries are heard
Ever lasting eternity
Warriors of hell

Unleashed men of sin
Hatred hell within
Sinners hate will die
The exorcist

I can see the light
I don't whant to burn
Help me save my soul
Let me live
Your curse is not my fear
Demons within me hear
I will escape your wrath
666

This is not my way
Doom, sorrow for eternity
Lights shine below in hell
Forever burning

Words of insanity scream out
Help me

Demons in my body gone
Sickened thoughtss left beyound
Haunted by evil memories
Nightmares in sin

My hand is burnt and black
Shadowed no way back
Fear of living in hell
Axed my mind

Memories held within
Satan's gone in sin
Grasping to relieve the pain
Scared for life

Exorcism takes control
Beneath my body help my soul
Save my soul from the evil hell
Your spell is lost
