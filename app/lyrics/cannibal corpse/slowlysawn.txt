Bound tight to the table
Unable to scream
The blades of the sadist
Are all I see

Meticulous slaughter
A saw for each limb
Cuts through my flesh

Every day brings torture
Methodical pain
Slowly sawn into pieces, slowly sawn
Burning staunches torn veins
Slowly sawn

Dissection resuming
After hours alone
One leg is severed
And thrown to the ground

The madman is silent
While pushing the blades
Jagged edge rips

Every day brings torture
Methodical pain
Slowly sawn into pieces, slowly sawn
Burning staunches torn veins
Slowly sawn

Protracted slaughter
Slowly cut apart
Every day another stroke
Serrated edge slicing
Through tendons and bone

Prolonged incisions
His job is almost done
Sawtooth surgeon cuts
Dismemberment
Limbs hang from hooks

Every day brings torture
Methodical pain
Slowly sawn into pieces, slowly sawn
Burning staunches torn veins
Slowly sawn
