Bleeding wounds never clot
Even after death
Murdered dead look on from beyond
Never to return

No way back at all
Trapped
Between life and death
We can't return to flesh

I'm dead now
Life has passed
In the grave
No life left
Move on to
The other side
Rotten
I have died

Murder took my life away
I will never rest
Dead, reaching from the grave
So cold in this place

<i>[Solo - Jack]</i>

I'm dead now
Life has passed
In the grave
No life left
Move on to
The other side
Rotten
I have died

Murder took my life away
I will never rest
Dead, reaching from the grave
So cold in this place

No way back at all
Trapped
Between life and death
I will come back
