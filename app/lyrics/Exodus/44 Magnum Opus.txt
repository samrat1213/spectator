Can't withhold my anger, won't control my rage
My bloodlust will be sated
I'm locked and loaded, ready to engage
Killing everything I've always hated
A motherfucking Van Gogh with a gun
About to paint this masterpiece
Blow the world into oblivion
Paint with the blood of the deceased

Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony
Written in human debris
Art and murder; true synonymy

No appeal, no "I got a raw deal"
I don't give a fuck
One thing is clear; I've got a deaf ear
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop 'til the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide

The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
My .44... magnum
My .44 magnum opus
Bodies are the canvas, ammo is the vision
For my greatest work of art
I'm waging my own inquisition
Tearing everything apart
I'm building a monument to horror
A temple so divine
Remembrance to those I've massacred
Death, the grand design

Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony
Written in human debris
Art and murder; true synonymy

No appeal, no "I got a raw deal"
I don't give a fuck
One thing is clear; I've got a deaf ear
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop 'til the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide

The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
My .44... magnum
My .44 magnum opus
Go!
People will stare in disbelief and awe
When they see what I've created
Still life, no life; beautiful and raw
The world will be captivated
Never have they seen something so ambitious
Like nothing done before
A work so terrible and vicious
A masterpiece of gore

Fire away
Put your body on display
Build myself a tower of decay
A symphony
Written in human debris
Art and murder; true synonymy

No appeal, no "I got a raw deal"
I don't give a fuck
One thing is clear; I've got a deaf ear
You better shut your mouth and duck
When I get a taste of laying everyone to waste
My hunger won't subside
I won't ever stop 'til the last body drops
Let the bullet be my guide

The virtue of vice
In my bloody paradise
A portrait of gore
