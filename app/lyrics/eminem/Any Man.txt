Bars to Any Man by Eminem Lyrics
Will and the Mix, original bad boy
Killing these pricks during mad ploy
To grab toys from a lesbian
And slap dildos round the faces a rappers acting thespian
I know it's far fetched to leave my ex with a scarred neck
And her arse stretched after inserting a large desk
My card's next, after being vexed by allah
For shooting up the curry section and the next isle after
In a super market, I get Snooki's arse whipped
Fuck reality TV, I smash the screen with a hard kick
Clipped a peg on my cock, slit ma knee
And smashed my head on a rock for 50p

Coz any kid, that'll pull his dick out on vid
And do mad shit, all for a penny or quid, is fucking crazy
You hear me?
I'm fucking crazy

Surely I'm fucking crazy
Not even the holy book can save me
Even the cops take a look and evade me
Thought it was weed to blaze and I puff on bay leaf
I'm shook and I'm lazy, sanity escapee
Wanked with numb hand, thought it was a man here to rape me
Got paranoid and shit myself up
Picked up a butter knife and give myself cuts
Coz I'm fucking crazy
You hear me?
I'm fucking crazyEmbed
