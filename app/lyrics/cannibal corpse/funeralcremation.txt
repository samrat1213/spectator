Stand before the corpse
Of the man I killed
His mother is behind me
Puts her hand on my shoulder
Torment deep inside
To be unleashed on those inside
Starting with this bitch
I grab her arm and smash
Her body on her lifeless son

A day of mourning fuels annihilation
I will kill them all by funeral cremation

Relatives must die
Of the man I killed
One by one destroyed
Nothing left when it is over
Torment deep inside
To be unleashed on those inside
Ending with his kids
Blood is flowing from their bodies
Out of misery

Out of their misery
In with my cruelty
Erase the present
To forget the past
Chaotic fury
Was driven by feat
Fear so intense
My whole family was slaughtered by me
