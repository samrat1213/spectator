Humans, a fucking wound on the entire stretch of the universe
Exploring these dimensions beyond their own comprehension
We cannot allow this to occur this way anymore
The veins of life shall flourish by the death
For with cleansing, miracles will start to bloom
Frequencies shaking, and melting their brains
A delicacy I lay up, feed them to me

Metamorphosis progression is in commencement, time is erasing
Cells erupt, disintegrate
I have become all powerful
I have become all powerful
Skin turning into ice and separating from their faces

Not realizing the depth of their own curiosity
The fabric of space and time have woven into me

Fuel required, harvest organic material
Terraform the Earth; and process their blood
Splice the genetic code to create new lifeforms

The veins of life shall flourish by the death

For with cleansing, miracles will start to bloom
Frequencies shaking, and melting their brains
A delicacy I lay up, feed them to me

Metamorphosis progression is in commencement, time is erasing
Cells erupt, disintegrate
I have become all powerful
I have become all powerful
Skin turning into ice and separating from their faces

Unravel my timeless mystery, of which the ancient relic devised me
I cannot resist the command of the monolith, it has always guided me

Preliminary experimentation
Intracranial regions splintering
Preliminary experimentation
Intracranial regions splintering
Relentlessly prying at the nervous system, invading your body and mind
