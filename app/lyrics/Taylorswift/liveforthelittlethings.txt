One daybreak, one heartache
Every once-upon-a-time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and borderlines

They mean so much to everyone
But you count 'em up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A bluebonnet with rain on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out right
One last dance, new romance
Living for that love at first sight

They mean so much to everyone
But you count 'em up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A bluebonnet with rain on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Oh, yeah, oh

No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

Na na na, na na na
Na na na na, oh yeah
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na, oh yeah
