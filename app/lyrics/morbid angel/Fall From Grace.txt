Fall from Grace Lyrics
Hot wind burns me
Burning as I fall
Cast away
Speechless in the holy way
I survive
The scourge and banishing
To scorching land
I am lord, I take command

Fall from grace

Forgive me not
This knowledge makes me strong
To resurrect
The cities of the damned
All the treasures of Sodom
Now belong to me - celebrate
Fallen angels take my hand

Fall from grace

Whores long for my flesh
And my desire
Lust anointing me now
Consume my soul
I writhe in the flesh and the sins of hell
I am Belial
I bend my knees not before my selfish desireEmbed
