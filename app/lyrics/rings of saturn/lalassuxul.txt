The ancient battalion birthed in the early universe surges through the extent of the cosmos. Harness the elementary particles, the power of a black hole is at our disposal.
Take aim at this sphere. Gravitational waves surround the world, as we watch it decay into oblivion. Atoms turn to dust. The body cells rupture.
An unsettling occurrence to lay sight to. Remnants of our existence, scattered through time and space.
Consumed, ensnared, mute of all fucking light. Lugal.zu.i.men. Lalassu Xul  I am your king. The Evil Spectre.

The god of death has arrived to smash the larva that crawl on this land. Squirm, earthlings. This is all that you can do 
For I have come here because of each one of you. I have planted my seed in your mother Earth, to watch the roots of death finally flourish once again.
Consumed, ensnared, mute of all fucking light.
