Falling from grace forever damning the human race
A parable amongst mortals, for we were damned from the start
Mass creators of population, yet destroyers of civilization
With piss and bile coursing through veins that flood an ashen heart

God damned this world -- that is if "god" exists
God hates this world -- left his "son" tied to a stick?
God as sadist -- this is the portrait you paint
God is within and we ruin everything...

We ruin everything.

Slow death (in the garden) unnatural selection
Sodomy (unwillingly) of everything
Our debts will never be paid, our mark left unerased
The sands of time now a suffocating desert
Devoid of color, grey matter produces greyer skies
The will to power -- a suicide

Leave no trace -- eliminate the human race

Killers.
Murderers.
Civilians...
The gardeners of Eden

Wreckers.
Ruiners.
Terrorists...
Addicted to death

God damned this world -- that is if "god" exists
God hates this world -- left his "son" tied to a stick?
God as sadist -- this is the portrait you paint
God is within and we ruin everything...

Leave no trace -- eliminate the human race
