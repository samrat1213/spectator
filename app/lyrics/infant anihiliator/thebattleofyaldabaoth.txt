The battle had barely begun before bodies, like mountains, piled up toward the sun
Blood flows like a flood
Crimson mud washes over the land where civilization once stood

All the while, the war rages on
The weak fall quickly to the mighty and strong
And they wail as they fail to withstand the cataclysmic defeat that has been brought upon

Fantasised genocide
Imperial subdivide
Humanoid pesticide
Indiscriminate fratricide

A war of filth and harrowed souls
With none left living once the battle unfolds
The trees only allow a peak of light
A glimmer of hope

"Rip them limb from limb from limb"
"Burn their bodies and char the skin"
"Crush their bones into dust"
"And feed the wind"
"Eat their hearts with a threatening grin"

All the while, the war rages on
Many have fled, and now, all hope has gone
The wounded cry and try to escape
The neverending slaughter that has just begun

As the warriors erase the fiends unclean
The King sits in his dwindling throne
His mind is filled with only loathing and woe
And with open eyes, he's paralysed
His gaze fixed upon the legions of heretics
Demoralised

Rivers of atrocities
Miles of monstrosities
A grim stream of desolation and misery

May the hopeless sing through their journey to the damned!
And deep underneath the flourishing life lies death

The roots entwined in the rotting
The warriors of primal supremacy
Prostitutes of war decaying in the dirt
For all eternity

Feeding the pines, the valley of swine slaughtered for their faith
The horns sound once more in the deep

Drums
In the deep

"Hell upon Hell, death beyond reach"
"All howling voids and torment beneath"
"Swallow me, please, and let me sleep"
"Though I know the dark is swarming with teeth"
