Always love the ones you hurt
Passion killer with no time to mourn
Cold comfort that your heart is torn
I wish you hell - sealed with a kiss

Tenderized twelve ounces of flesh
Love is a void a wound in the chest
Never open your heart worn on your sleeve
Sweet affection lip service to the bereaved

I am no ones property
In no others do I trust
For there is no true love
Only varying degrees of lust

Coronary deceased
Pitiless piety
Despicable cardiology
A rapture in purulence

Solid cast heart, metallic annealed
In surgical

Steal your heart your true soulmate
The best vengeance is living well
Love is a bitch it maims to please
I'll see you again once more down on your knees

We all wear the culled bull's feather
Senseless wittols of mistrust
For there is no true love
Only varying degrees of lust

Myocardiam depletes
Detestible pathology
Seventy two beats per minute desist
Ruptured in purulence

Solid cast heart, metallic annealed
In surgical steel

Exiled on maim street

Don't tell me that you want
Don't tell me that you need
Don't tell me that you love
Don't tell me that you care

Don't fool yourself
