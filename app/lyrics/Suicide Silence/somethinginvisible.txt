I can't hide this anymore
I've got to speak up
It's time to say what the fuck's on my mind
It's your smile that I miss and your
A fake smile behind a wounded face
With hands to hide the doubt you have in faith

So deep inside of you

You're the saddest life my eyes have seen
Suffocating in your own fucking doubt
Your own doubt in faith

And I know exactly how this has come about 

As long as I can remember you've always been this miserable
And it's all because you're still believing in something fucking invisible

Making time to think has made you weak in your own convictions 

As long as I can remember you've always been this miserable
And it's all because you're still believing in something fucking invisible
