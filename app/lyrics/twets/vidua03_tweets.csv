"""how could he know anything about a davenport all the way up in Lindenhurst?"""
pain is the only constant reminder
if you were to see a dove in a dream
here's everything you've always known
little piece in the news about it
dreamt Beckett built the pyramids
little black and white tv in the parlor
I spend the day with an unlit cigarette
a sinkhole opens up across the street
bring me beads from an ancient abacus
it was as if you'd fallen asleep with your arm above your head
she's a solar eclipse at sunrise
the gentleman caller calls again
I have written your name on every page
find her in the spaces that inhabit you
the song the moon sings in her sleep
last night's shirt still smells like you
I am the plant and the watering can
lately I've been dreaming of only strangers and unfamiliar places
here to repair her ramshackle heart
Dreamt I met a girl named Marjorie in the mail room. On the porch a man in blue shorts and a blue shirt watered the plants with a tin watering can. I sat at a table with a bag of rolls and an unopened Miller Lite. He asked why I was always so quiet and showed me a purple flower.
When I am unsure of something I photograph it in black and white.
afterwards we listened to the rain
her waning crescent heart
in dreams you still whisper my name
hold her close with your eyes alone
dreaming so close to the surface
you thought the fireworks were just for you
to draw you near with just my eyes
dreamt of a hand on the small of my back
your hand on my cheek as you kissed me
a minute with his exquisite stillness
I should have kissed your mouth and taken you back upstairs
I loved them all a little differently
I run my finger down your forearm
for him I will always make an exception
some people you love implicitly
the pleasure of undressing for a man
what base is it when they put a bunch of ice cubes in a ziploc bag and smash them with a hammer just so you can have crushed ice in your drink
I can't stop thinking about your palm on my stomach and your lips at my throat
to hold you the only way I know how
the little things only she notices
on days like this I miss winter's early darkness
I dream about you as the sun comes up
some days nothing much makes sense
and just like that she fell into your lap
I see the moon through curtain and glass
dreamt he brought me a basket of apples
something only the sun understands
I dreamt I never loved you
every so often I fall asleep to birdsong
we fell in love on an overnight bus
waiting up for the thunder and the rain
I dreamt I was suspected of a crime
the way a cloud turns gray before it rains
the oldest magnolia is just a leafless tree
in a dream you bring me the nose of the sphinx and watch as it crumbles at my feet
dreamt we cut through the neighbor's backyard
to dream without a destination
all beauty is by accident
where imagination ends and she begins
in a window next to the moon
a moon more crudely drawn
I dreamt my heart was a honeycomb
I've never seen a neck so elegant
like a letter sent to his last known address
your voice gets so tiny sometimes
that's just my heart backfiring
a song that breaks like a fever
the things we whisper behind closed doors
I remember when you lit my cigarette
there is a bell that never stops ringing
girls who live on streets named after trees
I don't think I realized I was dreaming
time enough to find the silver lining
I wonder if suicide ever thinks about me
tonight I whispered my own name
it was the way she called your eyes hazel when anyone else would have just said brown
dreamt you called me by your sister's name
imagine if our shadows could speak
to translate the flight of a butterfly
sometimes it's like I don't know how to walk when I don't have a destination
another night of tongue-tied isolation
another song about crying in the rain
I sleep beside a broken heart
I don't know but it seems like depression's been doing a lot of the talking lately
I'm ashamed to have a body at all.
dreamt we watched as the constellations broke apart and the moon became the sun
when temptation stands motionless
she could ruin you with her hip bones alone
the one who loves you more than she lets on
"""how could he know anything about a davenport all the way up in Lindenhurst?"""

I don't know but it seems like depression's been doing a lot of the talking lately
I'm ashamed to have a body at all.
dreamt we watched as the constellations broke apart and the moon became the sun
when temptation stands motionless
she could ruin you with her hip bones alone
the one who loves you more than she lets on
shaking like an old scroll saw
in the lavender of her shadow
eyes that hold the light of distant stars
tonight the stars will smile again
I am the moth that sleeps in your heart
to follow the moon and fold down the sky
I watch your eyes move south
you touch me with such patient hands
dreamt I saw our names on a padlock
I have tried several times to get out of bed
her shoulders would break your heart
I'm a ballerina on your stage
some nights the moon sings the blues
I've never known what was expected of me
when our hearts were made of stardust
she is a flower that opens with the sun
she offers her softness to you
an empty house is bigger at night
when the words burst from the pen
I might dream of a tree lined street
to lie in bed and watch you get dressed
ants cover the buds of the peonies
who you were before you gave up
the girl with rainwater in her veins
a wedding band made of light
a trail of ants to her honeydew heart
girl with the dogwood flower tattoo
like rush hour in a foreign city
I remember first realizing my own insignificance though that's not how I understood it then
who will pick me when I become a flower
you loved me the way a mother would love her only surviving child
our love won't see the light of day
all my life I've been just shy of flowering
digital pig in a digital pen
a poem for those I've pushed away
the roses exploding all around me
first person plural is a love language
the song he sang as he walked away
making our way through the moonlight
every precious thing these hands have held
a moon brighter than ours has ever been
I didn't say I needed saving
the moon was orange and her cloak was red and everything was like a picture book I once had
dreamt last night of a woman who was my wife and my mother and also myself
the way he would speak so gently
a poem is but a performance
what if this is the opposite of sin
come fuck these thoughts out of my skull
how long since you last wanted to die
so strange to hate a painting I once loved
how long have you been holding it together
his hands have grown impatient
one day someone will have the patience
the strange ways our lives overlap
I dreamt we sat back to back
a light heart turned heavy
if I had kept him at a distance
a way to hide your broken heart
the way the wisteria strangles the trees
to sit with him in silence is enough
I might have kept myself at a distance
some nights I dream of your mouth
some nights I dream of your mother
everything just goes on vanishing
you want nudes you can come over and take them yourself
broken chains that weigh you down
dreamt my hands were a source of light
"when she asks him why he's drinking himself to death and he says, ""I don't remember. I just know that I want to"""
I hear the blade drawn from the sheath
your heart before it was broken
the lost art of reading the fucking directions
"I once dreamt I was a dog with a human penis. I was underwater with a woman with perfectly round breasts. The water was gray and silent, and both of us could breathe. She held up a yellow lighter and flicked it, but nothing happened. I knew before she did there would be no flame."
newborn lungs filled with birdsong
I miss the simplicity of your smile
I smell the fire before I hear the sirens
all the stars exploding in my mind
like lightning through stained glass
I light a dozen candles with a single flame
throw my heart in the recycling bin
your hands have never been wrong
I'm sorry for the times I couldn't look you in the eye.
I remember the color of her hair at dusk
I miss the way his hands would shake
I dreamt of my father as a child
gather me like berries and leaves
I remember when we loved each other. It wasn't that long ago.
the light of a window that is centuries old
watch her wings as they slowly unfold
"""So pretty,"" he said, and shook his head. As if her beauty made him sad."
always the one remaining or not included
you touch me as if I'm made of moonlight
this is the nothing we owe each other
sometimes tuesday turns into thursday
tonight I might turn to dirt and let the rain wash me away
if I knew the words I have forgotten
to sit in the shadow of a sycamore
if the words exist I haven't learned them
a song that ends the same way it began
they get louder and louder and eventually you can't even hear him singing over the horns
the way he holds her is a form of prayer
what if just the chrysalis is enough
an image of the only surviving witness
a kiss that makes the coastlines shift
watching you change your mind again
I called him shy and he blushed
to finally know why it didn't work out
if I loved you have forgotten
if you sang to me I have forgotten
if you held me as we fell asleep I'm sure I have forgotten
if you loved me I have forgotten
like finding a tiny Christmas star someone had forgotten to take down
a silver chrysalis hidden in the oleander
hey just wondering if we could talk about something you said to me in december of 2018
to make an example of god
I see myself as a composite sketch
every memory is a composite sketch
drive your truck right up on the lawn when you come to take me away
some days my heart is a grain of sand
last night I dreamt of him for the first time since his death
she feels like a field of blossoming poppies
you were hungry and I couldn't feed you
he used to send me postcards and poetry
love is a long-necked flower
maybe she wants to be your boyfriend
There were things I liked about that life. Things I miss.
dreamt I was sitting next to myself
I hope we never have to say I love you
that look when you first get inside
a wash tub filled with memories
I'll hang these memories from clothespins to fade in the midday sun.
a moth that has yet to be described
like a moth that emerges from the dirt
the slow dance of the moonlit sea
the holy sacrament of springtime
I think our souls were slow dancing
the fragility of birdsong
the fragility of a monarch's wing
windows 3D pinball space cadet and chill
since when does wind make me anxious
I'm just a starling imitating a hawk
the clocks change and you forget again
you let him take your turn again
"Dreamt of a little brown house next to a rock cliff. Water ran down parts of the dusty rock and workers were filling in a large rectangular hole in the ground at the bottom. I stood between the hole and the house, which I knew to be my house. I felt relief."
another dream that the ceiling was leaking
"I walked you to your car and kissed you goodbye, but somehow I was still upstairs, watching from the window. Whatever I do it seems I'm always upstairs, just watching from the window."
in dreams I make the desert bloom
at night my mind is molten glass
her kiss is synesthetic
I was waiting in a line that didn't exist
bring me honeysuckle of a different hue
I remember the voices and what they said
it's just that I've been wrong so many times
and you the only bird in paradise
I am the snow that falls inside your heart
love like you were the one to discover it
couting backwards as the sun comes up
the silent post apocalyptic dawn
all by that identical one that is I
to kiss her is to taste the dragon's blood
when you accidentally click on someone's profile and it happens to be their birthday
I have looked forever in the eye
all of us have got a body in the basement
maybe heaven is an endless department store and I'll forever be the child lost in the aisles
a hundred butterflies inside her heart
I want a girl with dirt under her nails
where the moon ends and she begins
somehow I always end up on a zoom call with someone who needs to replace the battery in their fire detector
imagine a forest without any trees
to know the night inside her heart
you call her name a hundred times
love like a raindrop inside your heart
all the futures I have known
Turns out I just needed something to write about.
here to tell you the story of my decades long discomfort with my own body
dreams that know the future before it comes to pass
the kind of girl you'd write a sonnet for
the boy you met at the bottom of a bottle
a certain sadness only we know
at night your sorrows walk you home
this is the desert where everything ends
find me when the sky goes dark and the moon becomes the moon once again
she lives on a corner at a four-way stop
the one who recognizes your song
the night I caught him in the kitchen whispering to an empty bottle of gin
I become a stranger when you're with her
the heart is a scarlet chrysalis
count the days in blossoms and blooms
this endless origin story
a kiss that could turn me to liquid
I flutter like a hundred hummingbirds
I am the doll at the bottom of the well
running from a past you don't remember
I have named every tree in the cemetery
in dreams I still can make you laugh
Dreamt I turned on the lamp but nothing happened. Just a click in the darkness.
maybe her heart is just a ball of yarn
these are the things I tried to say to you
today I am anther and filament
you remember the taste of her fingertips
hands that could break your heart
a song you've always known but never sung
counting backwards from the pain
the past as a slow draining cyst
tiny red buds that open while we sleep
I guess your ghost is probably in Paris or that apartment on Walnut Street.
the moon before it was the moon
I like to think I didn't tell you because I didn't know.
a burner left on in a dream
tonight I am the snowfall and the field
the day they published his obituary
Let her know what you're looking for in a partner so she can just pretend to be that and then resent you for it later.
dreamt you brought me a polka dot begonia
a threat to everyone's masculinity
every night is moonlit if you just step outside
I remember the way you smiled that night
dreaming of the first crocus of spring
maybe the heart is a scarlet chrysalis and love is a hundred hummingbird moths
a cocoon made of scar tissue
It's not because it doesn't bother him. It's because he doesn't notice.
dreamt I said something that made him blush but I don't remember what it was
in the dream my name was something vague and unfamiliar
for all the things you gave away before you realized their importance
behold the angel as she falls
first rain and now cold evening snow
a girl who could grow a garden in the sand
sometimes love is the raccoon that climbs the screen door in the middle of the afternoon
girlfriend with dirt under her nails
in dreams I might be a raindrop or the sky
when an attempt to solve one problem ends up solving another problem that you didn't even know you had
he'll show you love is so much simpler than you thought it was
not being able to express yourself is its own kind of loneliness
tonight I'm counting the cracks in the moon
a conversation you'll replay years later
dropping a letter into the outgoing mail
I've come to worship you in reverse
I once thought it impossible to be honest with someone else.
he held my heart with two hands
tell me with a guitar solo or a fanfare of drums and horns
we look to a different moon each night
there's a word I haven't heard him say
the way gold glows brighter in the fire
Click the link to hear the voice of God.
I once mistook his voice for my own
I spent the day thinking about vulnerability. Of Siegfried and Achilles and lost virginity. A mother's grasp replaced with a single linden leaf.  And I think I know now that the story must go something like this: for you I'll be the dragon's blood and you can be my River Styx.
dreamt I bathed in the dragon's blood
"I finally figured out what I want. I might not get it, but right now just knowing what it is is enough."
I dreamt I was safe with you
I dreamed that love was a linden tree a hundred feet tall and glossy green
the modesty of the first blossom of spring
I send my love with no return address
winter bares the trees just to see into her window
blush rose and yellow nettle
the kind of hug that would break her heart
a word to refer to what we once were
a song that lasts the whole way home
the way a stranger stared at my veins
darkness unfolds so tenderly into night
her eyes a thousand shades of blue
"""To hold the night, line by line, as it sheds its vestments to the wind."""
the heart is a castle and a prison in turn
"My mother sat motionless upstairs, a faceless figure in a rocking chair."
"In a dream I was back in my childhood home, dusting the shelves in the family room."
all the saints have her name
dreams of an ancient medlar tree
at night her voice becomes velvet
love will leave the light on
when we've exhausted all the topics
my heart a darkened neon sign
bring me thickly painted clouds
when the moon is halfway done
a feeling you don't know how to talk about
press my hipbones to the floor with yours
you kiss me and then I exist
her worship will make you a god
I remember we would wake up early and yet you were always late for work
I dreamt I came upon a giant bird in an empty parking lot behind the church
all the things a poem can't do
When I was young I would sometimes put my mother's glasses on. It was something like that.
a diner that has a jukebox in every booth
all of us dying or already dead
A poem doesn't smile when it hears your name. It doesn't remember the day you met. It can't make you a coffee or grilled cheese sandwiches or offer you its last cigarette.
A poem doesn't wait all week to see you and then stand speechless at the door. And a poem won't ever ask you silly questions just to hear the way you say certain words.
A poem won't ask about your day or save you a place in line. And I don't know of a poem that would gladly stay late if it meant the chance to walk you home.
"dreamt I'd waited too long, that I was too late"
the night you kissed me and I took you home
sometimes I rest my head on your chest and it's almost as if it's summer again
I dreamt of a battlefield at dawn
the moon sinking with the ship
Just had a series of dreams that helped me make sense of so many things. I am happy to be wide awake at four a.m. I feel like I could prepare a huge breakfast or maybe just watch the cars struggle to make it up the hill in the snow from the comfort of the couch.
love is an unpublished poem
a love that lets the wind blow through
you picture her topless and on her knees
she whispers to you when you're asleep
the grenade you carry just in case
she is a study in opposition
It's so nice getting to know someone you've known for many years.
a tweet to mark the occasion
All this time it seems I've been nothing more than a pebble in your aquarium.
"I dreamt of my sister, but in the dream we were twins. I asked, ""How many daughters does your mother have?"" and she answered, ""Only one."""
I asked what she'd been up to. Said she was trying to find a way to blur out her pussy in real life the way they do in Japanese porn.
the strangeness of waking without you
the moon hiding below the horizon
I lie on the persian carpet and count the crystals on the chandelier
sometimes exactly once is just enough
dreamt someone told me I had russian coloring
to fall asleep inside a tulip with you
She called it January rain when she'd forgotten the word for snow.
things we do to keep a wound from healing
time stops when you're not looking and then rushes to catch up
the night we missed the bells at six
last night I dreamt of our first kiss
words that could shatter the earth
find someone who knows how to love you when you're dead
all the seagulls that would come when we were just trying to feed the swans
sometimes I wish it had been my fault
I dreamt of a red fox in the snow
a drug that eliminates the color blue
"Dreamt of a pale yellow house in another town. A friend lived there. I was impersonating an officer, wearing a short-sleeved uniform shirt with a matte brass name tag. A real officer showed up but seemed not to notice. Across the street someone played a piano in an open garage."
Spotify should split albums into what was side A and side B of the casette so I can fall asleep the way I did when I was a kid.
when every thought is intrusive
tonight the moon is tarnished silver
"a strange feeling today, almost as if I were finally recovering after a long illness but without actually having been sick"
she wanted to be more than just someone to come home to
I love signs of age in a woman's face
linen postcards of places that don't exist
you find her among the ancient ruins
the rain stops and starts up again
I'm the woman crying quietly in the passenger seat with my face turned to the glass
now she only feels that way in dreams
In the morning we can stand in the driveway unsure of what to say. I might smile and touch your arm and maybe you'll lean down and kiss my cheek.
put me in a sunny spot for six months and maybe I'll bloom too
Maybe it's time to reply to those Happy New Year texts.
the moon tonight like a photo of itself
"I finally figured out what You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine reminds me of. Lunar Park. I mean sure it reminds me of White Noise like everyone else. But also, and maybe more so, Lunar Park. So far anyway. I'm not even halfway done."
staring at the ceiling until it disappears
sometimes I think all my dreams are about you
I dreamt again of a childhood friend
in my dream I saw everything behind the dark mesh of a window screen
I dreamt I held a nightingale
find me in the hollows of an empty heart
well the washing machine absolutely destroyed my panties so
once I have you i won't want you for long
sometimes the urge to cry feels more like a laugh or a sneeze
somewhere the sun can't reach us
the boy with eyes of adriatic blue
just another package lost in transit
I dreamed we were traveling back in time
dreamt of well lit hallways and white linoleum and something important I knew I had to do
in my dream a half eaten cake
just the softness of flannel sheets
where were you when I came back from the dead
I go outside and look into my own window and I wonder who might live there
"I just heard a woman say, ""Am I speaking English?"" the way a parent or a teacher might to a misbehaving child, but when I looked she was talking to her dog."
I had what I thought was a broken heart
dreamt of breadcrumbs made of sand
I want to be the song you wake up singing
maybe you found someone else who covers her mouth when the words are hard to say
I had a question only you could answer
I saw the man from my dream at the grocery store
we were walking to the bar in the snow
dreamt of a clock with a disappearing face
drink tequila in the kitchen with me
seventy times seven of the deadliest sins
a poem that shows you the way home although the poet never could
I loved you before the months had names before the days had numbers
in my dream there you were    dragging another dead bird to my door
a dream about sex but not a sex dream
the way her eyelashes looked wet with tears
a smudge of charcoal is also a crow
bring me the silence of a single white rose
all the ghosts we hoped to leave behind
therapist who lets you smoke in their office
I fell into the space between every and day
just a name on her list of lovers
self portrait torn to pieces on the floor
how to protect this windswept heart
the winter sun seems to set in the south
everyone watched as you broke her heart
reaching for a light switch that doesn't exist
I lie in bed and listen to the sound of melting snow
thought I'd always say yes to you
a love as soft as the meadow grass each time the wind blows through
the way you would avoid my eyes
that door you opened in a dream
the heart is a shop that sets its own hours
like red tulips in december
dreamt I was an only child
sometimes it's your inner child who wakes you in the night
the gathering of crows before the storm
just found my french press...in the refrigerator
he holds her like a precious stone
I told you I loved you in a dream
on tiptoes past closed doors
the way you apologized with just your eyes
but I'm the one whose face you see
we watch them burn the devil in the street
when everything is rain and stone
with your fingertips between her ribs
our love stuck in limbo
my mind on piano my heart on upright bass
bring me drugs and wildflowers
for once it didn't matter how it would end
I didn't tell you. I didn't think I needed to.
I heard you singing a dream
dreamt I was drawing you a map
when love was a wheat field at dusk
the kind of song your heart might sing
a thousand years sober today
when forever has come and gone again
I know the echo of an empty room
"My decorating style is ""Would l want to be here if I were on acid?"""
to push you away from arm's length
I dreamt we were prisoners of war
the things he'll say to get you to stay
I am a light left on in the dark
I've hollowed out this heart a hundred times
enough desire for the both of us
sorrow's last spasmodic breath
I wanted to be someone worth waiting for
dreamt I held the hand of a dying man
Dreamt there was a tree stump and hundreds of mushrooms growing behind my dresser. A monarch floated by my closet door.
she shows you her scars in the dark
I saw the glint of infinity in her eyes
the way light fills the moon
when the wind sounds like the ocean
a finch and a sparrow and a nightingale
the way you sleep on your side with your arm across your chest and your hand on your own shoulder
heart like a heavily traded stock
sometimes my heart is a hammer
hold me like a book of poems
there by the chair where you used to sit
we hide beneath the light of a neon sign
to think I had forgotten about tenderness
kiss me like you're back from the dead
you hold me and the sky turns day-glo pink
if you knew that I was holding back too
at times I stand beside myself
maybe I'm afraid of scaring you away
Dreamt of a river that ran through the center of the city. I had the unsettling feeling it was running the wrong way.
listen to the wind howling at the moon
our hearts made of scar tissue
you might trace her name in the ancient dust along the ocean floor
tonight we are stones exploding in the fire
the fires on either side of paradise
the lines you drew without knowing
the yellow leaves hold on the longest
have you seen the way she smiles each time you walk into the room
thankful for the song of the ice cream truck
a heart made of space junk and metal dust
I hadn't realized how anxious I've been
have you seen her with her hair undone
a single pink tulip to remember you
that feeling when the one person you want to share something with is dead
not every little girl grows up to be a woman
dreamt of a door I couldn't lock
I'll be the sea and you be the moon
you touch her hand and you remember
it was what your eyes once said
nights I wanted to pull down the moon and crush it with my fist
what if everyone just wants to be forgiven
my poems are space junk and metal dust
you be the sea and I'll be the moon
"I remember being free to do as I pleased, I remember not wanting people who didn't want me"
"If you arrive at the intersection at the same exact time, the kindest thing to do is just sit there for the rest of your life."
I dreamt I ate a spider
"maybe it's the future, not the past, that flashes before your eyes"
dreamt I met an old man in the desert but he was my same age
bet you didn't know he could be tender
dream of things I'll never be and already am
I dreamt the sea was reaching for the moon
dreamt I couldn't pronounce my own name
dreamt of all the things I'll never have
found the fingerprint of a memory
heart like a second floor porch
you kiss me and the walls recede
the boy who lives by the bend in the river
go do your thing but come home to me
looking for a reason to wear these heels
the willows were whispering his name
I remember when you said I'm only beginning to understand
the boy with eyes like sunlit amber
I remember that night I could hear your heart beating from the other end of the bar
sometimes I hear my spirit stuttering
finally a voice that reminds me of my own
the words when they're seconds old
afraid of how little it might take
beginning to think some headaches are just uncried tears
the way you spoke to me as if you knew me
show me the poem you never wrote
this poem is the squeal of a brittle engine belt
those days you wake with a craving you can't name
those days you'd rather skip the euphoria and head straight to oblivion
I'm a child again in all my dreams of him
during sex I've never imagined that my partner was someone else but more than once I've imagined that I was
self-loathing in the time of covid-19
those days the snow falls upward
saw a man with your eyes today
the restless song of falling autumn leaves
when everyone can reply but no one does
come play your drum solo on the bottom of my thigh just above the knee
tell me about the time you got lost in a parking lot
I've held his gaze a hundred times
dreamt I was in the hall of a college dorm trying to find my own door
I got plans for next time boy
"Me after hooking up with someone for the fourth time: ""Are you doing this on a bet?"""
I wish I could hide in the hollow of a tree
while you wait for me to render
fall is for hallucinogens
kinda late to this one but why the fuck can't I listen to tom waits on spotify
she's a star shape at dawn
we stand on narrow cellar stones
the blackened veins of old news
tell me about your memory of that day
And the way he takes it off.
when you feel sad you can look up your name on urban dictionary
loving you from the requisite distance
"Just me shouting ""I'm fucking losing my shit"" through my mask from six feet away."
dreamt I called to you from the window
never got a chance to fuck things up
I only wanted to be beautiful for you
love is someone you make music with
Everyone wearing their white pants one last time.
the way the stars move through the dark
I miss the birds that used to sing in the middle of the night
I saw you out walking this morning and so I've left the porch light on
the same fuckin answers too
you had just graduated from college and I was getting skull fucked on my knees in the basement of a museum
hanging out at the pharmacy making small talk with the pharmacist
dreamt I got pulled over by an ambulance
she falls the way darkness does
I loved her practiced clumsiness
I dreamed of last year's strawberries
no dark sarcasm on the zoom call
it's somehow easier to post it for thousands of people than to send it to just one
I think I could feel safe with you
when he says he'll give you fifty bucks for plan b in the morning
these are the lessons we've learned from the trees
for those who wish to see her without any clothes
"Someone was playing ""Take This Longing"" and I paused outside their door."
that something so simple took so long
I have never dated a man who had a sister
the songs most often in my head are ones I haven't heard in years
I might wear my jersey inside out or underneath my clothes
One thing I've learned is that Moby Dick is like a hundred times better as a bunch of disconnected tweets.
sometimes I'll see you in a dream out of the corner of my eye
I can post it again if you'd like
show me those smiling and crying at the same time eyes
dreamt I found a spot on the lawn next to you and I hid in child's pose
I will stand on my own shoulders
I won't forget your eyes this time
and august passes me by butterfly by butterfly
her hand pressed to her heart when someone says his name
I was always afraid of making someone angry
"hoisting my axe again, as the man says"
I think it was your sweetness that broke my heart
today the wind sounds like rain
was that you I saw drinking whiskey at the end of some hotel bar
sometimes nothing seems out of the question
That was the summer the lilacs bloomed twice.
dreamt of an old friend again
dreamt you used the moon to light your cigarette
maybe if I stay out here on the porch I can keep the sun from setting
an invitation to rub your thumb along her bottom rib
the day I held his gaze and calmed his heart
here's to all the work I really should be doing
book cover
dreamt you asked me to sit on your lap
come over and be my friend then
dreamt it was raining and I hailed a cab and sigmund freud was in the back
One must imagine Beethoven happy.
like a string-of-pearls succulent touch me and I'll fall apart
I dreamt someone at work described my car this way and everyone laughed
it's the one with the cans tied to the bumper
"Santa Claus, California"
she greets me with a perfect curtsy
This thread is a job description for a personal assistant. Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience.
tell me about the heft of your heart
pulled a chair up to the stove to watch the water boil
should've boiled these eggs yesterday
is this the bottomless pit you promised
dreamt my glasses weren't visible in the mirror
I dreamt I held a needle up to the light and a tiny moth flew through the eye
What's happening? Just watching the dude who left his flashers on all night try to start his van.
our love is like a desert plant that flowers once a year
"a notification that someone liked all 4,884 of my tweets"
"I remember everything you've said and everything you did, even the things I seemed to ignore or to miss"
I will put my fist right through this day and see tomorrow's light
what hangs on the wall above your desk
burning leaves after the hurricane
"I'm sorry I can't work on Saturdays anymore, that's the day my neighbor plays guitar and sings in the afternoon by his window across from my bedroom."
we could stay in and just listen to the wind
portrait of the artist smoking a cigarette in a tornado
come spend the night in my bed again
slept on the couch and dreamt that an old co-worker had shaved his head
you're looking at the man who patented the bootstrap
tell me why perspective is so hard to keep
a fence to protect a dying tree
the sound of someone dialing on a rotary phone
I wake to find you staring at the ceiling
I miss drinking coffee from a paper cup
he kisses her beneath the sycamore before he leaves
if you get ghosted three times by the same person is that like a haunting? am I being haunted?
a phone so heavy you can't pick it up
baby's first healthy relationship
dreamt I was telling you why I had killed myself as we lay in bed
I've kept the ball in my court for far too long
blackout poem
a love commensurate with experience
find me at the creek stirring up the murk with a stick
Sunday: Unbutton my blouse as soon as church lets out. Let me dissolve under your tongue. Count each flower on my crown of thorns. Throw my heart in the river when you’re done.
Saturday: Find me in the kitchen with the daylight and the dishes. I’ll be curled into the bristles of a broom. Bring me a box of rotten pears and kiss me until you reach bone.
Friday: Meet me on the back stairs of memory. Run the vacuum to hide the screams. Tell me all the things you thought you understood. Fill my heart with fallen leaves.
Thursday: Serve me dinner on a snowflake. Iron my shirt with a rolling pin. Tell me something you just can’t say. Show me the way it might have been.
Wednesday: Show me the path that sorrow takes. Show me a church without a bell. Sit with me in the shade of a dying tree. Pin a rose to my lapel.
Tuesday: Bring me a syringe filled with starlight. Write me a poem that glows in the dark. Paint me a portrait of a newborn child. Unwrap the burlap from my heart.
Monday: Tell me the moon is made of scar tissue. Carve my likeness from a block of ice. Walk with me to where the river used to be. Show me the fire you could see from paradise.
pull the covers up over me when you think I'm still asleep
love is an attempt to collect a debt
stones of gall
"an ice cream truck playing ""Here I am, Lord"""
you pass like sand through my hourglass
tonight I might collapse into my shadow
"yet another dream of rotten teeth, this time my own"
teach me to tell time from the moon
the face you wear in dreams
tell me something you just can't say
show me the way it might have been
to listen to a river that flows from a glacier is to hear the mountain snow
and all the willows by the lake will know my name
you be a crown made of stars and I'll be the northern sky
I dreamt we had another name for the moon
crying over spilled moonlight
you're the itch of a healing wound
the same questions I had twenty years ago
dreamt you sat with me in the shade of a dying tree
would you recognize me in black and white
now she is the morning on someone else's shoreline
morning singing to the storm drains
her scarlet heart like a cigarette out in the dark
sing me lullabies that reach past the shadows outside
dreamt I learned that my grandmother had died in childbirth
he is taller when you stand beside him
dreamt you sent me a video of you crying on the floor of the shower and apologized because there was no sound
I know the song the river sings when you walk along the bank
find me curled like a fern at the start of spring
at dawn you sing your homilies into the darkened streets
bring me the ocean in a thin glass tumbler
endless footsteps that approach but never arrive
the way some nights begin
out past the meadow grasses the sun is silent
his heart an apostate in the vestments of a priest
the morning was dressed in the vestments of a priest
midnight singing to the storm drains
we met in the moonlight in a garden all overgrown
the memory comes forward slowly like a wounded bird
or the broken wing of a paper crane
the muse that broke the poet
I dreamt I slept in a pullman car that was carrying the dead
that notebook you're afraid to open
he runs the vacuum to hide the screams
autumn holds a stone in her heart
in a dream I saw her in a parlor standing before the mirror
in my mind I watch it replay in silence
a pill that makes the past make sense
like having test anxiety and everything is a test
I dreamt of a desert where the smoke trees still sing of swirling purple sands and all the hues of colored rain
it is later in the window than outside
for now I just imagine how your voice will sound
I dreamt I slept in a long stem of light
he brings the blood of violets to her cheeks
imagine killing yourself right before the pandemic
dreamt I fell into a rushing river and the pull of the current was so strangely familiar and in that moment I understood
dreamt I saw the moon fall into a basketball hoop
the day she found he had made her out of ink
when she leaves she takes the morning with her
I saw the city in a raindrop before it hit the ground
the way you hide the moon in your shadow
the bend of the light before it reaches the moon
love like sunflowers and lavender fields as far as the eye can see
a white fence a yellow willow and a wild rose
she's the song you can't help but sing
in the darkness she wears the sun
"""because I still do feel so horribly lonely"""
the back stairs of memory
"dreamt I got a kitten that I named goon (from buffalo 66). I sat on a sectional in my old apartment, the president of a university showed me his open billfold that held a small amber glass vial of weed, people were joking about how I was depressed and suicidal and i joined them."
a poem that shows you the way home
bring me the orange-handled scissors
dreamt the moon beat like a heart but no one else could see
the way you lift your leaves to the light
throw my heart in the river when you're done
powder your face until it disappears
I wonder what you've told her about me
find me when the floods come
all the willows by the river know her name
watching the older kids dive as I wait in line for the waterslide
when obituaries keep the papers in print
when you're right in the middle of some mundane task and suddenly last night's dream comes back
if only I could break the way the day does or the clouds after the rain
heard someone say a once familiar name and suddenly I was back there all over again: the cigar smoke and the arguing and the old windows that would rattle in the slightest wind
dreamt a man at work was giving out shots of orange juice because it expired the next day. he asked me if I'd want to be with someone whose dog had covid.
the swaying trees seem so nonchalant compared to me
in a dream I had a drink with your mother at the bar
a stranger's shoes in the entryway
this morning
she's the flood and the fire on either side of forever
a memory of a city street before the plows had come
a dress of wrinkled linen with buttons made from bone
like a picture of your parents on their honeymoon
the little blue flower who forgot her own name
"think I'll call this one ""the calamity that comes"""
it begins with your hands in the dirt
I've built a fence around my sorrow like a gravestone or a tree
saw the sun in a cereal box
the way she moved through the moonlit rain
one bird already singing in the dark and in the rain
tell me again about stained glass daffodils that catch the sun
sometimes I remember the front stoop and the mountain laurel shrubs and how sticky each little flower was
we walked on frozen water we mistook for solid ground
I dreamt of a faceless horse ankle deep in the floodwaters
her dress as bright as the moon
like a memory lost in a blackout
all those times I was the other woman
dreamt I found an unfinished novel in the trash
a torn sleeve where his heart used to be
my heart is a torn sleeve
a time to recite all those verses you memorized
where is the red dress you promised me
do you still miss his restless exhale
a train bound for some safe haven a thousand miles away
the apocalypse finds me mashing bananas
there's gunfire and then sirens and eventually there is silence
lights across the street in rooms that had always been dark
"""two thirty,"" he kept insisting, but the scrap of notebook paper he showed me said 2-30-35"
"dreamt I was living at my old elementary school. I napped and woke to find that my laptop, which I had left in the cafeteria, had been moved. a man with an accent saw me on the stairs and nodded: my things were locked up and the combination was 2-30-35"
a poem that breaks the moon in two just to put it back together
I am the mirror in your cage
find me kneeling at the worn edge of evening
she exists within those dreams between wakefulness and sleep
I've never once reached out to anyone but I guess people can change
all the willows by the river know his name
an obituary written by strangers
I slept and dreamt of a giant red sun but everything else was the same
"No more than five. My dear, we all must stay alive."
dreamt I pinned a rose to your lapel
I dream of them as they were back then
Allison. I dreamt of Allison.
how to get your dog to quit smoking
yesterday I vacuumed my phone charger right out of the wall
little sticker from a clementine to cover the webcam
I could be calm like an ancient blue flower or a wind that you can't see
the poet's wife is a yellow rose resistant to disease
I have grown gray as those winter streets
the way you tried to smile at me before you said good-bye
I dreamt I saw a scarecrow wearing his old shirt
dreamt of my hand on somebody's knee
from the back stairs the winter moon holds all the colors of the afternoon
the future is a flower in a highball glass
the way a blizzard is really more a matter of wind than of snow
you start using first person plural and I'll start using the past
dreamt I gave a blood transfusion to a girl with long blonde hair
hold my hand as I fall asleep so I don't float away
dreamt I saw a group of doctors in lab coats gathered on the grass outside the post office and one was warming up on a snare drum
pale blue blossoms awoken by the moon
the night moves lengthwise through the room
I miss friendship most of all
if you undress me if you touch my skin if you oh god anything
a barefoot child running after the moon
broken shoots that would have been trees
and I become an empty room again
the back seat of sorrow
dreamt you held a mirror in your hands
the folded edge of that afternoon
you can slide your apology under the door
there I am  looking for answers again
a train passes in silence beneath the gray light of the moon
who wants to go out for a cigarette
like a ghost I had brought to look after my sorrows
the age of the city beneath the first snow
carried as we are by the current
yesterday will make an anxious return
a hundred years with a rose in my teeth
entire cities set alight
put it under your mattress with your fear of success
I lie in the street and let the deer jump over me
my heart was once an unopened window
for a moment he holds the butterfly
the flowers that grow on memory lane
come to me with moonlight on the tip of your tongue
some stretch of highway under a sky more white than gray
the pencil we used to mark our height on the wall
every petal became a feather and then the flower took flight
the fire you could see from paradise
the things we didn't do even though we so wanted to
all the ways that grief has changed me
a poem for the painfully self-aware
in her armchair under the stars
a love to warm his orchid heart
the words you remember from long ago
she hides behind a darkened window
girl with a scrap yard heart
folding down the corner of a memory
another overcast and empty afternoon
even the evening is speechless
when the walls have lost their patience
days and weeks of hardened sorrows
in dreams I follow the sun to find you
the sound of someone whispering a thousand miles away
standing in the garden with a heart like an old screen door
try imagining a wheelbarrow that isn't red
in a dream I thought I saw myself in a crowd
falling in love with the same stranger again and again and again
I wait for the night to undo the day
I dreamt I was made of stone
we sit and watch the winter turn blue
dreamt of a man with long red hair and three blue eyes
like the B side of a memory
we have already made every decision there is to make
in a dream I hear the trains but cannot find the station
she is the sky at dawn
every river was once a subterranean stream
this is the river that waters the garden
find me hiding six degrees beneath the horizon
a dream of scenes from my recent past in complete silence
beauty wears a simple dress
the light from your hands like a crucifix
he likes you despite but I love you because
when you see the person you dreamt about the night before
everyone needs that friend who can tell them what to do when they want to use a word with a hyphenated prefix as the first half of a hyphenated compound
my arms will tell you the weight of the moon
the way the headlights know your stillness
kiss me again with your hand against my cheek
the snowflakes turn to rain inside your palms
a poem you wrote to the waxing moon
it seems I've never not lived by a fire station
the kind of goodbye that lasts all night
your face as I see it in dreams
with the moon looking through your window
we can dance between the stanzas where no one else can see
when the distance between us was a single cigarette
this is a secret revealed in a dream
the night will cradle what daylight doesn't touch
loved so much it turned to dust
I remember when you said that nothing ever works out
tonight you might remember the empty chair in the front row
the danger of mistaking yourself for the muse
I find an empty room and lie down on the floor
someone I'd like to be friends with but likely won't see again
to do the work of a seed in the soil
all my dreams had been silent
some nights I run out of patience
we follow the leaves back to the sky
I've seen the moon turn her face to the sun
the day he opens his cage
what if we found an empty house floating in a dream
the ocean has already seen your sorrow
a single light on the edge of evening
the way sunlight can change the shape of the moon
like a box of rotten pears
when your arms don't reach the ground
or the curve of her ribcage underneath your hands
come over and watch my orchid bloom
it was as if her footsteps walked alongside her
the sun has torn a hole in the midday sky
dreamt the city was all building and no sky
The Deer Hunter -  Can't Take My Eyes off You   via @YouTube
I might dream of your hands pressed together in prayer
it's as if we share a secret but we're not sure what it is
thought I saw summer sitting at the curb
"I dreamt you said ""I found it again"" and I knew what you meant"
dreamt I played the piano for you to hear
I miss wanting to smoke cigarettes but not the smoking
dreamt you were happy and had no use for me
every lover is a landscape
love is giving away your only copy of your favorite book
silence watches from the empty porch
remember me in the smell of a blown out candle
to learn to observe with closed eyes
the only city where I always know which direction I'm facing
you told me your sorrows in a windowless room
in dreams you curtsy to the trees that blossom by the river
sorry you got moonlight on your shoes
boys with eyes that trap the light
the body I once thought of as mine
they said forever is a refuge but I didn't believe
how long before you find your hands against her flesh again
a dream about old jobs and old bosses and hair dye
"this morning, around eight or so, it was ""i'll be your mirror"""
your hands against her flesh again
there's a waiting room inside her where the TV's always on
hold me like my heart is made of sand
describe it the way a child might
in dreams I am following the moon
she is moonlight through a microscope
somehow it feels like someone else's morning
to sink into the ocean's velvet dress
a time when I didn't see years as empty rooms
grew up in the darkness of a carpenter moon
dreamt you lived in a house without a driveway
I will forgive you from the window of a train
where the wind was a whisper of translucent blue
dreamt I was just a naked paper doll
still as stone and silent as the sand
each poem is an outstretched hand
a butterfly alights upon your mind
he types the way I've seen others play a piano
your heart when it was elsewhere
dreamt the moon was a second sun
"what does it mean when you wake up at three a.m. with ""breaking the girl"" in your head"
I always find you in the basement on a mattress on the floor
the written equivalent of a stick figure
he sings about orchids at the part where your disc skips
in dreams I've caught her watching me from a distance
the rattle of ice-coated branches in the breeze
dreamt there was a drawing of the statue of liberty torn from a book at the bottom of the stairs where the mirror used to be
how many nights I have dreamt of the dead
he said forever was a cage
her eyes had somehow followed me home
somewhat afraid of just how little it would take
I had forgotten about your hands
dreamt of a hen pecking at broken eggshells
dreamt of the yellow house across the street
always remembering the ending wrong
that feeling when you finally decide you're done
dreamt of a potted marigold underneath the tree
dreamt anne ramsay played a plainclothes cop
dreamt I taught with my back to the class
alone together
the lone passengers sharing a seat
gray sky  billowing smoke the train  the leafless trees  the fence  the fallen snow
you straighten your shirt as you pass
write my name with your left hand so I won't know it's you
I want a bed that's closer to the floor
dreamt I was picking out flowers for a bridal bouquet
I still look for you through the windows of every city bus
his tongue teased me some more
let me rummage through your mind
as if the world was waiting there
I am a sparrow in the dirt
in a dream you sat across from me but I couldn't see your face
a shy blue morning
the swirling water of a dream
all the trees and how they looked
an orchid blooms inside of you
a heart that opens like a star
a heart that opens like a flower
a song about the shamelessness of rain
my lover will play an acoustic guitar
you meander a while here with me
I have followed the river to its source a thousand times
the way every leafless tree stands waiting for the spring
my heart is a ball of red rubber bands
the clocks change and you remember
come over and watch my fingers as I type
a beaded curtain for a bedroom door
you were sitting in bed near the window and I stood at the door
pick me up at sunrise so the two of us might sleep
in a dream a white wall and tall windows facing east
an astronomer in love with a single star
call me when you've all but forgotten
the sound a thousand breaking hearts might make
that smile when someone says her name
tonight I hear voices in the raindrops
your name is on a list of widely used passwords
"nothing but land, but before that, a river"
I get as far as the part where we first see his tattoos
tonight maybe I'll try to remember all the bedrooms I have slept in and just maybe I will sleep
maybe I'm a framed painting at a saturday garage sale
that I am to require my students to write for a real-world audience confirms that I am not such a thing or part of it
dreamt I painted a geranium by the window in your room
dreamt you read me a letter you had written to Death
somewhere is a corner between your house and mine
what color should we paint your desk
on suicide and other side effects
a man with an iron first for a heart
inject my skin with starlight 'cause I'm going underground
"once I read someone saying they thought the words were ""a preacher boy to farm,"" not ""a creature void of form"" and well I think of that young preacher boy a lot I guess you could say"
it waddles out of the pond like a poem on webbed feet
dreamt I saw you in the park feeding goldfish to the ducks
like a poem with webbed feet
the way love moves like fresh water or electricity
you knock and a blind woman answers the door
we might meet among the lines of some old poem
because it is on fire and because it is my car
left forever in the last paragraph of a first draft
like something planted in cold weather
lines of a poem that rise like rows of corn
what is love if not a conversion disorder
dreamt of a man with my mother's hands
you dream of an ancient mulberry tree
when you hope that it takes the rest of your life
dreamt I found freud in the phone book
the city dreams of a golden dome hidden in a tree
who will write about the poets
you call an old friend to tell him you're in love again
can someone come over and turn on the TV
the sound a snowflake might make in your palm
maybe I'm one of those people that the ads after videos are for
I dream of the desert and wake with sand in my sheets
another dead fox on the freeway
this poem is the smoke of forty cheap cigars
the way she smiles when you ask about him
when all you see is smoke in the rear view mirror
thoughts that seem to echo down an empty hall
heart like a rusted tackle box
a dog to guard this junkyard of a heart
meet me in the morning over by the roses
answer me in yellow leaves whispering along the street
my heart is a ball of black rubber bands
I feel far less anxious when I think of time as a series of decades
the urge to return to the city of her birth
dreamt you couldn't open a bottle of soda so I showed you that trick with a rubber band
"""It was fate!"" fate screams from the inside of a poem."
dreamt of a diorama of my bedroom
dreamt of past tense adjectives
some nights silence is a sound
tonight I'll be your errand boy
prescription bottles filled with pebbles from the hills
poison ivy and riverswine and dreams of her first suicide
how to do about you
about cape cod and the sun and being blissfully young
she was singing a song about everything
"""there's coffee and xanax,"" she said"
emily grierson drinking kool-aid and gin
you were standing at the bottom of the hill smiling up at me
I'm sorry I mistook you for a painted figurine
I'll be the one in the velvet dress that buttons down the back
dreamt you were wearing my shirt again
dreamt of an answer embedded in a question
tonight I remember the minnows in the creek
you hand me a shell from the beach we walked in a dream
alone in the pasture without a lamb to feed
dreamt I introduced you to a ghost
your reflection in her necklace
the church on the riverbank that waits for the flood
love like an overturned ashtray
to have heard the poem read by the poet himself
some nights young and dumb and clumsy is enough
you tilt your head to face the sun your blue eyes bright like fire
if only you fit in a prescription bottle
you sing a few bars of a familiar song
tonight I might imagine your hand on my thigh
all your poems floating in an inkwell
your rocks do not offend the river any more than the rain
you're the telephone ringing in the operating room
I'll be patience and you be certainty
sorry you said Inherent Vice when you meant Infinite Jest
yellow leaves that whisper along the street
I know someone with the last name Cipriano and every time I hear it I imagine they're just saying Soprano with an accent
balled and burlapped heart
when you've forgotten the way he used to look at you
we follow the willows through the streets
I wish this time it would be different
an empty room at the end of every hall
your look so lonesome
she wears the ocean like a dress
tonight I will close my eyes and listen to his voice
those winter streets you know the ones I mean
the movement of the moon on the surface of the sea
"I dreamt everyone had a mug from a place they once worked. I gave my mom a teacup from her wedding china and said, ""You were a housewife."""
a rainy day that clears up just in time for sunset
I look out your window and see nothing but sky
you could be a mountain or a butterfly
eyes like the underside of an iceberg
write it on a cocktail napkin and pass it down the bar
asking strangers who I am
the morning I said goodbye to your closed door
hands that once held the moon
a selfie that no one liked
to find the underside of the iceberg inside her mind
what if the moon was a plain white rose
some nights the moon hangs upside down
that night you let me walk you home a thousand years ago
the way you writhe beneath the hands of time
the path that sorrow takes
the last time you dreamt of the moon
yesterday playing tennis with today
with eyes like sunlit amber
find me in the cemetery as the sun comes up
dreamt I held an empty room in my hand
only darkened bedroom windows
dreamt you told me I could get to indiana in a poem
dreamt the sun was a spider
dreamt of tree limbs disfigured by the dusk
back in that patch of june sunlight
wrote your name in every bathroom stall from here to alabama
someone to take my picture on the first day of school
she is moonlight's epigraph
he sang to me again today
power wash me off my feet
I've made a fence of my memories
she only loves the ones who got away
meet me by the tree with the blue trunk
the two of us as seen through an opera glass
we could take our sorrows out some rainy afternoon
I think I dreamt your girlfriend was pregnant
boy I would flirt with you on my birthday
dreamt I had barnacles all over my hands and feet
Puzzling? I don't know the last time something made so much sense to me.
dragging the river for Jesus
in a dream you see jesus in a panama hat
dreamt jesus was my cell mate
dreamt I rubbed my head against you like a cat
an entire year and I haven't fucked it up yet
heard you apologize to a butterfly
dreamt of a crow with white feathers
for whatever these words refer to
I'm the crumpled bill in your tip jar
she's standing at that door again
dreamt midnight had the eyes of a cat
for the moonlight and the moon
so many things you could have done and you did nothing
the sea the same as the fog
when I think back to last summer I remember only august
dreamt I gave you a post-it note with my name on it
I made him blush and then looked away
summer months of falling stars
bright and star shaped and gone the next day
pornographic video of a man watching a pornographic video
"This week a friend told me she was pregnant. Another got a new job, and another got engaged. Me, I saw a tiny magenta flower in the grass where I take smoke breaks. It was bright and star shaped."
a poem about a motion picture cowboy
meanwhile a father and son argue about a compass
anxiety is the barbwire is that thorny crown
I'm sure the earth must be curved like his smile
received it again this morning around ten
today someone told me my record was skipping
I want a dress that whispers your name
the roses are standing on tiptoe again
dreamt I was writing a poem with commercial breaks
all the flowers standing on tiptoe
dreamt morning wore an evening dress
I'll take your pulse with my own
you could be the center of an ancient blue flower
dreamt my shadow caught on fire
we could rename every painting in the museum
when someone tells me I can be anything I want to be
I could be an ancient blue flower whose center you can't see
if I had been a flower bed
"just talked derisively to a woman in a painting, if anyone's wondering how I'm doing"
you can be the anesthesiologist the day they open up my heart
I dreamt you were trying to wake me up
we walk in sunlight and smiling silence
I notice you don't talk to me when I'm wearing a dress
I dreamt that our arms touched and we were both speechless
she waits in a dress with an unlit cigarette
a change in the way the gratification arrives
dreamt of a dark and endless room
winter's blurry afternoons
dreamt of old newspapers and leather on the walls
something you have to look into a mirror to see
meet me in the mountains by the moon
songs to help me remember that I've been here before
tell me about the distance from the sidewalk to her stoop
the way midnight moves through the room
the daylight shines right through his heart
your choices are always away or toward
she has a nickname for me that I've never heard her say
maybe you'll dream of a quaker prayer meeting where you sit with your needles and your yarn
picture me a golden retriever shaking the ocean from her fur
"Obviously I'm rereading Infinite Jest, and now I wish I was in a book club. I wouldn't necessarily say much, but I'd like to be there. Maybe I could host it."
guided meditation for entertainment purposes only
he would put on guided meditation videos while he wrote
things I'll never have if I stay with you
send me your notebook in the mail
she adds the hearts in later
you would find that you could not yourself object
"Also I had a strange sort of after-the-fact orgasm, which I watched rather than experienced. I was alone in his bed and having what were basically neurogenic tremors. I noticed we had the same sheets."
"So last night I dreamt that I slept with David Foster Wallace in a dorm room. Afterwards I touched his face and thought, ""Oh my god, eventually he kills himself."" I didn't say it out loud, but I could tell he'd somehow heard and was annoyed by it, or seemed to be."
some days you're up before the alarm and writing in bed
I wake to find you putting up the sun
lost in the blossoms of the roses
I saw images of a room I've been in hundreds of times and noticed things I'd never seen
sitting on the carpet of a sunken family room
"""the way she seemed always caved in over and around her chest as if she’d been speared there"""
always trying to get to the bottom of the page
dreamt I ran across the surface of a swimming pool
"dreamt of laura palmer singing ""oh father"" in a trailer park"
dreamt I smoked a cigarette inside a museum
tonight I sat and wrote thousands of words without once stopping to think
handful after handful of sediment and silt
trying to see this for what it is
to learn what the relationship between certainty and patience is
the riverbeds and streams become goldfields again
a year of repairing things
sometimes you wake up touching yourself and wonder what it means
dreamt I was telling you about a dream
a dance for every man who's ever laid eyes on you
and then and then and then amen
just wishing I had something to offer you
I saw a worm eating a bird
how slowly the door opens now
queer as stopping without a farmhouse near
the one who makes you shake your head and smile
when you finally get around to seeing mark twain's house
asleep in an old molasses barrel round the fourth of july
counting the flowers on your crown of thorns
such a ridiculous dream it's as if my unconscious mind is mocking me
here are all the things you thought you understood
dreamt I collapsed with laughter
a feeling that maybe next time I won't be the one to make it out alive
you can come over but I'm just listening to the rain
sometimes I wonder when it was I lost my nerve
we could sit on the bandstand and hang our feet off the end
come over and make me forget I exist
how long does it take for a frog to eat a snake
in the span of your attention
loose sheets in an old folder
he brings me a road book from before the railways
I wander dark streets with the handle of an old sewing machine
trying to be something his father had only pretended to be
veins of opal through sandstone
in the morning a note to myself on the fridge
I wait for you in the light of a sudden evening thunderstorm
all the little shortcuts I know come back
a poem like crushed opal
I bought you a gift that I ended up keeping
love like an underground boxing club
walk with me to where the river used to be
today I stood in tree pose for a hundred years
come over and convince me I exist
creepy ice cream truck playing fur elise
I dreamt you were a sculptor and I turned to stone
ask her why she wears a band-aid on her wrist
remember when we stopped to let a turtle cross the road
I dreamt my heart was a butterfly
you try to imagine her reaction
he stayed and talked but faced the wall
back to not even remembering why I'd want to feel better
dreamt I screamed into your mouth
I wonder sometimes if my followers here can tell that I've changed at all
read to me your impromptu blackout poetry
I wake up on the floor where the bed used to be
does he get down on his knees every night and thank god for you
the night knelt upon your mind
rusted clouds from down the highway
sorry for the ones who never knew such arms
an unbroken line to your childhood
like throwing your first curve ball into the neighbors' living room
dreamt we stood in a field with our horse and our infant child
the love that coincided with the onset of the illness
you would dismantle her castle just to furnish your home
her dark walnut heart
just before the sun drops behind the church
the one who wears a red shirt in all my dreams
I went downstairs to ask you about a dream
I can't give you an explanation but I can give you a hug
a drawer filled with things she'll never see again
you smile at me as though I'm not there
a thank you card a post card a playing card a note card
I wonder if paintings have favorite museums
what better audience than a group of tourists to practice your new routine
you pause tonight in buttoning up your coat
I saw an albino frog carried on the shell of a red crab
dreamt I spoke to a poet on an old rotary phone
today you held me in a dream
embracing pain as an altered state
a lead pipe made from unfinished pewter
to be the beautiful one who died young
watching TV in a water glass
this one's called the onset of the illness
she's all lace curtains and one act plays
I slept in my dress in an unmade bed
dreamt I was a typesetter before the civil war
I knew a girl named Harriet / we wore the same size jeans
the fig tree and the full moon still await your return
your voice sounds different in a hospital room
the sky that existed before the moon
you remember in the steps back
dreamt of a piano in your bedroom
your hand over the top of the cup where you'd caught a lightning bug
I heard a child call a statue indecent
"this one's called ""I loved you all this time and you didn't notice"""
I'm not saying that this is the best I can do
summer sunsets at the riverbank or by the windowsill
I saw the sun rise in a velvet sky
a smile that could make the moon crumble to crystalline dust
dreamt I had been the shape between the light source and the scrim
the room giving light to the hall
the thaw my heart mistook for spring
a barrage of jagged hailstones
the shame and inadequacy is all mine
the sun setting all about the city
afraid I won't want to let go
let me know if this is a poem
there I am with my shirt tucked into my gym shorts
all your thoughts become secrets
tonight I will dream of them again
that thing you can't sleep without
dreamt of a translucent nightingale
in dreams I see her a mythical creature half serpent and half cat
so completely transparent and ordinary
picture a friend halfway to harm
I reach out to you just to see you recoil
tonight the willows walk you home  down pebbled shoreline roads a wet cement of yellow leaves and memories turned dull and green  for when you count yourself to sleep    a silent gathering of stones
nestled in a hillside between relevance and time
like breast milk for the infant child
my impulse when you left was to make myself ugly
dreamt I had done something wrong
the rusted hooks and tangled lines in this old tackle box of mine
but you were talking to the pear tree over by the garden gate
I brought you a tiny wooden spoon
dreamt I wrote your name on a blank piece of paper cut into the shape of a shoe
heart like a pad of post-it notes
a poem like a city bus or an underground line
kill me with molecular mimicry
back before it had become a pattern
he makes me a coffee the way he likes it
hang my heart like an IV bag
I am a shadow made by a child's hands
dreamt of a graveside funeral
dreamt I sat in a classroom made of glass
narrowed are the eyes
the softest black suede with iridescent seed pearls sewn in geometric shapes
"""no money in the bank of dust"""
a mother who always seemed inconvenienced
"and then one day you hear someone say ""pennies"" with a midwestern accent and you remember it all"
good at making bad things sound good and nothing seem great
now that we know what closeness is
the one or two who still see the summer inside you
think I'll stay up until the rain stops
woke myself up speaking in a dream
heart like a deaccessioned artifact
always looking into a dusty mirror
more like a hiccup with just the start of a smile
the view from her bedroom window in the middle of the night
I saw abraham lincoln in a velvet robe
a rose suspended in an empty room
the story itself is the poem
he offers to her an imaginary rose
let me be the paint you huff
reading from the disabled daughter's diary
a sort of softly blurred beauty
a patch of shadow in the shape of a woman
the closer to death the more you know
tonight I stand at your casket
where the barefoot spring laughs about a dream
the eyebrows of the clinically depressed
dreamt your death mask was on fire
dreamt I was telling you a joke but the person next to you was laughing
I know without counting how many there are
love is a bird with a many chambered heart
some days all you hear is background noise
See you there at 3:05.
the night we saw the sun rising from the moon
still on our way to that unlit cigarette
like sunlight through the blindfold
you scream as he removes the stones
an ode to the old and toothless
come hang your coat on my door
sometimes the trick is finding a healthy alternative to dying
I prefer to work by the kitchen window in the morning or at night
all of us in different rooms and different doorways
dreamt I wrote my poems beneath a daffodil lamp
I've been an old woman my whole life
always a celebration in all my dreams of him
dreamt I kissed you until you moaned
here between sometimes and never
her orchid blossom face titled upward toward the moon
the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite jest
leave me poems in the folds of my hospital gown
"""Once a woman told me that colored flowers would seem more bright if you added a few white flowers to give the colors definition. Every petal of blue lupin is edged with white, so that a field of lupins is more blue than you can imagine."""
let me dissolve under your tongue
single occupancy heart
when you're still depressed but no longer suicidal
grass fires on either side of the highway
only the narrator calls her by her name
dreamt of far-off planets on the other side of the sun
a moment is not where but when
I sat with my back to the door and watched people come and go in the glass
saw your face in the smoke above a cigarette
the moon is an illusion forever holding her peace
december's a death mask kept under the bed
find me crying at the bottom of the stairs
meet me where the river is a mile wide
retracing my steps back to your heart
the one who still sees the summer inside you
the way midnight shimmers on the surface of the river
a heart that tears like damp paper
I watch your coat go by the window
dreamt I met a stranger with your name
dreamt of the room I have tried my whole life to forget
midnight hidden in the hem of her dress
unprotected tweets
I see you've gone and cut your hair again
"how sad that one can complain about no one ever loving the ""real"" them and at the same time never share themselves with anyone for fear of not being loved"
imagine following your significant other on twitter and not even knowing it
where she keeps her calm
a memory in a highball glass
dreamt of the stone at the center of a ring
this dismal process of self-correction
the afternoon lifts her dress
the moonlight still shines through the blinds
shores of black velvet sands
for the drink already poured
the little notebook where she wrote it all down
"imagine smoking in bed, he said"
immortalize me with your post-it note poetry
when summer runs for cover
you could drink tequila in the kitchen with me
the back seat summer afternoon
a dictionary filled with illustrations for all the words you can't define
a poem in the shape of her face
rough streets made silken by the snow
his love like flour through a sieve
even the roses have frozen
touch me again the way you did in my dream
at that gas station that sells that snack you like thinking about your laugh
"""Far from me there's an island that turns aside when ships pass."""
in the smoldering fire of subconscious desire in the gap between platform and train there's an indigo evening gown filled with the wind and a sundress she won't wear again
the summer wore roses
you share your sorrows with the moon
the smoldering fire of the subconscious mind
dreamt you tired to sell me a bristleless broom
you dream about the sphere inside the body of a bell
like snow on a spiderweb
the day returns the night to the stars
the shadow of a rabbit you made with your hands
almost that time of day when you can say tomorrow but mean today
her heart was nothing more than a stone basement with a dirt floor
that look that goes tearing through your memory to the first time you felt loved
curves and contours that themselves are poems
a poem in which he remains
white steam rises from the cracks in the asphalt
dreamt about the making of the moon
wake me when it's time for the next dose
still smiling at something you said five days ago
dreamt I was painting my footprints on the floor
found beside a fallen white fence post
with a whisper you were hers
we knew the moon would keep watch over us
what is the river but a black velvet dress
we borrowed the light from the afternoon
I spent five years forgetting the letters of your name
I walk around with a half open mouth unsure of what to say
the blackout poetry of memory
to sleepwalk through the afternoon
a man from indiana with the moon in his hand
dreamt I saw a moth stuck in wet cement
in my dream you wore the vestments of a priest
I listen to the garbage bins rolling down the hill
she was standing in the shadow of a passing cloud
I'm the leaves in your gutter
the way sorrow softens your eyes
did he take his time undressing you
snow flurries floating by sidewise
a poem about a door that closes on its own
after a while you stop giving every poem a title
I dreamt of a gun in my father's nightstand
woman waiting for a pelvic exam
a silence we can hide in
the wind turns to glass in her hand
find me at the bottom of a velvet pouch
some nights I spend the whole way home feeling like I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I scan the poetry of your fingerprints
my heart is a thimble
when you walk right past a life you might have had
fill my lungs with your tarnished breath
bring me pencil shavings and rubber cement
the sun dropped into her hands
I wish you would've stopped me before I reached the door
she still remembers the way you whispered her name
beneath the muted blue of midnight
dreamt of a body trapped in the ash
here is a picture of your father on his deathbed
I was looking for someone who understood without my having to explain
the words you wrote an hour ago
when you said my name and smiled
sometimes I think we must be in love with the same person
he was careful to never promise you anything
dreamt I was the sand in your hourglass
to think I nearly turned away
find me at the very edge of the light
I saw my own face in the classroom window as the school bus pulled away
that night we renamed every constellation
the river continues without you
the clouds do their best to comfort the sun
the way he held her with just his eyes
I've always lived in old houses with doors that don't quite close
missed connection
you were selling prescription pills in the parking lot across from the hospital
lead me to the lost landscapes of your childhood
I dreamt of your reluctant smile
you read me your mother's favorite poem
trying to patch the broken plaster of the moon
my brain had emptied out and I confused the darkness outside for myself
the time it would take to paint your portrait
the clouds outlast the afternoon
a love like winter sunlight
she came to you in lace when what you wanted was cotton
what it means to pray for the angels
I dreamt of a wedding in a fenced-in backyard
a single space at the end of every tweet
maybe I am a painting based on a photograph
words that make the page shake
I dreamt you took my temperature as we waited for the snow
the poetry that moves her feet when she's trying to be still
all the window sills along the shoreline
every church basement smells the same
she's a deer in your headlights
I dreamt the house had a second floor
think of this as a grain of salt
I must have dreamt of something gentle
we know all the same secrets
she's the poem you don't remember writing
a poem you don't remember writing
his voice like water through glacial sands
I wake up before you just to watch you sleep
the last of your love recedes into the night
dreamt of a girl in a velvet dress and gray suede mary janes
the face of memory turns to glass
call me when you reach the second stanza
where the walls are made of moonlight
what was it that you were so anxious to explain
the unbroken surface of a thinly painted dream
flicking marbles at the moon
autumn left no forwarding address
I beckon to him from the jetty as the waves take my feet
they've changed the name of your church
tearing open the poem to find its scarlet heart
the fire gone dark in her eyes
teach me another word for woman
at the bottom of a brownstone quarry with no memory of who I am
find me curled into the bristles of a broom
last night I dreamt of an empty cage in a room lit by the sun
I found an empty room that once our love had filled
watch her hands when you mention his name
I have kept your heart in a silk lined box
the pins that hold the horizon in place
ghosts of smoke rising from the ocean
hold me like your last cigarette
her face was blurry in every picture
last night I dreamt of a circus on fire
morning tangled on the floor
a sadness set like cement
spin the moon until it sings
dark are the stars they told you to wish on
scatter me like a handful of seeds
you dream of a woman with wounds on her feet
I went back to the place it happened to try to feel something
in the fall you are a painter
I hadn't thought to ask the wind what it wants
dreamt we walked along the harbor beneath a long familiar moon
the light of dawn is cold again on the windowsill above the garbage can
even the walls seem blue
when all that's left is your breath on the mirror
tonight I cast two shadows on the stone
every villain has your face
click here to acknowledge receipt of this mess
self-portrait on a prescription pad
I told her I was fragile and she said that I was tough as nails
feel like a printer with an empty paper tray
bottles of milk on the front porch frozen in the cold
at night he still dreams of her mouth
his pockets filled with panhandled poems
the night is blurry and endless
head full of half-told secrets
dreamt we tried to scrape the sunlight from the snow
dreamt I spoke your name into a microphone as you walked into the room
down the street the blue oaks slow dance while we sleep
in some ways it was easier  always wanting to die
I will let down my hair for you
I know what that smile means you know
the way she explained it without once saying his name
where all our lines intersect
dreamt I ran a boarding house before the second world war
the trees leave their confetti on the lawn
our future scrawled on dirty concrete walls
shake the leaves from this tree so we can dance underneath
the night our laughter filled the darkness with light
I will line your winter coat with that summer afternoon
in the ancient city where he leapt to his death
tell me with your fingertips
dreamt I was there to witness his death
I can see my breath when you leave the room
feelings unaltered by light or shadow
I got you some moving boxes
does she remember when you held her until she fell asleep
the night is a paperback with its cover torn off
let me whisper to your cheekbones
drape your towel over my cage so I can sleep through the day
gone is the ax that could break this glass
where the wind has left its fingerprints
did I wash my sheets for this
dreamt we met at the edge of a young forest
paint me closer to you
like a tree that grows through a chain link fence
in the parentheses of memory
the sound of pumpkins smashing on suburban streets
caught you smiling at the moon
heart like an old brass bell
to say nothing of the fact that you just ashed a cigarette in your lap
when morning has worn thin
an answer to the question you were too afraid to ask
tell me again what I'll say as I strangle you
let this empty bottle be your microphone
even the moon has turned away
dreamed we were drinking beer on the basement stairs
I watch your hands as you talk to me
some days I am ashamed of her mouth
playing tic-tac-toe in the condensation on the window
the crackle of tobacco as it turns to ash
a memory that makes your hands shake
the hooded figure on the kitchen floor
the sacrament of his smile
each night you dream of her face in the window
two rooms that share the moon
those who worship in a windowless church
some days you confuse the sun and the moon
you press your lips to the bottom of a crucifix
your love on the evening wind
like the hit of a hollow point bullet
he tires of your sorrow
I offer up my walls to you in the altered state of sleep
marching to her death in a long white satin dress
I dreamed the streets were filled with sea-foam but we were miles from the sea
you abandon your mansion for a cottage by the sea
I see you on the bourne bridge with all the windows down
like a young girl's first piece of jewelry
the only house I dream of
all your secrets at the end of an ice pick
a poem in which the valleys burn and laughter fills the pastures
I imagine the sound of a half dark moon
in the morning you seem closer to the door
we sat in bulky winter coats in an empty swimming pool
when autumn has your arm
layers of paper-smooth moonlight
I dreamt you were naked in my parents' bed
an old prison cell with brownstone walls
a wet cement of yellow leaves
dreamt I was a pregnant bride in a tattered dress
hold the night in your lungs
where the moths eat my mother's wedding gown
dreamt I licked the screen door to see my spit fill the squares
by morning a bruise the shape of his thumb
it's a story I think you'll recognize
past the yellow of the meadow grasses
she comes back with all her flags at half mast
we could watch the flowers float away
night is an empty room
abandoned streets where pale shadows still walk
smiling with a mouth full of fallen-out teeth
dreamt we smoked in the lobby of an old hotel
a love that floods the mountains
a sadness that is somehow not my own
dreamt we pressed our palms together
a hug that breaks your heart
in the morning we found pieces of the broken moon washed up on the sand
those nights when you are made of stone
a sorrow taller than the empty house
first you have to make a list of everyone you've ever kissed
sing your songs to the soil while I slowly decompose
dreamt you told me of a murder in your hometown
saw an angel made of motor oil spread across the floor
she tried to hide the moon in a brown paper bag
you dream of your lover with a spider in her palm
I met december in the churchyard on a summer afternoon
the way you wear your sorrow
another night is silent
you heard her somehow
he held you in his broken bed and kissed you at the door
we can share a cigarette from your secret pack
sweeping your hair from the kitchen floor
fill my heart with fallen leaves
she's the snow in your globe
some days you're the toilet that won't stop flushing
a grown woman with the handwriting of a teenage girl
dreamt I was walking a dog through a dark parking lot
just kiss me until you reach bone
maybe you'll find her lurking behind the furniture
I saw you gazing at the wall as if it were a window
I dreamt we met in a makeshift morgue
meet me by the tree where the sparrows sleep
I saw the sun rising from her hipbones
in a dream I heard you singing
your secrets seep into the carpet and eat through the floor below
it's always just past midnight in her dreams about the sea
where the road narrows to a balance beam
counting the acorns that fall on the roof
in a kingdom made of straw
too insecure to voice her insecurities
tie your hair with a typewriter ribbon
a girl of ten testing the acidity of the rain
I heard a voice on a loudspeaker repeating the same unintelligible message
I saw myself pushing a stroller through a great hall with a young girl at my heels
some days I feel chalk-drawn
saw you folding down the corner of a page
a dream that lifts the city and gently places it back down
the way they scrape like a rake across the pavement
the song she was humming as she walked away
the night she left her necklace on the table by his bed
the long walk back to consciousness
the night we tried to measure the distance between the desert and the sea
where the blossoms dream of blooming
when you find that her locket has a mirror inside
the way you say the word sorrow as if it has a thousand syllables
I tried to jump over the puddle and discovered I could fly
dreamt I saw my reflection in a full length mirror wearing someone else's clothes
dreamt I held a broken worry stone
the clouds ignite and the night applauds
the sidewalk was closed so we walked in the street
portrait of a stillborn child
the moon a magic 8-ball
you heard the voice of god in every shell she held up to your ear
the dirt road that curves down toward the orchard
the way her voice changes in the evening
the one where you're the riverbank and I'm sinking in the soil
like a mirror in a moonlit bedroom
heart like a gathering crowd
we saw the insects etch their secrets on the surface of the pond
kiss me while the river is still silver before the daylight turns it blue
the song of the paper sparrow
the first lie you ever told yourself
here in summer's shadow
even the windows shiver
fingertips filled with grief
the human heart is a hollow cone
the dreams of the child too shy to speak
sweetness is the last thing that some people need
walking barefoot through your dreams
in the minutes of a meeting that hasn't been held
walking barefoot through your whispers
the one where I hold you until you stop shaking
voices of old friends calling out to you
self-portrait made of dying stars
the vaulted ceilings of your mind
dreamt I wrapped his hands with bandages
I swear I saw your face pixelate right before my eyes
standing there with the evening in her hand
love like the stained glass windows of an abandoned church
a church built around your hospital room as your fingernails turn blue
meet me in that translucent city I've only seen in dreams
how the moon looked broken before you left
between the waiting and the room
kiss me at the coastline before the glaciers melt
an open window on a winter morning
she boxes up the ocean's blue and sends it home to him
beneath that black satin dress
dreams of a body I once held
words that don't exist yet were marked as archaic
dreamt I sifted through the unbound pages of an old dictionary manuscript
a deck of playing cards with images of all the times I've wanted to kiss you
if you've ever seen the soft glow of sunlight through thin marble
left my heart like you left my dress
a pill crusher for all that is hard to swallow
every raindrop creates a crater that one day becomes a lake
beneath a gray stucco moon
a fraudulent email about fraudulent emails
back when we lived on the same planet
the secrets of an empty room
seven images of stillness
Day one of seven (likely nonconsecutive) days of black and white photos of my life with no humans and no explanations. I was nominated by the one and only @NikiDresden. I nominate @themoonwithjag if he's up to it.
a thought that sits just outside of consciousness
like a february without a full moon
when the scissors are sharp again
the names of three women written on the inside of her wrist
the woman he stayed with and eventually left
heart like an unmarked grave
a syringe filled with starlight
his secrets are sleeping in a hospital room
left in a corner of the typesetter's drawer
call me when the pain exceeds the pleasure
the moon won't last the night
the words I heard you whisper in a dream
the future is a self-inflicted wound
drunk on your homemade kombucha in the middle of the afternoon
your reflection in a raindrop
a breeze passes by the window but doesn't come in
*cracks open a can of tomato juice*
I can't wait to show you what a disaster I am
at the base of the mountain where stone turns to silk
the two of us talking through the fence
the night hung out to dry
you were holding a polaroid of your father at nineteen
I read of a man who traveled five thousand miles just to jump to his death
the way you kissed me in the back seat of someone else's car
the things you collected when you were a kid
some nights regret is a silent silhouette that lingers by the foot of the bed
meet me where the world has turned to stone
the words you whisper to the empty house
"""Bleecker Street, Summer,"" Derek Walcott"
tonight you dream of the sounds of the merry-go-round
when dreams awaken memories you thought were fast asleep
the riverbank that dreams of the sea
she left him to feel better
dreamt I held a single daffodil and offered it to you
today the clouds seem to dangle just out of reach
the porcelain dust inside your lungs
dreamt of the resurrection in reverse
I like the look of a just-posted tweet: words without any numbers underneath
I find myself mourning over long-ago losses instead of the one at hand
when the two took off their shoes the bride was taller than the groom
you will forgive your father when he has forgotten your name
the dust that covers all of us
with winter's razor pressed against her wrist
before you vanished into the blur of the passing streets
we share the blindfold
put your pillows at the foot of the bed to better see the moon
this gray chalk sorrow won't last the week
when midnight is silent and the shadows crystallize
I have drawn your portrait a thousand times
these walls are made of memories too painful to recall
like a bloodless incision
*pours dirty castrol all over white vans* oil on canvas
always thinking of roses but dreaming of ash
when autumn has hardened these patches of mud
a hospital room where dead blossoms drop onto an empty cot
a running carousel with no one on it
your bedroom window as seen from the house across the street
once familiar streets you no longer recognize
the one you wear in all my dreams
I dreamt your mother tried to convince me to take you back
young lovers with hands that shake
I love not recognizing my own tweets
when her face drops out of the frame
picture the moon in a blindfold or midnight in a bed of ash
she said the ocean looks the bluest not long before the end
in memory sometimes you strangle me before I make it to the door
I saw you in a dream  a syringe between your teeth  tying off your arm
midnight and everything in it
if you should find me perched on the ledge of memory
the way you change the shape of time
I met an angel made of midnight who was gone before the dawn
I have followed the river to its source
enough of a breeze to scatter the seeds
a conversation the two of us should have had years ago
follow the moon to an empty room where the sky sings you to sleep
she says her prayers on a stolen rosary
in a summer dress secrets perched upon your breast embers from the moon
the children dream of butterflies
tonight the city has your face
been trying for a while now to put the ball in your court
your future viewed through a keyhole
a collection of raindrops that have yet to fall
the yard sale where they sold your memories
he lights his cigarette on the way down the steps
think of this as the epigraph
you up?
you wake in an unfamiliar building to the sound of a fire alarm
you spend the night trying to climb the shifting fences of memory
the lemon wedge of time
a ballerina sneaks a cigarette backstage
I wasn't ready for the way you look in a dark winter coat in the snow
ask her how she did it and never once looked back
he dreams of a jockey on a spotted horse
sometimes the sky grows lighter as the sun goes down
I have forgotten the way back to your grave
an angel made of stone plays the harp in the graveyard
a smooth stone from the bottom of the ocean
a crowd gathers around the open grave
the nights when I dream of you it's all lavender shadows and intermittent blue
still waiting for her to write me back
one day you notice that your private list has subscribers
dreamt the walls were rough with barnacles and we folded down the sky
like tiny white flowers floating on a golden sea
drove for hours in the rain to leave a flower at your grave
you always refer to her as your mother but never as your mom
her hair a strange ageless ash blonde
these are the words that will reopen the wound
the currency of other centuries
this is the blood between his teeth
the hook that the kissing ball hangs from
a strange feeling this morning as if I dreamed of everything
the sound of a school bell on a summer night
leave me on a shelf in your memory
saw you selling loose cigarettes outside my execution
months and months of sunflowers
raking the churchyard in the last city to burn
the red sun drops into the ocean’s blue and in the east appears a lavender moon
thought I heard footsteps behind me but they were my own
in a dream you spoke with the voice of an old man
I dreamed a door where there was none and sunlight folding down the stairs
it sits on a shelf in your childhood home
a book too sad to finish
afraid to hear her own name
"sometimes this house feels like a cottage, as if the ocean is somewhere nearby"
a poem to remember the evening at dawn
a breeze passing through an empty room
this summer like a loaded trash bag that no one will take out
like a loveseat left at the curb
you find it there among the things he left behind
a seagull pecking at the beads of a broken rosary
dreamt of a town surrounded by mountains where everyone knew my name
like a lenten rose I will still thrive in your shadow
even the bluest night is no match for her eyes
the glittering creek where summer whispers her secrets to the sea
endlessly stretching this canvas
time to finish this morning's coffee
your secrets sleepwalking at dawn
music for a piano inside an abandoned minivan
a silver sky and a blue-green glass moon
her boiled wool blazer with the brass buttons I thought were ancient coins
you were once a song
on the porch as a summer storm brings darkness at four
to have never been a daughter
dreamt of a dark marble bartop and a shot glass filled with smoke
what is the opposite of holding hands
to paint a flower without knowing its name
when I picture you I see a moth the color of the moon
the long familiar streets I return to in dreams
moonlit raindrops the color of your eyes
your heart like a blindfold or a darkened white rose
a dream reminds me of my strangeness as a child
wait for me until the thistles go to seed
the morning glories clean forget the listlessness of night
words written in the evening underneath a paper moon
in a dream we met at the hour of my death
the roar of marbles across the floor
bare feet on the bed frame
watch the sun rise in a bathroom stall
as his hands form an apology
you were lovers in a dream on a train bound for the coast
chalk-drawn thoughts
midnight in a velvet dress
I have heard my own voice in a dream
all your masks look the same to me
a threat to my androgyny
somewhere beneath a backwoods moon
dreamt of blue-eyed dragonflies and flowers on your shoes
like wallpaper that's been painted over instead of taken down
that numbness in your fingertips that no one can explain
the summer spent inside a nesting doll
dreamed of a seagull that would tell the future in mollusks dropped from the sky
emptying the night from the ashtray
fallen yellow willows in the glass
I wait for you in the empty room at the bottom of the stairs
night like an overturned ashtray
all of it written in a single afternoon
a letter sent from someone else's address
looking for her childhood behind the fireplace tiles
love like an overcast afternoon
jam jars bursting in the basement
lifeguards with their noses painted white
a desire awoken by the moon
maybe the moon crosses the ocean just for you
dreamed of a cathedral at the center of the moon
the moon an ancient graveyard
an ache made of loneliness inside his chest
red foxes screaming in the valley
eating berries from the tree and spitting out the seeds
fallen mango moon
I dreamt I was the statue atop your wedding cake
a room for all your masks
you submit your work to a journal that doesn't exist
she brought you foil for your cardboard crown
the two of us have always been in love
dreamt of green gourds bursting in the valleys
dreams of narrow one-way streets
the way the light moves on the riverbank
violets bloom in an empty room
patent leather blackbirds on her feet
the moon was stuck in the berry bush
she made no mention of the moon
the light moves left across the empty bench
summer hovers by the fence and hides in the vines
playing pinball with the moon
among the yellow crocuses a lone daffodil hangs its head
all the borrowed light returned
the moon in a jar on the windowsill
lilacs in bloom in all my memories of you
the oceans know the secrets of the trees
the church across from the methadone clinic
we meet beneath the pink of the only magnolia on the street
the first thing you saw when you regained sight
eyes like the ones you see in old photographs
she's all photographs and legal pads and tag sale paperbacks
all those years sewing your own blindfold
tonight she will whisper to you in a dream
dreamt of a night unbroken by the moon
take the night from my hands
I remember a bedroom with wooden floors and walls of whitewashed brick
dreamt of a moon carved from the sea
in my dreams you're like an acoustic cover of yourself
dreamt of a little cottage made from my hands
still we are no closer to the moon
the wound that bleeds through the bandage
come to me with the summer inside your shoes
make your way to the desert and dissolve under the moon
listening to the river as it moves through the dark
white rose in green glass
the last cigarette you ever smoked
all the rooms are empty on the second floor
dreamt I was the wasp inside a fig
the stranger who gave her a home
she was a song in a plain summer dress
tell me again how you knew me before we met
paint on your jeans and chunks of plaster in the sink
your history of mental illness is the history of mental illness
summer waits blindfolded on the windward side of the fence
your imaginary friend who lived by the ocean
the worn edge of everything
you boil your secrets in the bath
dreamt I was afraid of your new white shoes
maybe the stars are afraid of the dark
the night I saw the future in a parchment yellow moon
red smoke rising from the ruins
back to crying in your sleep and forgetting all your dreams
made love to you in a rented room on the carolina coast
dingy blue waiting room on the second floor
dreamt I had no fingers again
the butterflies still fluttering in my subconscious mind
a deserted beach house filled with butterflies
in the moonlight you take off your name
two lovers etched in an endless minuet
bury the moon beneath the floorboards
dreamt I was barefoot on the train
hiding in the empty space above the stairs
put tape over the places where the tabs used to be and then record
watch the moon turn to chalk at dawn
dreamt I was a child in a hospital room
a poem in an old winter coat
we were sitting on the steps of our childhood home
in the dark our hipbones strike and spark like stones
a stack of cardboard boxes where you used to write your poems
the way some trees flower before sprouting leaves
the tree that crushed shel silverstein's house
something she meant to tell you before you went away
the bluest eve is but a strand and midnight is a pin
a game only she and the moon knew
mark my grave with a popsicle stick
dreamt I played the flute at your wedding
the worn edges of these memories
the body of christ is an empty room
in dreams we meet on paths on the underside of night
how many cigarettes smoked in the breezeway waiting out the rain
we swim where the river is warmer than the air
fill my hands with fortune-telling fish
find her by the ocean on an overcast afternoon
woke up knowing I'd dreamt of you but remembering only the glow of the moon
in an unspecified future wearing your jeans
I still remember you in a white dress and wooden shoes
waiting for the wet cement of sleep
a line of bottles on the windowsill in shades of green and blue
dreamt of paper swans floating on the surface of a song
hitchhiking with your ghost at dawn
saw a snowman in an empty field
notes folded like funeral flags
heart like an old radiator
tonight the poet wears wooden shoes
the light of the train as it pulls away
when you've outgrown the roads that lead back home
portrait of the artist in a hospital room
the way your feet alight
I dreamt of a statue with my sister's face
the promise you break in a dream
standing at the door with your pants on fire knowing she'll let you in
the hand that holds the blindfold
you held me by my rib cage and for once I felt safe
the shy girl who lived down the street in the house with two pianos
how often my own mother calls me by the wrong name
a promise you made in a dream
pulling the stone from the center of a poem
the story of a car wrapped around a tree
your kitchen sink filled with snow
the sound of your laugh the colored plume atop a hat
a used condom in the church parking lot
stumbling down the hallway in your mother's high-heeled shoes
dreamt I sat beside a pile of mending I knew I would never get done
an old wooden music box that still plays the wedding march
I dream of ancient cities and leaded window glass
first a white fence post
what good will it do to paint the closet door
today another suitcase floating in the lake
the moon in an incubator
morning sits on the windowsill telling someone else's secrets
the silver of city streets
you stand at someone else's kitchen sink and wear someone else's diamond ring
where the moon meets your street
haunted by a portrait that hangs on the wall inside another painting
saw a star shaped orchid rising from the ash
the man at the station with his paper and his hat
somewhere in summer a shovel hits stone
the month of june in her pocket
just a face in a photo in a locket on the shelf
wet footprints on unfinished wood
a skeleton for every closet and a closet for every skeleton
like the scarlet fish that tries to fight its own reflection
dreamt my shoes were stuck to the waiting room rug
you be the child at the window and I'll be the car driving away
meander with me through the dandelion trees on paths of purple sand
found you sitting on a suitcase with a postcard in your hand
the first white house past the cemetery
birdwatching with a boy from brooklyn
the flowers bloom in your absence
in the mirror you are made of light
the numbers of the routes that pass right through your town
there's a woman in the kitchen washing her hair at the sink
dreamt you gave me a ring with a broken opal
where the stars sing lullabies made of light
while your pearls gather dust
sad how people will settle and what they will submit to
remembering what the mirror held
put your cigarette out on my forehead and call it ash wednesday
a child with green eyes at the foot of the stairs
dreamt of a creek in the redwood forest and narrow cellar stairs
gloved hands to hold the moon
some days I am the ashtray
a dream in which you see a single sparrow in a tree
sat with my subconscious on a cold stone wall
hole-punch confetti on the classroom floor
flowers to fill an empty room
collecting acorns on your honeymoon
winter morning in a hospital room
I dreamt I was afraid to look you in the eye
the smile she saves for the camera
sing to me from your window seat above the city
I walk the darkness to the sound of your name
a dream so loud that the day seems muted
the nights you undress in the dark
when yours was the only opinion that mattered
in a dream you bring me the moon in a mirror
the night in a plain white frame
I dreamt of a hand held in secret
I dreamt of a man with his face turned toward the wind
the words he sent sit forgotten in a box of ballpoint pens
we follow the evening down lavender paths to the silver of city streets
the strange silence when the rain stops
a poem unfolding in the roses beneath a seagull moon
the child at the window of my subconscious mind
like the difference between discard and delete
that I might recognize the night when it arrives
a plume of blue smoke rising from a dandelion
dreamt of chalk on the sidewalks and her shoes in the next stall
the color of the courtyard moon
they sweep the stairs on monday mornings sometime after ten
a crown of laurel crushed underfoot
for a night we were like newlyweds without a forwarding address
the old me from memory
a yard without a single tree covered in fallen yellow leaves
who are you to misgender the moon
an old notebook filled with the names of ancient cities
the muffled sobs you mistook for laughter
she set fire to the pile of shoes by the door
somewhere in the city the smoke rises from the street
somewhere in the city an old heart has turned to chalk
you stand and address the empty room
a school bus filled with sleeping children making its way through the rain
heart like a boarded-up storefront
a light left on and other apologies
I watched you throw coins into the sea from a window in a dream
the night is cold against your coat
high above the fires we saw the moon turn blue
I dreamt the ocean had frozen and all the roads were closed
another someone he knew from the rooms
by the third season she doesn't exist
hundreds of buttons in a blue cookie tin
a memory of a lemon tree here in winter's blue room
your name on the back of a gas station map
the only known recording of your voice
she has always lived by the river
follow her footprints up the stairs
an old incandescent bulb in the light above the stove
we stood in the barn where christ was born and all the stars shone through the slats
in the muted scenes of memory
we see a crowd take shape in the street below
going where the snow hasn't melted
the moon in a rented room
she will dismantle your castle while you sleep
stacks on the horizon the smoke rising with the sun
a woman I've never seen before asks me if I'm following her
I've slept in backroads and hands that never held
I've slept in restaurants and on the steps of municipalities
dreamt we tried to fill the ocean with sand
old canvas shoes in the sand
the silent gathering of stones
in a dream I wore a jester's hat and lipstick on my cheeks
the fire at the edge of the moon
we'd sit atop the monkey bars until the sky went dark
still the sunflowers shiver against their will
dreamt I was mistaken for the librarian's wife
a young boy smiles from the back window of a school bus
she's the wind that whistles through the empty acorn shells
how often she dreams of the plush turquoise lizard inside the claw machine
madness scratching at your door
the two of us in a classroom putting up the chairs
a purple rose in a grocery store bouquet
dreams are the smoke rising from an ashtray
a light burns all night in the garage
blue trees waiting at dawn
a million poems before morning
we walked until our feet had turned to dust
you have startled the vultures that feast on my heart
memories like stop motion scenes
the last to leave with the farthest to go
a little girl writing secrets on the bottoms of her sneakers
midnight held in a velvet pouch
dreamt of a pale green moth trapped in a bag of potting soil
stuffed inside the glove box of memory
come drag your blue chalk across my midnight sky
I dreamt I stood beside you in a long and sightless fog
I slept in your dress and made confetti of your memory
the songs you only listen to at night
dreamt I cradled a broken limbed child
you wait by the window at the top of the stairs
where the widows walk in my subconscious mind
a memory lands in the garden and sets your sorrows spinning
dreamt I knocked on a dark green door
the way the wind shapes the land
the sun is rising in the rear view mirror as I drive into the dark
standing in the snow in the light before dawn
we were playing that game where you get a letter for every shot you miss
silently screaming from the center of a snow globe
the hum of the chrysanthemums in the morning fog
I find her by a white church with a red door
a poem that stills the moon
pouring sand into your chimney fire
the soft glow of every church window
never a pen in her purse
born beneath a leafless tree
tell me something that didn't come from a movie or a song
dreamt of the empty bottom bunk
feel like a squirrel caught in a mousetrap
front hall fireplaces and marble floors
the way he wakes you when it starts to snow
dreamt of grass fires in the pastures and a song in the wind
some days it's not safe to listen to the radio
I shoot my arrows at the moon
out of nowhere I remember the swing set in your yard
dreams beneath the fabric seats
the white picket fence she could see from her bed
dreamt we were newlyweds on a ferry in the rain
a girl of six in a lightless room with a list of things to tell the moon
those nights you can see right through the moon
we watched the war from my window
chalk outline of us in our last embrace
a shelf for your sorrows
another midnight at the door
the sunset at arm's length
in the back road daylight with blue chalk on your white dress
the sound of a thousand spoons against glass
asleep in the laundry basket at the foot of the stairs
dreamt I saw your sorrow in the shape of a gray church
hall closet filled with empty boxes
I have long been a garden gone to seed
the foreground filled with thinly painted clouds
she keeps her apology
old new year's resolutions on hotel stationery
standing in the driveway with flowers you picked from the side of the road
we can watch the night from my little window
what does my car say about me? i guess that my grandmother died recently
they demolished the woods where we all used to play and cut down the old tree that once held both our names
the sound your pupils make as they dilate
strange dreams of a stranger in a campaign hat
I think of all the people who died on the day you were born
dreamt you asked me to dance in mismatched shoes
scars from wounds you no longer recall
dreamt my fingertips were full of static
a hollowed out piano and a broken metronome
we spend the morning watching a spider crawl across the ceiling
left me spinning beneath the scarlet oak tree
when her rose colored laughter would fill up the room
dreamt we found a crawlspace on the moon
we walk the path where the river used to be
a photograph of your right palm
her self worth a pile of dirt dumped by the side of the road
pages that turn toward the light
our pockets filled with sea glass and sand
dreamt I slept in silhouette
followed the waves of a desert to a backward moon
the flour that dreams of the rolling pin
the moon is forgotten in a hospital room
in a dream I waited barefoot on a bright red fire escape
all the sidewalks home
pack the gaps in memory with coffee grounds and dirt
where a window looks into an empty room
dreamt I was twelve with sunset arms
all the faces you wear in my dreams
the kind of poem that follows you home
in a dress that dreams of dancing
green branches that reach past the sun
dreamt I kissed you on a swing set on the last day of july
dreamt I whispered your name and you appeared
here the streets are made of stone and the windows open outward
last night my own ghost followed me home
I see the accident as she describes it
I see the station and its neon signs
dreamt I played the trumpet in a military band
highlighting the bible in yellow and blue
a confidence kept and a confidence confessed
the foot that hovers over the pedal
she said she dreamt of vultures the night before we met
in the dream I carried a dead coyote down an abandoned street
a dark attic bedroom where she sensed the presence of death
asleep on a mattress by the side of the highway
endlessly stringing this necklace
she will suck out your marrow and make wind chimes from your bones
I remember when you told me you're only ever angry in dreams
the moon is made of scar tissue
dreamed we were shaking acorns from the neighbor's tree
in a dream you asked me if there are rivers in new jersey and I didn't know what to say
dreamt a golden swallow slept in my upturned palm
the first time you saw hermes without his clothes
overnight the red yarn winds itself back into a ball
the bar code on the back of everything
a lit cigarette in the glove box
a lampshade in silhouette
dreamed we were a pair of sparrows in the hollow of a tree
long streets beyond the classroom window
and there she was in heels and a high waisted pencil skirt and a black lace bra
dreamt of a missed call from the number we had when I was a kid
she's a thousand sheep when you are sleepless
awoken each day by the sound of an ocean
saw you in a dream again in that same dark velvet dress
dreamt you were as tall as the sunflowers and every raindrop that fell was a mirror
the back roads only we know
we have come to witness the demolition of the moon
the pigeons that fill the parking garage
a pewter medal pinned to her hospital gown
dreamt we watched the stars from an underground tower
a room for rent on a dead end street
dreamt we were driving someplace
all the exit signs on the highway were numbered but otherwise blank
at the road's end a stretch of darkened farmland
dreamt of an ancient necklace with a tangled chain
waiting out your sadness on the back step
the cat with three white paws would follow us home
she still carries around a pedestal just in case you decide to show up
she spoke of a man who held midnight in his hands
tonight the willows walk us home
did she show you the roses that grow by her window
when the vein has once been opened
an early portrait of the painter's wife
I follow behind a man with shoulders hunched like yours
a lightning bug trapped inside a parked car
you left and my heart lit a cigarette
I watch the old clock with the broken hour hand
I dreamt I saw your ghost by an armchair in the garden
lost in the wildflowers on the walk home
maybe this is the way the eucharist is made
there is an empty room with walls of gilded brick
she counts the leaves on the trees outside the bedroom window
on the corner where you used to sit a broken crucifix
her hands still remember what her heart forgot
a poem that reaches past your sorrow and finds a little joy
in a hundred years we meet again beneath the white skies of beijing
heart like a choir loft
dreamt of a single typewritten line that only I could see
dreamt I saw a blindfolded woman boarding an empty train
the poems that grow out back
some days all I see is the burnt umber of the underpainting
ivy that grows around the shape of your sorrow
I remember the way you'd exhale the first drag
silent and smiling and twirling a dandelion
the door to the left of the choir loft
wholesale communion wafers
broken plaster moon
I stand outside on the steps of your church
"I dreamt that what I thought were silver coins were actually little mirrors, hundreds of them in a tall glass jar"
but it was you who invited him in
jesus christ in gold-rimmed glasses
blackberries in the church basket
the sound of a rose as it opens
tonight you take the back roads with sadness as your passenger
I dream of stone in silhouette
he said he dreamt of seven marbles in a yellow velvet pouch
a poem in a disposable medicine cup
the muted blue of sorrow
like digging for water in a sandbox
the lined paper of your childhood
a poem rolling around in the glove box
I dreamt of your sister's blue dress
somewhere I will find your shoreline
the sound of a song submerged
the crisp air and the setting sun and everything done behind us
a lullaby in a mislabeled box
thought I saw your footprints in the wind
trying to find a way back into last night's dream
dreams of windows left open and rain getting in
so what if a little rain gets in
the world through an empty pill bottle
the darkness turned flame blue
nights the ashtray overflows
she's already written your obituary
I look into your eyes and see the surface of the moon
a poem to open folded hands
dreamt of a fog so thick that when you wrote in it your words would hang in the air
an empty stretcher in the street
as a child she would blindfold her dolls
she writes of cliffs and meadows she sees in dreams
the ever shifting topography in the playscape of sleep
a memory floating face down in the lake
a poem stuck to the bottom of your shoe
pages torn from my hands
the password you thought you would never forget
rows of empty benches on a double-ended ferry
what you say when you speak into the mirror
cigarette butts in the sand what won't a seagull eat
saw our initials carved on a desk
when he smiles you see he has the teeth of a lion
dreamt I saw my mind congealed on a plate
for now you are an abstract noun
I picture you at a picnic table writing poems on paper plates
listening for the voices that travel down the hillside
find me hiding in the hostas at dusk
dreamt I decided to kill myself only to find I was already dead
carve my likeness from a block of ice
she keeps his death mask under the bed
a name you whisper in a dream just before you wake
a row of homes with red geraniums in gray stone
thoughts of suicide are what have kept me alive
tear the brown paper from the back of the frame
saw your face at the bottom of a paper cup
I had a dream it snowed last night. snow had come in the open windows and covered the floor while I slept.
these are the ocean's secrets washed upon the shore
find me in a dream lost in a forest without any trees
the sky all golden and orange
someone else's clothes in your closet
she releases the butterflies one by one
"still thinking about last night's dream, about what it meant and what it might mean"
dreamt I was a drop of poison on your arrowhead
you wait by the painted daisies where sparrows gather in the dirt
but she would whisper to us about illness and love
the patsy cline of circus peanuts
and the pocket doors slide open on their own
words you repeat like you know what they mean
taking advice from a dying man
made a white flag of your wedding dress
words you repeat like you don't know what they mean
I dream of a landscape of layered sand and a wall of whitewashed brick
the things you only think when it’s three something and you can’t sleep
the bristles of the broom against the cottage floor
patterns of shadows that remind me of you
you're the patron saint of found money and I'm a dollar bill lifted by the breeze
a shade of purple only seen on the underside of certain leaves
I could hear her name in everything you didn't say
evening waits at the window
we share a cigarette out back
close enough to read the inscription on her crucifix
pouring poems into the public water supply
picture me in an elizabethan collar before you fall asleep
I dreamt of you in a dingy hospital room with a ballpoint pen by your bed
a reflection of the painting on the gallery floor
dreamt of a small darkness and a backwards moon
saw you peddling moonshine in my dream last night
she wears a name tag that says volunteer
I pass a vulture eating from the carcass of a deer
today you built me a bookcase and tomorrow I will paint
she is the butterfly that drinks from your birdbath
place the tweet at a distance and see a human skull
dreaming of a face you’ve never seen
a life looking down into a basement window
a poem that glows in the dark
we would draw with colored chalk on the walls of the garage
another stone in the harbor
watch as the water boils over
factitious disorder imposed on a dog
the lights of the ferris wheel as seen from the interstate
a flower with two petals I remember from a dream
maybe it fell into the space you left between two hyphens
I dreamt of winter and blue shadows on the snow
I can hear you cracking eggs against the countertop
we live on the same street in different cities
i dreamt i was standing barefoot in someone else's kitchen
today I moved the furniture only to move it back
the sky is gray from where you stand upon the graves of the condemned
you take her picture in front of the forsythia on the same day every year
the summer she turned twenty-one the month of june was twelve weeks long
he faces the window while he waits
i dreamt of a field in a frame and a parchment paper moon
in a garden full of grasshoppers
I opened a gift meant for someone else
maybe she writes to steady her hand
the same mourning dove that sings in a hundred suburbs
something you've heard all your life but never understood
in the darkness of the old man's room
sunset on the surface of the sightless moon
you will know her by the rattle of the pills in her purse
i dreamt i worked at the library of alexandria
dreamt i walked through the desert to find a nail in a jetty
the four-leaf clover inside her shoe
write to me from the taxi on your way out of town
at the edge of consciousness with an unlit cigarette
heart like a typewriter ribbon
always waiting for it to get bad enough
the ache of the window that was painted shut
a photograph of a painting of a statue of a woman
I heard the call of a seagull a hundred miles from the coast
spent the night inside in old cigar box dreaming of your hands
a poem unfolding in my hand
the night we watched the willows lift the moon
i dreamt of poems unfolding and notebooks full of sleep
I dreamt of sound absorbing walls that had to be bled like an old radiator
the ocean's secrets washed ashore
show me all your annotations
she comes back with hands full of catkins she's pulled from the branch
i dreamt of the light of a thin white candle
some secrets rise up and skim the surface of sleep
the girl who works at the department store downtown
barefoot children on their way to the sand
somewhere the sidewalks
I see your funeral in every church
dreamt I found you hiding in the bathtub with the shower curtain pulled over your body like a sheet at the morgue
I remember when you tried to take a picture of the sky
she leaves you lost and alone with moth-eaten bones
a pen that tears the darkness
the past in a paper bag
the words you wrote that morning
leaving chicago i see that i was never there
I will tell her in a dream
we stand before a house with two front doors
velvet frayed by his fingertips
the poet who tried to reshape the moon
the national anthem plays in an empty stadium
i would have been happy without any sidewalks
you dreamt of a moon that was not our own
i dreamt again of ireland and angels spun from sand
i dreamt i was a postage stamp
i dreamt an acorn fell asleep in my hand
girl with a gauze bandage
a little lemon tree in a bright blue pot
it was thomas the apostle with a carpenter's square
we dig till we reach water and color fills the moon
you left your poems in my winter coat
the window and the morning
an account of items left in the lost and found
i saw white smoke rising from my cold cupped hands
maybe he's still waiting at the curb
how strange that others should see me as looking basically the same every day
"under ""in case you missed it"" all seven tweets from @ghoulfinch🐦"
we see the city as it once was through an old wooden stereoscope
maybe it's the flag that whips the wind
butterflies on city streets
i have this fantasy that you're in love with me whatever that might mean
we drive an empty moving truck down an unlit highway
your mother in sunglasses and cream colored shoes
she leaves you at the gate with the sound of the rain
she takes the old pictures down from the fridge
woman on the train with an empty flower pot
familiar streets without names
we listen to the laughter of the daffodils
i think about the two of us waiting for a train
dreamt we saw the devil in a dressing room
the way water boils faster in her kitchen
we meet on a bench by whistler's mother on the first day of may
all your lies in a hollowed out bible
I'm not ready to stop wearing my coat
for those of us who learned to love by living with its absence
i dreamt i was following you through miles of bioluminescent blue
and in the evening a poem to walk you home
he taught you how to test the direction of the wind
an empty bottle rolling down the steps of city hall
a water main breaks in the church basement as they exchange their vows
a notebook wrapped in gauze
maybe the autumn's falling leaves are an apology
a cheap plastic rosary wrapped twice around her wrist
two painters with the same last name
in my dream you held the hand of a girl with a garnet ring
lost in the leaves along the sidewalk
a silence that predates recorded history
lost in the leaves along the curb
he packed his bags but never left
vacuuming memories from the old fabric seats
dump these lies down the drain
restrained with a paper chain
dreamt your front door was a mirror and your steps were made of sand
a woman writing at the kitchen sink
misery's infinite guest book
bring me the pages torn from memory
show me the way to your childhood home
the velvet glove in the lost and found
wearing slippers in the starting blocks
he leaves his love on the counter with his keys
men in orange suits descend from yellow trucks
your story sticks to the glass
the body suicidal
a wrinkled shirt to remember you by
another poem in the kitchen sink
some nights i light two cigarettes and my foot looks for the clutch
the sweet potato in a family of morning glories
seven messages that failed to send
i dreamt that god spoke in my mother's voice and told me i was fine
we wake beneath the weight of crocheted snowflakes
pacing through a darkened room where all the windows face the moon
send me to the mill for polishing
washing a dead woman's clothes
the way her dress whispers your name
self-portrait on cigarette paper
whispering secrets to the sidewalk
she brings you sunlight from last night's dream
I dreamt I knelt in the wet cement and whispered the words I wish I'd said
an orchid in the ash
the inbox of the subconscious
describe the dimensions of your prison cell
i am stiff fingers on an index card in a dress
the way the scissors shape the angles
my mother points out the house where they lived before i was born
dreamt i tried to iron your shirt with a rolling pin
dreamt you served me dinner on a snowflake
the scattering green of the river
two rooms on an overcast afternoon
the shivering begins with her fingertips
the groom stands at the altar with a bunch of balloons
an old paperback in the sand
bare feet on the jetty
in the kitchen with the daylight and the dishes
in the kitchen with the dishes and the daylight
seven empty rooms at the edge of the city
she's the one you saw in a dream gathering up the first sunbeams of spring
the yellowed edge of an apology
crushed pills and ash on silvered glass
you come to me with yellow roses in your arms
a young girl with a basket in the aisle
walking backward through a moving train
the memory that lights a cigarette and puts the kettle on
a pile of empty pill packs in the trash
the face she saw on the cover of a book
figures from the velvet frame
a thousand station wagons under a brittle paper sun
i walked in my sleep to an outstretched room
something cold and measured and dark
i heard the raccoons laughing in the shadows
a chalk drawn evening
the girl who sits across from me in love for the third time this week
dreamt i found a pair of glasses in the driveway and it turned out they were mine
an air mattress filled with your lies
"the volume was low as it started to play and what you thought was ""wish you were here"" was actually ""maggie may"""
here is the dress she wore for you
the way a tomato will ripen in the dark
laundry basket afternoon
gathering last night in a coffee can
she stands on the cliff and loosens his poems to the wind
she prays on a rosary made from the stars
i saw the moon impaled on a fence post
i saw a woman in a casket wearing a wedding dress
patches of snow that look like mold
all the places i waited for you and all the times you never came
a man loosens his necktie in the seat next to mine
we'd been calling it by the wrong name all along
i dreamt i owned my childhood home and sat on the couch where i'd been sick
one hand under the pillow and the other curled against her chest
your image imprisoned on a screen
i recognized it as our old house but the dining room was on the second floor and all the windows faced the south
it was lilac or violet or lavender
the face you hide behind your hands
i sleep with the light on the nights when you're away
tell me what kind of cigarettes you smoked when you were seventeen
the way you got in may be the same way you get out
a poem about another cup of coffee gone cold
each new love obliterates the last
i walk in my own footsteps on the way back
i will wash your hair in the kitchen sink and brush the sand from your sheets
the nightingale returns to the ruins of the opera house
for he had tried to write about despair
you called the morning glories rhododendrons but I loved you all the same
it was sweet and slow and pianissimo
a gold cargo tram on a circular track around the basement carpet
these roses are red and covered in glitter i dreamt you got rich writing poems on twitter
a moth caught in the mountain laurel outside the front door
she dreams there is a second moon that only she can see
her coat smells like the perfume your mother used to wear
the man who stands at the corner and plays the violin
spend the day rearranging the letters of your name
the girlishness of a silent film actress
the dreams i had that first night in your bed
dressed in amethyst and red on the anniversary of his death
the blinking yellow light outside the firehouse
i find a schoolbook covered with a brown paper bag with a little armadillo drawn on the back
i stay home and make felt from your old sweaters
leaned over the sink brushing my teeth I realize that it was you in my dream
at the end of the dock with her fingers crossed
he spent the rest of the afternoon wondering if attraction to perversion was itself a perversion and then he made himself some soup
she leaves the theater in tears before the screen is dark
a man with a stethoscope stands at the end of the bed
you stand by the side of the road with your easel and your brush
you tell me again what i already know
all the gowns are red at the dress shop down the street
a bride dreams that her seamstress walks her down the aisle
"up in the attic he tore away the brown paper and showed me walls of cotton candy, daring me to eat"
if you ask her why her pupils are always so large she'll tell you she lives in a perpetual dark
among the things that I have dreamed
you were standing at the kitchen sink but your eyes were miles away
unbuttoning her blouse as soon as church lets out
i wonder who twitter suggests when someone follows me
you were down on hollywood boulevard drinking rainwater from the footprints of the stars
i saw you standing in an abandoned park with a bunch of white balloons
we stood on the riverbank and watched the moon explode
the backyard is full of squirrels and you're crying on the porch
faces carved from carpathian walnut line the lower halls
something you left on the concrete steps when the skies began to shake
an unfinished puzzle on the dining room table
watching the words as they scroll across the screen
the broken yardstick behind the fridge
in your memory of that day i'm wearing the long burgundy coat i got rid of three years before we met
dreamt i attempted to fill a prescription at a small museum gift shop
the red bench in the rain
we meet there in a dream
they tell you to eat but you look down to find that the flatware is tied to the tablecloth with a thin fishing line
they used old bath towels at the beach and a white bucket like the one mom kept under the kitchen sink
i have never seen the sponges but i often see the shells that wash up on the beach looking like ceiling tiles
i return to our house in dreams to find the flag at half mast
he stops at the hospital those nights he feels alone and holds the newborn babies too tiny to go home
"a small animal struggles by the dumpster, its head stuck in a plastic salad dressing jug"
when asked for evidence of completion of her goals she turned her job description  into a blackout poem
tonight I am dangling from the fire escape
there is a spider that weaves a golden web
and from somewhere the sound of a phone off the hook
they sold chocolate molds in the shape of your face
what you thought was a closet is a corridor
a secret shared between reader and narrator
here is the flower he buried in the snow
flowers painted on a garbage can
in the space where one sentence ends and another begins
i heard your voice but didn't see your face
the bar water moon broken ocean white
a question dropped into the river
a childhood illness that left him anxious and unable to cry
in the reference section where the shelves are not so tall
we build a birdhouse from the old picket fence
dreamt i slept in a hexagonal room with honey-colored walls
you pass a costumed character on the stairs and another down the hall
you offer me an empty canister of bread crumbs
they've painted the front door a color she calls raspberry
a glass ladybug and a girl scout pin and a stack of coins from ireland
this is the muzzle on the mouth of the dog
i dream of stolid faces in a smoke filled room
we meet by the door below the stairs that opens to a wall
some days i wake up breathing smoke
a hard hat falls from a scaffold and lands at your feet
a whisper from the bottom of the basement stairs
but then you touch her skin
lost in a department store where all the walls are mirrors
the way light can make a space feel small
your sister says she is an only child
things that other people aren't allowed to touch
the human skull in three parts
your name engraved on a spoon
a dozen young bridesmaids in soft gray chiffon
you play the saxophone in my mother's living room
painted window frames where stained glass angels hang from chains
dull smudge of a moon
you brush the sugar from your apron and untie the strings
the black tattoo that fades to green and blue
the woman in the apron smiles at me and i see she has your teeth
this time i find myself in the back of a group of classmates gathered around a butter churn
i dream again of that first-grade field trip
they say she's a different person when she's with you but maybe she's herself
how i came to be sitting in a rental car down the street from our old apartment
we sat in the back of your mother's station wagon
our bare feet were covered with sand
his heart's not in it they said when they opened up his chest
someone sneezes three times from the back of the room
a black and white photograph with her name written on the back
I dream of a ballerina on a diving board
she sleeps with the bedroom door closed even though she lives alone
the eyes of the viewer are drawn to her hands
her hair was wet and she smelled like smoke and that was how he knew
like the dog that eats the tinsel from the tree
that was before you knew how to stand up for yourself or even that you could
the indoor courtyard of an old hotel
a scrap of red velvet or the bell from the cat's neck
how long she stood in the parking lot after he'd pulled away
you crawl out from a cabinet below the kitchen sink
the tape stuck in your VCR
she stands under the branches where the rain doesn't fall
maybe the dead communicate with us through anonymous twitter accounts
an obituary written on a prescription pad
how many unforced errors before he puts the racket down
you dive into the indigo depths while I stay on board and holystone the deck
I knelt upon the velvet and heard the sound of bells
how silly it would sound to somebody else
a list of items that will later fill a cart
the roads become rivers and the sidewalks turn to sand
the roads will become rivers and the sidewalks turn to streams
the only likeness that exists is a courtroom artist's sketch
dreamt I was a juror at the murder trial of a man who had your name
the raindrops thunder in the gutter
the girl you kissed behind the grange when you were seventeen
you forget sometimes how much shouting there was
the rain pulls the leaves from the trees
i dream of a nursery inside of a dollhouse with stenciled elephants on the walls
she's got a sister in oklahoma who swears she's never coming back
the whole town watched as he built his house but no one offered to help
eyes closed listening to your yellow walkman the whole way home
we set the table in silence and I watched her hair turn gray
sometimes i find myself back on that bus
she'll never see the northern lights or hold her newborn child
a childless woman dreams of a christening gown made from her own wedding dress
I dream I am leading a silent tour through the dim servants’ quarters of an old chateau
"in the updated version of the game Operation, children use the tweezers to remove a cell phone from the patient's hand"
all your lies in a salon style exhibition
there's another picture hidden behind the one you see in the frame
I dream I am a farmer after the harvest setting my fields on fire
the woman who hides her prescription pills before her children arrive
she counts every pothole from the passenger seat
the thud of the newspaper just after dawn
the first light of the sun on the horizon
a notification for every time someone hovers over the heart but doesn't click
i sit in the back by the pharmacy and read a magazine
the only time she'd heard her mother sing
like seeing your own neighborhood from the back of a police car
they're drinking mind erasers on the texas deck
the driveway is empty but we park on the street
we leave our coats in a small bedroom on the first floor
the poem that poses a question
but no one saw the photograph she carried in her purse from the hospital to the halfway house to the basement of the church
a little girl stands in an abandoned theme park beside an empty red wagon
nights when the moon seems no larger than a marble
from this distance your window is the size of a postage stamp
she offers you a strawberry the size of a peach
dreamt you said I had the eyes of the mother of a disabled child
a vivid image of him as a much older man
she got him a plant to attract butterflies but he brought it home and just left it inside
another poem of fallen leaves
tonight
we pass on a platform above a vast stage and you ask me if someone is calling my name
minutes into dinner you rested your fork on your plate
one gray gull on a red tile roof
meet me at the little bookstore on the other side of town
she says he's fine for weeks on end and then he's back talking to the police scanner again
exotic birds in native trees
through curtain and glass a hundred gray gulls ascend with her final breath
the name you whispered in a dream just before you woke
you return to the room where you were born in the hospital downtown
following behind an old volvo sedan with a rusted out bumper and both tail lights smashed in
i dream i'm riding an old ten-speed down unfamiliar streets
the year we watched the parade from our hotel window
we say hello to every snowflake
"the woman with endless patience for every stranger or acquaintance, at home she has practically none to offer her husband or daughter or son"
this stop-motion sadness
where she puts the accent when she's angry
she called him exhausting and went back to bed
the pregnant woman falls asleep just minutes before noon and dreams she's doing somersaults inside her mother's womb
changing the bulb in the night light again
"standing beneath the branches of the scarlet oak tree a young girl points to every acorn and says that's me, that's me, that's me"
swings that hang from rusted chains
an old sauce jar filled with wildflowers
a tiffany lamp on a one-cent stamp
dreamt i was the only guest at your wedding
the bud that turns brown before it can blossom
the edges of the petals will turn yellow as they wilt
you follow her for miles through narrow streets without sidewalks
she will sleep but fitfully
a box of old ballet costumes and a flattened witch's hat
pull-down attic stairs in the second-floor hall
she offers herself to you one dark november afternoon in a cold bedroom above the garage
you stood by a lego replica of my childhood house and quoted freud in my mother's voice
the story begins in the drop-off lane of an unspecified airport
this is where the green goes when the leaves turn red
all she knew of poetry was a wheelbarrow and oyster-shells and little cat feet
recumbent headstones crumbling into dust
like plastic flags in artificial grass
dreamt i was a crossing guard in a reflective vest across the street from your old school
blue butterflies with mirrored wings hover over her bed while she sleeps
this is the cathedral before the fire
the man at the counter scratches a lottery ticket with a gray guitar pick
collected stones and seaweed
a tank of vivid tropical fish where the television used to be
"i was in the lobby and the doors were locked but i heard them announce your name, i heard the applause"
the way your voice changes every time you say her name
somewhere between the driveway and the door
i dream i'm walking past as they cover your body with a thick white cloth and your hands and feet with paper bags
there is an empty bench beside the path but you don't stop
memories of youth nectar-heavy butterflies patent leather shoes
shall i compare thee to the blue-green corrosion around the battery
i was at the grocery store watching all the lobsters when you called
another night in misery's guest room
on the piano there stands an oval frame that holds a black and white photograph of a man with dark eyes and his hand tucked inside his coat
I have not forgotten which cigarettes you smoked back then or the color of your winter coat
this is what she said: [guitar solo]
the knock she thought she heard in a dream was the thud thud thud of a frenzied bee trapped between the window and the screen
you dream again of an empty room
sometimes someone you follow will tweet about the very thing you dreamt of the night before
here is the light you mistook for the moon
he told me green is the hardest color to control
all her fragile carnival glass still packed in bubble wrap
the same intersection in every city
you called me from the desert to tell me something you couldn't say
you are brought to a windowless room
the night we sat in a circle on her old plank floor and one by one recited the poems she’d written in the room above
later we walked through the gravesite and stood by her meager stone
i saw you slip something between a gap in the floorboards
we pass the girl with mahogany hair and a rosary made from seeds
a deer jumps over a chain-link fence
lifestyles of the chronically suicidal
medicine cabinets of the terminally ill
i dreamt once that i gave birth to a little hammerhead shark
scattered showers on an otherwise sunny day
still sitting at the bottom of the laundry basket after all this time
that was the year the christmas tree was covered with bright red mites and the two of us went down to the garage and got high on insecticide
the differences between the two eventually do become clear
as an acorn falls into the shadow of a squirrel
the tree they condemned they take it down in segments limb by limb by limb
later in a hospital elevator i realize i'm wearing his jeans
a french press or a clarinet
i am still lost in the department store they turned into a school
you pause to consider a future in which the two of us don't cross paths
i dream we're gathering fruit from the chinaberry tree that stood beside the barn
bare feet on painted concrete
the letters on the eye chart spell out your name
when you wrote me letters from a yellow legal pad
i found you downstairs folding my old letters into handheld fans
*powders face with sunshine*
i am six years old and my sister convinces me that she came from a toy terrarium from the bottom of a cereal box and i am sad that i did not
"you told me madame blavatsky was your spirit animal and, as if to explain, pushed back your sleeve to show me a tattoo of a fingerprint"
that photograph of you in sunglasses on an overcast afternoon
the second-hand dress i wore to your funeral and never wore again
a man who has never seen you calls you beautiful
i remember a piano in a house that had none
heard a girl ask a seagull if he's noticed how the packs of saltines they give you in restaurants are much better than the ones from the box
i spell your name out with elmer's glue and sprinkle it with glitter
you take off your coat and i shiver
you take off your glasses and my vision blurs
scarlet tanager on a gold-rimmed glass pitcher
we washed the dishes and she asked me what month violets bloom in
in the darkened corners of the photograph
he left the door open but she never came by
the hearse at the curb with its engine idling and its headlights still on
the words you overheard in a dream
a book you keep on top of the fridge
she sits at the edge of the tub and watches you brush your teeth
she keeps her anger in a coffee can under the kitchen sink
shame waits at the corner to walk you home
a game of war with a deck of blank white cards
on her third consecutive adverb
on winter mornings her bare feet still remember each warm grain of sand
the wooden playscape where we carved our names underneath the bridge
the two of us waiting at the intersection listening to the same song
an ache made sweet
the praying mantis preserved for years in amber she held in a dream
a poem in which the writer compares the sacrament of marriage to a game of pin the tail on the donkey
you showed me pictures from your honeymoon
"""you'll have a four-year-old in like four years"" and other words of wisdom for new parents"
dreamt i knelt on the bathroom floor and gathered coins from the toilet bowl
a tiny kaleidoscope held up to the sun
the winds may steady
a memory turned dull and green
a blindfolded bride stumbling sightless down the aisle dizzy from spinning
*goes to live with the family of raccoons in the garage*
he falls asleep remembering last night's dream
an exhibit of all the pictures you've taken in dreams
a red gemstone without a name
the serial killer behind the screen door
her fever peaks in the early evening
chased silver hand mirror face down on the shelf
i send her away but she returns
a young girl stands on the front step with a basket full of colored eggs
a surgical mask hangs from the doorknob
her own face blurry or obscured in every dream
you wait beneath the sycamore with daisies in your hands
I dreamt we were fledgling hummingbirds
tonight a stranger will dream of your face
i saw a scarecrow in a beach chair and you in a straw hat
hot midday sun and the highway's soft hum
we were children again and we were barefoot
i dreamt we were having a water balloon fight in the overgrown parking lot behind the old self-storage place
again
how long since he held a baseball or squinted into the sun
already today the acorns
august yawns and turns away
the gray cat that waits by the elevator door
we take the freight elevator to the fourth floor
the first time you heard laughter from behind those closed doors
i will keep you in my carry-on
either side of an oval that holds a woman's face
in a dream I saw the gloved fingertips of the state medical examiner
like letters on the bulletin board
when your reflection looks you in the eye
treading water as they drain the pool
in the glittering green glass of a shattered windscreen
we hum like fireflies in a perpetual twilight
dreamt i was cutting through the mesh cover on the hotel pool with a pair of children's plastic scissors
the sound of the rain out in the street
monday morning smell of the hair dryer
braided ribbon barrettes in her sun-bleached hair
he sings harmonies from the top riser on the stage in her mind
i imagine the sound of a trumpet in a vast and sunlit cemetery
the thud of his midlife crisis
she’s all balls of cotton and thin strips of foil on saturday morning in a chair facing the wall
i dreamt of a hundred unlit candles in small glass jars
her heart shaped like a butterfly
words carved in hardwood
keep her tucked inside your pillowcase
summer swim lesson a boy is a butterfly for one splendid lap
you blow me a kiss from the old railroad bridge
in the dream i find a second bedroom door i know nothing about
like ships on the mississippi
the beach weeks of august
daylight taking shape in the darkness of the nave
some combination of bibliomancy and impromptu blackout poetry
saw a dog named after a desert dressed in a wool sweater
we wrote our secrets on a stretched out rubber band
your opinion on thin cardboard
the house dreams of its own construction
meaningless the monogamy of a bird that cannot fly
the cat returns smelling faintly of perfume
those who look both ways before they cross a one-way street
we keep the seesaw balanced through the afternoon
i wrote your name on every school bus window
paint her in a fuschia skirt and snakes under her feet
the mosquito in the elevator
you call me past midnight to ask what it means that poem about lovers and corniced eaves
you stand under my window with your shoebox guitar
a stack of telephone books in the lobby from 1992
i dream i'm stringing old wooden rackets at the sporting goods store
and rest with me under a canopy of pale pink blossoms and plum purple leaves
the penny lands heads up at the bottom of the well
copper on turquoise old wishes scatter and sink in the fountain pool
patches of light in the shadows of the leaves like holes in a tattered window screen
find her among the punched-out holes and cut-off corners
stained glass daffodils that catch the sun
laughter in a padded cell
adjust the brightness until all but her eyes disappear
i see yellow bricks beneath our feet
she dreams of events that change the skyline
we paint the walls in xanax blue
to return to the scheme of the rhyme
you and me and our substance-free intimacy
in the backyard i find a manhole cover painted with the profile of a woman's face; it's heavy and i wake before i can see what's underneath
sinking as the surface turns to ice
plans made on the back of a paper placemat
the pencil sharpener jammed with a cotton candy crayon
she forgets the space between every and day
a red circle around every past tense verb
the hour hand grows too heavy and falls back to six
just the light of the vacancy sign in his eyes
we kiss under a construction paper sun
they say this lake it holds the ocean
the culverts burst and overflow
a split second of blindness as we enter the tunnel
the perfect cursive she learned from the nuns
the song that was playing that night in your car
yellow roses in the alcove to welcome her home
the hymn of the red geranium
lost in the middle of a metaphor
the post mortem on the walk home
i dream we're rolling down the hill behind the old elementary school
a thousand starfish washed ashore
that place where we first kissed the ivied courtyard the moonlit brick
all along the sidewalks the shadows of trees
the waves like the woman each year closer to the door
take me back to that clapboard cottage underneath the moon
how many fingers curled into fists
olive green goodbyes
to listen to an empty room
morning plays a tune on the half-empty champagne flutes
i learn the smell of geraniums from her fingertips
in the dream we wake naked on a dried up riverbed
the train and the taxi and then three flights of stairs
so ordinary a landscape
here is the house reflected in the river
a blood stained sundress she'll never wear again
indigo evening gown filled with the wind
she dreams of the strength to speak
wrap me in the plastic from your cigarette pack
she'll show you a crackling fireplace beneath an open window
the last of the inventory sits on the bottom shelf
i think i've told you about his pale face
some birds i've only heard from a distance
her voice loud and careless
she'll leave her pack of cigarettes in the passenger seat
you were trapped inside a walk-in freezer
a cigarette shared among the groomsmen
blood shed in black and white
called you by the wrong name in a dream
clouds the color of nicotine stains
back when we were two strangers on the front step
just some sunflowers in a tin can and a checkered tablecloth
in your arms i felt the deep relief of the guilty man's first sleep
a dream of light upon faceted glass and lampshades carved from antique brass
a bar code on every heart
whisper our sins to the brisk evening wind
high tide arrives and leaves me stranded on the other side
a conversation with a refrigerator magnet
the long walk to the nearby anything
words misheard through the walls
build me a church in your ashtray leave your love on the lowest step
the waves of a deserted beach
the youngest son of my subconscious
i exist from my window
i pretend to remember love
a laugh like fresh cracked pepper
an empty bottle of a woman
the mirrored surface of pride
words written in the back of a taxi cab
no more reaching out to do
not the closet at the end of the hall nor the mirror at the foot of the stairs
five years stuffed inside an old cigar box
in my dream we went to find a nail polish called pink chanel suicide
the feel of your frayed sleeve soft against my cheek
dark eyes and darkened eyelids
the work of some strange light
in love with another apology
soon everything begins to seem like an attempt of the conscious mind to jar me from a dream
still shivering beneath that open window
turning his poems to whispers
the first to remember the sun
when all that's left is summer's thin silhouette
she's the light that matters
the two of us before the war in the center of piccadilly circus
the dream where i find you face down on the driveway
your coat left on the fence post
pipes bursting within her walls
she never comes back to ask him
another match from the stack
the soldier in the hotel lobby
i suppose that a life existed in the sand
perhaps this could have been happiness
the old bar by the airport with the dirt parking lot
burgundy thoughts embossed with gold
gloved hands ready his mouth for the medicine
in the garden work was possible
two rooms on the harbor
i was still myself in the absence of sleep
our dreams are the silk of the milkweed seed
a million flowers before morning
she looked most like a boy in her floral dress
tucked behind a mirror in her childhood home
all memories merge in a cloud of dust
she lifts the brittle paper from a mislabeled box
she will not see chicago or flint
the small half bath down memory lane
a dangling wire in a dream
measure our love in millimeters of mercury
the visibility of the things outside his cage
your own blindness inches closer to you
violence comes in the bluest eyes
a small opal that falls just below her collarbones
a moment on loan from the darkness
somewhere beneath the blackberries that grow out back
she sits in the shape of a circle
sent him pages from an old paperback
the line that begins beside her fingertip
some pink about the eyes
to touch his hands with her body
when she had the devil in restraints
still on their way to that lit cigarette
