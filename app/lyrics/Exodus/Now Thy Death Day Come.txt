Bloodied, cleaved, and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Man's bloody inclination
God's final abdication
Angels weep on bended knee
So begins the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man

Thine will be done
Now thy death day come

Nevermore the sound of laughter
Misery forever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the malediction
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for man's lament

Thine will be done
Now thy death day come

[Instrumental Break]
On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
I'm the one you so revere

[Instrumental Break]

The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well-rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to apologise
Can you feel the irony?
War for all eternity

Thine will be done
Now thy death day come
Thine will be done
Now thy death day... comeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
