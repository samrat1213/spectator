Creeping in the shadows
Shadows of the night
Wading through the darkness
A death before the light
Blending in with faces
Faces of the night
Safe at home in comfort
At home is where you'll die

Watching you
Knowing your every move
Hearing you
Every single word that you spew
Carving you
Is what I'm about to do
Saving you
From the torment of this earth to be buried for rebirth

Silently I enter through the broken basement window now to wait
It's twelve o'clock the time has come ascend the staircase to the hunted one
Make way to the second floor right outside your open bedroom door
One last time to sleep in peace unaware of brutal things that

Will be done
To you after you awake
Enter slow
Machete leads the way
Eerie calm
Death is in the air
Savage thrust
Death is everywhere

Adrenaline is pumping as my heart is pounding faster yours slows down
Choke on blood and breathe your last breath mangled
guts I wear to celebrate
Stay inside and fuck the corpse an innards orgy satisfies my needs
Finally I feel complete by eating brains and flesh

Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed

<i>[Solo: O'Brien]</i>

Take what's left in garbage bags and throw them in a hole I dug out back
Clean the room I killed you in making sure the clues of sin are gone
Revel in my vicious deed and replay what had happened in my head
Vivid memories of you remain of your remains

Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed

Followed home then killed
