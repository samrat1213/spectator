Radikult LyricsThe lines have long been drawn
Between the life and death
The right and wrong
But what's the reason
What's our reason?
The walls are high we know
They've gotta come down
'Cause we've been crossing the line since 1989
We're moving the world
Because our power is a shining
Sick groove with fucking magic to prove that
The radicals are here to stay!
We're living hardcore and radical
We'll always be maniacal and animal
They fear us cause we're physical irrational
Our radi-killer kult is thriving!
Setting fire to everything we see
Fill the rage inside the music, what will be
Given reason, then taken away
Because the boundaries are coming down
'Cause though we live
And breathe we're like nasty machines
Taking out targets and we do it with ease
We've been called
We scream back never the same
And we tear it up as radicals!
We're banging hardcore radical
Maniacal and animal
Beast stomping with an appetite insatiable
We are the radikult
We're living hardcore and radical
We'll always be maniacal and animal
They fear us cause we're physical irrational
Our radikult is thriving!
Bang it hardcore and radical
Maniacal and like an animal
Beasts stomping with an appetite insatiable
We are the radikult
Our beats down
One step close to the fiery end
Just take another dose of our insane world
It all gets better
Feel next to nothing till we drop it again
We're radical, radikult
Never made to order unpredictable
Demoniacal and so fanatical
Are the zealots and the martyrs of the radikultEmbed
