Unholy Blasphemies Lyrics
Rise through the gate, Iak Sakkath
From depths beyond the sky
The realm of evil gods
Painful... they eat your mind

Evil in disguise
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy Jehovah's church
Vomit upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

Evil in disguise
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy Jehovah's church
Vomit upon the cross
And burn the book of lies
Evil in disguise
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

Yog Sothoth evil one
Come forth and taste the blood
Infant entrails
Are hung upon the twisted cross

Evil in disguise
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remainEmbed
