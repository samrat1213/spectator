Inducing fear

Into prosaic minds that do now believe in me
Spewing forth acidic fluids
Gruesome blisters rupture
Beneath the epidermis lies, Labyrinths of organs ripping apart

Returned to the proper home
As their corpses putrefy
Crumbling human forms
We extract, and feast upon their bowels

Inducing fear

Into prosaic minds that do now believe in me
Spewing forth acidic fluids
Gruesome blisters rupture
Beneath the epidermis lies, Labyrinths of organs ripping apart

Returned to the proper home
As their corpses putrefy
Crumbling human forms
We extract, and feast upon their bowels

We extract, and feast upon their fucking bowels
Repulsed by the stench of ignorance
We will stain your planet bright red
Fuck your world, home of vermin

Thrive on uncertainty of your existence
No soul will escape our grasp
Appendages removed, we look and smile
You are so easily deconstructed

Thrive on uncertainty of your existence
No soul will escape our grasp
Abandon all your fucking hope
For there is no one, watching over you
