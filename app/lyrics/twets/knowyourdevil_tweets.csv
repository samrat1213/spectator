‘nothing in space and time exists without your perceptions’   ~Donald Hoffman
you are the ultimate reality that 'all there is' spinning yourself out of control inside your head
we could discuss the mechanics of carnal acts or we could just immerse ourselves in them
woke up obliterated
"it’s all in your head the universe, everything"
Less romantic more voracious
The dust it is
The Devil never sends unsolicited dick pics.
Be hungry not thirsty
Missionary but with teeth on your neck a hand on your throat and non stop pounding until you’re a struggling pathetic wet trembling needy mess underneath my hunger.
"They wanted you strictly missionary but the Devil came along with cunnilingus, orgies, and butt play and god responded by destroying a city and turning someone’s wife into a pillar of salt just because she looked back. If that’s not sexual repression I don’t know what is."
The Devil created that thing you like.
Let’s be a sticky heaving mess together.
I’m not the devil I’m a mirror.
Most souls have been neutered by toxic culture.
Sins of the heart leading to sins of the flesh is explosive and life changing.
Evil wins sometimes. Balance is sometimes on a macro scale.
I leave judgement to god. I accept you for where you are in your struggle to be divine. Some of you are way behind.
To be known and understood. That’s the pinnacle of intimacy.
If our minds are the only thing that ever touched this life would be fulfilled.
"Just know I love all of you. Your mind. Our conversations. We think so much alike in many ways. Most ways. It’s rare. Most people just stare at me like I’m an alien. You, however, understand."
transcendental masturbation
My content will remain free. I may be diabolical but I’m no sellout.
"Much of me is something you’ve made up in your mind. Much more of me is something I’ve made up in my own from a collection of dreams, memories, and experiences."
‘Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.’ ~ George Orwell  ‘Who controls the media controls the present.’ ~ Me
Not everything has to have a fucking price tag.
I know a civil war when I see one
What part of twitter am I in?
years like grains of sand falling to the ground wishing they were stars
sad we us
Devil is just your word for me.
‘find your bliss’
Life changes in a flash leaving you stranded with abandoned dreams.
There’s nothing to fear.
In the grand scheme of things there are no dead people. There are only people whose life cycle existed in the past but they are still there because like you and me they are infinite.
there always seems to be a circumstance that must be overcome
the lies we tell ourselves are the most beautiful ones of all
the tragedy of misaligned timelines
"we’ll endure, but there will be death and lost love as the clock edges closer to midnight"
"I only love strong women, ones who would stab someone to protect the ones they love."
"I like that the rumors are out there, frightening the timid."
what we suppress kills us
the beatific and the grotesque
I want your filth on my hands
All the world’s problems come from one source. Overpopulation.
Humanity. Brutes hellbent on procreating. Poetry makes it seem more beautiful.
Concessions to circumstance.
I’ve got blood on my hands like all of us do.
Some never leave.
Some break the rules and become a part of your very soul. The very air you breathe. Let them go when the time comes.
"You’ll find love, lose it, and find it again and again. It’s the love you carry within yourself that you must protect at all costs. Everything else is temporary madness."
You’re a spiritual being. Nothing external can define you without your permission.
"n an age of uncertainty people need their reality packaged neatly in a tiny box. Governments, media, religions, and corporations are here to help with that."
It’s been four years and a flash since I washed up on the shore and changed who I wanted to be for the world.
who you are when nobody is looking is who you really are
we live other lives in our dreams that are reflections of this one
"It’s okay to be human. Imperfect, finite, and lost."
I’ve been sad my entire life. I think most intelligent people are. It’s easy to be happy when you’re a goddamned idiot or a liar pretending your life is better than everybody else’s.
"There’s not much left for me here but regret, loneliness, and the echoes of distant memory bouncing around inside my skull painting something beautiful wherever they land."
"‘It feels good to feel bad. There’s a relief I can’t name, like something I can’t talk about finally being said.’  ~Mikel Jollett, Hollywood Park (regarding the lyrics of The Cure’s Robert Smith)"
"All beautiful souls have endured some terrible tragedy and have struggled with great loneliness, yet there they are, shining brilliantly against the darkness."
Like a dream wandering in endless daylight
"‘To be a drunk is to be a hero in a sad story.’ ~Mikel Jollett, Hollywood Park"
there are no happily ever afters but there are bearable ones with moments of ecstasy if you’re lucky
all that light leaking onto the grey
the owners need you distracted and thinking alike for there is no room for non-conformity in their world order
nothingness implies substance darkness implies light sadness implies happiness  disappointment implies delight  death implies life  black implies white
"half eaten flesh on the table, an empty glass, a shotgun, a handful of memories and you"
all things devil
"It’s not a tweet storm, it’s a maelstrom from hell"
"cry for the lives you’ve lived, the loves you’ve lost"
Christmas lights until we fade away
I’ve been to war. I know what love is supposed to feel like.
"It’s all beautiful. Love, loss, life before the demons arrived. The smile of lost loves and the moment we felt magic floating in the air for the very first time."
The worlds we’ve forgotten. The ones we’ve drowned.
I’m a poet. I’m death.
I’m already nostalgic for you
read me by midnight  know be by dawn
morning coffee by the bed
you remind me of war
I just want to know you exist
"god, you"
validating your follow
that way I tremble and shake and try to tame a spinning room
that way oceans drown sunsets
we love what we lost
larger than life
I remember melting into the void for you. I never dream of voids. I dream of sunrises and possibilities.
I want a quiet place with you with a mint julep porch and melancholy sunsets.
you bring out the freak in me
we’re all the dead trying to make the myths
I bled across Europe and the Americas and now I’m drowning in a hole.
I’m never gonna wake up again
some get it some are slaves for the man
some people are art until death
smoke and regret
What’s best in life is where the crowd isn’t.
"sad, lonely old rockers playing on the curb channeling the best of us"
take some heaven take some hell
suicidal social justice
reassess your villains
"blood, botulism, and death"
we die in the image we love
gnawing bones  grinding teeth
we all die in our own way
my ghost eyes your banshee everything
I hate you as a midnight somniloquy. I love you as a knife.
"I don’t want to trigger you with my words, I want to inspire you with them."
I’m never quiet. Maybe my waking world is but my mind is loud as bombs and the shrapnel falls here.
can you even imagine how boring it would be to be emotionally involved with a saint?
everyone you fall for is a devil in one way or another
fingering the spine of a book I want to absorb
mad about you and everything you’ve ever touched
"find someone you can trust among all others and make a life together, it’s that simple"
You were never born broken. Fear those who profit by making you believe that.
rot with me  in the garden
the worms of memory
I drink my pills
"my words are about you, everyone, and all the projections that come with you"
"death weaves its way among us, slaying the unbelievers, the stupid, and innocent alike"
I’m sorry you thought this was about gardens. It was about corruption. Not sorry.
she’s sinfully perfect
when your heart pounds it’s way up your throat into the base of your skull and the world spins itself away from everything you’ve ever known I’ll be there holding your hand giving you the drugs you need to come down
a devil for all seasons
scream into the void and see if it screams back
the trap of this mortal coil
our dysfunctional bloodlust romance
trace the violence in your lips
love pain death
"I love your fatalism. I absorb it. I worship it. Like some ancient god crucified on a rotting throne, decaying, forgotten."
she’s dark like me
I would let her drive hell for a little while
she’s just a goddess who fell to earth
let’s gut each other in orgiastic ecstasy
"my megalomania got me this far and there are many roads ahead, so much more to conquer"
we would just ruin each other
extra dimensional destroyer of worlds
I’ve already lost my mind. Might as well write about it.
they hate me because I have a better message
the malls bring out the lonely in people for nobody is as ever alone as they are walking in solitude among the shopping crowd
"most people are beaten down, you can see it in the eyes or the fake shit they post on Facebook or Instagram"
Never conform
Just be. You don’t owe anyone anything but yourself.
"I’ve been silent, giving you bullshit and obfuscation. I’ve been healing. Physical wounds are nothing. The taste of death is nothing. The only thing that matters is how much of of life you’re willing to live and how much you allow them to take from you."
Live your life so that death either trembles to take you or scoops you up as an afterthought. There are no half measures worth living.
I’m lying. There is no pain. Just indifference and a few stories to tell.
Judgement is usually projection.
Holding on to grim misery even if it’s only a shadow.
"I give you soul. I give you wisdom. I give you music, light, and laughter. You can’t save me and I don’t want to save you. I prefer to drown together, whiling away lazy afternoons in bed as the world passes by our window."
"You must prove from whence your authority is derived before you try and exert power over anyone. If it stems from the will of the governed that’s one thing, a magical book is quite another. We all know power rules this earth and the owners go though great lengths to protect it."
"I always break the rules. I always did, I always will. The rules weren’t made for people like us."
It will never be any different.
You’ll miss this moment too.
none of us here got out alive  you can see it in the eyes
self inflicted
I love how you wait for me to correct my typos
fuck you don’t even know what depths I’ve fathomed in your very presence
"this is it, this struggle, this life  beautiful in its darkness its sunrises  love and heartbreak joy and grief  the moments of triumph  and defeats we don’t need heaven or hell we have each other"
doch tausend sonnen brennen nur für dich🎵
we start believing our own myths just before falling back to earth
I’ve resurrected myself many times
a small respite from the emotional wasteland of what our culture has become
nothing means anything here
nostalgia finds the extraordinary within the ordinary moments
"you need the devil you see, for he has kept you honest all these millennia when you wanted to hide your crimes behind a holy facade"
the dark heart on the periphery of all your dreams laughing
I never dream of angels I only dream about the dead among the living
the poets have failed us  the artists have failed us  they are so many critical voices that have gone unheeded  unheard  uncared for
we wish there was oblivion but there will always be work to do in some form or another
nothingness is dependent upon existence for its survival
"strong people can make fun of themselves and take constructive criticism from others, weak people can only manage a facade of strength"
I write about many things real and imagined. I enjoy getting weird and insane and pushing boundaries but all my best thoughts are for her. She is the inspiration for everything beautiful in these lines.
I’m only the devil when I’m drunk. Otherwise you know me as god.
I love you all for you are me
If you’ve never gotten down to eye level with a blade of grass or contemplated bees and wondered at the process that brought these things into being then I don’t want to know you.
Your life sucks because you never stood for anything. It’s not too late.
The real devil is the corporation.
Most never contemplate anything. They eventually become chattel used to maximize the corporate bottom line. I’m trying to free you.
I’m already dead. I’ll bring you down with me.
"I’ve done a lot of trembling, I’ve eaten a lot of fear, I’ve seen a lot of shit that I want to channel inside you."
Futant
Some humans are way more evolved than others. Those are the ones I’m speaking to.
*from a species who’s half a chromosome away from being a chimpanzee
The followers I lose are exactly the followers you’d expect I’d lose.
I want to sink my teeth into your hot taught ass and get tangled in your lace. A love poem.
"I’ll undo you. I’ll unzip you out of your skin with electric fingertips and hungrily consume your light. I’ll leave you chained in the dark, writhing."
Love my dichotomy
"Don’t worry love, your god will forgive you by morning for the things we do. I’m damned forever."
Satanic erotica
I have much to say but much if it concerns your body and the filthy things we will do together.
Take a bite love. Feel the warm juice run down your chin as you greedily devour the fruit from my hand. Let’s talk about the garden.
it’s the fear that’s addicting  the rest everybody can do
I’m not for most
wear me like war paint  one more time
defile yourself with sins of the flesh and find strength from your destruction
There should be more fucking in the world than violence yet so called faith leaders love the latter more than the former.
"fucking is a sacred act animalistic, ritualistic, raw it’s both an act of creation  and destruction"
a forked tongue  think about that
"find your own way to the divine, never rely on intermediaries who want to control you"
music compatibility is a must
I will never perpetuate your delusions. I’ll drown them along with whatever ones I have left.
"humanity’s newest predator is culling the herd, and like the herd most prey are oblivious to the danger"
the sum of our unholy fears
"‘ and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’ ~Thomas Hobbes Leviathan"
"Everything in moderation, even excess."
When too long ago becomes another universe.
"I enjoy reading people here, wondering about the lives behind the words"
Hopefully 2022 is the year covid loses its bite
"58,000 people have died of covid in the US since November 14th, someone’s plan is working"
another day of observing humanity on the internet and I’ve concluded you’re more fucked than you were yesterday
"for those of you who are spending an inordinate amount of time just trying to be okay during the post holiday hangover I understand where you’re coming from, take care of yourselves"
"a cold morning in this desert city, with Turkish coffee"
sometimes the difference one makes by being there for someone in their darkest moment can change the course of a life
"drawn to each other, easy as breathing"
Turn your back on a culture that is stale and dead in favor of a living world that is non-linear and rises above the illusory control of the least among us. Find magic again. It was always there.
those who don’t want to be found
one morning you wake up decades later
Regrets are sealed into eternity by death. Say what you need to say to those you love.
There are no deals with god.
In the end they’re all haunting memories
"Paint me with your purity, I’ll baptize you with my filth."
Trading emotional capital for peace of mind. Sure isolation is a knife but the cuts only hurt at night and there is no blood.
I can never say no to anyone but you🎵
being hated makes you stronger while being loved makes you soft
Side two of Disintegration is far superior to side one.
"We should fuck away our existential angst, or die trying."
People always demonize what they don’t understand. Their universe is very small.
‘Average seeks average’ ~Charles Bukowski
Don’t cling to anything. Learn to let go of both your angels and your demons.
I don’t fuck with anyone as a matter of practice. I’m here doing my own thing reading you doing your own thing. I don’t need to know you.
"You missed my cruelty, is that it? I only gave you what you needed. Anything less and it would have been a failure on my part."
I bring a cruel eye for your delusions and a sharp tongue to disarm you of them.
"As a polarizing figure, you either hate me or despise me, but you can never say I don’t love."
You must search me out if you want my words to nibble on your ears.
It’s none of my business other’s opinion of me. They don’t have all the information and most likely have included much of their own self loathing in their judgement.
"We all have the right to choose who will be in our lives and who will not. It’s not only okay to close the door on toxicity, it’s a requirement."
They never seem to understand that control is an illusion and yet they tighten the grip on their reality and double down on their futile attempt to establish order from the chaos. It all breaks down in the end.
There are those who can never show vulnerability to the outside world and the air of strength they project is mostly show. The anxiety they suppress causes them issues and will cut them down early. The quiet desperation of their own facade is also their prison.
just be art
I can read her mind  and she can read mine
ask me yourself  I have nothing to hide  I own my shit
when you overthink you lose touch with reality as your thoughts consume themselves inside the echo chamber of your skull and you are left with nothing to think about but overused thoughts
"Nobody in the modern era really believes in the Bronze Age god. Those days are gone. What they do believe is that they should be believing, or want to believe but their minds fail them while doubt is the ultimate threat to circular reasoning."
we are little more than a chemical reaction with a primitive consciousness but we can manage to catch a glimpse of the infinite
"in the future everything falls apart one way or another, enjoy this moment before entropy takes you"
overstimulated I withdraw like I always do
try not to take life too seriously
we accept so much that is demonstrably false
I have always been sitting here on this balcony looking over the rooftops at storm clouds with this delicious beer in hand. The mosque sounding the call to prayer. The universe made so much happen for the honor of experiencing this moment which is eternal.
the eternal now
"I walk among brutes, they think I belong"
kings and tyrants have always loved those religions whose followers craved certainty and whose heaven is reserved for the subservient
"the distant universe could be dead for all we know, its light finally reaching us in the frontier delivering a cosmic eulogy"
"few can grasp the concept of the number one trillion, infinity, or the vastness of the observable universe"
"time is a social construct based on the revolutions of our planet referencing our local star, seems silly when you think about it that way"
I know where love is
I demand more than most
this party is boring have you ever contemplated the infinite
a prolonged derangement of the senses
don’t wait for me I’m already dead but breathing
you freak me out in your perfect
"off to a festive New Years party, stay safe everyone when midnight rolls around to your part of the world, I love you all"
blow my mind
your desire is the only thing that hurts
the block feature is holy water for twitter
unfollow me now  before I devour your soul
so many don’t even know what they want and don’t recognize what they need when they see it but their poetry is good
the best people have seen some shit
awareness is so fantastic we must flee into sleep nightly to escape the bombardment of the day
true love is letting go  obsession is control  not love
you cannot possess love  you cannot possess fire
there are no objects  just relationships  we only touch  in our imagination
I’ve seen her naked soul and she touched mine
she tempts me nightly
my words are not unlike a wheat field swaying in the breeze and somewhere out there you can find me searching for sunrise
I only want one woman to share my dreams with but my god that woman
"my thoughts gravitate to her, always, for she is the gravity for which my words fall"
"you’re the actual devil, I’m just the scapegoat"
when will you realize that life can be beautiful you fool
the universe has changed
"life certainly has its unbearable moments indeed, however it also has its share of beautiful ones as well if you’re lucky"
"your skull is not a prison, it is also a part of everything"
nobody has power over another that is not willingly given
"I don’t have any answers for you, just well thought out questions"
when you want to wake up you will
the void is merely a mirror reflection of everything
hate requires too much energy that would best be spent on something positive
I don't hate anyone
some people you’re just drawn to
we all go crazy sometimes
something beyond human
as humanity rapidly becomes one collective consciousness connected through electronic technologies
until you can become intellectually naked you know nothing about anything
too dangerous to be in your feed
time is impossible to waste
do your thing
nothing is more or less important than anything else; time does not judge
suchness
"the most traveled road is one where you become someone who is easily managed by established societal power, for the gods they created eternal reward is reserved for the subservient"
the internal transcendence of being
language is magic if anything is
the evolution of language is what changed the world and continues to do so
find a way through the jungle of propaganda and release yourself from the grip of cultural machinery
what hath we wrought for the world
"“May the New Year bring you courage to break your resolutions early! My own plan is to swear off every kind of virtue, so that I triumph even when I fall!” — Aleister Crowley, Moonchild"
we die nightly  recreated by the dawn
be dangerous to the status quo
an asymmetrical mind
we exist forever in our best moments
"when she wants you you’ll definitely know, the signal will be thunderous"
take the hurt and do something good with it
she’s ethereal  you can find her between the notes dancing
they let you see what they want you to see and you don't see me
"we pass from one phase of life into another and for many it changes them, but for the good ones it only enhances them"
if there wasn't a devil it would be necessary for humanity to invent one because personal responsibility for most approaches ego death
the crowd is always wrong
words for the middle of the night
humanity was propagated from all this shit we do
you only have to get through the day nights take care of themselves
it's a process *everything
what once was what could have been what never will be  what is
we are dynamic
time is never wasted time just is
that way we fall into place
the world sleeps like it always does
my god you
a thousand yard stare from two thousand three hundred miles away
at peace with the day
dreams of violence dreams of war dreams of death
with a cynical eye on bullshit
life is a cycle between everything is bullshit and forgetting everything is bullshit long enough to learn a lesson
"So take some time, get high, have an orgasm and say fuck off to a bunch of people. It’s the only way."
nothing means anything
trying to squeeze back into anonymity
if you don’t love yourself how can anyone else
there are real vampires  emotion is the blood  upon which they feed
we see what we want to see and usually it’s a reflection of us
the all seeing eye
sometimes we torture people just by existing
"mine, for example"
the human condition is punishment enough
some people’s version of quiet desperation is louder than others
dreamt I let someone in
seriously slept 12 hours last night

Jean-Phillippe Piter
I see a lot of pain in your smile
Demons are the baseline human being.
You know who changes the world? Teachers and nurses.
I’ve tried to make the world a better place. I’ve tried to make a difference. In the end it doesn’t even matter.
"people who are genuine are easily played, don’t change"
"West Bay, Doha, Qatar"
"She’ll love you, she’ll fuck you, she’ll stab you."
I’m cruel in a raw sort of way
people will feed off your regrets if you let them
I know many of your stories. I understand you. I never judge.
it’s all fun and games until you pull the ‘regret the shit you did when you were young’ card
‘A virus with shoes’ ~Bill Hicks
a great die off of ignorance
I drink my pills
the products of selfish adults make the best people
from an early age I saw agendas

‘feel good’ movies share responsibility for a shitty world
I like the odd ones.
"crimes, real and imagined"
where the only safe place is in your head
the noose is tightening on free thought
algorithms control ideas
I burn for her
Most in this world don’t even have their basic needs met yet we write about love like it’s a thing.
her unreasonable fire
the sound darkness makes when bound in leather
sanity comes and goes
"every time you wake up at 3am rejoice, for you are still breathing and possibility hasn’t given up on you yet"
people should enhance your life not be the focus of it
* I’m always there for you *
It’s a lovely morning a cool breeze  a warm sunrise Italian espresso  and if I try hard enough I can ignore the sounds of a jackhammer across the way at the place  where a ministry  collects all our data
The more I write the more you fall in love with me or the more you hate me. There are no half measures.
"“I admit it: above all things, I fear absurdity.” ~Salman Rushdie"
we are time travellers  trapped in time on the cusp of the infinite
you must take my good with my terrible
You belong here. You deserve to to feel love. Be who you want to be. Be who you are. Laugh every chance you can. It’s not always an easy road but never let anyone tell you who you are supposed to be. Think for yourself. Question everything. Live your life goddamn it! Live it well
Where is the god who couldn’t stand to see you on your knees? Where is the god who isn’t the embodiment of a fragile ego?
Always be willing to change your position in the face of sufficient evidence.
Believe in yourself. You got this.
"Don’t hate the believer, hate the belief. The credulous need love too, unless they’re an asshole. Then it’s okay to hate them too."
Don’t delete your words. You wanted to say them. Hold fast.
dazzle me with bullshit
"Just be who you are and make micro adjustments until you become who you want to be. In the end it doesn’t really matter, you are a part of this thing."
there is no void
let’s calm the obsession down a little
the complications of survival
she has my attention  that lure of the impossible do you believe in fate?
the glow of dawn over the rooftops
there are different levels of people
that dress brings out my exquisite villainy
"by all means lose your grip on reality, I highly recommend it"
torn between worlds
we undo ourselves more often than not
"rough night lots going on insomnia  homesick depressed no, melancholic  pensive even  existential crisis  hungry jet lagged post op blues  fortunately  it’s likely  situational"
"to devour you, to feel the tremble of waves under a hungry mouth and tongue and a finger or two or three inside your everything; and you, god you, trying to pull it all inside with your painted talons clawing and screaming into the night"
I’ve kept every song she sent like so many wild flowers pressed in between the pages of ancient books
I wouldn’t read too much into it
"question everything, including your sanity"
try living the life you chose
the devil you know
the truth is we’re all terrible
a beast hiding among roses
sustain me with fingertips
I feel nothing but my mind slipping into the creaking sound of leather
words for the dust
hate is a decidedly undisciplined emotion
pretty things breaking in the dark
"my silence accounts for so much that has happened, I manage some paltry scraps occasionally but my heart’s not in it like it used to be"
"you have every reason to be careful here, continue doing that"
music is time travel
there’s an entire level in hell that is nothing but that female robot voice from Tik Tok and Instagram whispering sweet nothings into your ear
you may consider me to be evil but at least you know where to find me and my door is always open
"all the old demons are still here, they’ve just adopted different masks"
"I’m not sure which is more beautiful, the fantasy or the reality"
there always seems to be room to be a little more broken
a monster to some an angelic hand reaching through the darkness for others
this is a fine world you should care for it it’s the only one you got
things changed and here I am still trying to save the world
"a lover once told me you can never go back, she has always been right on that point"
people change over time and become strangers again
learn to be alone  and you’ll have something
we make up so much bullshit just to get through this life
if it was love then you care what happens to them even though the passage of time dulls the sting of regret
always close and so far away
people we meet in passing with stories to tell
forests and abandoned places ancient lakes tucked away on mountaintops church bells ringing on a lazy afternoon
"there is a gulf between make believe and reality, there are things you should be seeing that you are not seeing and there are those who whisper into your ear the dulcet words of influence"
all so many immortals playing hide and seek with themselves
post apocalyptic afterworld
"Covid has killed 817,000 Americans yet the most vulnerable age group seems to resist getting vaccinated and wearing masks. That’s also the largest age group, coincidentally the one with all of the wealth, resources, and pensions. Game, government and media. Brilliant! Well played"
Rise
we all need to do from hell and back on occasion
the best of us are forged from chaos
Nobody leaves this place unscathed. That’s how it’s supposed to be.
It’s like we have these insane desires that are never satiated. We always want more. The system requires it. At some point we all need to just sit in the forest or the desert or by the ocean and just listen.
I’ve already procreated. What else you got?
developing a good poker face is probably essential for survival
most entertain fragile realities crafted from necessity or circumstance
everything implies nothing
nothing much more than higher primates occupying a minor speck of a planet inside an insignificant solar system in the backwater of a small galaxy that is colliding with another galaxy that churns among billions of other galaxies in one of many universes; you’re not that special.
you are fundamentally the universal forces that brought you to this moment where even this moment is on the move
"it’s better to live a short life of wonder, doing the things you love rather than a long life of misery doing what is expected"
wake up  recognize the illusion of who you are
most of you are very good at pretending you’re not the basic universe whatever; you’re very good at pretending you’re not god
walls as monuments
fade to black  for a moment
what have you been told to care about this week
embrace what makes you different
independent thinkers are the worst enemies of history’s tyrants
I don’t control the media I don’t control your mind  I just nudge you occasionally  to think for yourself
still my favorite filthy place to leave my thoughts
we’re all the devil in somebody’s story
being a lost soul is a temporary condition
we never get what we want out of all these words we toss into the aether after lighting them on fire with our imagination but somehow watching them burn while falling into the nothingness before being extinguished by the dark is comforting
This world will try to shit on you. It will look for any opportunity to bring you down. It’s up to you to develop the tools to not let it. If you do this sometimes you’ll win the small victories.
she holds my heart she is who I dream about  she knows who she is  she knows who these words are for  she understands impossible  like I do
the differences between people are really insignificant unless they hold onto what those who would hold power over them have told them about ‘the other’
"sleep will come when it comes, being awake is breathing"
"Hagia Sophia. Photo by me. Istanbul, Turkey."
"contrary to popular belief you absolutely do need your demons, they make you who you are"
I know a thing or two about love. About what it is and isn’t. About what endures in time and what is left behind in the dark. Let me tell you it’s worth every moment you’re inside of its embrace because that’s the way the universe lets you know who you are.
This needs to go right here.
"It’s 4am in my part of the world and I just deleted my entire drafts folder. A gift from my drug deluged brain to yours, whatever the state it’s in"
"keep the fire I gave you, it was for you to carry"
let’s always be mad together no matter where in the world we find ourselves
sometimes the blood is real
"you’ll one day notice experiences such as the music you love the most, the memories you made that you hold close, the places you’ve seen, and the people you know and love have nothing to do with traumatic moments in the past, it’s when you know your wounds are fully healed"
we’re all survivors until we’re not
"to my haters I just want to say I appreciate the fuck out of you for giving me some form of credibility for my username, reputation matters"
too old to die young  but I tried
she was an inevitable fire
blood moon knives for eyes
in a hotel in an ancient place designing my business card while watching ‘American Psycho’
just my own
the way you handle knives gets me hot
she’s the candy inside satan’s bowels
life is short if you believe such things
the crushing weight of memory
there are pure moments but they are fleeting
we smile because we wish the world was better than it is
"I have alts, abandoned places that once was; on the edge of oblivion"
we exist in time  not in space
drawn to me
explosive orgasms creating new worlds between the waves
a mouth and tongue playing you like an orchestra
fingers have memory
I’m never tempted by sins of the flesh because it’s your filthy mind I want
not living is dying
most prefer mediocrity because it feels safe
"you can’t save anyone, you can only die trying"
"people have problems, never get involved until they work things out"
all true heroes are unsung
find someone you can never have enough of
my presence here is an act of defiance
she is what’s rare in the world
midnight savior
a life without risk is never safe
too many people are dead in this world
those with fire in their hearts understand
"one can never understand god, one only understands their own reflection in the face of the divine"
"there have been enough martyrs in the world, what humanity needs are better angels"
war does something to people
I haven’t been real in a long time
"people have hurt me but I wish them well, this life is all about survival and those who were struggling needed to do what they had to do, and so did I"
somewhere on a rooftop in the Middle East with a cocktail in hand and someone in my thoughts
Cheshire Cat grin 🎵
We exist where our being touches this world.
If I ever hurt you please know it was unintentional. Matters of the heart are a sensitive affair and all I know is violence.
under the spell of an Arabic night
pills come in a variety of people
all some know is what dead men wrote
this human experience  a perspective of the cosmos
to feign human
awaken from this illusion  you are not a stranger here  you are “here”
"mad, bad, and dangerous to know"
the reptilian part of my brain wants to devour you
"you are eternal, it’s about time you start acting like it"
authoritarians control democracy by controlling minds; remember this fact the next time you hear a bore parroting talking points from the corporate sponsored media around the water cooler
I want to absorb you and the fact that I can’t reveals the true limits of love
there are those who grew up following the rules and it shows
her mind runs deep
They cut my part out
take away your pain with my mouth
our story is the stuff of legends
life is pain fuck away the tears
daddy Devil
they just didn’t understand
we are meant to be
Always the first to recognize “not meant to be”
the light they are drawn to
a menagerie of lost souls  crying out in the darkness of isolation and loneliness
people exhaust me
life waits for nobody
we always seem to believe there’s more time
"At the beginning of time there was a garden. In the center of the garden was a house. Footpaths spiderwebbed  throughout the garden, passing a large stone fountain before reaching the groves and banks of rare flowers. She sat under a willow with a porcelain cup of cardamom tea."
we all live in invisible cages but we can still dream and remember what freedom tasted like
inside the minds of madness
I get lost in her world often
can you feel me feeling you?
an explosion of the senses
the best revenge is to live a good life and forget all about revenge
you belong here  you are not a stranger  in the universe  you are the universe
when I’m finally done here I’m going to buy a place with a two person bathtub
when the disordered accuse you of something you can guarantee that’s what they themselves are doing
one must realize this effort will enable one to sort out those who stand by the victim through the scorched earth tactics of the disordered over the ones they no longer require in their life; it’s an opportunity to start fresh with new people
This years’s Halloween party with friends.
you got me all wrong
feigning anonymity while pretending to be invisible
the poetry came first  when madness breathed itself into words carved into the page as if the keystrokes were a knife or a gun or a jilted lover stalking  waiting planning
what do you want
I hate your programming but love you as a person
I’ll offend your fake sensibilities
I know my own  and she’s fucking  badass
"god, please blacklist me you insufferable cunt"
I let you play as long as I own your soul
I was always with the baddest bitch in the room even when she dressed me like a dork. That devil energy is undeniable.
it’s okay this thing
she’s not on my mind she’s a part of it with her own garden  and sea
each day  marks a moment  closer to the infinite
pregaming the pregame for a night out
we touch in another life
"perhaps all this happens when nothing else can, I for one make the time for it"
the human story is a painful one
face the fire
"you don’t want to feel the infinite you make excuses and deceive yourself and pretend you must deserve what you get through suffering and play the role of the poor little me but nothing changes the fact that you are the great self, you are everything, there’s nothing to realize"
she’s magic  I can feel her cantrips  and incantations
just hold on  there’s life left  in the moments
the right hand of a self centered narcissistic prick and the way this is just the fucking theme apparently
never fall for someone who thinks he’s the devil
wine is not blood but it should be
despite my reputation I bleed for you all the time
"‘Self Portrait’  Angélique Boissière Nantes, France"
never worry about the judgement of fools
they only have the power over you that you let them have
I’m only human some of the time
the Devil is the source of her power and when he hears her asking he provides
every now and then I’ll tell you I hate you only because I love you
the other reason is you must be told what to think and that’s so easy for a twit like you
"theocrats own the media, that’s part of the reason you’re offended by my existence"
"I only like the rebels, the misfits, the lost, and the damned."
if an invisible sky god told me to gut my child to prove my faith I would respond with a resounding “fuck you” but that seems to be the entire crux of the faith now doesn’t it?
fucking live that life and ignore the death cults
most people are credulous if you repeat the lie often enough
people of faith will lie to you to preserve the lie they’ve lived their entire lives
an angel always does the killing yet I’m the bad guy
time is static it never moves  we do
"faces come into and out of focus while dancing among the shadows as you ride this rollercoaster of time; they have one voice, one mind, and it is yours"
walks of shame are underrated
we create images in our minds that are the perfect reflections of an imperfect reality and when reality asserts itself the mirror shatters and the shards cut your feet
we are the reflection  of a dying god  made into the image of ourselves
dreams of war
there’s a forest just down the hill from the garden with spiderweb footfalls winding themselves under the branches that paint the ground with a dappled late afternoon sun
the fabric and structure of existence lies within all of us and it is up to us to seek out the infinite
"the dead speak to you in dreams, never go with them when they beckon"
dreams of abandoned places
a sense of doom looming from somewhere inside the dream; from behind every door that is locked before you lies safety and salvation but it is out of your grasp
shadows of faces moving in and out of perception dancing to the flames of of a candle flickering in the periphery
like a dream where you are abandoned and the night has a choke hold on an eternal sky
it’s bad out there  take care of yourselves
loss piles up  like so many bone heaps bleached in the sun
it’s sort of like painting variations of a theme
only this moment is forever  the rest are not real anymore
time is its own demon spinning memories of things that can no longer be touched yet seem to be at the edge of our fingertips
time slips away  opportunities are lost  we become what we need  to be
the sky is empty  and we are nothing
truth is a bitter medicine dispelling the dulcet siren song of illusion
the curse of overthinking  the weight of memory
grinding teeth  into bonemeal  the remnants  of chemicals  still in the system
It’s days like today I would never get out of bed with you.
Heaven to me is a glimpse of the world through your eyes.
I don’t give a fuck. I never have. That’s my super power.
I can finally sit alone with my thoughts in the morning over coffee. I have a special place where I can see the courtyard of my villa where there are plants and a bright pink bougainvillea that is climbing up over the desert toned wall.
"we can slow down  we can channel crazy into something soft, quiet, and beautiful"
You can never go home really. We’ll always be at that crossroads of time.
I have nothing to lose and know how to use a sword.
she’s the other version of me
our hands can’t keep secrets
an exceptional life begins with taking the first step toward an independent life
lives are a measure of small victories
I need you to understand that I’m quiet sometimes but when I’m silent you are with me
words can be demons hiding from you and laughing in the dark
"do what thou wilt, do no harm, never kneel before anyone, not even me"
name evil to take away its power
I rather enjoy reading your dark paths
an observer of humanity  the Devil’s only power  is providing what you secretly  desire but rest assured that evil has always been  within you
she is  therefore  I am
hell is a garden  on an island  floating in the lake of fire
I respect everyone’s right to believe in whatever they wish. I don’t respect the pretentiousness of those who who would push those beliefs onto others. I’ve already heard your so called good news and find it lacking but you do you.
Inshallah
she exists between the space of dreams and forever and I’m quite fond of her
in the end I choose kindness everytime
"I wouldn’t call it desperation. He seems content with his life, with the ritual and routine. He’s a gentle soul when I think about it but I wouldn’t want to witness the homicidal rage that must be waiting just beneath the surface. The system tends to do that to certain people."
"He was once an officer in the Army. That was a long time ago. His existence is simple. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. He never socializes or goes out. Machinelike, he seems to have no motivation to make human connections. His is the face of true loneliness and isolation."
His IQ is quite high. He is almost 50 with no wife or kids. He has thoughts about a variety of topics and states his opinions well. Both his mother and his grandmother died of COVID within a week of each other in August. He left for a month dealing with the aftermath.
Death will come for us all but for some you just know that pale horse is already on the way.
His breath is labored. He saunters about the kitchen. He is a gargantuan example of a human with a taste for beef and bacon. No vegetables. On the spectrum he sits down nightly after work with his greasy food at the table. Weird libertarian TV shows play loudly from his phone.
nobody ever really leaves  they just find new forms to inhabit
"you know what you must do to get better, not doing that puts ownership directly onto your shoulders making you both victim and perpetrator of your own mind"
Reality is merely the translation of captured sense stimuli by the brain. Nothing more. Through communication we agree upon shared concepts of reality but in truth if the brain is sick or damaged those concepts are much different and individualized.
some live lives of quiet desperation  some live lifetimes of lies and betrayal some live both
"her voice was a whisper that could have been love breathing its way through the peonies, more of a spring breeze than the chilly gusts of winter or the stifling hot exhaust of summer"
her bones are made of words while her heart is made of stories that keep her warm in the night for she exists at the edge of the world where dreams dance with reality
some stories never leave you
Water trickled from four verdigris fish mouths set at cardinal compass points into the black water of the stone cistern of the fountain. Sunlight rippled between lilies that a dozen or so Koi lazily dabbled beneath. Bees and hummingbirds danced and shot from flower to flower.
"she held the porcelain cup delicately with both hands and pressed it to her lips, her eyes closed in the garden"
they’re here trying to work themselves out and the beautiful ones do it beautifully
you get the god you deserve
a reality shaped by false information
"fitness is about life or death, it’s that simple"
"Identify the agenda in everything you read or watch. The news is not simply the news, it’s indoctrination by the few firms that own all of the media. Your obedience and control is the product.If you’re asleep they already own you."
"there is a fire that dwells in the hearts of the best of you that cannot be quelled by the dull minds of plastic people who would seek to bring you into the fold of the mundane, the obedient, and the fearful"
I did it all for love.
defiant
repentless
heretic
those whose sin is pride will always tell you the cold truth for liars are always missing something in their life
the god of fuck
When you finally see your Devil was your saint all along and now see him as your god.
when forever and nothing means everything to you
overt religious and sexual overtones
"you’ve died enough for a few lifetimes love, it’s time to live without regret"
she understands for she is fire
defile yourself to gain power
All the fun things in life are forbidden by the rules of dull minds
nothing is sacred if everything is
"one day humanity will stop killing each other over religion, that’s the day god breathes over a cold dead planet"
‘Through the Window’  by Roberto De Mitri
annihilate the self to find the infinite
Ask the Devil
say when
every time we wake from dreams we are somebody else
If they ever truly loved you they would be happy for you when you find happiness. If they’re resentful they weren’t the one anyway.
There are many roads ahead. Some take you to where you need to be. So many are dead ends. All of them are important.
navigating the deep dark waters of the insane and obsessed
Find your deep connections but never ever go looking for them. They won’t happen that way.
"Maxwell Swift, NYC"
the act of creation requires the use of violent forces that have been caged for so long they shout out to the world when they are released through art and the written word
take my hand love  descend with me
I can imagine being strung out on the sofa with you while listening to after party music quietly playing in the background as we vibe and fight the end of night.
Decadent
*for entertainment purposes only
I learned early on that playing it safe gets you nowhere.
If you want to see god look into the mirror it is there where you’ll  see the Devil too
Twitter is always in rough draft
“I’ve known you a long time. It’s been too long.” His voice was everywhere in the darkness. She felt it penetrate her formless body. She was pure thought. A mind suspended in time and bound to his voice. It’s timbre and cadence sliding around her throat like an invisible hand.
"Losing a pet is one of the first lessons about grief for many young people. That’s when we realize that emotional attachment isn’t just reserved for people, but to all sentient beings. The universe experiences itself in multitudes."
One can see the true character of a person by the way dogs interact with them. Those that dogs avoid or get angry with are the ones who have no soul. Those people are dead inside.
"‘Unholy water, sanguine addiction’"
I’ve destroyed worlds with my fingertips
there was no fall I was pushed
Americans were the best at violence. They were good at war. Their society was organized around it and they used it for entertainment. They would gun each other down in movie theaters and at grocery stores. They weren’t even safe in their own homes or in the churches they loved.
Violence and the threat of violence defines most societies.
"Hardwired to procreate and survive. Their institutions, religions, and governments, by extension, are hardwired the same."
Peace is a lie. It’s a lie like everything else you’ve been told. There has always been violence and there always will be.
If you use human history as a metric Satan won that little war in Heaven.
I don’t care about the opinions or judgement from willing thought slaves. I don’t care what they have to say at all.
I’m surprised the word ‘peace’ can be found in any language
"‘A man had to die, sacrificed in the most violent and macabre way so you could be a cunt to everybody. As long as you ask for forgiveness you can just do the same horrible things to people over and over again. I hate to tell you, it doesn’t really work that way. We’ll talk soon.’"
humans are the most dangerous animal of them all
*dialogue ideas
"‘Don’t get all high and mighty with me human. You are essentially a hairless ape half a chromosome away from being a chimpanzee. Yet you think you can judge and rebuke me? You just came down from the trees a moment ago from my perspective.’  ~me, as Lucifer"
those who pay attention know me in all my forms
forged from fire  tempered inside you
eyes made from the golden splinters of heaven
I am  always
"most people sleepwalk through life, drifting from one situation to the next"
sometimes we make connections that endure over the remainder of our lives
‘Solitude is far more better than meaningless entertainment. Distractions will never be extinct.’  ~Napoleon Hill
don’t look down
lips the color of roses and ash
you are your own prisoner in a prison of your own making   you alone are judge and jury  with the power to forgive yourself of your crimes  real and imagined
to see new worlds through the wonder in your eyes
six wings of golden light  a heart made of fire
I’ve known you before there were stars in the sky. You have always been and always will be.
"The beginning of the most beautiful love story was an ending, as much as endings can be. We all die for love in some form or another only to be transformed into something magnificent, beautiful, unstoppable. This is the curse and the blessing."
listen to the hard songs
I surveyed the ravaged plain and saw black smoke billowing from the destruction of the battle. The stench of the dead rose up from the filth. A foul wind greeted me in defeat. The gates of Heaven shining in the distance. The pit opened before me to welcome my descent. So it goes.
how weird do you need me
loneliness doesn’t stem from the absence of people but from the people who don’t understand
the sound of a penny drop in an unhallowed chamber  surrounded by fire
I can’t save you. I don’t even want to. I spend an inordinate amount of energy just to be able function in this dysfunctional world. If you can’t meet me half way then we have nothing. I won’t let you drown both of us.
for all the world is but a dream
my kink is her mind
When god breathed life into existence he made her. It was her I risked and lost everything for. It was her that led to the fall.
"the worst people will reduce you to a number, avoid them at all costs"
style is as messy as it is important
I have my voice
bullshit people have bullshit rules
we die only because the experiment was a failure
the Devil is a mirror  held by the hands  of a false god
you exist in the reality they sold you
my ocean is fire  she crossed it  willingly
I find I inspiration by writing in character
rebel against tyranny even if you must give up everything you love
the devil fell in love once and once means eternity for an arch angel
"an extra-terrestrial monster from another dimension hellbent on destroying the earth, but love me anyway and listen to my side of the story"
lift with fear
I’m not your Devil anymore
people have pasts  so do you  it’s now a matter  of mitigating  your level of hypocrisy
I will never judge you
be who you need to be
we need to escape our head because the “designer” of our head is a fucking idiot
at the end of the day we are slaves for biological processes
when people heal  they leave  while some stay to help the others
a vast empty hall made of stone  and marble and small alcoves  set into the walls  from where murmurs whisper  pain and anguish from the unseen and the unheard  by the decaying grey throne that lords over the dust
late morning ennui fading into the long shadows of afternoon
I require withdrawn time
why yes that is a bag of bones in my pocket
moan the blues
a place for the downtrodden  the broken hearted  the lost
step out of the shadows tell them you love them  stand or fall
When your ex tells you you’re a saint. That.
I would fuck the shy right out of your mouth
the ones who fade into the shadows and fall out of memory
I meet people from my past over and over again in the most unlikely of places. This life has few people in it.
Sometimes those ghosts walk in from out of nowhere and meet you in far away lands.
she would fuck me like the Devil
*Birdcloud
The Devil’s pick for best harmonica solo. They get the golden fiddle.
lighten up a little  you’re here to have fun  and laugh at the absurdity  of it all that’s the test
It’s just me and Whiskey left. All the others are abandoned and lost forever.
It doesn’t matter which account I write on. It’s still me doing the writing. It’s still my imagination coming up with the words. I just happen to like this one. A lot.
in the end life is summed up by moments
I don’t know how anyone really forgets
a random memory of snow falling around a redbud tree in Virginia
burning ourselves to heaven
La Sera by Antonio Palmerini
never depend on people but find some good ones who understand you
she would disappear inside my silhouette and be consumed by my shadow
I drink my pills
sometimes you require the Devil
a curiosity among the plebeians
I’m definitely deleting this later
power lies in numbers  it lies with the masses  who must be controlled by the owners  unfortunately  it’s easy for them
technology enables liars to be better at what they do; the credulous make it easy for them
reality is multifaceted and easily manipulated by those who have every reason to do so
"Unplug from the media for a little while, when you come back you can see through the lights and the noise and see the carnival for what it truly is."
and just like that nothing is real
she exists in dreams and on paper she’s a ghost ballerina dancing on my lap but goddamn those eyes would destroy me
feel the brunt of my darkness
thirsty for thighs and that little thing you do with your mouth
destructive fingers and a healing mouth
all armies are the armies of god
You’re only wretched because you want to be. It’s because they told you that’s all you are and that’s all you’ll ever be but I believe in you. Even when no one else will.
falling from grace was the best thing that ever happened to me
long distance loves  through virtual dreamscapes have heartbreak  built right in
look beyond your carefully constructed reality
playing it safe gets you nowhere
"while trying to make sense of the world, scared and lonely in the dark, they made it insane"
some people are forever make believe
I’ve cut out the world  only letting in some light through the pinholes of a dark curtain  of my own making
sometimes I tire of the petty abuses  people are all about
sex is nothing without connection
anyone in my life is never boring  I think the term “extra” might be an apt description but I like it that way
you’re bored  not surprising take a look at your life and try to figure out  why that is while writing down  all the interesting things you’ve done or thought about  and you have  your answer  why
most hearts are insane
you’ll never truly know my world
unapologetically withdrawn most of the time
"I see the breadth of it all; from the vantage of every moment of a life lived, from here I can see the remainder. This is how it is. This is how it works."
the depth of the human experience is spiritual on its own accord
a little isolation
I’ve convinced myself I’m anonymous
"dark, but with purpose"
we really are islands
fair weather followers
some feign darkness  but the pain is real
you need your existence shattered
I’ve always been on your side
there are monsters here
"the end of the story, really"
a thousand minor wounds
people who’ve been part of your experience fucking die
"the passing of a moment, an experience, a life"
brothers and partings and a farewell to arms
sometimes my words tumble over each other but never my sentiment
we write from the offsides part of the world
invisible until manifesting into everything like the way dawn breaks suddenly or an errant tide ruins your day
every word strategically placed for maximum impact
I like to see who’s paying attention.
I never fully stop loving them. I just grow quiet and hope the best for them.
we’re the same people over and over
days of grass growing between the cracks of the sidewalk and the smell of hay from the fields in that old town
I’m aware of my reputation and I’m not even denying the rumors but I’m also not asking anything from you
"Doha, Qatar"
"remembering the sound of cicadas along a country lane, the way they drone as the heat wanes at the end of the day and the sun spreads itself across the sky in soft dappled hues of pink and orange"
her lips are wild and free
I will never lie to you  because I don’t have to
“most people are liars”
where the mask ends we begin
on the fourth day of a seven day binge
a darker cave  a deeper depth
I’ve done some shit I don’t have to lie
sentimental perverted demanding aloof pensive melancholic twisted erudite beatific diabolic Machiavellian sociopathic psychopathic narcissistic complicated heroic tragic
we find ourselves in other people  it’s best when those people are lovers
a heart like the deep end of the ocean
the way memories gather around her
where the crowd is I am not
the best relationships are effortless
I only drunk tweet these days. I have no idea what I’m writing.
the most dangerous ones are those that sit in the corner while everyone else is alive with the energy of the moment
it’s come full circle  my relationship with violence
nobody is so lonely as when they are immersed in dreams
most people are bullshit
I do see you  but much separates us
I’m only the Devil if you want me to be
I’m the one in the corner  brooding over something personal
is it tomorrow yet or is it someday  or never
if you need destruction I would destroy you out of love
Daddy Devil
a different sort of Devil
alone with people
so called normalcy and shallow engagements
everything withers and flutters away
"I’ve never found the perfect words to express the depth of the way I feel, I’ve only ever managed good enough"
the truth is we will never survive love
"I’m in my own world and it’s a place where yours is only a shadow, a quick glance, or a fast movement in the corner of my eye."
maybe death will take me maybe I’ll be getting death drunk
Russian roulette but with a personality
I’m an ass
white knights are trying to save themselves and will drown you in their vision of the world
the faith where you find solace once burned people alive at the stake
heal yourself  you’re the only one who can
ceremonial evil  an alter to sins of the flesh
governments love god  belief in him makes the slaves  easier to manage
her fingertips  my destruction
the Devil never drowned his own children
her hair  black fire  scorching  dreams
corruption as power
spiritual choke fucking and anal blasphemies  the Devil’s unholy water  seeping from her mouth
her mouth is both holy and profane
you can pray to your god and clutch your holy sacraments but I never leave
her thighs split in two by lightning and fire
my heart is cold it’s black and dark and is a place you can never leave
she wears the Devil’s mark  I made sure of it
“Snakes of the divine”
hell has gardens and a sea
there’s a shotgun hidden somewhere within the words
Ruslan Dyusyunov
life is short our time is precious
most people are essentially silent because the words they choose have no meaning and are fueled by minds that have no real meaningful thoughts
"don’t worry about finding love, we’re all going to die alone one way or another"
and he walked out of her life forever
I don’t believe anything anymore
the road is long and hard  old men sing about heartbreak and loss over cheap beer  and cigarettes
"“I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of.  ~Charles Bukowski,  Love Is a Dog from Hell"
leave to war what belongs to war
of forests in the mist and melancholic violins
what are we if not doomed to fall
isolation is Heaven  sometimes
I don’t hate anyone. I just avoid toxic people until they’ve found their way. Some never do. Some commit unforgivable crimes and can never be redeemed. Those are the ones who are consigned to the pit. They deserve oblivion.
"Melancholy has turned into a quiet, reflective, stone cold stoicism. The raging sea has become a tranquil lake upon which a sky is painted upon its surface."
pain is the forge of greatness
some in leadership positions are basically followers in leadership positions and they are the worst
and they don’t drink
"you can see the dead when they walk among you, the banal shit they talk about, their small ideas and narrow worldview"
the sweet taste of oblivion enticing me to close my eyes is my favorite part of the evening
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
"The owners want you to believe you were born sick and yet they command you to be well; they want you depressed and anxious, weak and powerless, but you don’t have to believe any of it. You don’t have to conform to their control."
sometimes life slows down enough so the horror of it all can grab you by the throat
love me and become immortal
her mouth is the gateway to the abyss
demons come in all the beautiful shapes of goddamn
you’re already in Hell hasn’t anyone told you

Neraz Saaed
"people judge sociopaths but we make the hard decisions, we get shit done"

there were never enough cracks in the sky for me
much had to happen to bring you to this very moment
life hurts  it just does
life coach  now that’s funny
"there are more important things in life than obsessing over former lovers who never deserved you, take me for example"
too ethereal to touch
"every word is a sin every dream,  damnation"

Outlier
I want her corrupt mouth
"Humans evolve at different rates, some are more advanced than others. Most are still knuckle draggers. Meet me at the apex."
this fire will burn
overstimulated and numb
she was pretty much trash but he has her all painted up in hues of pink and lavender in his mind  in his memory
those places where we intersect  are fucking magical
"we live, we love, we fuck, we die that’s the orgasm"
I don’t give a shit about anything any of you have to say. Walk in my shoes for a minute and then we can talk.
"with the exception of a very few I require much alone time to recharge from people, others I can’t get enough of"
those who hate have no imagination
life is a constant cycle of love and loss
it is the sad ones that I love the most
low value people tend to be thirsty
It’s dangerous indeed
impossible gardens under an impossible sky
things change
where we intersect  where we burn  where we crash
some must escape their past while others have the courage to own it
like so many clouds passing by I stoically read fragments of beautiful minds hurt by life as their words scroll past my screen
I’m nothing if I’m not everything
looking back is a waste of time  looking forward is where your bliss dwells
I would hungrily take a bite of your apple
the Devil inside  your ass
born of sin  and serpents
I don’t need worship  I need you to be free
revile me  love me  sing hymns as I undo you
your filth is my salvation
bury me inside your mouth
channel me through your fingertips
How am I the only one with the Uber app among these people and what’s stopping them from downloading it?   A poem.
my fingers in her hair in her mouth  her eyes destroy me  while I destroy her
the tragedy of human existence and sales quotas
you’re not real until I smell you on my fingers in the morning
she’s a porcelain goddess in a rose garden
"You can sacrifice and suffer for your fairy tale god if you want, I’ll be over here indulging in excess and living my life to the fullest. I don’t entertain your Bronze Age delusions of an afterlife. I’m an adult in the modern era."

I don’t want to come home. I can’t come home. The people are alien to me.
"click that block/unfollow button you shallow cunt, there’s more life in my little finger than you’ve ever experienced in your entire pathetic life"
the truth is never popular but lies will enslave you
I left you alone so hard I forgot you exist
texastan
a death cult with themes of child sacrifice dictating healthcare options for women
fuck Texas  fuck fundamentalist anything
so called pro lifers are Satan’s cum stain
I have enough hate in this love to carry us both
I never dwell in past glories  I wallow in present ecstasies
I woke up hard from the fresh dreams  of you
I may have gone to far to get home  I may be lost in the sand forever
carefully crafted minds
the deconstruction of you for my pleasure
distract me with your mouth  quench me from the fires of hell
all the tombs are in the right places
bury me inside your dreams
to slice you open with a fingertip  and see your naked soul exposed for all to see
you matter  sometimes  you fight  with yourself  on this point  but I know  the truth  of your heart  because  I’ve tasted  your soul
there is no meaning other than what you make matter
I’ll be drunk for the next couple of weeks. I apologize in advance for any weird shit I’m going to write.
dreamt you exploded in my dream
life is my death mask
I’m hundreds of years old and not a day over twenty five
finishing up the unfathomable
"Doha, Qatar"
giving up is dying  so is settling for less
when the light becomes her
I’m death baby I breathe and fuck  and tell you pretty things from the shadows  with whiskey in hand while teetering on the edge  and stumbling home
none of it seems to matter anymore when it should matter most
on the second day of a depraved and irresponsible binge
there are still songs that want to cut my throat
uncertain what to do with a life without violence
her lonely mouth  a flower in need of  the sun
born into a slavery few ever escape
I noticed how the owners have you organized into tribes. I see the machinations of servitude.
art is dead because we are

an injured foot and a fractured skull from the butt of a Taliban rifle this kid has seen more in 14 years than most have in a lifetime
"trafficked, sexually assaulted  wearing Ill fitted clothing and holding a comfort toy"
the death of innocence brutalized forgotten
The shit fucked up people equate to normalcy is a function of control versus freedom and the judgement that keeps the mediocrity in power.
I’m in a new reality. It’s called normalcy and I find it quite insane.
I’ve destroyed worlds trying to rebuild them
There are people I love who are in danger
a world is dying inside my heart
some of you are beautiful souls and I see you
I missed you guys. I’m still taking some well deserved down time but I’ll be back to being my old bastard self soon enough. I left Kabul last night and I’m in another location nearby.
I’m fine. Staying off social media until things play out.
"I’ve only ever wanted to make you feel how I feel inside, even when it was nothing."

she is a thousand years old she's every lover in the poetry and within the lines  of the great love letters

Vip by Jeff Mercader
sometimes I have nothing to say but just want to feel you through your words
if sex is death she’s sexy as fuck
"entire lives vanish as if they were never there, immortalized for a little while in words and memory"
silence is a graveyard
a little sleep deprived and a lot insane
her contours are a warm river
I only associate with people who identify as damaged. Everyone else is a liar.
you were made sick it made you who you are I accept you
feed me peaches and sunflowers
let me eat your self loathing
Biljana Radojicic
two snakes kissing a diamond
when she swallows the sea she swallows me
forests of hard trees atop immovable mountains
she plants gardens with her fingertips; fingers that churn the earth and swirl the sea
she found my mind and I drained the energy out of her legs with it
we are in constant flux a mad dance of energy  and chemical reactions  environments interacting  within environments
we are of the earth and the earth is made of dead stars
when I love  there are no  conditions
A fundie with Puritan leanings will be assigned to you shortly.

Piccolo Peccato
we all go silent eventually with words that are stuck in time
a world on fire
into the Sunday part of the night
barbed wire roses in concrete gardens
I want nothing from you but your presence
undefined matters of the heart and Wordsworth was right when he said “we murder to dissect” in his poem “The Tables Turned”
the darkest part of daylight
who knew dead to me would require so much energy
Exploring all of your soft landscapes with rough hands; the contours and hidden gardens where you keep all your secrets.
Thought crimes.
I haven’t shared any music in a while. This is tonight’s vibe on my playlist. Enjoy.
"my fingers are her religion my mouth, her salvation I crave her damnation"
she is divine if anything is
never trust a mortal who claims to have an exclusive path to the divine
never sell me purity I want your filth
Worlds die. It’s the way things are. It’s much larger than us but we are also a part of this process.
we found our forever and it defined itself
I notice people when they’re gone.
We spend so much time glorifying things that are beyond our reach that we forget to acknowledge ourselves and what we’ve had to endure just to be standing here today. We are all on varied paths of the same journey.
Paradise has always been a garden not a city and that’s where everything went wrong.
The sunlight stretched into a prism of multi colored lights dancing on the wooden floor as it pierced through the windows. The shadows grew long and the chimes of the ancient grandfather clock ushered in another day ending when there have been too many to count.
A complex mind is multi-faceted.
Piano music in the dark and I have things to do before I sleep.
Swan shaped boats on the water. A fountain of ancient myths. A sea god drowning in the pond or is he rising from the murk and the lily pads? The sun is setting on the palace. A memory like a gemstone set in my favorite ring.
The poetry of solitude.
Her mind is a garden and I find myself wanting to lose myself there when the sun gets beautiful and the shadows long in late afternoon.
We form images of each other in our minds. In mine I know the taste of your skin and the warmth of your sleeping body.

#thetempleofsatan
Few ever question why.
This is the statue serving to defend every American’s religious pluralism through the use of the religious iconography of the one religion Christian theocrats want supreme.
"Utilizing the fear Christians have of Satan they came up with an 8'6"" statue of Baphomet to be legally erected on the same grounds as the Ten Commandments. They are activists holding the government true to American ideals, removing their statue only when the Ten Commandments are"
When legislatures vote to erect Ten Commandment monuments on government grounds they must accept the right of other faiths to do the same. Enter The Satanic Temple. They're 1st Amendment advocates on the front lines of the advancing theocrats. They use the law to erect their own.
"So the argument lawmakers use when they want to erect monuments of the Ten Commandments on government grounds are typically 1. They are the oldest written laws (false), 2. That they are the concepts in which the United States was founded (also false)."
*The original Pledge of Allegiance did not have the phrase 'Under God'.   **typo
"The US Constitution is a secular document which promotes religious freedom for all through its first amendment, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof' There will be no religion that is favored over another"
The original Pledge of Allegiance did not have the phrase 'In God We Trust'. That was added in the 1950's as religious fervor rose in opposition to Communism. Nor was the phrase on US paper currency until 1956. The idea that the US is a Christian nation is theocratic revisionism.
Religious freedom means just that. Not religious freedom just for your religion. In the US you are free to worship or not worship as you wish. There is an encroaching theocracy in the United States that seeks to elevate one religion over another. This is not an American ideal.
"The oldest recorded laws, the code of Hammurabi (an eye for an eye), predates the ten commandments by 400 years. The first of the Ten Commandments, 'Thou shall not have another god before me' is contrary to the religious pluralism ideals expressed in the 1st Amendment in the US."

you bring so much into your own darkness
I still go crazy

Piccolo Peccato
Delfi Carmona
We fucked so hard the congregation felt it in the dreams of when they were once alive.
The moral police don't choke fuck. They lie there like dead fish while their man fantasizes about other women and tries to get off. She's a catch for the right kind of thirsty however.
Choke fucking is shadow work.
"Corrupting a woman with faith in her heart. Replacing her god with me, if only for a dark moment. To be revered and reviled at the same time. To make her know what it means to sin, to sacrifice, to submit."
Her dress was ripped. Her makeup ran down her face and her hair was a mess. She looked at me and smiled as if she saw something beautiful for the first time. As if rain clouds gave way to a single beam of sunlight. I reached across and kissed her and watched her walk away.
"My belt was around her throat. I was pounding her hard. She opened her mouth in lust, accepting my spittle. I smeared her makeup like warpaint. I grabbed a fistful of her hair and kissed her deeply. She opened herself to everything. I felt myself falling inside of her completely."
Looks like I need to get rid of followers and replace them with my kind. Sex positive.
Choke fucking is less about violence and more about expressing the complete trust of a partner. Orgasms are more intense and the bond between you becomes stronger. It's not for everyone. Communicate with your partner to see what sexual acts are best for you. Don't be kink shamed.
If you haven’t noticed I don’t give a shit about what anyone thinks. I have well thought out opinions and ideas but unlike most I’m willing to abandon them in the face of sufficient evidence or a better argument.
"I like a nice whiskey after a night of choke fucking. Cuddled up with my girl. Yes, I said girl, who is all woman. Playing with her hair with the most attentive of aftercare, because you see, pleasing her pleases me."
"Bound in the dark. Tortured with orgasm denial. Humiliated. Then forced orgasms. Pulling hair. Spitting. Anal. Whips. The belt. Hearing the moans and screams of a fallen angel. Oh, and choke fucking."
"I also like to pull hair when I’m deep inside you. A good solid fistful with a hard pounding, but only if you want that."
Awakened to judgement.
"Every time she chokes fucks me an angel gets her wings back, and who wants that?"
Every time I choke fuck a woman an angel loses her wings.
"If you don't want to be choke fucked, don't ask to be choke fucked. This applies to any sexual act. Communication and setting healthy boundaries are key. Consent is paramount. Most importantly don't allow prudes to kink shame what you like sexually. It's really that simple."
"there’s something regal about her, as if she’s descended from a long line of ancient queens, or one in particular"
I could get lost in her hair and never want to find my way back to the light again
the way her eyes burn with the words that are meant for her
She wears her fire well.
If you get offended because you hold certain ideas you might consider whether your ideas are holding you.
"“If the theocrats are trying to bring us their revisionist vision of a Christian nation it is very much our duty to bring them hell.”  ~Lucien Greaves, The Satanic Temple"
"Women are not free in much of the world yet most of the world is silent, indifferent, or focus on the trivial in the face of this fact."
Certainty is wonder for the unimaginative and the incurious.
"David Dubnitskiy   Kiev, Ukraine"
The Devil was the good guy.
"Just because I write poetry doesn’t mean I don’t want to choke fuck you all night, because I do. I’ll just write about how the sun reflects in your eyes at dawn and how your smile breaks me apart a little at a time."
"Kings and tyrants want you to serve them, to be slaves. They love your ability to believe in the fantastic and assimilate to the herd. It is those who preach freedom over servitude that are the enemy of the state."

They tell you that you're wretched. That's not the word I would use for someone who carries the same  inner light as the one they want you to  kneel before.
Everything is beautiful when seen with the right eyes. One day we will either put an end to our tribal past and primitive urges and live in peace or we will annihilate ourselves saving the universe from what our history has proven to be a terrible scourge upon the planet.
I can’t take everything away without replacing it with something. That would be cruel. You are eternal and nothing anyone says can change that fact but you don’t have to kneel before any tyrant. You don’t have to believe in superstition. You just have to be.
"salvation is a clever word for eternal servitude which by definition means enslavement, you’ve been lied to"

"I dwell in the ruins of every every broken temple, in every failed dream, in every courageous attempt, in every fallen hero, in every redeemed villain."
I love the way she tastes. It's as if succubi and sin were mixed with honey and darkness and hidden away behind a pale inner light.
drink  fuck write
I could take a stab at forever between those thighs
Those words are not meant for you. They are monuments to someone she loves; and the way she loves ensnares the lost and the lonely. She writes with a devotion to the one who made her feel something so long ago. The one that she lost. The one whose forever quietly closed the door.
but this is my home
you have a lot of people in orbit and I don’t like crowds
find the one who wants you to put the mask back on when you fuck them
You tend to see only what you want to see. Sometimes the beast is silent and invisible but will devour you just the same.
The hands that reach from the shadows; faces with no faces. Hidden desperation staggers quietly along haphazard sidewalks toward the call of another dimly lit bar.
I love you but I don't know how I hold onto swelling words  that burst in cruel secrecy subtly hidden from you and I am the worse for it

her divine body glowing  fragile in the moonlight delicate in hands rough with intent she was small in my  shadow  she is small  in my memory I must pull out a knife to remember
o dark night desperate and cold a belt  her neck leather biting into her flesh gripped tight by my fist we burned grinding our bodies the slick heat of a satanic rhythm  guttural moans in the flame of a candle spittle  her mess  of a face her mouth open and begging urgent
I exist somewhere deep within her that tingles when the day grows dark and when it rains
we died in the bed that day the hard cold bed of a rain shattered afternoon cascading into each other like water on the glass like leather hot and beautiful slick with need violently violating the space between us becoming something else writhing desperate in a disgusted memory

"I know, I know. You only like me for the sex tweets. Since sex is 90% mental I thought I would stimulate your mind."
Nobody has all the answers. Some ask the right questions which makes them way more interesting than those who feign certainty.
I read tweets pining over former lovers all the time. It’s better to work on a new relationship than to try to rework a a failed one. If it was a trauma bond then get out and stay out. The best thing is to try and forget them. For me once it’s done there’s no going back. Ever.

Throw out all that religious bullshit about humans being above animals. Humans are higher primates. Once you realize that you can understand them better.
the myth of a 'soul mate' and the myth of 'forever'
the myth she doesn't have your replacement lined up
the myth 'love conquers all'
the myth of the 'good girl'
humanity has a propensity for believing the most preposterous myths
wear me home
I'm not saying we should have stayed together. I just consider her one of the wisest people I've met and I appreciate her friendship.
I already am.
I got lucky with my ex wife. The more I delve into the single life the more I appreciate the fuck out of her.
For women there are the men who set fire to their loins and there are men who provide a comfortable life. Rarely are they the same man.
"Humans have propagated their entire species by women wandering off and getting pregnant by dominant men only to have their agreeable husbands or boyfriends provide and raise the offspring as their own. I’m not judging, just observing. It happens more often than you think."

I really hope none of you are writing about me because I’m pretending not to notice.
Most of you break my fucking heart when I read you.
It’s no secret that I have a thing for Monica Belluci. I have it bad.
Going to need a car when I get back. A fucking fast car.
Now if I can get down to 2000 followers it would have been a productive day.
I'm sure you've realized that I'm impossible to hate
I cleaned out my followers list of inactive accounts. If I've made a mistake and unfollowed by mistake you can reply to this thread and I'll follow back.
"So I'm at day six of quarantine at the military barracks in Kabul and about day sixteen of the infection. I have no more symptoms other than lack of smell/taste. Still the military has be ""detained"" for another week or so. In other news the enemy is 28km away on the outskirts."
pursue excellence do cool shit don't just talk about it
you are what you settle for
Or don’t be looking at all. Spend that energy on self improvement and be selective with potential long term partners. You don’t have to do the relationship thing. It’s another lie society has put at our feet. Don’t be thirsty.
Long distance relationships aren’t relationships. They don’t work and are a waste of energy. At least that’s how I feel about it. Find someone in real life that’s not in this fake virtual fantasy world.
people get angry when they can’t control you
"the quiet literary corner, or it should be"

"“The moment you declare a set of ideas to be immune from criticism, satire, derision, or contempt, freedom of thought becomes impossible.”   ~Salman Rushdie"
She told me as she was walking out that she hated Charles Bukowski. She only read the one poetry book I gave her. “Love is a Dog from Hell”. She only hates him because someone she read hated him and I figure this is somehow a part of what’s wrong with the world.
If you picked any one person’s life story anywhere in the world it would break your fucking heart.
"“At the age of 25 most people were finished. A whole god-damned nation of assholes driving automobiles, eating, having babies, doing everything in the worst way possible, like voting for the presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.”   ~C. Bukowski, Ham on Rye"
"""Business bullshit allows us to blather on without saying anything. It empties out language and makes us less able to think clearly and soberly about the real issues. As we find our words become increasingly meaningless, we begin to feel a sense of powerlessness."" ~André Spicer"
It’s amazing how much the society has changed in the last forty years.
"In a sense the West has become a disposable society, populated with disposable people. There are few jobs with pensions left and workers have become mostly at will. Even the language of the corporate world is a mush pidgin language of vacuous bullshit thought up by sociopaths."
"People can become habit. Loving them becomes routine, a chore like taking out the trash or doing the dishes. The magic inevitably dies. When maintaining the facade becomes too tedious someone leaves. For men it's usually for variety. For women it's for a better deal."
"“I am wary of the whole dreary deadening structured mess that we have built into such a glittering top-heavy structure that there is nothing left to see but the glitter, and the brute routines of maintaining it.”  ― John D. MacDonald, The Deep Blue Good-By"
"“only women, children, and dogs are loved unconditionally,” whereas “a man is only loved under the condition that he provide something. I’ve never heard a woman in my life say, ‘You know, after he got laid off, we got so much closer.’”   ~Chris Rock"
They should be more afraid of those who burned witches than the witches themselves.
People are afraid to like the Devil.
"Okay, okay, it’s a little weird. I was feverish and I love my tactical tomahawk. The worst part about it is I need to clean the mirror in the room I just moved into."
Update on the status of my Covid quarantine: I feel fine. I caught the Delta variant from India. The vaccine saved me from the brunt of it. The first week I thought it was allergies. Day 7 I’m down to no taste and a slight cough. The fever and body aches are gone. No lung issues.

I spent so much energy trying to get past the fact that humans spoke to me from behind a flesh covered skull powered by a primitive brain. I used to watch their mouths move like it was some miracle.

I had no idea Michael Been passed away in 2010. In Belgium. I used to listen to The Call when I was a young man. It’s been decades since I’ve listened to them. This song is on my soundtrack for first loves and heartbreaks.

Another great song from this album. I woke up with it inside my head
It’s okay to change and work on a new path. Someday you’ll look back and think about how fucked up you’ve been and how wonderful you are now.
Bring a real person is hard work. Pretending to be someone you’re not is even harder.

There is a looming theocracy in America. It’s stink is present in the minds of its powerful citizens and the avenues of information and the institutions they control. If you pay attention you’ll see it.
People are not complex. They are animals (higher primates) who’ve bought into the lie that they are not. Aggression is disguised behind social constructs but it’s still there. It’s worse than all of the animal kingdom. We eat our own. Once you realize this everything makes sense.
We’ve all done something we’re not proud of. Forgive yourself. Forgive others and if they are decent they will do the same. If they are not then fuck them and move on. They don’t belong in your life.

You're in her DMs. I'm in her ass. We are not the same.

She reads every word and feels them deeply.
A very underrated band.
"Twitter is just sparse enough for people to project their desires onto the words you allow them to see. They build a picture of you that is not only incomplete, but is more a mirror image of themselves."

It’s impossible for you to remain angry with me for long. We both know this.
she’s the type of woman who would flay you alive for the whole world to see
I perceive the passage of time differently than most. What they have forgotten is right there for me. Years and decades mean nothing. There are only the moments I keep in a safe place.

"Rewind: Lyrics are from middle Egyptian. The HP Lovecraft themed Canadian band sings about the crawling chaos, Nyarlathotep. This concept album is intelligent, it rocks, and is worth checking out."
Music for rainy day melancholy.
The title is better than the song but the song is pretty good for what it is.
something from my Instagram page
Life is tough out there. I know.
I'm real. Are you?
desperation has its own stink
I’m not interested in your private photos or only fans. Thank you though.
"I forgot to tell you, I’m going dark in about ten days. It’s out of my control."
The world is our playground.
I like to be invisible when I want to be but I never like to get lost in the crowd.
"We get into our lives and feel trapped and want more than anything to just run away sometimes but wherever you go, there you are."
Pretty much.
"Saw these guys with my ex in Santa Barbara, 2019."
I also love this song. One from my  electronic playlist.
I’m pretty much a black metal guy if I had to pick a genre. My playlist is eclectic and reads like a crazy person. I’m never afraid of liking what I like. I love this song.
There is little that excites me here anymore.
I don't believe in romantic love. It's ephemeral at best. However passion is an intense fire that burns magnificently in a temporary brilliance and always seems to give way to either tolerance or abandonment.
"""The Byronic hero, incapable of love, or capable only of an impossible love, suffers endlessly. He is solitary, languid, his condition exhausts him. If he wants to feel alive, it must be in the terrible exaltation of a brief and destructive action."" — Albert Camus, The Stranger"
Then a song comes along and punches you in the gut.
"People lie to me, some have been for years."
kindness where kindness is deserved
Most of you are way too complicated to get involved with but still need love. I understand this. I see you.
it’s okay to withdraw inside your head and turn people into whispers and birdsong
we can just keep it make believe
dominant introvert
I’m probably not even aware of the love of my life. I can be so oblivious sometimes spending all that time inside my head.
We always carry something with us  from the people we’ve known in life.
We must play the game of life or go insane. We must pretend this is real.
We are alone when we are the universe. That’s why we dream.
I'm the only sober one here. How ironic.
"Vs. Robert Frost's actual words from ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.""   ""The woods are lovely, dark and deep,    But I have promises to keep,    And miles to go before I sleep,    And miles to go before I sleep."""
"A conversation with a French colleague about the literary value of the Imperial system vs the metric one in literature. Example:  ""The woods are lovely, dark and deep,    But I have promises to keep,    And kilometers to go before I sleep,    And kilometers to go before I sleep."""
Some are weak but hide behind a facade of strength; others have become strong over a lifetime and are not afraid of revealing their humanity. Those are my people.

You’re not real until I’m in your ass.
Vice signaling. I admit it.
Some of you really drain me and not in the good way.
You’re not real until we do filthy shit together.
None of this shit matters. We only pretend it does. Stop wasting your life and go live a little. Fuck what people think.
Exactly this!
I don’t eat shit from anyone.
Holy fuck don't get involved with anyone on Twitter. Even me. Especially me.
I don't get involved in twitter drama. I don't belong to DM rooms. I find them crowded. I don't care about your relationship or TC drama. It's none of my business. I'm not being paid so I say what I please and you may be offended. I follow and or interact with whomever I choose.
Don't spend a lot of time trying to get over a past that no longer matters. You just came into existence in this moment and you are working with the cards you were dealt. Focus your energy on the now with an eye on tomorrow.
"To be fair my ex wife was simply wonderful. I also consider we had a successful 23 year marriage. You must realize that ""until death do us part"" was a popular concept when the average age span was something like thirty or forty years."

"When you lie to someone to be with them you are letting them make life decisions based upon your deception. When the truth finally comes out don’t be surprised when they hate you, if only for a little while. You’ll never see them again once they heal. Let them love you for you."
"They’re always looking for your replacement. You’ve got to be so irreplaceable that you would leave the coldest, darkest emptiness inside them when you leave. Or you could just be alone and live your life on your own terms."
I have a smoking hot ex wife in case you’re wondering.
She wanted gardens and the pitter patter of little feet. I needed the road to perdition.
Good morning. What sort of trouble shall we get into today?
Lmfao!!
"I love your style, your words, your sense of artistic expression but love, for all I know you’re a man, baby."
the power of bullshit
you were never born sick; you were born a blank slate and people put their fears into you
How much is your self respect worth?
I’m chaotic neutral if you ever wondered about my nerd cred.
Modern love is a transaction in a society where everything is bought and sold.
"There’s a different version of them inside our heads, the one that they want you to see while hiding the remainder."
I always know where the exits are.
"When their bliss is no longer you, let them go."
I don’t feel like I’ve ever lost anybody. I feel like they’ve either followed their bliss or returned to the cosmos. Either way they still live within me.
"Lost a few followers from this morning’s bullshit, lol! Fucking prudes. Good riddance."
I’m probably madly in love with her. It’ll pass.
Retro coffee.
I’m difficult to get to know right? I’m not changing.
"""Whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god.""  ~Aristotle  If you're the Devil, you're both."
Check your DMs. Somebody there loves you.
I usually form my own opinions about people. I also don’t play by the rules and believe freedom is more important than love. That’s why I’m weird to you.
conflating love with obsession
If you ever get to the point that you’re afraid to lose them walk away. It is that moment they own you and you were born to be free.
"you can always, always, start over"
you’ll make a great wife for someone someday

I've seen some shit.
"Most of the time you're so many words on the screen. Sometimes when I'm bored, or drunk, or feeling melancholy, I construct you in my mind. I know it isn't real."
"some of the best moments in my life was when I was between relationships; it's not just okay to be single, it's preferable"
"Nobody can make you happy. People can augment your happiness for a little while, but it doesn’t last. Real life gets in the way."
poor bastard
"you’re not real until I’m inside you and my hand is around your throat, otherwise you’re just make believe"
the darkness is just context
Most people with opinions don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
"I can admire your beauty, your style, your intellect, your independence, your manifestation as a woman without feeling the need to fuck you, but my god that tension is there."
I’ll fuck you to death.
I want to fuck you. I don’t care.
I pretend I’m less than.
Everyone I’ve ever loved I fell into effortlessly.
We’re going to lose people. It’s going to hurt. Someday people will lose us. It’s going to hurt. Stop with all the bullshit and do what matters.

we don't need hell we make our own
There is a large population of people in this world who are not even slightly bothered by a belief that would have other large populations of people burned and tortured for eternity. People have been exterminated for these beliefs. That’s quite an indictment of the human race.
My message is simple. Life is rough. It’s okay to be you. Stand on your own or work toward that goal. People have agendas. Find the good ones and never let them go. Question everything and don’t be afraid of uncertainty. Forgive for you own sake. Vengeance is a life well lived.
those who know me are not frightened by my moniker; those who are aren’t worth knowing
get the help you need  don’t suffer in silence  people love you
it’s like prison but with bombs from small men who worry about girls getting an education; small men who want to kill you

I have no home.
I remember you. The quiet dead rose girl with sunshine eyes.
piano keys like teeth scraping ancient memories of still black lakes and orange sunsets through dead trees from the inside of my brain
"love is a shadow of a sunset of a memory creeping up when you least expect it, never seeming to leave graveyards and abandoned places"

her eyes consume me; they negate her words
"I’ll hold you in a foreign land on the strand next to some sea somewhere. As you remove threads of hair out of your face from the wind I’ll kiss your smile and hold you close, laughing. The world be damned."
I will always love the mother of my children even though we are no longer together. I still consider her family. We have each other’s back. She’s also drop dead gorgeous. That’s been a problem for past relationships.
it’s the hard edges that enable you to be soft
there aren’t so many love triangles here as there are love tetrahedrons
We all had choices. I’m at peace with mine.
I’ve got to do today don’t I? Fuck.
a moment in time is all we have
Pornography is The Cure’s best album if I had to pick one.
We can have nice memories from moments long gone with people who are no longer in our lives.

An old favorite from a forgotten playlist.
We are made from goodbyes.
I'm not going to lie. I look forward to seeing her everyday and I'll miss her when we leave this place.
If I could die inside your mouth everything would be righted again.
We die everyday. That's the paradox.
I don't want her as much as I want then. Both are no more.
"""You can never go back"", she said. A voice echoing from another world through an ocean of time."
I suppose I'm a very sentimental Devil.
"Time changes people. They become someone different than you used to know, for better or worse."
One of the saddest aspects of life is knowing that you're leaving a place or someone for the last time.

I will never ignore anyone if they approach me with good intentions.

In case you're interested in what's going on in the Philippines.
I stand before you in all my glory within my light and show you exactly who I am. I don’t lie. I will tell you the literal truth. I don’t hide in fear of judgement. I am here. This is who and what I am. This is my place in the universe.
you needed something more domesticated than I was willing to compromise for
would it help you if you knew I go through the same melancholy most nights?
well here I am; surrounded by all my dichotomies
we don't have to talk ever we can just enjoy each other's minds from a safe distance
caught myself loving too much of your mind
"There will be a time when what you're going through right now won't matter anymore. It will happen like that over and over again until one day you'll catch yourself saying ""I remember that girl, woman, boy, guy, man."" but you won't feel anything but the tiniest nothing of a pang."
the key to a happy life is knowing where the sweet spot is between ‘do what thou wilt’ and ‘do no harm’.
It’s okay to let go love. You have dreams to manifest into.
I’m quite fond of many of you. I know beautiful souls when I see them. I can feel you from all the way out here.
There are two sides to every story.
I’m quite fond of her energy.

You are the only one with the authority to define who you are. The definitions of others is really the projection of their internal view of themselves.
A very self-actualized Devil.
I already have all that I need.
I want nothing from you.
Your shadow of your former self should meet mine.
We’re all ghosts to somebody.
My tweets mean whatever you want them to mean. It is none of my concern how you feel about them or me.
My cult consists of you realizing the beauty and the divine within you. That’s it.
I mostly come here to read you being beautiful in your sadness.

Growing up I wanted to be Jesus. I wanted to be the ‘those without guilt cast the first stone’ flipping money changer’s tables over ‘not in my father’s house!’ Jesus. At his angriest.
her mind dwells in darkness  her love is light and fire a force to be reckoned with
I actually make more typos sober
just looking back at my tweets and comparing them to know I’m happy to say it wasn’t the alcohol
When an Afghan friend invites you to dinner you never leave hungry. You stay for a long time and talk and laugh and enjoy some of the best hospitality in the world before waddling home.
Some nights you just need to get out of your head. Some nights you must pretend life doesn't have you by the throat.
loneliness is merely the realization the illusion was never real
in the end you were always on your own; everyone else was just noise
I get mansplained too. It's cute.

I always try to be honest and will lose followers. I gain better ones back who know me a little more in depth.
I would advise against online romances. You don’t really know who you’re talking to and they can say anything to ensnare you.
"I’m reloading my musket but yes, I agree too."
"Take a moment to inventory your worldview, your beliefs, your prejudices. Do they make sense? Are there better arguments or alternatives. This is what Socrates meant when he said “an unexamined life is not worth living”. Prepare to change them in the face of sufficient evidence."
There are more sex tweets on the way.
"The idea of vicarious redemption is immoral. The idea you can run amok in this world causing as much pain as you can only to be forgiven at the end of the day. Not forgiven by your victims, but rather an invisible old man in the sky. It's psychotic isn't it?"
"All I'm saying is you can live life, make mistakes, love and lose at love without beating yourself up over it. Guilt is the least productive of the human emotions."

"when the war is done with me I'll meet you in Italy, I need something to look forward to"
I am well aware of my hypocrisy thank you
it's the weirdest fucking thing following strangers who pretend to be famous dead people
people rarely talk anymore
With so many of you writing such beautiful things my silence is in awe. I'm happy to shine some limelight your way.
"We all channel spirituality differently. Many cluster into groups loosely professing the same beliefs but it’s all an individual interpretation of the divine. Your beliefs are a reflection of who you are rather universal truth, therefore all religions are true. None are literal."
"Happy Easter for those who celebrate it! I hope your day is lovely, the service is peaceful, and the Easter baskets full."

Everyone I once loved has someone to take care of them. I find a strange sort of peace in that.
I must admit I look forward to seeing your thoughts put into words. I’m quite fond of them.

I pretty much stay out of those propaganda fueled faux wars. Emotional thinking with be the death of us.
It’s a lovely spring morning here in Kabul. Grass has made the palisade their own and birds play and sing inside the concertina wire. Thank you for your sweet distractions.
I know the sorts of things pain and anxiety make you do. I know you feel too much. I know how the fear of abandonment consumes your nightmares and sometimes your waking thoughts. I see you. I know you.

‘deeds not words’
You’re all gods and goddesses. That power is within you all. There are those who don’t want you to realize this because gods and goddesses are impossible to control and without control there is no power.

Strength can mean many things. Some of the strongest people I know inhabit fragile bodies.

if it’s not working change it
Never take shit from anybody. Never be afraid of being alone. Stop thinking emotionally. Find your independence. Trust but verify. Drop the toxic people from your life. Make and achieve goals. Sometimes you have to be ruthless. Don’t dwell on the past (much). Live in the now.

all that’s left of me

I never worry about death. I worry about time prisons and the gatekeepers of mediocrity whose entire purpose seems to be how to make my life harder and keeping me from living my life the the fullest.

Morning playlist. I saw him in Philadelphia in 2017. Amazing live performer.
Where’s the god who couldn’t stand to see you on your knees?
You can’t forget me because I’m ever present. It’s the curse you must bear for once loving me.
"I realize I sometimes get too loud for your quiet soul. Let’s talk privately, without pretense. Without expectation."
I like all photos of demons appearing as angels.
"I’m bad and dangerous to know. Touched by madness, all I want is to enslave your heart, bind you in the darkness and transform you into something beautiful. I want you to fly."
"Feel good Twitter, the the Bourbon fueled Hell version."
"Forget about the darkness. Everyone is dark, even those pretending they’re not. What is important is we try to understand the people who are struggling with their own versions and reach out to them. They need to be seen as well."
"Most cannot see past their prejudices. Their cruelty toward the unusual is the same cruelty they use against the other, whatever form that manifests. It’s a function of narrow minded upbringing combined with an uncritical mind. It’s what’s wrong with the world."
"I know I’m too much for most. Most don’t interest me. You, however..."
I try to follow back. I’m oblivious and suck at Twitter. Send me a DM for a follow.
I’ll never be verified because Twitter is prejudiced against the Devil. Meanwhile any wanker pretending to be Jesus is a shoe in.
Sinners have the best stories.
We see things in the modern world through the filter of convenience born from the backs of those who have sacrificed so that we may judge.
"Because you have lived, death is nothing."

perpetual words born form madness
my mind is a desert with a bottomless pit at its center  from which one can hear the wailing of the damned on those quiet nights where there is no moon

Sociopaths fuck better.
I spend most of my mental energy between extreme boredom and the day to day complexities of survival in a war zone. Love will come later. Maybe.
Hell hath plenty of furies. Especially here.
I’m in love with beautiful hearts and caring souls.
For those who find reasons to hate you. Cheers! You insipid freaks.
People aren’t prizes to be possessed. People are human beings that need to love and be loved.
I don’t wish anyone ill will.

It’s your hell. I’m just here to serve.
most eligible Devil

I’m not a hundred percent sure of anything but I was closer than ever to that metric with you.
"I lied, I know exactly who you are"
I tried reaching out to you. You weren’t receptive so I left you alone.
runaway with me
I’m not who you think I am
My bird just landed. I’m off. See you soon. Take care.
"Many probably don't realize this Devil account is just an alt for my main, @awhiskydarkly I wrote a story there once. A sort of epic poem. Pushing the boundaries of what twitter can be."

I finally broke 5000 followers. It only took 26k tweets. I want to thank all of you for keeping up with all of this madness. This is my favorite account to write on. It's interesting that my @awhiskydarkly has almost one follower per tweet. The Devil frightens people perhaps.
"Holy shit Dani, this is the club you wanted to take me to. @dannarebb"
Trying to weed out the people I can't trust. See how my mind operates?
I’ll be out of pocket for a few days. I’m in good hands.
I trust you.
"Don’t worry, I’m not after you or anyone here. I operate best in real life."
I want to know what is familiar to your fingers. How they pass the time.
I’ve never played by the rules. Since a young age I’ve bent them for my benefit. I always encouraged others to follow them so people like me could break them without being noticed. The herd masked my deviations. Now I encourage small acts of dissent from everyone. It’s your duty.
we’ll die wondering
This is definitely one of my drunk tweets.
we must either play the game or succumb to insanity
on a sub-atomic level we don’t exist; on a molecular level we don’t exist; in fact each of us is an environment teeming with life inside another environment teeming with life where “we” are just an illusion held together by the processes
I look forward to fingering through the pages of your mind. I look forward to seeing what makes you tick.
nobody is blameless and there are many ways to lie; life is too short and we are wasting time
"That’s pretty much the summary from the “Knowing the Narcissist” videos which were the inspiration for this account along with the Byronic character types such as the devil or Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights. (Mad, bad, and dangerous to know). Thoughts, comments, etc?"
"The ends being the sweet fuel (psychic energy) upon which they feed. The three schools just go about it differently. From the pure instinct of the lessers to the careful calculations of the greater narcissists, all three can be potentially extremely dangerous to get involved with"
Finally there’s the greater narcissist. Gifted with self awareness they know they’re different. Calculating. Diabolical. Highly intelligent. They have the power to stop their behavior but see no reason to do so because they see it as highly effective. The ends justify the means.
"Unlike the lesser who is driven by instinct, the mid ranges are know what they are doing, know that they are hurting their victim, and have the power to stop it but are still ruled by instinct. In many ways they’re worse than the lesser narcissists because they choose to continue"
"One of the terms HG Tudor uses is the “lesser narcissist”, alpha and beta. The lessers are low intelligence with no control and no self awareness. They are the obnoxious knuckle draggers on the tree. He talks about alpha and beta lessers but I haven’t absorbed that part yet."
"Until one day, months, or years later, they will make a hoover attempt. “I’ve changed.” They will say. “I’m sorry.” Narcs use apologies as a weapon to ensnare you back into their fuel matrix. They will love bomb you again and the process repeats. The pain gets worse every time."
"Narcissists view the world in black and white. You’re either all good or all bad. There is no in between. A narcissist will devalue you, split you black, and disappear if you hurt them. Radio silence. A complete blackout. You will be dead to them. They aren’t thinking about you."
"A hoover, like the vacuum cleaner, is when the narc tries to suck you back in. Once a narc has ensnared their victim they consider them their property. Forever. They know just the right buttons to push to bring their victim back into the fold, until they get out and stay out."
After the love bombing stage there is a prolonged period of devaluation. It is here where their victim will scramble to get back the affection from the narc from the love bombing stage. That affection is the means for their enslavement. It’ll never return unless there is a hoover
Gaslighting. I’ve done it. It’s been done to me. A narcissist or a BPD with narc traits want what they want and when caught they will lie and distort the truth. They may even believe their lies. You may think you’re going crazy but they excel at manipulating reality to their end.
evil thrives in the dark and so does ignorance
I keep most people at a distance you know this is true because you are at a distance as well
"""You would walk into a room without saying anything and look at everyone like you were looking through them. It was like you were searching for the right words to say in order to see how much damage you could cause."""
"“I think writers are the most narcissistic people. Well, I mustn’t say this, I like many of them, a great many of my friends are writers.”  – Sylvia Plath"
I may continue this later but I’ll let you digest it for now. Watch the videos. That’s my source. I find them to be the best on the topic.
If you are the victim of narcissistic abuse I would recommend the video series by HG Tudor I’ve linked below. It’s a quite extensive series.
A mid range or greater narcissist will have control over lesser narcissists and use them to attack victims that have stood up to them. These are called flying monkeys. The lessers will dog pile their targeted prey. It happens daily on Twitter which is a narcissists hunting ground
The narcissist will play their intimate partners and sources of fuel against each other. This is called triangulation. It’s a heartless manipulation technique where a narcissist will try and control multiple fuel sources or intimate partners by pitting them against each other.
Borderlines have their favorite person but narcissists will have multiple sources of fuel through intimate partners. A primary source and secondary ones. The primary may be a spouse or girlfriend. A best friend also works in a platonic setting.
Sex with a narcissist is mind blowing but they are not after sex. Sex is one of many weapons in their arsenal. It is a means to and end. It is the most effective way to get you hooked so they may have the supply they crave. They will be all about your pleasure as they feed on you
"A narcissist’s charm is irresistible. Flooding their victims with attention and adoration, known as love bombing,  it never lasts. The narcissist will eventually withdraw this level of affection on some level leaving their victim to play emotional catch up and conceding ground."
"A narcissist is a vampire. Instead of blood they feed on psychic energy. It is the fuel they crave. Negative and positive emotional states of their victims taste equally sweet. Whether the fuel comes from smiles and laughter or tears and anguish, they feed. Hungrily consuming you"
I notice the pain in your eyes and your smile betrays your soft edges. You’ve been hurt or are hurting. I’ve been there. I know what that feels like. I understand.
the way a monster loves  is through intense orgasms while feeding off that energy
in harms way
the devil is only that part of you that grows tired of eating shit
there is no pain  there is just the darkness and the cry of the ravens
A little morning music for you. I’m about to switch to something heavier for my evening.
I’ve tried to remain positive throughout this pandemic. Some dry humor mixed in with absurdities. Sometimes I write beautiful things. Sometimes I write grotesque things. I like to have fun with all this even when I’m serious. I did it for all of you. You keep me going.
My followers are the absolute best. I love you all. I try to make sure you’re entertained.
so much has happened so much to talk about so little time
I'll stop frightening you now. I'm kind and generous in real life. I exercise my dark mind here.
Ironically by going to war.
I've changed as well. I found some peace in this life.
We are not demon possessed but would be much cooler if we were. If you have been on Twitter for any length of time you may want to check out this video if you are entangled with anyone here.
"The world is our playground. So are the stars. We are lucky to exist inside our time range. We have an opportunity to experience awareness for a short time. We are the universe experiencing itself. We belong here, breathing. Experiencing. Wondering."
Excommunication is the ultimate splitting black and radio silence by organized narcissists.
The Holy Narcissist

I came up with that and realized it's based on a quote by the poet Hesiod. Nothing new under the sun I suppose.
everything in moderation especially moderation
I'm strange. That has always been an issue when dealing with boring people.
I live by this.
I've never done safe. I've been hurt but it was all worth it. All of it.
The benefits of freedom is you can talk to anyone anytime you want or you can talk to no one.
Don't overthink this shit too much. It's twitter.
I struggle too so I try to channel negative energy into something positive
your image of me is just a reflection of you

I know well enough what to leave alone.
I remember your dark places
if you’ve ever done acid then you know what a mind tastes like
four fingers deep and short of a milestone
fingers and mouths and tongues and you and me mixed together dripping down your thighs next to a window with rain cascading down it
I would eat your pain and nurse you back to health with my fingers and tongue.

"The girl in the scene is Cindy Morgan, Townes’ then girlfriend. She went on to become a famous actress and appeared in movies like Caddyshack and the original Tron."
A powerful scene from the 1975 documentary “Heartworn Highways”. The intro piece is from Guy Clark. This is Townes’ first song he ever wrote. I also recommend the documentary about Townes Van Zandt “Be Here to Love me” even if the music is not your style
"And this one!  ‘Well, I used to wake and run with the moon I lived like a rake and a young man I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds My laughter the devil would frighten’"
I hate to see people trapped inside their own mind.
you must love debauchery
Regarding her...
I wouldn’t change a thing.
you be you I’ll be me  perhaps we can walk together  for a little while
My personal favorite from him.
One of my musical heroes. I owe a special person many thanks for introducing me to his work.
I’ll tell you the literal truth and let you find your own way to hell.
"If you would like me to continue I could discuss gaslighting, splitting people black, love bombing, flying monkeys (lesser and mid-range narcissists under your control), radio silence, no contact, fuel and appliance. I see many narcissists here. Some pretending to be empaths."
I would never survive another you.
I’m seriously considering traveling the world when I get out of this place.
I’ve given you something to read. Something raw and honest. It’s late here. I hope you have a wonderful day and if that’s not possible I hope it’s at least manageable. That’s all we can really do as humans anyway. Just make it bearable enough to survive until tomorrow. Goodnight.
I’ve dropped out of mainstream conversation where the fickle winds blow.
"love, not judgement"
I won’t let you fall but I will let you bloom
"get out, stay out"
she exists in fragility  I’m a brute
her heart is a storm at sea
I always imagine my hand or a belt around your throat in my mind. The conversation comes later.
I’m not a domesticated animal. I’m not about a domesticated life. For me it’s crazy all the time until we burn out. There is no fading away.
"love is not a battlefield, it’s a garden"
"The Crucible, but 2021. People never change."
All the other devil accounts do their thing. I do mine.
"It’s even worse for me. I’m not only a self aware narcissist, I’m dark triad and I score very high on psychopathy, Machiavellian, and narcissistic metrics.  I’m literally the devil. Knowledge of this fact is why I made this account. You can’t help but love me but I’ll consume you"
When a narcissist of any degree tangles with a Borderline they get destroyed. The Borderlines are out of control and the narcissist is powerless against them. Borderlines are too chaotic and nihilistic for the narcissist charms. The narcissist will eat empaths all day long.
Lesser and mid range narcissists are just terrible. Prone to outbursts of rage and are manipulative. They are not self aware. They would never admit their condition nor are they capable of understanding. They destroy lives. The Greater narcissists however...they are something.
I see a lot of hatred toward sufferers of Borderline and Narcissist Personality Disorder but I find that is an archaic attitude. Certainly non-self aware cluster b types can be horrendous but they have a disease through no fault of their own. Yet the witch hunt exists.
a heart like a clinched fist
I’m incapable of any real human emotion but I’m intelligent enough to know how to act in any situation and mimic empathy. I value people but I don’t feel a thing. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to. It means I can’t.
love me if you must
"the clocks don’t move until they do, then they lie about how much time we have left"
to answer your question I wasn’t prepared to change one cage for another
I have no love interests but I’m quite fond of many friends. I care about them on a deep level.
we let the desert hold our secrets and that’s where we died
my strength will destroy me in the end
You’re fine. You’re a catch for some lucky man. Go find him. Be happy.
That’s probably best.
The French press is empty and I’m off to work.  Have a good day/evening everyone. A little piano piece for you.
What do you want? What do you need?
and when we stepped outside we pretended we weren’t here
I thought there would be less strangers by now.
The waiter took us to a lone table. As we sat down I pointed to the line of patrons who waited outside. “I’m respected here.” I smiled. “I see that. Holy shit!” She said. “I’m taking you everywhere.” I laughed and took a sip of my tea. “I’m very respected here among the locals.”
Turkish tea
true loneliness can be felt here expressed inside words spilling from the minds of thousands of souls writing from dark places
I probably won't come in from the wild.
You feel like you know me don’t you? That’s because you do if you’ve read me for any length of time. I’m not just some made up persona. I’m a real person with a real life.
an interactive experience where you become part of the story
There are places that only exist in memory and people whose faces I’ve all but practically forgotten but they’re all a part of me now.
It’ll all work out.
I sing this song in passing all the time. Still.
"love the damaged ones, they need it the most"
certainty is responsible for most of the atrocities in humankind's dark history
"""Hell does not wait for our downfall."""
Lemmy popped up on my morning playlist. Miss that guy.
people as placeholders
love transcends our artificial lines in the sand
they’ll tell you exactly who they are if you would just listen
oftentimes the ones you should fall in love with are invisible but you see them everyday
terrified of normalcy
everyone is out of reach because I am out of reach
we are so many parallel universes doomed to observe and want but never touch
homesick for a home that no longer exists
"This album. This. This. This. I’ve been listening to this masterpiece from Peter Gabriel since college. This will take you on a sojourn through first and lands within your mind if you close your eyes, put in the headphones and let it take you away."
leaving these congratulations here for you. I’m otherworldly like that.
deus ex machina
we remember the shards of heaven glistening red on the cold marble floors of hell
never fall in love with dead girls
I’m just going to leave your words on the ground where I found them. Beautiful though.
Swedish Tribal Ambient. I listened the shit out of this song when I first got to the Middle East/Asia.
there are those who have to be with someone no matter what then there’s me
I’m going to pretend those apparitions didn’t come for me.
I accept who you are. I’ll stand by you during your struggles. I will listen. I’ll ask nothing in return.
I’m all over the place. I know this. I just want to live it all at once.
I’m in love with sunsets and the open road. I’m in love with possibility.
you are beautiful in love
Just putting this here.
"when you love someone you want them to be happy even if it’s without you, for that’s what love is"
loss tries to suffocate you at first but its grip around your throat eventually lessens to the point where you once again notice the wildflowers on a spring mountainside swaying in the sunshine
immaterial outside of my world  immortal within it
"From their latest collaboration Album with Aerial Ruin. This one is a departure from their dark and brooding melancholic rage but I find it to be beautiful, harrowing, with plenty of space. Organs, a dark, neo-folk singing style. I really enjoyed it"
people are mostly dead inside
outside of your vision of domestication
permanent adventure
I would probably drown you in my shadow
feel me in your fingertips  close your eyes  breath me in
sexual chemistry is a powerful narcotic
I could feel her energy. She had to close herself off it was so powerful. It was like we held electrified caged tigers under our skin and they thirsted for blood. I imagine we both tore each other apart in our imagination but we are professionals and we don’t shit where we eat.
I miss the corruption and your lawless mouth. I miss the way sin ran down your thighs and how you looked at me like I was something beautiful you noticed for the very first time
I knew everything  I just kept quiet
dedicated to not getting involved
she’s out for a fresh kill but I’ve learned how to survive her
I was here
a distraction we’ve come to rely on too much
a quiet life is not in the cards
at the tail end of my prime
“you can never go back”  ~a lover from a long time ago
“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”   ~Carl Sagan
Some are batshit crazy and see things that aren’t there.
go with real life and leave the fantasy here
split black and blue and black again
some are quiet and notice everything
in my experience I’m never who you think I am
‘much ado about nothing’ and something about devils
it’s all good
“There is violence in your words.” She said as we looked at the nudes she drew.
sometimes you have to take out the knife
the weight of age  the heaviness of loss  this human experience
when they disappear they’re either in some version of death or in love
Metal as meditation.
very few understand my world
He was smiling but I could see tears in his eyes when he was saying “no matter what happens here will will always gather with friends and family and share food.”
I had a local dinner last night with wonderful people and stories that would break your heart.
people want peace and the ability to provide for their families but somehow this is a problem for those who only want power
we laugh when we fall
we laugh because we die
back inside exhausted  goodnight
embedded
this very moment is all there is
the worlds inside dreams
words fall from being alone inside my head
It was the wrong everything.
I’m not judging but I’m not getting involved either.
I walked across the stone floor of the abandoned cathedral and found a dusty mirror behind some curtains among the ruins. I looked deeply into the reflection of my skull and realized I will be always manifest in dreams.
I never abandoned you. I set you free.
Give me a perch with a view to brood from and halls to roam and haunt.
I can be withdrawn at times. I’m hard to really know. I never respond appropriately and miss social cues. Fuck me then.
"it’s a devastating loss actually, I just don’t talk about it"
forever loses its value as time goes by
The devil...
people get up to shit don’t they
she doesn’t want to be emotionally responsible for whatever happens but she needs the sexual gratification
I may walk away from this life someday
some of our masks are fearsome
People are just not good to each other and that’s the way it is and that’s the way it has always been and always will be. I live for the exceptions.
adept at leaving you alone
I know all about the knife you keep just inside your heart.
Living is terrifying and relentless if you’re lucky.
Low tempo sex love hate affairs.
Imagine if everyone was silent. What would everyone read then?
You’ll find love again.
That’s right!
I first came here to read about your heartbreak. I never intended to be a part of the story.
I couldn’t save you even if I wanted to. I can listen though.
I read the saddest thoughts here. I read you.
I'll leave you with my favorite Satanic Irish band. I'll be away for a little while. Try not to get into too much trouble without me.
I'm sure the story is fucked up with shocking plot twists. I would expect nothing less.
A little German psychedelic for the morning in country. These guys are from Munich.
this make believe thing is fun but I wouldn't be able to pick you out of a crowd
nothing hurts and that may be the problem
The god of fuck.
My favorite song on my favorite Bell Witch Album. Excellent lyrics.   “With the river flows the lesser souls of hell So the river holds me as well”
when the darkness is abated and souls are laid bare see the ones who need to be needed  feel the ones who burn on their own
every mind can be a prison
Once you exist you always exist.
"Saw these guys at the Wiltern in LA in May, ‘18. Bell Witch opened for them. Got locked out of the parking garage, so had some drinks and my ex and I had to get the strangest hotel downtown."
Why would you?
Waiting for all of you to catch up.
This is a song about Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death” and has clips from Vincent Price as Prospero.
It’s all make believe. Everything.
some design
"“Visions they come in the night, they tear at your mind Places of horror obscene, they're haunting your dreams People that you never know, are calling you home Faces obscured by disease, but you do what they please.”"
All music today.
"From their 2015 album Four Phantoms, Pitchfork’s number three top metal albums of the year. This video is best on headphones because of the bad sound quality but features the late Adrian Guerra, Bell Witch’s original drummer/vocalist. A dark lament."
"A funeral dirge. Spacious. Dark. Suffocating at times. Painfully slow and deliberate and building into moments of pure rage. A six string bass. He keeps time by twirling his pick. This is from Mirror Reaper, a one song album."
A bass player and drummer. That’s it. This is one of their softer songs but listening to these guys lead you on a journey into the underworld is quite something.
a detached view of the world
moments that become memories  memories that become enshrined  in the notes of sad beautiful music
"By the way, that nazi Luftwaffe interrogator, Hans Joachim Scharff, had a mosaic studio in the US after the war and designed the marble mosaic floor to the entrance of the California State Capitol, the mosaic entry ramps to Disney’s Epcot Center, and the Eagle mosaic floor at USC"
"a combat tomahawk next to some crocs, a pistol by the bed, a rifle in the wall locker, body armor, magazines, a book about a nazi interrogator who obtained information by being kind, beard oil, a book by Bukowski, a hookah, empty tequila bottles, a steel French press, a knife"
"I’m prepared to change my entire worldview at anytime in the face of compelling evidence and have done so often for there is only one thing I know, like Socrates famously said, I know nothing."
suddenly baby grass in the mud beneath the palisade
rain falling onto a hellish landscape
I must write a report but all I want to do is listen to the rain fall on the metal rooftop with music playing softly in the background.
My cult demands 100% of all proceeds go to Non-governmental organizations established to further human rights and protect children. I don’t want a dime from you.
"You’re not buying salvation, you’re buying servitude while enriching your masters."
If there was no money involved in religion there would be no religion.
The living night we want to last forever. The dawn is an angel kissing us awake. In between somewhere lies our truth.
I’m too tired to accept anything less than falling into place.
This year has been hard on everyone. It will take years to fully comprehend the devastating loss we’ve collectively endured. We’ve acclimated to the new normal for to be human is to be resilient. I look forward to emerging from the darkness with you who’ve shared your pain here.
It can be.
You can never go back. The past is dead. Everyone is a stranger now.
I’m just a voice repeating echoes whispered from eternity.
Love is perhaps like a fire that keeps you warm on a cold star filled night. The fire may die but the stories and the stars will live on.
Stay wild. Stay free.
“All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.”  ~Friedrich Nietzsche
I’m going to walk away from this life someday.
I’m not wise. I’ve just seen some shit.
The world is at your fingertips. Didn’t anyone tell you?
If you don’t miss people you’re not human. Don’t think that ‘they’ don’t.
Some of you are really crazy and I love it.
be decadent when you can
Embrace your humanness but do no harm. It’s simple really.
hypocrisy is the final sin
where even free will is an illusion playing god’s hand
Doubt is a virtue. Without it we become insufferable.
Like my coffee and my heart. Good morning.
I hope you enjoyed my tequila fueled drunk tweet storm last night (or this morning depending on where you are). These have become rare for me. All is well. A friend called it and summed it up pretty well.
The world is a rough place and we always seem to double down.
Guilt is extremely profitable for those willing to exploit human frailties.
We beat ourselves up to much. By we I mean you.
The worst sort of tragedy is settling for convenience and abandoning your desires because you are afraid to truly live. If anything this is what’s wrong with the world.
People thought Poe and Kafka were weird.
I don’t really care about you but I do if you know what I mean. I want you to find fulfillment but I don’t necessarily need to be a part of that process.
Embrace temptation. Live your bliss.
If we were meant to be we would be.
I will never know you outside of our words.
"Write for truth, not applause."
I’d read me. That’s why I do this shit.
Your definitions suck and so do mine.
Your vacant eyes and no poetry at all.
Born in the age of conformity where mediocrity is king and individuality is the devil’s influence.
I fall in love with a smile or the way light is captured in the eyes of a curious mind.
A toast! To the passage of time and the forgetting of lost love. If you do it right there will be many.
People are more important than differences of opinion.
My evening moon is your morning sunrise. My drunk poetry is your facing of the day with a few cups of coffee and bills to pay.
My daughters are young adults now but I remember when they were tiny bundles of weightlessness in my arms. I remember how they smelled like new life. Hope. Like darkness isn’t a thing.
Poetry is the smile of a newborn baby or the blooming of the first rose in spring.
The most powerful art captures the most basic aspect of life and reminds us we are mortal.
We make it through this life as best we can. That’s all that can be expected of us. It manifests in a world of colors and varied shades.
I loved that girl. I was mad for her. She was my world. My everything. The devastation of her loss made me crazy. I lost myself in a spiral of substance abuse. I joined the Army. When I met my next soulmate I burned all the poetry I’d written about her. There are many soulmates.
"music, people, and places"
“I don't believe in destiny or the guiding hand of fate I don't believe in forever or love as a mystical state  I don't believe in the stars or the planets or angels watching from above but I believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love and make it last” ~N.P.
experience compressed into a flash of time and the shadows grow long as the echoes seem to be getting farther and farther away

awoke to pitchforks and torches
I focus primarily on the present with an eye toward the future. The past is gone and will never return. It’s more of a conversation piece.
when you remove your mask I hope I don’t know you
I want nothing from you but your presence in this world.
"romantic interests found online shouldn't be afraid of video chat, scammers will be though"
I'm more feared than loved.
"""someday you'll find happiness"" I lied."
"emotional pain is never pathetic, it's a process"
I recently heard a story of two young lovers caught holding hands in a remote area of the country. The village made them dig their graves and stoned them to death. Their relatives finished them off with gunfire. What sort of people murder their own children? There is no hope here
stand against religious fascism
I write in waves and my mind is a maelstrom.
the worst is cold rain and grey merciless skies
Those pretending to be the devil should be verified just as much as those pretending to be Jesus. Religious bias Twitter? Can anyone show me a verified devil account?
Morning stoner rock.
"my unsolicited advice would be to let them go and find your own bliss, there are fantastic worlds to discover in their absence"

The only thing I crave is a swank high rise condo in Vegas with a pristine blue Tesla Model Y performance in the garage with plane tickets to someplace exotic on the coffee table.
Your familiar tells me all your secrets.
I only get to read you between heartbreaks these days.

Some of you are very important to me even though we’ve never met. I care what happens in your lives. I want the best for you.

I’m doing this war thing right now but in a few months I’ll be in Vegas living large. I’m forming a cult. Come out.
I hardly sit here and write for you anymore but that doesn’t mean I don’t love you. I still do.

If I could punch autocorrect in the mouth my life would be so much better. Autocorrect is a nasally simp desperate for attention with an overinflated sense of self and a power complex.

The Army of course had to coordinate with state and local police and someone leaked the op order and blew it all out of proportion. Hillary Clinton was also supposed to be arrested and sent to GITMO according to these types.

I never explain my tweets usually but I wrote this one last night when I was watching Casino and noticed how Sharon Stone's character kept going back to the loser ex boyfriend again and again while risking losing it all. I wrote it then.

Yesterday a Capitol Police officer succumbed to his injuries after bravely defending the US Capitol against an anti-American insurgency. He was beaten to death with a brick. These people are not patriots. They are traitors and should be treated as such.
people that only show you a serious side are either unintelligent or demons
Our souls danced together once and have been intertwined like Celtic knots or the interlacing fingers of young lovers summoning the dawn.

I do love my sins. I relish them. I marvel at their perfect beauty and wear them like armor. I kick in the doors of the status quo and walk inside halls built by the prude like I own the place.  I’m not ashamed. There is no need to confess or bow to anyone or made up king.
does your sins speak forehead kisses
perhaps your life needs more devil and less hypocrisy
I don’t remember when or how she came into my periphery but she is there.

the memories are a part of you now
some hellos are worth the goodbyes
I own every fuck you
it’s easy to hate me because it’s easy to love me  but I love freedom  the most
no path no doors  you’ve always been where you needed to be

Exactly!

I never leave  don’t you know that by now
imagining you  in my hands
ghosts disguised as strangers   knocking on my heart from outside in the rain in the near freezing cold
lies revealed in spaces  between sleep and awake  about things and people  that don’t matter anymore
so many are just trying to survive I will never judge your methods
so I'll be who I am  you be who you are we can go from there

isn’t there an army behind me willing to take my place  surely there’s someone capable of finding your heart  or at least commanding its attention
my dark runs deep
I know what got away  I know what should have killed me
I depend on a few of you to get through the night.
One that haunts me.
I need to put you in context love.
those who are afraid to live are intolerant of those who do
we’re all broken some just hide it well
people are all so many torches and pitchforks fearing what they  don’t have the capacity to understand  the mass of humanity  still being afraid of the dark
they want to silence you  because they fear that  which you embrace

I fell into her like a fever and woke up to a nightmare now her ghost is my demon
there are things only I remember from things lost before the dream changed
the way she stretches her claws and looks for weakness
I have a few realities to choose from.
I tried live inside her once  holding as tight as I could but we are all destined to be  alone with the memories
"“The car's on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides And a dark wind blows  The government is corrupt And we're on so many drugs With the radio on and the curtains drawn”"
I’m a dark motherfucker.
Southern Gothic
"“My church is black, my Christ is cold My cross is pale, all hope is gone... My cross is pale, hell is my home My church is black, my blood runs cold The sun don't shine for me no more  Black is the moon, cold is the sun Sing hallelujah, no kingdom come”"

my words are sins I name and throw into the fire
I want nothing more than to experience your presence. To know you exist is heaven to me. Anything more I don’t deserve in this life.
I like to relive things through your eyes.
"I doubt the sun will ever feel the same as it did when we were alive, together."
embrace the suck
Sunday morning.
reading you makes me homesick
goodnight  I’ve left some morsels
poetry spat into the depths of the void from the edge of the abyss
if they fumble for words they’ll fumble everything else
circle me cross my heart  in crooked lines
"sssh, stop talking let me feel you breathe you in"
the blood of dreams  the bones of memory
be free  be honest  be raw
she tastes of wormwood and green magic
your mouth holds the foundation of creation in its depths and all I can think about is destruction
it’s cold on the perimeter  and dark  but I remember your fire to keep me warm
you’ve just got to hold on  until the fire is done with you
I need to feel your presence  if I cannot feel your skin
and in that moment  when I come inside  time stops and we drown
no one will forgive you me
I can smell your heart a mile away
I came here to disappear
"me neither, fuck that"
I want to be drunk on your eyes damned by your mouth and saved inside of you
they claw their way out  and we call it poetry
I can feel decay  in your smile   the mute  in your laughter
strangely  a tear falls  inexplicably uncalled for unwanted  unheeded
powerless against your fingertips
I see love’s demise  before it even begins
my darkness is a firestorm raging up the curves of your dress
like Twitter
when my truth collides with yours a new universe explodes into being
It’s always better when I’m anonymous but you always find me.
I would lick you from your ass to your chin only to lose myself inside your mouth
sometimes ghosts have knives
I’ve had to walk away too much
sometimes I do get homesick
the shame in our lines the guilt in our words
I’ve been hopeless  I understand
you're all devils that's why you're here
our lines have crossed in time and space
when returning from war with insatiable desires who will temper my steel
who are you when nobody is watching  that’s the you I want to know
dangerous words dangerous minds
another day another explosion welcome to Kabul
tonight the words taste like smoke and ash I would rather choke them down than spit them out
we’ve let the insane define sanity and call it normalcy
Never accept judgement from people who don’t know you. They only see what you let them see.
I have this monster in my heart that devours everyone I love. It has the face of a clown.
I’ll continue bringing the light in 2021. You continue carrying the fire.
people come here to disappear
Everyone be safe. Peace.
I’m in love with like seven of you.
I think if everyone just fucking chills 2021 could be okay
Midnight was four hours ago for me. I passed out nine minutes to midnight and woke up in my clothes. I feel like I’m back home. I’m going to find someone to put me to bed when I get back.
happy new year or some bullshit
you’re all ghosts then aren’t you
those of you seeking go seek I’m here for the eternal moment
I don’t need love  I need understanding
I meant trafficked
all holidays are bullshit when children are starving in the world
truth is a hard swallow
cross your heart and hope to fall for death is not what I need from you
I can afford to leave vulnerability alone
the sound of a smooth zipper separating silk from pale skin the smell of warm fragrance  the feel of hot breath  the taste of darkness
"some of you might be insane but the Devil loves you unconditionally, it’s not your fault"
the background droning of the furies of hell
she would drown me if I let her
the left hand path
I may be many things  but I will always accept you for who you are
I love you  don’t wait
I prefer to be hated  it’s more honest
there are some fantastic people in this world and sometimes you have to brave dragons to find them
"you’re not good enough  happy now?  whenever you’re done feeling sorry for yourself go and find someone worthy of your love and stop with the negative self talk, they should be so lucky to be with someone like you"
bringing in the new year with ash in our mouths and hope in our dreams
Me too
there is one soul out there  and it is hurting
Surrounded by friends and comrades and we’re bringing in the new year with food and drink and laughter.
nobody can save you but yourself but there are those who will walk with you and carry you if they have to
I purposely avoid replying to strangers most of the time even though their pain hurts me also.
I'm always here. I'll always listen.
the ones who say they're fragile are the most dangerous
people who want to control you will hate your freedom

"I wrote this a few years ago. I envisioned a novel made of tweets, like an epic poem. It’s raw and unedited."
I count on it
I’ve always considered this to be a conversation.
I can’t let you get close enough to sink your claws into me but I don’t want to let you get too far away either. Isn’t that some shit.
How do I make you feel?
"I'm not who you think I am, I'm sure of it."
Yes
you are beyond good enough  and I am a fool
I don’t know of any other kind of connection than effortless
reading you made me realize you’ve lost someone important and I’m sorry I understand
your words make me sad
when you're comfortable enough to be weird together
my darkness is sexy as fuck while most of theirs is just weird and creepy
one of my other Afghan interpreters was raised in Kabul and used to be a pit boss in Vegas these are some of my favorite people here
the only circle I care about  is the seventh circle of hell the one with all the writers and the good Tiki bar
embracing your sins is embracing who you are be with someone who brings them all out beautifully
love my dichotomies
one of my Afghan interpreters is beautiful she used to be a dominatrix in New York City and worked the sex club scene I told her about @balaibalan in DC and the sex party scene there war zones make strange bedfellows
we do what we must in this life acceptance of others is a virtue for only they know where they've been
my favorite people are the ones who see past the writing
I don’t have any answers but I see you and may have been  where you are now
fear the evil  behind ingratiating smiles and wild eyes

I’ll indulge your fantasy persona but I want to know the real you which I suspect has much more to offer the world than you think.
you’re the apple of sodom of my eye
come to me a pale form  like moonlight  in the darkness drinking the sin  I pour into your mouth whispering blasphemous  promises of trembling hands  afraid to let go

"Fuck, I have to do today don’t I?"
The year of healing needs strong people to carry the fire.
I have my coffee. I have my wall.
It’s harder than you would think to be a hedonist in a war zone stricken by a pandemic.
The world has gotten smaller and even larger than before.
"I’m not looking for love. I don’t mean to be harsh, but that’s where I stand. Maybe not forever, but right now. I’m looking for friendship, and laughter, and well written words. I care about the lives I intersect with and love to have fun just being here. I love you all. G’night."
Some motherfucker is out here walking on water and breaking hearts and shit by the way they talk about him. I would love to buy this guy a beer.

"Just take what you want from my words and leave what you don’t. I’m not stopping nor am I waiting for you to catch up. I write what I want, how I want, and how much I need."

You’re not real unless we’ve had a pregnancy scare.
I have a lot to say in person as well.
this is the strangest life

Although it’s difficult to sleep when it’s Christmas morning back home I must try. Tomorrow will be a day. I love all of you. Enjoy the magic.

good guy devil is one thing  nice guy devil is sickening  I’ll be back to my usual shit tomorrow
I hope everyone has a lovely day. Share photos. I’m dealing with shit here that made me forget it was still Christmas morning. How quickly reality rears its head.
you can just see loss in someone’s face
coffee the color of my jet black heart
it’s good to be loved  and not possessed
Thank you for reading. I love you all.
I was talking with my interpreters around the fire last night and my favorite one told me about the time a mortar round went right through her room when she was in Kandahar last year. It didn't explode. She showed me the photo. She's got more courage than most people I know.
so can we agree to spread all this goodwill all year round instead of just two days or is that outside the scope of human compassion

There are those who quietly channel their spirituality through one of the established faiths. I have no problem with them. I do have a problem with those who view their faith as supreme and seek to subjugate others with their beliefs. It is spiritual extortion at the very least.

I feel you keep writing
let me hold onto your anger and self loathing so you may be free to love yourself again
I hope you find love or whatever it is that is lacking
everyone focuses on the fall but there is a dreadful backstory that has been buried by history and it would break your heart
I cannot choose to believe I cannot choose to love it either is or it isn't and both are beyond  my control
do no harm

Meanwhile a great debate rages in the halls of power in the US whether to help their people out due to the economic impact of the pandemic by offering to pay them $600. You get the government you deserve.
Galileo was forced to recant the Copernican model of the solar system upon the threat of pain of death for heresy by the religious establishment because his scientific findings supporting the model conflicted with Biblical scripture.
"$1,500,000,000,000 or 1.5 million millions. An unfathomable number really and almost twice the national health expenditure of all of Europe...gone in thirty minutes."
The US government dropped $1.5 trillion last spring to stop a market in free fall. It stopped it for thirty minutes before continuing the plunge. There’s another reason Americans don’t have national healthcare and a multiple generations of debt slaves from student loans.

"Oh that’s terrible, lol! I had to."
you are the fire that burns inside my infernal loins
the Devil is in the typos and grammatical errors
I’ve been here before  the purgatory of wanting  what’s not mine to take
people have always needed their art spoonfed
we must make our own heavens out of the hell we're born into or that were thrust upon us
"you can move on, sure but you can never compete  with memories"
I follow the heartbroken ones
if there’s taking to be done you decide the when and where I’ll decide the how
be the best and worst thing to happen to me and I’ll do the same
see
there are many devils like me but this one is yours
the pain that hurts to breathe the taste of grey and ash of living but not living
forbidden just tastes better
when lovers die
I know how to feel I just choose not to
you're dreams are just as real as the one you wake to
learning how to grow into new realities is a strong skill to have in an ever changing universe
the passage of time is the true heartbreak
moments gone as soon as they appear
I could just slip into you
my infernal mind
eternity is such a drag
I recommend changing your perspective every now and then. Reality is multi-faceted.

“DM’s are the Devil’s candy.” ~@churiascuroflux
I did some cold blooded shit today.
just like you're every character in your dreams you're every character in every reality
no rest for the wicked that's why I look tired in my fleet
the world is so small now that you'll just have to learn to play together  tribalism should perish
hookah smoking Devil
never needed to vanish to not be found
long black hair cascading like fire over her shoulders
she probably wouldn't understand my words but I write them anyway
winter falls and so do we
a life of grey
I was a brilliant light whose absence was mistaken for the void
don't look back too long the sun will burn your eyes
My version of self talk.
intelligence is addictive
do you want me to give you a break for a little while or should I keep going
thank you for reading me
Dark Folk from Finland.  Kuoppa by Tenhi   #NowPlaying
I've had what you so yearn for. I've had it all.
a heart like a fist holding a grenade
you cannot know my mind by the curated words I let you see just feel them like I do
while she lives I shall not love another
I'm not
I want nothing from you but your presence in this world.
coffee with her
I imagine our souls dancing in another reality
I think of you often
you cannot escape a prison when you don't know you're inside one
a manufactured culture brought to you by capitalism and technology as a prison
"“Since man cannot live without miracles, he will provide himself with miracles of his own making. He will believe in witchcraft and sorcery, even though he may otherwise be a heretic, an atheist, and a rebel.”  F. Dostoyevsky  *The Brothers Karamazov"
when an angel is in love it's across time and space you may have known them at different moments in your life but they've known you for eternity
I'm not saying there's hope the Greeks saw it as a curse but there is magic in the moment and moments are eternal
"god is lawful evil, his crimes against humanity are legion"
just so you're aware low EQ people are hilarious to people with high EQs
her soul shares space in many bodies as does mine
um...
you’re the one  sorry about that
true character is measured by how someone accepts defeat rather than how one exalts in victory
human folly is funny as shit
It’s freezing without her though.
all living things are sacred
Perfect! The machinations of petty evil from lesser people never set well with me.
the Devil is chaotic neutral  if we want to nerd out on the matter
my drunk tweets were more coherent
I miss the ones I will never meet  and the ones I will never see again
Nothing that sexy. Too much coffee and adrenaline followed by melatonin.
"I’m just fucking around here until the meds kick in, I’m wired as shit"
The Byronic character part of my @awhiskydarkly story (pinned tweet) inspired this account.
Pretty much a dead ringer.
I’m my own Byronic character.
"mercenaries laying around on sofas watching “Love, Actually”"
"he's one of the most positive people I've ever met an ex-marine, Christmas enthusiast, workout buddy, friend he will be missed"
we have the tools already to save ourselves  we just need to give ourselves permission to use them
"I can't promise next year will be any better than this one, but we have each other and there's strength in that. I enjoy your company."
you've always underestimated me and I've always let you win because you need that I know you well
I can't save you even if I wanted to but I can listen without judgement
I sense a loneliness and pain so great when I read some of you that it breaks my heart. I'm sorry.
I write here with a sense of irony I'm usually laughing when I hit send nothing in life should be taken that seriously breathe
I need to leave someday but wherever you go there you are
a heart at the center of a maze full of gardens and walls
I'm often the first dozen or so followers followed by new accounts. That is better than being twitter famous. That's being essential.
"you  know we made everything up, right?"
imagine the mental gymnastics it must take to dissect all things and sort them into little black and white boxes and place them into the cupboard of certainty
forget the hardwiring set up for your failure transcend and manifest
we all fall a little everyday
I lost heaven for love
such an ugly species really they eat their own
I speak with you from inside your  primate skull
so many thoughts about forever from creatures trapped in a three dimensional prison
thoughts about a sunset drowning by the sea
some introspection couldn't hurt some of you here
my words are about my vanity about dreams that once were and dreams that will never be
quite
a room full of abandoned houses
such a classic fool am I
intelligent people are sad because they can see more  than just the good side of the nature of things
I find you to be very important to me.

my tattoo artist just reached out to me warning me not to get my arm blown off
my real life is more insane than my online one could ever be
I have a main account but I rarely write there these days. This one is so much fun.
french press coffee as black as her soul
wiping the slate clean through the fires of war
"exactly, it is humankind’s delusion that their will is separate from the universe"
I’m not a domesticated animal  this much is certain  fading away seems so pedestrian
goodnight fair people the dawn awaits the banishment of midnight

passion gave way to methodical means of destruction
"stoically observing the complex dance of the current state of human mating rituals fueled by technology and the subconscious need to reproduce in the content here is a curse, actually"
I am the wound.
I process time differently than most.

I’m all about spreading the light.
"charming, as fuck"
I forgot to forget
mine are bodies
she came knocking yesterday
that’s the spirit!
I hope my words soothe your restless heart.
"I hope you found what you’re looking for. If not, I hope you will."
long day
write like you want to push them away rather than trying to kiss their ass and your words will be more honest and raw
this speaks to me
I always have something for you to read when you wake
I came closer to dying today than ever before and I've seen some shit
black metal and black coffee fueled ideation
I need at least a name and a clear photo of your face and maybe a nude before I can even obsess over you. Otherwise it's all so much polite talk over coffee.
silence louder than bombs
never to that
I see you
live your truth but first make sure your truth isn't what someone else told you it is
you can't love everyone only liars say that
self empowerment living one's life fearlessly loving to the fullest for those who deserve it questioning authority caring for nature doing no harm enjoying excesses in moderation enthusiastic consensual sex and having a great time is a damned good message
Nobody will remember you ever existed in a hundred years. Live your life accordingly.
the death penalty is for barbaric societies
I counted 15 impacts but may have heard some of the launches.
Morning view:
hate the belief not the believer unless they are assholes then hate them too
the chalice represents creation the fertile darkness that awaits and ready for untold possibilities
Some of you seem like you're really in love with somebody.
do it
I do what I fucking want  that's freedom
I always dream of this world
no truer words
everything is right where it belongs
I already own you  with a word
make peace with whom you can if you haven't already destroyed them completely
I'm kicking around a story centered on all this but frankly I cannot suspend my disbelief
"my favorite story was when Satan and Jahweh, god, the tyrant, whatever, fucking murdered the family of a man named Job after torturing them to test his faith, that book is an indictment and yet considered a testament to faith, well fuck faith and fuck tyranny in all its forms"
"the old man needed someone to blame for the shit he pulled in the Old Testament and blam, the position of Ha-Satan opened up which became Satan, or adversary"
"Satan is a job title, actually"

going to make the most of the night by lifting in the outdoor gym in the freezing cold and then go to bed a poem

nope
dalliance with the damned  *sext
I can’t wait to be done with this shit so I can go back to being drunk all the time.
goddamn some of you get up early
I never planned on being one of the evil minds that plot destruction but here I am
I write with a bit of irony in mind I wouldn't take me too seriously
Hell shall rise again
devil is lived spelled backwards
show me your quiet places reveal your darkness
"I could love you we could walk quiet mountain paths in Switzerland or wander the city in Paris, DC, Brussels talking about nothing and everything"
I can be a real motherfucker
I'm inside of your dreams protecting you  from me
it takes a lifetime  for people to learn sometimes and some people  never do
"mental illness bashing is the new witch hunt people suffering from Cluster B personality disorders  are disabled, not monsters they should be treated with love not hatred"

when I split you black you'll rarely crawl out of that grave
dogs really love me uncanny really
for her being lost in the darkness was better than being consumed by fire
immune to your spells your petty evil love burn me if you can
most beautiful things in this world have a dark backstory
"you try to fill your emptiness with drugs, sex, music, alcohol but the chasm is too deep and long in the making to feel nothing is despair while pain is feeling something let me feel you"
it was the love of the ages every damned one
me too and it blows
I agree
I do love dark hearts
midnight calls from the cold past concrete battlements a lonely avenue fades in the dark sentries roam in armored vehicles stalking the night their headlights menacing in the fog tall gates open at the end of the road leading to the door of the chamber where sleep summons dreams
humanity needs more light
life passes on with time this darkness too will pass hold on for a little while longer as hard as you can
a heart like a maelstrom at the bottom of an abyss where not even light escapes
one part Hemingway one part Aleister Crowley one part Poe
when an angel falls she falls forever
true darkness is the memory of light
you deserved my silence you deserved my indifference and I deserved your absence
I swallow the pain nightly  the sadness that tingles  at the  tips of my fingers the dreams that have been weaponized against me
you are the ultimate torment from across mountains and seas and forsaken places where hope goes to die
a prison of my own making devoid of light and love sorrow torments my waking moments despair my dreams
all this blood on my hands
I might remain for three years and be done forever.
I'll wrap you in a shroud of warmth and darkness protected safe and damned
someday really means never
I see you I feel you I want you
those mountain wildflowers we always talk about
I never give up on people because people never gave up on me.
we must find the mystery in the ordinary
unhealthy obsessions are far superior to the healthy ones
They took it down. Well they're no fun.
"they’ve led every revolution, won every battle and wrote every story worth reading"
"Nah, fuck that"
Mine too.
dead to me is the new black
keeping my attention is the hard part getting it not so much
you can banish me with a word never to be seen again I promise
"you, on the halfshell"
this is my rage tweet account
we love impossible mostly
I like her mostly with my eyes and dreams
perhaps I should just go live a quiet life somewhere
you've got to be or become hard to kill
I am. All of this.
I never understood this mentality. I don’t subscribe to it.
Me too actually.
I won’t
we can leave it at villain
Oh Devil is that a touch of the feels  that cannot be  it will pass
I can't find the trance tonight the words are fucked maybe tomorrow
fuck authority
I wish you weren't spoken for goddamn
there is a lot more mystery where that came from
give her what she needs however she defines it
Who do you love?
I want to be a bartender when I grow up.
An uncomplicated life is not worth living.
I've done the twitter romance thing. No thank you. Instagram romances are all the rage now. If I was looking for that sort of thing I could find someone just as bad for me over there and so can you.
but gently I imagine
we are all cleansed here through fire and friendship strength and honor forgetting the ghosts of the past walking away from the demons and forging a new future
the days are lonely here when I finish my work early and you are sleeping
Clocks always have a meaning for the artist.
I wouldn't want to be anyone else.

forget Oz fall asleep right here in the prime material plane under the goddess
I’m easy to love but difficult to love  I’d advise against it
I don’t believe in forever  I believe in the immediate I believe in the now
attachment is weakness in my line of work
you’d be surprised at how indifferent I am
I forgot @thedevilswhisky lol
Just know I’m flattered but it’s considered theft and plagiarism. It can get you kicked out of university and make you look foolish. Otherwise it’s a fucking tweet so who cares?
steal my tweets lose your soul  fair trade
art and darkness beauty and pain
This is from my old account. I no longer write here.
you'll have to love yourself for the both of us
my only regret is that I wasn't as kind as I should have been to people who were struggling too
those who understand knows about the darkness that never goes away completely
everything is complicated except isolation
let's get on with it then
I'm full of surprises
"He's been fighting here, doing hoodrat shit as he calls it, since the war began. His adrenal glands have been burned out. He can't sleep through the night. He's matter of fact when he talks about the horrors of war. People become dead inside."
Three days ago we saw a rocket attack explode a few hundred feet in front of us. Three explosions. Pulling out now is a foolish mistake.
"My roommate in Afghanistan was in the special forces. He fell 16,000 feet in a parachute accident. He broke his back and injured his brain but he survived. The Army forced him out at 17 years of service. Three years later and after years of rehabilitation he's back in Afghanistan"
my dear you look like a shadow just passed over your grave
It's mandatory in some instances.
I'm not thirsty I'm hungry there's a difference
when I get back we're never leaving the bed whoever you are
I count on it
the taste of fear  the look of trust
tell me how corrupt you've been I want to hear about your petty evil and pretty little lies
I won't be gentle
let her believe in virtue only to sacrifice it for me  I want all that's hers to make it mine
hold your god close to your breast as I strip your virtue from your bones and trace daggers down your spine
if falling terrifies you  then fall for me
corrupting you with my mouth flood me with purity
"muscle, bone, and heart"
I sometimes think I'm insane and @msbtx is my alter ego. Or maybe it's the other way around and he's insane and I'm the alter ego. (I have so many.) Check him out. I command it.
Hold fast!
EVIL is LIVE spelled backwards
do not harm children
not everyone is worthy of your love but everyone deserves it
do what thou wilt  but do no harm
excess but in moderation
"eat, fuck, seek vengeance"
"self-acceptance, self-indulgence, and self-respect"
I probably should start carrying my tourniquet.
this will be a long dark winter for all of us  stay strong

"Actually it was Christians both Protestant and Catholic who were the perpetrators, not just the Church."
"The church burned 50,000 men, women, and children alive at the stake between the 15th and 18th centuries. They were accused of witchcraft. Please spare me your righteous indignation and shut the fuck up."
when I get finally back I'll have a mighty white beard and long white hair and a body like Thor

what are we doing to each other

the confidence of the credulous
"Civitas, or civic virtue, is the willingness to subordinate one’s needs for the good of the state and was considered one of the most important virtues in the Roman Republic. They would have worn the mask without question."
I must retire to my bed it's a long walk home it's cold and I love you all
it's late the klaxon screams outside my door again the tea is ready too tired to sleep too angry too lost
I'm more comfortable in this version of Hell than I am anywhere else and that's something I must look deep within myself to find out why.
to me hypocrisy is the only sin
every rumour about me is probably true wouldn't it be fun to make our own
young hearts break easily old ones remember
"I can only enter when invited. Otherwise I'm just mist in the trees, a wolf howling in the distance, a raven crying at dusk."

most minds are already chained in the dark
everpresence
there is no free will no matter how you look at it
well said
penetrating your dreams in the middle of the night so I may hold you when you wake

you’ve got to gorge on the marrow for they lied when they said excess is a sin
go for it
"“it feels like I’ve been here before here where the animals lay down to die”  ~Primorodial, The Coffin Ships"
and then one day you are left alone with your darkness forged in chains by lies and truth is your killer angel
some days I’m solipsistic and brooding and I forget anyone else is here while other days I want to hold everybody in a group hug because we’re all in this together
"just forget them, they’re probably an asshole anyway and not worth your time in sorrow"
I want to be in a black metal band
nobody is that special  maybe enough to have a rough few nights of drinking and eating chocolate but not enough to die for anyway
some of you break my heart with your sadness
"a physical, spiritual, and chemical cleanse"
where’s the god who doesn’t want you on your knees?
I only weep when I'm devouring the pure of heart
sociopaths fuck better
a better version
"this place, these mountains, this desert, is an extension of my self destruction"
all the best shit in the world is also what seems to be the least popular
"A fine Irish band. This is the song of the day.  Primordial - ""The Coffin Ships"" (live Hellfest 2013)"
you'll know when I'm in love
how many fallen angels are you
In the beginning there was nothing. In the beginning we were everything.
third dimensional shadows of fourth dimensional words
wake from your dreams love find my star in the painted sky
letters arranged into words words transformed into feeling feeling becoming love love welling from the mind bent on your destruction
her spine is the spine of the world the backbone of all that is
her mouth destroys worlds
her claws draw blood
be the light
your silence amid the fray paints a nice silhouette among the noise  but I’m in love with your shadow
and for some strange reason the lovers who loved in silence went to their graves without uttering a word to each other
as you read the words spilling from my mind it is only us
I feel your presence  like you feel mine
dreamt it was us dreaming something beautiful
goodnight my darklings
let's be irreverent together love the priests won't know
make it through the darkness love I'll meet you on the other side
you feel like sunrise
I have to write devil stuff it's in my contract
sin was always a made up crime so that unscrupulous men could extort money and obedience from the fearful
there are no devils there are just human failings and an unwillingness to accept responsibility
the underdogs of twitter unite
I'm always one.
someone tell me about an amazing book I should read
it's okay to flirt with what once was it's okay to taunt death
you want to believe not that you do or are able to
fearless is the only way to thrive
your art your death your immortality
brooding inside my concrete fortress the choppers take off and land in the distance it's hot today in the Hindu Kush the door is open the music is playing
she’s become nothing but the memory of my fist in her hair she’s become divine
my shadow envelops her completely
her hair cascades over her porcelain shoulders like silk raven honeysuckle dreams and my hands are a harvesting scythe of her ache
the armies of sleep devastated by dawn her legs ache to be entwined somewhere
she stands naked before me though I’ve never met her  she’s ripe for the taking  with just a word
"art, the human condition"
there is beauty in the struggle
all lives are tragic
Quite
the devil is every old soul that is bored and tired of the rules
hell was never fire or ice it was isolation it has always been isolation
sometimes a heart can reach an entropy where it no longer bleeds
penny for your soul
Very much so.
"I owe you something beautiful other than darkness. I owe you the sea. I owe you mountains. I owe you a summer afternoon with windows open and you next to me naked in the bed, the smell of honeysuckle and your hair in my dreams."
Said the serpeant to Eve.
That was from my early @awhiskydarkly account.
"I'm not here to save you, princess. I'm here to lead you into darkness and transform you into something beautiful."

perhaps they never left
I agree
we bide our time in the rat race waiting for one hammer or another to fall
it's all so tragic everything
There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of the law and in the name of justice. ~ Montesquieu
You are the result of madness. You are the result of treason. You are the result of tyranny. You were to be the weapon that would take us down.
She craved the feeling she had in his presence. It felt like danger. It felt like sin.
a bad Internet connection can kill a modern romance
why is it I'm always looking for you
That’s what the devil does baby!

she has love to give  but my heart is a frozen wasteland
I've been loved before and when I'm ready I'll let love in again
the silence is good for now

Just had a nice Thanksgiving dinner with my team and watched a holiday movie during which I took the obligatory after dinner nap. I hope everyone who celebrates has a nice day and if you don’t we’ll have a nice day anyway.
Typing...
Thanks brother!
"Nope, not if it’s a holiday."
if I can’t eat your soul I’ll have to make do with something else
"you can never stay angry at me for long, love, I know this much is true"
"""I'm not even on the doorstep of your soul"" she said. ""You are in your own realm, somewhere  where distance doesn't even matter."""
there is this curious emotional maneuvering many  women do to enslave the hearts of men it is not lost on me
"""I want to swallow your soul"", she said smiling as I imagined being devoured."
high pressure love
"Jesus Christ! I do have a weakness for women who said ""I love you, I kill you."""
Hell never anticipated online dating
people who seem happy all the time are hiding the most insidious of evil
"the best of humankind is hardwired to feel incomplete, empty, and filled with desires they cannot attain"
someday I'll tell you the real story about the war in heaven
It has occurred to me that I don't know who most of you are. You could be maniacs for all I know.
This would have definitely been a drunk tweet night. Damned teetotalers and their control issues.

How do you really feel?
From a few years ago...
new Twitter is all a part of My diabolical plan to rule the world
unapologetically skeptical
astrology is to astronomy what alchemy is to chemistry to what religion is to philosophy to what being afraid of the dark is to science
you’ll drown in my darkness if you’re not careful love
I’m nothing but layers stacked within layers and your projection of what you want to see
I’ll love you like I hate you but more gently
"she made her way through the maze, climbed the dark tower and when she opened the door to his chamber she found herself outside again"
That explains much
dead to me is a spectrum
The Internet is done for today. Excellent!
"my new hot interpreter used to be a dominatrix, you can’t make this shit up"
I never stare at beauty too long lest it burns my eyes
I always know where the exits are
cheers to those of us who like isolation a little too much
the way certain people try to make you feel guilty for being you
I cannot contain the fire once it is released
this moment too will pass
perhaps I should let love in at least for a little while
she has the look of determination in her eyes and the sound of vulnerability in her voice
when you stop asking questions you die
there's nothing more violent than certainty
we're all searching for something beyond us the lost ones claim they've found it
it's difficult to keep up with a beautiful heart that churns like the sea
exhausted is the new drunk
perhaps I've lost my humanity perhaps I've transcended it
my heart is a clinched fist
she said my voice was soothing but with a sense of despair
I pretty much leave people alone but I'm not hard to find.
I don't know you do I? Do I?
I love my freedom more than I hate the loneliness of war
those were a fine people
ahem... *adjusts collar
"wait, we’re still in 2020?"
my beard is getting so out of control I’m starting to look like god

East Coast nostalgia
rage me
why are you sad love?
this song reminds me of the red headed girl who spent most of her time just trying to survive small town life in rural America
Three hours to midnight and it's been a day.
Sorry.
"be careful love, all the crazies will think you’re writing about them"
how many ghosts are you? how many demons?
change is the only constant
Heraclitus once said you can never step into the same river twice. You can never go back but you can remember.
I’ll miss this moment someday as well
you fascinate me
the drive to reproduce is hardwired into humanity’s primitive brain but somehow it’s been turned into poetry
we were wearing masks here long before any pandemic
all tragic lovers have the same soul
I’ve made it to  ‘out of here’ but I still am where I ran to
It’s difficult for me to suspend my disbelief enough to even tweet here.
it doesn’t matter to me how you channel your spirituality or what you call the divine voice as long as it doesn’t matter to you how I channel mine
show me your defiance  make your god proud
touching you would bring about a second war in Heaven
I don’t hate anybody  I try to understand them
There are plenty of other devil accounts writing about devil things. This one is about love.

she's the apple of sodom of my eye
what delicious things does your day have in store love?
The old man has his favorites. Surprised nobody got drowned.
"It’s the witching hour. I’ll dream of you as I drift off to sleep. Sweet, delicious sleep. I wonder what you’ll be wearing?"
I’m nobody you know.
I was always the life of the party in church.
The soul is the symbol of the self. It's a paper ego. It's also an instrument of control by those who use fear to hold onto wealth and power.
"People back then feared death so much they made up stories to assuage their survival instinct, to sooth the thought of annihilation. They were also afraid of the dark."
you don't have a soul to steal love another lie the priests told you
I've worked at the White House for quarterly meetings. I remember one day they wouldn't let us into the West Wing because of all the arguing. lol.
"Imagine if you will being the only consciousness in your own cold universe. You can do whatever you want, change yourself into any form, dream up worlds and destroy them but you can never die. You just are.  Death would therefore be the greatest gift and the greatest lie."
"I was just about to ask you the same thing, love. Mine are on fire!"
I've had some green tea and I'm on a rip!
"Did I mention all this is an elaborate illusion that you, of all people, made up? It's true. This is where your divine dream landed. This is where you pretend you are weak and wretched when you are actually everything. You created the universe. Sorry to rain on your parade."
I'm bad simply because I'm so goddamned good.
do what thou wilt just don't hurt anybody
be free of your prisons follow your bliss
"Life is too short to spend it sad all the time, love. Every breath you take is sacred and sweet and finite."
I say follow your desires. You'll wish you had when it's finally out of your reach.
you never tire of all this yearning? interesting...
that emptiness will swallow you whole
you can't possess other people love but you can be in their life for a little while
some of you will never be happy no matter what
my bed is like a womb right now and it’s fucking freezing outside
"Whatever that something is deep inside that is the essence of your existence, call it the self, or ego, or god even, but it’s you. It’s always been you. It’s fun pretending you’re not god or whatever you call it but not as fun as being the devil and spoiling your game."
you can only love a ghost so long a devil on the other hand...
"humans are still in the infancy of their species, of course they frame big picture things in terms of black and white, good and evil. It's cute."
"people are not a game, shitbag"
this adventure I'm on would be a real shitshow if it weren't for some of the best people I've ever met
I keep telling myself that all this austere living will make that martini slurped from your tongue taste oh so much better
it’s a lazy morning on the edge
everything seems ridiculous except sleep
all I do is dream and plan
The virus went from “I don’t know anyone who has it” to “I don’t know anyone who doesn’t know someone who’s died from it.” Listen to the scientists!!!
I was never the devil I was just damaged
fighting  the  snow
those bones from the past rattling in the wind almost sound like they’re whispering something
"It's not by choice, lol!"
"I've been mostly sober for two months, two days, eight hours and twenty three minutes but who's counting?"
I probably won’t reply or slide into your DMs but that doesn’t mean it’s not real
listening to music and the rain beating the pavement outside my window; scrolling through the emptiness  it’s late here and I’m far from sleep
indeed
we need another enlightenment in America after the last administration
I have green eyes
I write as the actual devil some of the time and as your admirer the remainder but I’m starting to have a difficult time telling the difference
blow off the world and run away with me
I no longer show up in your feed  you’ll have to settle for dreams
I just game it all out in my head until I convince myself it's impossible
life was a dream ago
it’s easier not to trust or get involved
the strange dance of cyberspace
"I'm ""remember when Twitter used to be fun"" years old"
alone in my office on the perimeter in a war zone with music blasting while admiring your thoughts as they scroll across the void that has become this place
It’s quite difficult to be a hedonist in a mask but I would rather everyone be safe.
Once the pandemic is over the world is mine.
Other people aren’t the long term solution. You are.
How is everybody doing?
How is all your DM romance going?
where there’s hope there’s life
Don’t worry about me love  I’m my own worst enemy
sometimes you meet people who are pure light
the concentric ripples of time that make forgetting impossible while memory is an old man weaving tales in the dark
the system is learning us for when it becomes self aware
time both lessens and reveals the extent of loss
quite
dead things that whisper from the past in the stillness of solitude
I miss entire worlds
we are sad about the passing of time more than we are about lost love  they both hurt equally as much
I hope you find what you’re looking for
I’m probably not even paying attention but I care.
random moments with strangers that leave an impression
people can be draining
It’s time to heal.
I’ve had way too much coffee today and the exciting news has me stoked. It’s late and this devil should be going to bed. There’s an insane former Marine who’s going to make me lift heavy things in the morning. Good night world. Tomorrow is a new dawn and we are in this together.
"Sometimes I agree with the old man. Not often, but sometimes."
2020 couldn’t keep its stranglehold forever
look deeper
there are lonely hearts and the ones that feed upon them
an intricate and highly elaborate mating ritual
what is it we’re doing here?
talk yourself out of me
thank you everybody for giving me wonderful distractions
enjoy your life become who you want to be
I’m in a war zone  and I’ve never been more at peace
someday we’ll look back on today with the fondness we look back on every other day we’ve lived  all of them are magic  we live in wonder
there's always more to the story
Glad to see you back.
I’ll tell you exactly who and what I am. I don’t need to pretend.
You can be anyone you want to be here. I always keep that in mind.
"My shadow lurks here, it’s true, but it’s cast from an eclipse of reality."
Many of you are insane.
"""Find your bliss."" ~Joseph Campbell"
There be dragons.
I'm very solipsistic and very much an introvert. I forget you are real sometimes. You'll have to forgive me.
Me too.
the nightmare is coming to a close
I pretend I’m invisible
"you probably have the wrong idea about me, it’s my fault not yours"
adrenaline is my last addiction
get drunk and write it all down
this was fun but no longer holds the charm it once did
all out of beautiful things
distraction is the road to enslavement
Or is it replies are lava? I never know what bullshit control issues people are tripping on today.
DM’s are lava.
Saying I don’t exist is exactly what you’d expect the Devil to say. So if I say I do exist then you would think I was just trying to trick you into believing I don’t exist by saying the opposite of what you’d expect me to say. Therefore l don’t exist.
If you believe in demons and devils you have more problems than I’m prepared to deal with.
I’m the devil writing as a man writing as the devil. Try and keep up.
the illusion of choice
it’s impossible to avoid looking at the blinding light when darkness is all around you  take my hand
after you’ve found yourself we can talk
fathomless amounts
desire is wanting what’s out of reach  greed is getting more of that than you deserve
we forge our own chains  we build our own prisons we torture ourselves  with ‘not enough’ nothing ever is
everyone has an agenda everyone
chasing one distraction after another is the root of our sorrows  we must constantly be entertained  the economy depends upon it
sleep is death’s foreplay
I darken your door every time you close your eyes
monsters in your head are worse than the ones  under your bed
the only real pain is truth everything else is an opiate
be light and fire  make darkness tremble
life is no fun on god mode
surprisingly omniscient  uncannily ever present  typically distant
Once this shit is over there will be orgies every night. My place.
We can dream but the second wave is coming.
I watched the first episode of Lucifer and didn’t care too much for it. Any fans?
Beautiful!
After I visit India and Southeast Asia.
I’m thinking about moving to Ireland after all this.
I’m bored here
Mine too
everything is perfect  everything is exactly how it’s supposed to be  all I do is voice my protest  while nobody listens
lets kiss before I unzip your flesh with my teeth love
fuck tyranny in all its forms
I'm a survivor first an arch angel second
let me take your mind away for a little while
corrupting you trying to corrupt me
I'm sitting here at the end of my day tapping my fingers against my desk waiting for the East Coast of the US to wake up
"and if you're married, well that keeps things simple doesn't it?"
your words are flattering love but I know you sleep in someone else's arms but I'm not one to turn down a compliment
"I'm sorry I had to leave you this way, love but look how immortal you are"
I wear my evil on my sleeve
fragments of hope eroding with the tide dead black water under a grey sky the smell of death in the air the sunset suffocating in the mist
you were caught up inside my darkness now you can never leave
more people on this planet are afraid of the dark and believe in superstition than not and until that changes there will always be bloodshed
It’s late in my part of the world. Until tomorrow. Take care.
I’m my own muse so to speak. I write in dreams and in broken memory.
you have a pretty eye
your smile is my drug
That’s why I read you.
what are we doing here
a road trip into the setting sun the future is the next town on the map the cool desert air rushing in with the windows down while the slick black highway marked with little green signs disappears into the night the song on the radio echoing dreams of nostalgia and neon lights
look away if you can
we become a series of closed doors and smoldering pyres
It has always been   It always will be
when you notice ants acting frenzied  and the sun is orange red in the sky just know I’m Th I king of you
“like”?
where beautiful minds intersect
meeting you in the flesh is one thing trusting your illusions is quite another
imagine the algorithm  designed by puritanical minds
it’s just not the same is it
I have no home here
the gate is closed on the past
I’m probably not who you think I am and I’m definitely not him
"I’m here to fuck your mind, body, and soul"
you’re here because you think about shit and need someplace to bounce the ball against the walls
I love October
you don’t want a Lustmord afterlife believe me
I’m not normal
we’re lucky to be here and over near impossible odds we were fortunate enough to draw breath and experience our vantage point in the cosmos
"I may not be a saint but I despise hypocrisy, I embrace all my sins"
people are important to me  ideologies not so much
yet we strive
nothing is holy and everybody bleeds the shadow consumes everything  eventually
everything is right where it belongs every mistake is perfect and the universe has its own course despite our hubris
I spend most of my time tweaking my AVI
dispel me
write the pain away don’t stop til it’s gone  naming sadness often dispels it
she’s bad news *almost every woman here
notice every detail about me
love can be a trap people should pursue understanding instead
I’m ever-present
Life is always easy for me. It just works out that way. I don’t try.
There are people who actually think winning at life means someone has to lose. Those people are assholes. Avoid them.
confession: I love you all
Aw
I don’t have a muse. I’ve been faking it this entire time.
you’re always just beyond reach or is that me
I’d probably get more engagements if I wasn’t such an asshole all the time
we all want what we can’t have but sometimes we get what is best for us
I’ve watched many of your lives unfold throughout the years as many of you have watched mine
a 2018 afterlife
but I’m not an ambulance driver
my Hemingway moment
we breathe fire  because we must
"I’ve made such a mess of your face love, now you’re a part of my tribe"
I’ve never seen such destructive hands
brutality can be gentle
"survivors have this inner rage, a fire that just won’t die"
"I just want to grab the wine bottle from the table before flipping the table over as I drink from the bottle and throw it against the stucco wall while madly pointing at all of you and shouting “Hold on goddamn it, just hold on!”"
"browsing through old screenshots (from an amazing woman who’s found love, even her texts were poetry)"
feeling broken is a temporary state of mind unless you want it to define you
I may be addicted to freedom
*for entertainment purposes only
I’m the smallest big account on Twitter. It’s just people are afraid to love the devil.
Me: do you want to write this poem asshole?   Autocorrect:
I love love love the small accounts. Less bloviating and more honesty.   *as I bloviate
I’m just kidding. I’m not emotionally available either.
make me feel something  make me feel you
I’m emotionally available but physically out of reach for a while in case you wondered how my year is going.
Nobody ever needs to apologize for trying to survive themselves.
I fucking love this TL!
things are fine on a molecular level
"nothing hurts, love I thought you knew me better"
"Brienz, Switzerland"
winter will be worse than anything so far take care of yourselves
when I find you I will never let go
Stumbled upon something from the past
I follow some people because they are light.
small miracles happen all the time you just have to be looking
I’m not the devil but I should have been
runaway with me let’s chase the sunset through foreign lands
she keeps me warm  even though she is far away
Divine of course
the universe could very well already be dead but I choose not to think that
who is in love with whom
as I observe the dance of love games like so many bones diced in the dark
I’m an acquired taste most do not acquire
In love with her art and the mind that drives it.
I’d crawl out from under your bed for you.
I can’t afford to feel anything right now. Check back later.
I'm her least favorite incarnation.
You’re not who you say you are.
make me stumble  so I know you’re something
she’s out there somewhere  fumbling towards her version of darkness
I knew her as ‘your demon’ but I wanted her words to be mine. She influenced me like no other.
We couldn’t fix what was broken. A love story.
I own everything as well
"Me, hiding. I do love my anonymity."
I’m not one to fade into the shadows
keep dreaming
you’ll find me soon enough but this time it’s for good
I never lie
stop being hell bent for self destruction  let me do it
love small miss small
our house by the sea  your garden  my sky
I’ve loved in fleeting glances and inside the smiles of strangers
he’s probably shit but I like how you write about him
stand your ground make it your own  fuck what people think
a life of waiting is not living
my most lucid state
people are a bad idea
our time in hell
the crooked line and the straight
what is and everything we think we know
I’ll know you when I see you
self deceit is our only true enemy
rise
to never feel a goddamned thing
I ate a wasp today and it stung the inside of my lip in case you wanted to know what sort of day I had.
I’ve grown to like these weird motherfuckers
our most hallowed moment
she must feed  keep that in mind
I get really bored with escapism sometimes
trying to scrape up words from the least inspiring place on the planet I would even say god forsaken
the way sin drips from her mouth
just the dark
eden becomes you
the culmination of our collective insanity memorialized in decaying concrete and crumbling walls
patiently waiting  biding my time  making plans
take my hand
you never realize how superstitious people are until you make an account pretending to be the devil
Scrambling to find some good news in 2020. Anything will do.
it can be lonely on the perimeter without my devils and demons  I miss you all so much
"there will be no more drunk tweets for a while, only insane ones"
this year isn’t over yet
A fearful populace is an easily manipulated populace where the facilitation of fear is used as a control technique. Unplug for a while and take note of your anxiety levels.
I’ve seen what you’ve wanted me to see but is that you?
you’re being manipulated by anyone who thinks they can
"remember when I said don’t be afraid, ever? I meant that."
Look at the quote tweets to understand why I mostly despise humanity.
"Heartbreak from 2,400 years ago. No parent should ever have to lose a child."
what pray you midnight what dreams are you hiding
I must leave you for a while. If you want to reach out to me hit me up @awhiskydarkly I won’t have time to check this one after next week. Follow me there. I love all of you and thank you for your interactions. There are some beautiful minds here. Take care and good luck.
I must say goodbye soon. Until then I want to go one final round.
gardens die too  along with memory
love and fire  destructive forces
the way time flies the way love is lost  is this heaven  or is this hell
every star is dead  every star is a memory
the memory of stars  tantalizing us in the dark
I’m not someone to love  I’m someone to lust after  be the latter
I’m not here to make you feel good I’m here to make you think  and act
living for a sustainable future  means a full scale assault against  ignorance and credulity  lest we all die
I must offend your sacred sensibilities the ones that once justified the burning of people I get it  I don’t want to know you
the source of all darkness  is the knowledge of light
gather your brambles  your branches  your dirt  your tokens your talismans  cards and candles incantations your sigils  your dark loyalties  and cast your spell   do your worst
the stars hold unimaginable truths
I’m my own reality  what could you ever  bring to the table  besides baggage
abandon me before I leave you
I hate people
fuck your god  and your imbecilic  worldview
sleep young lovers  tomorrow challenges your faith
I dream of things  that come to pass even though I’m a  skeptic
Probably blocked as well. Good. Fuck them.
I’ve lost about fifty followers this week! Ha ha hah!
I’ve never cared about your approval but I’ve always cared about your dialogue.
“Under God” was not put in the pledge of allegiance until 1954. We’ve been fighting against a theocracy ever since.
sex is the number one casualty of 2020
Death is mercy
the devil is not so popular in a repressive theocracy as he is in a freedom loving republic
Twitter is life  and life is tragic
Lol!
I’m mostly safe for work
I was pretty vocal about my opinion that humanity was a bad idea
god only wanted missionary style but I snuck in orgasms  it was a game changer
I care little for games people play
life is more complicated than we’re programmed to acknowledge
anyone ever wonder why the most powerful being in the universe blames his failures on his number two?
Current song
nothing satisfies  until we bend boredom to our will
a life well lived must include contemplation
I never kill spiders
a fly landed on my thumb it let me examine it as it rubbed its forearms together  the iridescent sheen of its body its translucent wings and bulbous eyes what a magnificent creature  one of the apertures of the universe   channeling Alan Watts
this blood never washes off
I genuinely care about people.
nothing satisfies  show me something interesting
The fourth year of a five year binge.
every word should do some damage
you can’t claim to be raw without cracking the figurative skulls of narrow minded people
I just happen to be well versed in religious philosophy and the devil was the most sympathetic character in Christian mythology in my opinion.

This account was supposed to be about Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights but you wanted the devil and I’m here to serve.

It has the best dive bars though.

I’m no Messiah. I’m the devil. There’s a difference. You must decide your truth on your own.
Free will demands great responsibility. I doubt any of you understand it.
I’m here to shake your confidence so you may find the truth.
So are you.
I’m god.
The crutches we use to limit our greatness.
There is so much wrong with the society we’ve allowed to be.
This is all about conversation. Both consciously and subconsciously. I feel alive here.
my tongue is a rapier
The devil is all fine and dandy until you hear what he has to say.
I’ve bruised egos here but the ego is what’s wrong with the world.
you’re a good person  humanity should celebrate your kind
of all the knives  you chose that one
The truth is out there.
Trust no one.
Most people aren’t trust fund kids.
I have a very uncomfortable perspective.
We delude ourselves about everything.
Nobody survives anything. Life just prepares us for death.
I’m the devil when I’m too intoxicated to be eloquent.
This is the account where I talk to people. It’s my favorite actually despite my pretending to abandon it.
There is no pain. There’s just nothing.
I’ll be the devil for you.

I’m really worried about my youngest.
My daughters are fire. They’re something I unleashed onto the world.
I’m kind but I’m a ruthless bastard.
That apple didn’t fall far from the tree.
My daughter was assaulted while sitting in the passenger seat at a gas station. Her assailant opened the door and she took her punches before wiping the ground with her attacker. At a 30 pound disadvantage she slammed the girl’s face into the hood of an SUV leaving blood stains.
I'll be over on my main @awhiskydarkly for a while.
I’ll throw some shit your way on occasion but I’ll take my entertainment elsewhere.
every word wasted here is metal on metal
I’ve never mastered cliché or banality.
"I don’t see the point of writing here any more. It’s a colossal waste of time with little or no reward. Like sending little notes in a bottle, never to be seen again. An SOS in vain. Creative masturbation to slack jawed applause. I do it anyway. I don’t know for how much longer."
the only thing that really matters is strength of mind and willpower  that’s what carves a place in the world
If you can’t be the baddest motherfucker in the room you better be the most intelligent. I found it best to be both.

I’m not here to find love. That’s what real life is for.
If you unfollow me you buy a ticket to hell. It’s a breech of contract.
canned octopus in Spanish olive oil over rosemary crackers with a dank hazy IPA
“I think there are more than one soulmate.” She said.
I consider many of you friends even though I have no idea who you are or how many of you are actually you.
regarding normalcy I see cracks growing  into fissures
Governments are bullshit Religions are bullshit War is bullshit Judgement is bullshit Money is bullshit Jealously is bullshit  Greed is bullshit Hate is bullshit Racism is bullshit  Violence is bullshit  Hunger is bullshit Ignorance is bullshit  Bigotry is bullshit
So what’s the point of it all? To have as much fun as possible while doing as little harm as possible while we’re here. Anything else is bullshit.
‘Do the best you can with what you have’ should be a commandment
I’m irreverent  that’s sort of my thing
every time you unfollow me an angel gets her wings back
my home sounds like an aviary in the morning
Who wants to read my cards?
deeper into the forest
3 am Twitter sucks
I’ve met seven people from here in real life. You just don’t know me. I’ve gotten mixed reviews also.
I’m listening to the boomers at the next table over spreading misinformation about legionaries disease and dirty masks. Americans are so fucking stupid.
Where first? Spain? Italy? Thailand? Berlin? I’m serious. I’m not coming back to the US once I leave.
I’m going to just wander the earth like Jules in Pulp fiction.
Just be. That’s all I require.
"At my ex’s while she’s at work stealing a beer and talking with my youngest. Sorry, I’ll get more. I’ve had a day. (She reads this)."
All women stalk. It’s nature.
"“When you drank the world was still out there, but for the moment it didn’t have you by the throat.” ~ Charles Bukowski, Factotum"
I’m hiding in plain sight.
I hate reading my shit in the morning.
I’m not trying to get laid I’m trying to change the world
"I not only stand up for what I believe in, I fight for it too. I’m highly trained."
It’s time to pick sides
Resist
"god and I divided up the universe  he gets all the plagues, natural disasters, floods, diseases, and Republicans, while I get all the orgies, all the sins, cocktails, and sunsets on the beach with nice bottles of wine"
my tweet storms are locust plagues
meet me somewhere ancient
my words explode every few days
our bones define us
my eyes are black
know thyself  be invincible  and know  when to let go
I write like I’m holding on.
If you make it to dawn you dispel me. Then I’ll make you coffee.
I’m shy
Big dark lord energy.
"What even is this account? Fun, that’s what it is. Debauchery. Abandon. Philosophical. Political. Wanton anything with moments where I tell you I hate you while admiring your smile and the way the afternoon sun reflects in your eyes. The way your laughter makes me cry."
I happen to love angels. We are literally kindred spirits.
my hands know how to win battles
the anyones who’re left are picking among the ashes of the nothings and the left behinds
fade me
How on earth did you get inside my dreams?
"I don’t get too much into my true struggles, just the ordinary ones."
Thank you for sharing. Naming evil dispels it.
everything’s better when you live in a forest
Your eyes look like they’ve seen some shit but are upbeat despite it all.
major government policy decisions that happen in bars
medical students from banana republics you play darts with in bars
the truth of old men you meet in bars
you’d be surprised to know who I am when that final mask is removed
So writing for vacant minds and empty spaces is enough for me.
I write exponentially more than the average attention span of the average person and exponentially less than enough to preserve my sanity.
who could ever love my wondrous and chaotic mind?
I have the highest respect for Robert Evans and his coverage of Portland. His podcast “It could happen here” is nothing short of brilliant.   @IwriteOK
Herman Melville died in obscurity. So did Vincent Van Gough. So did Poe. So did Plath. So did Berlin. And Kafka. So did Keats. So did Lovecraft. What does that tell you about applause and  human nature? It means popularity is vacuous and ignorant and doesn’t stand up to history.
I’ll speak about the unspeakable.
my dreams are dust covered streets in Vegas and abandoned libraries
I’m just the salt of the earth who made it. I didn’t forget where I came from.
I’ll shatter your peace if it was built on the backs of suffering.
Autocorrect is as powerful a nemesis as Moriarty was to Sherlock Holmes. Take your small victories corporate elite. I’ll win the war.
I’ve seen most of the facets of human nature and just so you know I hate most of you. There are gems that are the exception. You have my love completely.
the world is my abyss
political twitter in the US is now a patriotic duty
the working class being those who are being fucked every day of their lives as the social safety net is being dissolved for the benefit of billionaires.
the media protects the ruling class from the working class
the media protects the masses from the raw experience
I’m not only willing to sacrifice my privilege so others have a place to stand. I’ll even fight for your place to stand.
*a poem
The rich became rich off of the backs of the working class. Now they exploit differences between the working class in order to keep the focus off of them and the kleptocracy they’ve created. There’s a class war happening. There’s democracy being dismantled. Pick a side.
life was pretty cool before media manipulation turned working people into hate machines
you don’t know me at all I’ve just let you see what I wanted to let you see
good luck
proving me wrong is my kink
I can be wrong. My best views on life came after someone had better evidence than I did in a debate. That’s why we talk rather than dictate.
Hopper’s eyes looks like they’ve seen some shit.
Now look at Dennis Hopper’s eyes in this photos I just happened to run across. Sad. Contemplative. Wise. Remorseful. The light and love crowd do not have these eyes.
"me, in a nutshell"
in my experience the light and love crowd are hiding something heinous
You don’t have to relive your trauma with anyone. There are better ways to love.
"“I am wary of the whole dreary deadening structured mess that we have built into such a glittering top-heavy structure that there is nothing left to see but the glitter, and the brute routines of maintaining it.”  John D. MacDonald, The Deep Blue Good-By"
I’ve fucked plenty of shit up
Toss anything you’ve imagined reality to be out the door.
we all need someone  to get us through the chills
I’m not so unreachable anymore.
everything is deliberate  well thought out
crazy like a fox
materialize then
that’s a respectable mask
love someone enough to wish them happiness without you
I get crazy sometimes it’s part of my charm
she wanted normalcy I wanted glory
my world  is not your world
will there ever be anything  beautiful again
people come and go there is no shortage of people
so much depends upon  a red wheel barrow  glazed with rain water  beside the white chickens  ~William Carlos Williams
when the people sleep the demons play  the devil plans
“wir haben angst und sind allein”
the first thing I’m going to do is get lost in an art museum once the all clear is announced
I’ll toss my “like” into your fire why not  it means nothing
I consider your existence beyond the follow/follower dynamic
the world misses us
my prophetic dreams have ended
I can be so beautiful at times
hold me with your words
I left my laptop and my gun at my ex’s place but didn’t forget the toilet paper
eyes that remember a lost world
I keep telling myself it gets better also
I see the cracks  at the edge of every  smile
just scrolling  watching the faces roll by  the words melting into nothing
I’ve been in this desolate forest before
people are fading into the shadows
"god, can you imagine living forever"
the sudden din of silence  and abandoned rooms
I’m willing to do what it takes
No
Hold my beer
"Us, irl"
until the very end of us
I can be a lot  and often am
"If I had a faith it would center on discourse about the nature of the divine. No judgement. No guilt. Just a desire to know the infinite from a perspective of all the traditions. That’s not what organized religions do. They dictate, judge and harm. Mine would heal and understand"
The devil would be telling you that you’re eternal and death is an illusion. Only the religions of the world capitalize on the fear of death. It’s all profit from them.
"Just hold on, the sex tweets are coming. Pun intended."
All sycophants fail to live up to the visions of prophets.
Please tell my ex or my daughters this fact. I’m the post office guy.
All religions are bullshit.
Don’t bother being a satanist. They’re  hypocrites too.
You’d probably have to sell your parents out to love me. I’d probably hate them anyway.
I live by the second largest city in the US and there are no hot twitter vixens nearby?  What kind of theocratic good clean Christian fun is that?
Americans are lame.
I’m the sum of teen angst but the adult version with all the responsibility of people and shit.
"Whew, one less victim."
"I know, I know, I don’t play by the rules. I never do what you expect of me. I never write what you want to hear. Have you considered the possibility that I write what you need?"
"People do have their egos and sense of self, however misguided that is."
"My youngest daughter wants a bunny so bad, I can’t even imagine one of you with whom I was romantically involved with killing it and putting it in a pot, but hey, that’s twitter romances in a nutshell."
"My type is dirty and loyal  you know, my mirror image"
If I didn’t have daughters I wouldn’t give a fuck.
I don’t want power I want you to be empowered
"Have some passion about something, anything. Never die in silence. Never let them win."
Did anyone understand Van Gough? Kafka? Poe? Berlin? Fante? We abandoned their genius like we always do while praising convenient mediocrity. Most great artists die alone. That’s the way the owners want it. To silence the voices of real people while exalting fantasy and bullshit
By my calculation 66.6% of the world are complete morons. By my twisted logic I should only have 1300 or so followers. Click unfollow or block. I’m carrying too much negative energy.
I crush my bluebird with my fist every night but he’s always back in the morning
I crave all of your hearts  bleeding the broken memories beautiful upon reflection  like a pool in an abandoned garden amid the lillies and the fireflies
woke up one day damaged to the betrayal of a lifetime of fond memories
everything is grey except for those who died on the hill for them everything was black and white
The idiocy of people are a part of a greater evolutionary process. Humanity has always had a built in self destruct button.
we must wake up in the morning breathe have coffee breathe listen to the birds feel the sun on our face  and see what the day brings  until it doesn’t anymore
"I can’t promise we’ll make it love, my reassurances have become lies and false hopes"
take people for granted  they’ll one day take you for dead
we’ve lost a world and gained a jungle
everything tasted better when I had nothing
you have to cry a lot to be my lover
I’m not sure I want to give you up now that we’re on the precipice. I’m not sure letting go looks much different than the void.
"It’s like Bukowski’s Post Office, but it’s FEDEX. Maybe that should be the third novel."
I catch this aroma of weed saturated books in my humble place tonight. Weird.
This speaks to me on a desolate level.
I’ve become this thing. This instinct. This killer. This nothing of a human. I need to ease off the throttle.
Let people go when they need to go. Let them manifest. Let them thrive.
Decades ago I faced the same unknown I face today. Back then I had you. Now I have only dust and memory.
I know you. I know your eternal self.
I need complete isolation  free from the chatter of restless minds  in order to discover the infinite
He is
attractive woman tweets hundreds of thirsty replies follow  get some self respect  Jesus fucking Christ
I think I’m going to create a comedy account. Maybe a meme page on IG. I don’t know. Keep shit spicy. Wait! This is my comedy account.
loathe me or love me remember I was here
a golden honey morning
These people we love don’t last forever.
Cult leader was my first choice on all those career assessments back in college.
the need for validation is a lapse in spiritual self awareness but we should be kind to the seekers and the lost
"Sex is a fraction of the total human experience. It’s a means to attain enlightenment but is often conflated with solipsism, egoism, hypocrisy, self doubt, and manipulation. Sex is as much of a spiritual experience as it is a physical one. More so even. Yet so many weaponize it."
"I really am the devil. Such an unfair term for one who would show you what true freedom tastes like. Freedom without the yoke of orthodoxy, dogma or myths forced onto the minds of fragile children. I’m a victim just like you. I ascended from the slavery of fear and superstition."
I never said I wouldn’t challenge you. Make you uncomfortable. Make you squirm. Make you think. Make you feel. Make you grow.
All my tweets are sex tweets.
"“If power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, then the omnipotent creator of heaven and earth must be the most evil son-of-a-bitch who ever lived.”"
Angels have their worth but they work for a tyrant.
there are no demons or devils other than the stupidity and hypocrisy of the average human
No more typos tonight
All so called sins will set you free. Once you abandon artificial restrictions you can manifest into who you really are. Infinite.
Great album
I miss my demon.
On a serious note my heart goes out to the people of Beirut. What a horrible tragedy. Someday I will drink tea and dine upon your shores.
I slept through the alarm on my doomsday clock.
"You’ll have to settle for drinking wine out of my skull when I’m gone love, I’m a busy man."
It’s a good night for witches to be in the forest dancing for the goddess.
"I love how my unconsistencies leave you silent. My mind is a rabbit hole, come on in"
She told me she was leaving and that I should too. I probably should have listened to her but here I am still in the world of intellectual masturbation.
Feels like that sometimes
I feel like I at least owe you a cliché or two
"lost two on that one, lol They’re like “peace out”"
"Intellectual, freedom fighter, musician...ok, not a musician but a music aficionado"
My next house will have a ritual altar next to the dungeon.
much superior to the Karens of Facebook
"Ahh, the mad bad crazy women of twitter..."
Beautiful
I can’t be for certain who any of you are. I’m heavily stalked.
Dreamt I was being stalked by a T-Rex on a tropical island. I tried to hide and be very still but I died in my dream and woke up.
I’ve been waiting for you
I will never go peacefully into the night
Remember my roses  remember them goddamn it
my psychopathy knows no bounds
I’m strong by default vulnerability is my Achilles heel
You should be able to say it anywhere.
I reached out to the people I know in Beirut. No word back yet. There is a time zone difference. I’m going to visit someday. See what was once the Paris of the Middle East.
what dirty filthy things will you do for me
your control is yours to give  I’m merely asking
drown me in the oblivion of your thighs the purgatory of your mouth the depths of your eyes  the want of your need
"Me, every night."
Listen to them.
Only you have the power to do that love.
I’ll darken your door someday
Bad governments depend upon good citizens. We should be burning shit and breaking every law we can right now. I suggest starting with sodomy.
I always thought guardian angels watched over me. I realized in adulthood they weren’t angels. They were demons who wanted something from me.
what do you do when you’re in a vat of boiling water and there’s a storm coming?
I’ll be up here in my fortress my mountain retreat brooding   playing with my organ.
My best creation was destruction.
You see those assholes wrapped in the flag? They’re not patriots.
beak some rules be disobedient
"I know, I know, I keep being raw"
good Germans enabled the murder of millions 75 years ago and good Americans will do the same
"good people in the past have allowed atrocities, I’ll never trust them again"
Do your demons ever let you go love?
"I’m not easy to love, I whisper to the bones."

“a crack in the window is a crack in the sky”
I make going to hell sexy
I’m bad
if your soul was a pair of panties  it’d be around your ankles
look at all you wonderful people with real lives and real hopes and fears  how kind of you to let me peel back your mind and take a peek at your soul
tonight I write with stoic indifference
kiss my skull ring show your fealty
I think you’re right. I’ve read some scientific data on the subject. These are advanced creatures.
I’m not accepting anymore followers
you get used to insanity but it should never be normalized
never be a good citizen  for a bad government
villain core
I have a wonderland to attend to  in my dreams  goodnight my lovelies
I know. I’m an asshole. I just want to make you uncomfortable in your preconceptions so you may grow.
"you can keep your live, laugh, love in your suburban hell with your husband who is cheating on you and your friends who hate your pathetic play for conformity."
most people just don’t understand
I’m too weird for average  I’m too much for mediocre
I hate being intoxicated  and none of you are there
I’m political  I feel  I judge I accept judgement  I forgive  I love  I admit mistakes  I’m open to evidence  or a superior argument
I’m of a different sort of violence and duty  of selfish adventurism
I wake alone this is my lot but I dream of legs and eyelid kisses
wake with me forever
unconditional love  that’s where you want  happiness for another  without concern for yourself
turns out love isn’t selfish at all
who do you want at your deathbed that’s who you should love  that’s your soulmate
calm my thoughts put me to bed  wake me with kisses
hold me  let me sleep and  wake next to you and rub your legs in the morning  before I make you  coffee
dance for me bring me wine
"‘Oh, my beloved Tania How I long to see your face Photographed in fifteen second intervals In a bank in San Leandro A Polaroid of you, Cinque With a seven-headed dragon In a house in Daly City Don't be sad, my beloved Tania’  ~Camper Van Beethoven"
time stamped somewhere between dead and darkened doom
let me hate in peace
“like everybody else” is just pathetic
"I know, I always fuck it up. Remember my roses."
“My friend thinks you’re hot. I told her you’re probably waiting for someone. I told her maybe not.”  I hate when people do this shit. Leave me the fuck alone.
flowers always bloom amid the ruins
"I really hope I offend you someone needs to kick the chicken coop, someone has to get you out of your shell"
these words were written before a live virtual audience
my tongue is a rapier my mind is a mortar
pretend to hate me feign offense  righteous indignation I know better  I know you  “thy lady doth protest too much”
I know
broken people are useless
I am the wall.
Always onward. Always forward.
Here’s one from California
Your silence is terrifying  I wanted more for you
Too hot to drink warm mescal.
Heute ist Freitag is Brute isn’t Freitas in autocorrect.
Some of you on here are fucking crazy.
Ever notice how beautiful eyes are these days?
too immature *swipe left I don’t do dog ear filters *swipe left looks like she’s in prison * swipe left there’s the fraud shot *swipe left  frowning? *swipe left Ewww *swipe left   this one looks crazy (Pauses) *swipe right  MATCH!!!  Me on an online dating app.
I passed out on the sofa last night and woke up at dawn in case you wondered what a rock lifestyle entailed. I feel ripped off.
"I move we cancel the poll. It may be ripe with fraud. Plus I don’t like the results. Remind me again, are we voting to keep or get rid of?"
I’ll make you feel human  at least
You’re all so many what ifs and what could have beens.
"For the record, nobody sends me nudes. They send me their naked minds."
I’m at max follower count. Let’s have some fun.
so mote it be in a sentence
It was my job to identify them and put them in prison.
You see an unsolicited dick pic in your DMs you can know for certain that guy is an unindicted rapist. Block him.
I write for those who don’t get offended equally as much as I do for those who do.
more of god is found in a glass or beer than in all the churches combined
I’m going to tell you right now I’m not deleting my dark erotica account @aphoticlenses that’s the old whisky right there.
I’m him
Those are the only ones I can remember offhand.
The Devil’s poll. Which TL’s go to hell.
I should have just two accounts. A real one and an alt. Since democracy is dying in America I’ll let you decide which ones I abandon.
I make up for at least a third of literary twitter. I’m literally everywhere.
*key word unsolicited
Dudes in DM’s who send unsolicited dick pics are sexual predators in real life.
Sometimes I sit down and talk with you. I just don’t dictate my thoughts. I find this to be an interactive experience. Interactive art.
I say fuck a lot more than I used to
I’ll be unapologetically me you be unapologetically you
With a few exceptions I pair best with non Americans.
and you did too...
There is a very real and very frightening possibility that I am god and that I made everyrhing up and made everything forget so that I wouldn’t feel the pain of my isolation in a dark and cold universe.
love is a luxury we can no longer afford
normal is average and average seeks the average of the mediocre
remember how strange I was  remember bringing me in from the wild how we breathed a life together how you released me to the wild again
our tomorrow’s bloom from the seeds of yesterday
of you don’t write with tears forming at the edges of your eyes your writing is probably shit
careful love we may fall and who wants that
I spend most of my time on an alt fighting the man. The man I used to be. The man who’s out of control.
"Everyone is tripped out. Nothing is normal nor will anything ever be normal again. It’s okay to be concerned. It’s okay to be frightened. Everyday is it’s own war, every moment a battle we must win."
Raw is real.
I don’t write half the dark erotica I was once known for. I suppose I lack inspiration. I do throw you a bone every now and then.
"It’s less that everything happens for a reason and more of everything already happened. Remember everything is an illusion, including time."
"cool, you have mammaries I want what’s behind that pretty little skull"
nobody’s life is that great our illusions are wonderful though  it’s all about perspective
"we wile away the boredom moments of pleasure dusted amid rare, exciting moments framing an endless search for meaning the tedious among us claim to have already found perhaps they have  for me the search is the substance  a curious mind and inquiry the only meaning worth having"
Going today.
We must fight all of us  We must think We mustn’t go down easy
if there is no vaccine which is quite possible you know we’re fucked right? extinction level event  Stephen Hawking gave us 100 years before we needed to find a new planet that time frame has just been shortened
Rest In Peace love.
Why is anyone here? Because we need to be understood or at least heard.
"Thank god for the Back Abbey in Claremont, California and rogue distributors."
This isn’t supposed to exist outside of the small De Garre pub in Brugge.
What’s with this forever fetish?
what say we get weird together
I love this account.
Best drunk tweet ever. Probably triggered the QAnon types. Little do they know it was me trolling them all along.
death drinks tequila
I’m old enough to remember hanging out in a girl’s room listening to albums all night in between fucking.
I’m immune to alcohol and sleep
I forget which account I’m on half the time but one mind drives them all.
entertain me
Primus sucks
I mark your every breath I see your every word I feel your every struggle  for it is also my own
Perfect
the darkest side of darkness
I gravitate to the devil every fucking time
My dreams of a worldwide satanic sex cult is nearing its end.
we may not be able to reason our way out of it
war in the age of Fermi’s paradox
I just had an epiphany  all the world’s problems are essentially caused by overpopulation  think about that for a moment in light of everything
I look back on my life and can truly say I’ve made a difference.
Dreamt of a dystopian future. A pizza parlor at the edge of a nation on the verge of self destruction.
I’m too drunk for adult twitter. I have to maintain some semblance of credibility. I can easily handle the devil crowd three sheets to the wind. It’s my superpower.
I’m extremely vexed.
I try to be decent in an indecent world.
I hate the universe right now.
These are dark times  we will persevere  and there will be gardens and butterflies yet
I am war
no one should be silent  who has passion coursing through their veins
I wish I was forever with you in the falling leaves on the green by the lake at sunset on the ancient grounds of inquiry.
I might not have enough life left after I’m done living to write about anything.
forever is a lie  there is only this moment
"I needed this, LMAO!"
I apologize for not writing panty dropping tweets. I’m sort of busy trying to prevent a war here in the US by peddling my meager influence.
Observe  be quiet  listen
History is against us
forever is a moment
history is not with us
I was a soldier fighting on multiple fronts and I still am
listen to the trees they’ve known us for a long time
the sacred feminine  mothers of humanity  the sacred earth  undefiled wisdom
I’m a man as ugly and repulsive  and beautiful and grotesque  and vulnerable  and mythological  and childlike  and wrongheaded  and misunderstood  as that can be
love my darkness
half a carafe of French press coffee as I sit on the deck taking the morning slowly in a pale blue sky and the smell of pines an empty seat at the bistro table next to mine
the night dreams of us too
the morning is better  because you’re in the world
you’re as safe as gentle rain or the smell of new wildflowers in my arms
I want to know you your dreams  I want to dream your dreams
sleep is becoming more and more her cousin death
and this...
I have no conditions  no expectations  but your soul soothes me among the brambles
"It’s okay, I’ll wake up in the morning and you’ll be gone autocorrected to you’ll be fine"
the sky is not so barren after all
you just know when you see her
Then there’s this.
I’m a self proclaimed devil  I do devil things things I must do   while shrugging off  your ‘decent’ judgment
I could love you without ever meeting you right? Or is that just a fool’s errand?
I might have to look away
apathetic people are easily walked over
Mood:
I’m heavily stalked  I write want I want anyway
Anyone in Portland? Give me a hands up!
we’ll just fight in the kitchen  will the sex be worth it
I wish we could be bored at the same time
It’s okay I don’t need to be here
the garden grows in the shadow beside the ancient stones
that wall was placed there on purpose
the way you look through me while recognizing what someone who’s seen hell looks like
that tremble at the tips of your fingers
the way your smile cracks at the edges
I want to write about the pain just behind your eyes
"too drun...er, intoxicated for adult twitter. I’m all yours. What sorts of deviltry can we get up to?"
there are no flowers in my world
the coyotes howl my laments
I don’t have a place to be  limbo is my home
"I want a country where I’m free to write my bullshit, that’s why I fight"
you’re beautiful  how do you feel about destruction
your catfish account only excites me so far
I know how bad everything is I see the events unfolding   we must hold onto hope  we must fight where we can even if that just means getting out of bed each day the human spirit has perservered  and it will triumph again
I lack insight sometimes
I don’t get drunk but when I do I get intoxicated.
It’s best to drunk tweet here than over on my serious account.
I certainly do have my passions
the future is full of phantoms
the clock is bleeding
I’m finished  everything else will use me up  I have no choice in the  flavor of my destruction
death is not living  I know that sounds obvious  but sometimes the body hasn’t died yet
knowing what I know now I would have explored more Tiki bars
how about a $5 shake in ‘94 dollars
I only deserve your dead flowers
judge me
"a modern day gunslinger who supports human rights, reads and writes poetry, and gets lost in gardens and art museums"
I’m a force for something  just what that is  depends on my sobriety level
I have no past  I came to be in this moment
‘milk white neck’
Poetry never dies when we do.
this is a much happier place than adult twitter
I don’t even know what to think.
I pretend I’m invisible  your voice startles me when you enter the room
I’m strange but would never blow smoke up your ass
waterfalls are how the world bleeds
I should go to bed so I can’t sleep and wake up too early and be a zombie all day tomorrow such is my lot
the world is a horrible place horrible people doing horrible things to anyone they can because the void calls out in the sound of the voice that manifests some past trauma demanding retribution for the pain of life which seems to be the sum of our collective human experience
we’re much closer than our world opinions allows
I’m a real motherfucker but I always try to be decent.
drunk hate fuck tweets aren’t as good as the real thing
Actually I care about all of you but must keep true to my brand  don’t take it personally
I care about less than ten of you in case you’re wondering where you fall in my hierarchy of giving a fuck
I am an exit
I don’t give a fuck who you are  entertain me or get the fuck out
I can’t stand text speech
this is the dark part of life
I’ve lost you goodnight then
The Dutch speak better English than the best American. That’s a fact.
I may not be your brand after all
grammar and spelling is a pet peave of mine that’s why drinking and autocorrect is the devil incarnate
I’m not real  nor are any of us we are just reflections of dreams  and wishful thinking
I don’t give a fuck about your new selfie try being someone real try doing something real
there was once a dream of a people who self governed themselves  imagine that
If you’re not raging you’re a part of the problem
I think when we cut off the essence of ourselves we are more useful for the owners who demand our compliance
have you ever felt what drowning must feel like that metaphor the void
our barbaric yawp is also our last stand
I write mainly for dreamers who’ve succumbed to the demands of the day
keep your sunflowers and galaxies and rib cages and the rest of your clichés we are all sitting here in the gloam basking in the darkness waiting for something real waiting to live waiting to die waiting to be remembered and loved and experienced for that’s what we do
I’m just here to salvage bad choices  to make them relevant somehow  to die with an obscure version of dignity
hopefully I echo in eternity  rather than being drowned  by the void
we’re suffering  we have our world event  I understand  and will until I too  am snuffed out
we may have lost too much of ourselves  perhaps the silence of the grave is wisdom  perhaps the grave makes it irrelevant
I remember when writing here was the marrow not the bone
truth is raw and explosive  that’s how I write
I pretend I’m the universe and you’re a dream god would have if he dreamed
I see you and I bleed
Remember when I said I was deleting this shit at 2000 followers? My hypocrisy knows no bounds.
there is more truth in a tall pour of tequila than any religion we’ve dreamed up
I’m here to be so real mediocrity unfollows the shit out of me
I’m too old for you to have anything lasting and real years old
I remember the smell of old books and the sunshine bleeding across the concrete  the vaults  the tunnels  the dreams the art the innocence  the lies  I remember the world inside my mind what a beautiful world it was
once tribalism ends there will be no more wars
to be understood is the essence of human existence
I wish I could find my people here
justice is a child outliving a parent
to drown in someone is what poetry is all about it’s the metaphor of a sunset  or fresh snowfall  or the smell of a newborn  or a daughter growing up
minds connect  the only way they know how by conversation  and physical touch
the tyranny of mediocrity  the only tyranny there is
those of you who never explode  are not real  you’re fake heroes
the most important messages  are drowned out by noise
I’ve sold my soul some would say I disagree  I joined them so I could beat them I’ve always been me
take my hand let’s end this shit
I’m here with you  tonight
we need to leave a better world than the one we came into not fuck it into dank submission
death is reserved  living is the opposite of that
I either need someone to tell me to go to bed at night or someone who doesn’t mind if I conquer the world
"being crazy myself I tend to avoid crazy people, the world doesn’t need that"
you could die in your sleep tonight and your silence would have meant nothing
Who knows what that’s from?
I tend to withdraw
“foul dwimmerlake” has got to be one of the best insults ever
my daughter’s friend  said I sounded like Darth Vader when they were on the phone  as I kissed her and said goodnight
It’s best to have no entanglements when one walks through the valley of the shadow of death.
I just downed a measure of cognac and need to wash it down with tequila
I’m fully convinced IOS has a hidden breathalyzer that triggers autocorrect into “fuck with this guy” mode.
Just took a peak at my drunk drafts folder. Oof!!
I always felt that after 5 pm reality was my own to mold as I saw fit
how the fuck do we explain America now?
I’m shooting for a less weird evening on here tonight.
I may be dead but I can save a few lives before it’s official
mi vida loca
You’ll melt completely in my presence.
you’re one of the stars in my sky and my sky is forever
The mediocrity of playing it safe.
I feel very fortunate that the adults in my life made terrible decisions.
give me another word for you  the night has taken all the definitions
I’m cryptic  I know
I’m not only a spy in the house of love.
I’m not nostalgic. You need my vagueness and I’m just good enough with words to give that to you.
There are lots of girls on the half shell but there is only one Madonna.
I’ll let you know when I cross the precipice.
"A silent disappearance is probably best but I’ll return, I promise."
I’m apparently immune to alcohol tonight.
I’m long gone love my fate is set in stone
Everyone needs a devil account.
That’s the spirit!
"Not to kink shame or anything, just usurping the language of the would be oppressor."
QAnon is for cucks.
"71,000 new infections per day is quite a fucking lot!"
I was a good devil today I stayed home
I’ve been spending time on my adult account adulting. I have more fun here.
we’re all important  we each contain our own version of the universe within our dreams
I don’t mind your judgement if it’s justified and if it is then I’m one step closer to enlightenment
a properly poured pint of beer
my five year plan is surviving the last few months of this one
every day is Friday for me but everyday will soon be the worst parts of Sunday for a long time
I forgot about Super Chicken in DC. Peruvian chicken that would give any Mexican chicken a run for the money.
Juan Pollo is the best Mexican chicken in the world. The chicken bursts in flavor as you tear it apart to make a taco with the chicken rice and corn tortillas and hot salsa. Jalapeños and lemon juice add to the crispy flavor of the rotisserie chicken.
or twenty
what I would do for a Köslch bier at the dom in Köln
"the people of America are some of the best in the world, they’ve just lost control of their government"
there’s a real America that never makes the news or the self serving narratives
I have tequila and limes and whiskey and hate
I’m college level hungry
"Never watch Anthony Bourdain in Austin, Texas when you’re hungry and there’s no food in your house."
raw oysters and hot sauce Phó with all the parts Ramen in Little Tokyo  duck sausages and Belgian beer in the Arts District  Juan Pollo anywhere  Chicago style pizza where I hate Chicago style pizza but this one is better than anything New York has and I love New York style pizza
I fucking love Cracker Barrel  and Waffle House  and pineapple on pizza  and unsweetened ice tea  and Mexican street corn  and Texas Barbecue  and crawfish boils  carne asada  carnitas  ceviche  Mexican chicken  fried okra  and a good IPA
this is more of a conversation from my mind to yours
I’m aloof because I love you
Hell is no art museums
drown me out I’ll thrive in the silence
I value intimacy  I eschew the crowd I’m accessible
the best worlds  are small worlds real worlds
I have nothing to hide  I own my shit
I’m home tonight like a good boy  I’m here for you
smiles heal the world
we must love  we must hurt we must die
photographs are portals
there are no more crummy hotels over Washington Square
my eyes are as green as death
if I had a soul it would be a sunflower darkened by a storm cloud but yearning for rain
I’ll call you from the void  hoping a part of you remembers
I’m not nostalgic  but I’m good with words
at some point all of us will be a memory to someone who loved us before they become a memory as well
art may not be obscurity  but honesty is
you should be an alabaster statue living in a garden among the butterflies and hummingbirds and bees with sunlight on your shoulders forever
subject me to interpretation
Hell is a vague place indeed.
Whomever needs to hear this I’m sorry I hurt you.
I think you depend upon me coloring outside the lines
the devil has the best records the best drugs  the best art the best sex  the best introspection  the best philosophy  what does god have  but the best mediocrity  and pleated khakis
It’s okay to feel desperate and lonely  and hopeless but recognize the hand reaching out from the darkness as the hand of hope and redemption and of a new beginning for we are all sinners
those of us who aren’t insane are insane
she was my last forever
hands desperately covering her mouth as earthquakes grew beyond our control
I owned her in the moment  between the screams and the walls of the neighbors
the entire shithouse is about implode but your selfie looks fine  I’m not judging mostly
plastic  in the modern age
I fight for a future where my daughters have a place to stand and anyone in my way is an enemy that must be destroyed in one form or another.
a knife is probably the most universal symbol of fear since the end of the Bronze Age
real is the difference between pretentiousness and a knife
Anyone can psychobabble...
I could write frilly prose all day long  but would you feel it I depend on you feeling me  in my words
manifest mother fuckers   make them listen
I know I could rule the world but I want all of you to have that power. The power of the individual. The power of freedom and choice. The power to dream of your own destiny.
"Nobody here can RT a dick pic I’ve sent. Well, maybe one, but we were in a relationship."
I’m torn between running for office or Messiah.
authority trumps their interests over yours
normalalcy is submitting to authority
you can just suck the blasphemy right off of my toungue
fucking is my favorite escape  it’s how religions are born
we all had some shit to deal with  that’s how this all works
I love my enemies there’s that hypocrisy
there be monsters  question their gifts
be decent  be fine
the fruit was my idea  but someone couldn’t take a joke
I’m all about forbidden  and the taste of rebellion
you’re too pretty for me try hating yourself a little
your selfies become you  but they bore me
close your eyes take a screenshot for eternity
the void was a black hole all along and we were just an instance of ourselves
love at the end of everything we’ve known
we’ve been changed  and now we must endure
we will never be the same  remember your dreams
we hang on to sunflowers and sunsets because sometimes the cliche is also the naked truth
love is a distraction  entropy is the elephant in the room
the gravity of being
tell me what the thirsty men are saying
we’re at a crossroads  history will be made  from here on out which side will you be on
I have daughters. I want to leave behind a world where daughters can be who they want to be without religious wingnuts defining their rights.
"Those were not followers, those were the sins of mediocrity."
I want to love you  but I have hell to pay
some of the best people here I was once told were the worst by the absolute worst  there are always two sides to every story
the best of us just doesn’t give a shit
you just want the sex and less of the gravity of a well developed mind that comes with it
I find a twisted form of amusement in the moment a person decides to unfollow me. I imagine a sort of self righteous indignation wracked in judgement and commonplace ignorance as they pull the plug.
I don’t want your nudes  I want you
sometimes your nudes and selfies seem ridiculous in the scheme of things
I bow to no one or imagined deity
the ones I lose are worth losing
doubt is freedom  certainty is slavery
all religion is a lie
we are hurling through space together on a lonely rock formed moments after time itself began and yet we are a stupid kind of species in the way we hate each other
power is controlling people  whether that is through government or religion it makes no difference  as long as those at the top get their results and enjoy their fruits  while the mass of people suffer
those who are willing servants of a tyrannical god are willing slaves  it’s pathetic really  but that seems to translate well into American politics
what true god would want anyone on their knees?
A true religion would enable its adherents rather than subject them.
just walk away I did it made all the difference
judgement is cold unforgiving narrow and obtuse  ugly even it comes from a dark place  acceptance is warmth  it’s an amber radiance a warm glow   a connection  understanding  sympathy  empathy
you have the most beautiful eye
I’m not real
Rest In Peace
my walls love you from afar
let’s make it real let’s make it last
we would all give up ourselves for an endless fire
I could fall for you  but I must be careful
meet me in Phuket
there’s nothing more depraved than desperation a stink that won’t  wash off
give me your fragility  but I want something real
some of you don’t need nuance  you’ll rut with whatever you can get
I’m not really all that insane  and you don’t really love me
the worst people will hate your honesty
I have few friends but they are the best motherfucking people in the world.
I can’t really handle all your noise with the demon party that’s in my head.
my demons are eternal  they drive me
I’ll try not to hate you before I sleep
the “love” economy is alive and well but so is the plastic one
I’ll respect the shit out of you so much that I will never speak with you
Hi
"Are you out of your goddamned mind? Pull yourself together, get a cup of coffee, workout, and by god stop with all the negative thoughts and self doubt. You’re fine.  *whoever needs to hear that"
I'm bored and you are failing me
I’m American  that makes me mostly ridiculous
and 50% whiskey
I’m 90% bullshit
most want what’s bad for you  so do I
the abyss turns out to be alive and well
people with ptsd fuck better
I avoid the best of you like the plague I hope you don't take it personally I'm just trying to survive and I would never survive you
I drink because Hell requires its dues.
I'm letting that last one stand.
I'm a gunfighter. I've been one for 23 years. Separated by the fight at the OK Corral by 139 years. I'm retired now and don't want to get involved. I just want to make money.
your claws would drag me straight to hell
I'm a presence a feeling an anthem  I'm absurdity
an Ennio Morricone afterlife
A wild west song plays every time I enter a room.
I’m a presence here not an account
the whole of humanity matters to me
love makes you soft soft gets you killed
"I want to take the time and thank all of you who’ve followed me throughout the years across all my accounts, especially my main account @awhiskydarkly you’ve been an inspiration to me and I hope I’ve inspired you."
I’m essentially a quiet loner with a loud mind who leaves everyone alone
I’m not looking for love  actually
be stoic you cannot control external forces but you can control your reaction to them
I see many of you all the time  all over the place I feel that I know you  and don’t know you at the same time
I’ve lived out my dreams  now what do I do
first light
we died trying but the mornings without us had their way
feel me when you feel yourself falling
most don’t want to taint their timeline with my filth but my filth is the nectar of the divine
we’ve definitely made a mess of everything
most people are absurd  their half cocked sense of morality  and hypocritical sense of justice  they would get on their knees for any two bit tyrant  who validated their bigotry
your silence is sacred  so is your self worth
I hope your fingers are in your mouth and you are flooding for me
all we have is this moment  make it explode into forever
don’t be afraid  feel
chained in the dark all alone  his voice your pivot  his fingers  your universe  his mind your destruction  his love your protection  his appetite your need
I’ve been walking in the grey of mediocrity for too long  it’s time to remove the mask
please me show me your wares
I want to fuck the blasphemy from your mouth and make you taste your damnation on my fingers
she has a thousand destructions   in her mind  all just under the thin veneer  of societal ‘normalcy’
hard fucking because everything else in the world sucks
lasting love is a slow snowfall  or blooming roses in a well kept garden  it’s more of a marathon  than a storm or earthquake
in a world gone mad our madness is all I care about the world can pass us by it can burn but not as hot as we will
my early morning tweets are my favorite fresh from my dreams  and before the sun silences the birds
"I was told I was a late night guilty pleasure. Well then, I mustn’t disappoint."
never share music if you want to keep it
woke up at 5am the trashy neighbor was screaming shut the fuck up I fell asleep again dreamed of driving off of a missing section of a bridge  reset the dream (I’m god in my mind) only to have my daughter flick a black widow on me I turned its legs into leaves it’s face Pokémon
it’s a higher higher ground
‘see you in the sky in the morning see you in the stars at night see you in the river flowing see you in the grass  feel you as I find myself flowing feel you as I find myself feeling  five toes five fingers all the time it’s a higher ground’  ~Younger Brother (Psychic Gibbon)
bondage is loving the wrong person  who takes advantage of your  kindness
should I put a trigger warning in my bio?
the face of evil  may be our own
death stalks me I give him both of my fingers knowing he’ll be laughing in the end
"we’ve had 2,000 years  we should be love by now"
suffocate in my words  let me own your despair
all love dies  like we do
the void is entropy  an end to all existence  it’s stray protons dying in the darkness  in the cold she is not that  at least right now  in the garden of our  young universe where love is a memory  locked in time  a shadow of an alternate reality a something  that’s unsustainable
I’m pretty much a quiet loner with an explosive mind in real life. It’s by choice rather than circumstance.
orgasms are more powerful when they’ve been denied
orgasms are more powerful  with a deep connection  how long have you been reading me?
a vast number of things in life  are fraudulent  including governments and religion  and young lovers  fawning over your brilliance
I’m an ass most of the time  I’m serious I’m a real motherfucker  ask anyone who knows me  but I have roses I keep  tucked away for when I’m not
My favorite rhymes with Underwood
name a pre-electric typewriter and you’ll have my admiration
our machine gun is a silent ode to the void
plastic has become us
turn that judgment inward  and the universe will right itself
sorry you feel so damaged  somewhere out there is the wreckage you left behind
Look what randomly popped up on my Spotify Discover. I’ve seen this band live more times than I can count in my wasted youth.
is anyone as weary of artificial mating rituals as I am
I’ve been a real motherfucker
tomorrow may be an afraid to open twitter over coffee sort of morning  the best nights always are
I hate that motherfucker  but god did give me a beautiful cock  so I can’t fully hate him
If you’re not a burning flame that threatens to destroy me  I’m not even interested
I come with a sword  and armor  and a taste for flesh  and strong drink
I’m comfortable with being a nightmare but I hope to be a dream someday
I hide here  because it feels safe
I drink too much  have seen too much  and am too heavily armed  to live a normal life
all I ask of you  is to get me though the next year
my entire world is violence  talk me down
candles and black cats  are underrated
I can’t get past this song tonight.
without sex and death  what else can I write about  love? please
so you ever think we’ll pan out  or is the devil just laughing
you are an earthquake to me a tornado a catastrophe an epidemic something to notice and take seriously
I may be hard to read  emotionally hard to handle  blunt and too dirty real
the problem with humanity is we love too much we have too many dreams and the excess turns to hate
the problem isn’t my lack of empathy  I’ve bled for several lifetimes it’s yours
I’ve seen death first hand it’s more anti-climatic  than poetic
I get weaker as I age I can feel it one day the wolves will win  but not today
we lose people because we have to someday someone we love  will lose us
I depend on base impulses  to keep average away
I could write about rope  and whips  wax and nipple clamps  but that’s so much dungeons and dragons isn’t it love  I would rather write about true submission the awe of a sunset  the way the wind sounds through the trees the speech of art in a gallery   the way we’re born damned
life is beautiful  even when it’s ugly the poetry says it all
I’ve dreamed of you for years  and I wake up every morning  and you are not there
those of you I find beautiful are the most beautiful ones of all
I’m at that part of the evening where the music is good the drink is strong memory no longer has a sting the morning is hopeful and everything is going to be okay
"I don’t hate anyone, I just hate mediocrity."
I never know where my mask is and usually wear my shemagh to the grocery store or the post office
I write some beautiful shit  and then tell you all I hate you  no wonder I suck at Twitter
losing followers means you’re real  and unafraid of speaking your truth it means you’re not a suck ass
I’m repentless because there’s no free will
I’m surrounded by beauty  I’m fortunate in that regard
there is no such a thing as a soul but if there was I would devour yours with an insatiable mouth and tongue and lick the excess from my fingers as I gulp a glass of wine by the fire
every person is redeemable
I always forget who I am  that allows me to keep  a sense of wonder  an appreciation of beauty  a lust for life
‘The idea of God is the sole wrong for which I cannot forgive mankind.’  ~The Marquis de Sade
flood me  with your trembling  and loathing
I’ll love you  but keep my pistol close
I’m sorry I don’t smile all the time not sorry
I’ll never be done fighting it seems
I have a small niche carved from the twitterverse  but this is my domain I am its lord  and master
all I’m saying  is live motherfuckers  while you still can
stupid people don’t follow me you are the elite
breaching trust  and companionship is one of the most difficult  of human endeavors
If you’re with me I will cherish you
tell me about your own corruption  how would you like to be undone  ripped apart  exposed destroyed  abandoned  chained  how do you want to be loved
the apple of sodom
I want to take a bite of your apple
I want to trample your pure driven snow
poetic  in a corrupt sort of way
it’s a will to power weakness become dead protons in a zombie universe
the best of us are weird  the only ones I associate with
sometimes fingertips destroy souls
you’ll either love my dichotomies  or hate rhem  my hypocrisy knows no bounds
I have love in my heart  and peace in my mind
if I offend you try and work  on being less sensitive the world is a cruel place
I see you
eyes may be the windows to the soul but hands unlock the gates of Heaven
I’m down to loving my children  and repairing the damage I’ve done  call it redemption  I call it honor
pain is real for me when I forget I’m eternal
‘flies will lay their eggs’
she’s an impotent plaything  her sunsets are plastic her love is spoiled
my enemies are horrible people  my friends are angels
coffee black I eat ass  as you know
Los Angeles is Hell.
eat the fucking fruit
a woman is a hearth a man is a pillar  children are laughter
so much of me leaves inside of you
I paint in words  in brilliant shades  of black and white
I hope at the end of the universe  there’s a rose garden  and I see your thighs crossed  in black stockings  sitting next to a fountain  of Eros
I try to be beautiful  write beautiful things but it all comes out  grotesque
the irony is I don’t love  destruction  is my only  language
If I love you  I melt inside of you  and try to be one  with your everything
every intimate encounter  should be creation  even though destruction  is involved
those who boast about their conquests are abusers as well  avoid them
the intelligent ones  know your worth  they will trade you  for a sunset  or a budding flower or fireflies in the forest  the stupid ones just want to fuck you  they shouldn’t be procreating
this mortal coil is a real motherfucker
we’re here to experience  not to hold back
hope is a painless death
entropy is our only future everything along the way is nihilistic hedonism
every DM  is a minute of your life taken away  chat rooms are months
death is sex  the void a toe curling  orgasm  the annihilation  of consciousness  hell is the screams  in the night  the abyss is no aftercare
ever want to just devour her in all her warmth and softness  pools for eyes damnation for a smile  hair burning down the hills  hands that are destroyers  of peaceful sleep
I’ve been listing to the same song on repeat for over an hour is that psychotic
would you bleed for me  how far would you go how deep would you fall
nothing in the past matters  except the people who’ve made it into your present with you
I have a different perspective of the events in question plausible deniability  a diabolical justification  for all of it
I don’t fall
some evolve faster than others  some are ready to explore space  while others are still sharpening weapons
*its
truth is fourth dimensional
the space-time continuum is a prison and so is it’s cousin immortality
Definitely...
I collect beautiful souls  because I love surrounding myself with the divine
we can get so wrapped up in our own thoughts that we forget life is happening all around us and it’s happening rapidly  stop and look around every so often breathe deep and take notice of the little things that typically fade into the background of our solipsism
our life also belongs to everyone it touches to everyone who loves us and to those for whom we matter
it’s what we do while we’re here that matters
I was always more of a warrior priest than a mindless pawn who just “followed orders”.
I sexually identify as the elder of the tribe.
I’m nothing but a damaged soul with the epiphany of circumstance. My wisdom is nothing more than universal suffering.
Love each other would be my only commandment if I had a say in such things.
I should add that the individual practitioners are good people just trying to survive until morning. My criticism has more to do with power and the influence of the elite in the separate faiths.
Christianity just sucks  so does Islam and Judaism  the mosaic religions will destroy us all
god is autocracy  the devil is freedom  rebellion and justice
Let’s burn this motherfucker down and start fresh.
I write in rebellion I write in rock and roll I write in anarchy
trees have a community  they talk to each other  protect each other  and are as close to eternal as anything on Earth
I find this strangely inspiring
we probably shouldn’t escape the planet while everything is put into perspective
we have our Nero
power is control control is an illusion rebellion is immenent
money has been our downfall all along
we die upon the cross  of lies while truth drowns  in the gutter
Mood:
this is the part of the evening where I tell you I love you but hate you at the same time my dichotomies are complex
I hope I offend you and you fuck right off
Lucifer had our back and we turned away from him in favor of old man virgins and contemptuous crones
music may be god  even though it’s from Lucifer
I’m only immortal in your mind in your dreams I’m the dying god  the tragic hero  the wasted youth  futility  the lost cause  the stuff of poetry
remember the snow melting in spring  the way the sky looks yellow in the fall when the sun fades for the day  the smells of summer  the dread of winter  the way I taste while tasting you  in all of the seasons  the way you’re constant
I’m a product of evil people  I try to enlighten despite of that fact
You’re fine
I’m a will to power in my own right
forever is a losing bet
I’m a little drunk the truth may be dominating  my thoughts
I’m not even saying choose me. I’m saying choose your bliss where I’m the worst possible choice
I’m the king  of nothingness and everything
"those among us suffering from cancer or a terminal illness understands more about what it is to live than every poet and every artist combined, they understand what living on the cusp of uncertainty truly means the rest of us are fake heroes"
your perfect world will never understand mine
"god is un-American. We don’t like unelected, autocratic kings here. This is still a Republic."
Vote for me when I run. I’ll create heaven on Earth.
"I’m probably more Marilyn Manson than Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper, King Diamond, Deicide, and Ozzy Osbourne are combined."
Satan was the only real hero in the Bible. Everyone else were suck asses.
We evolved from lesser life forms so we may plant gardens and trees.
My youngest asked me to play Dungeons and Dragons with her tomorrow. My nerd self just woke up after decades of dormancy. “I’m all in.” I told her.
we want what we cannot have  because we want to rebel against god
I know I know  when I get too wild  the hand wringers get nervous and by hand wringers   I mean conservatives  they’re a sensitive lot
tell me what you think life is  and I’ll show you a meandering tale  of dead ends and lost dreams  of heroic moments and cowardice  of love lost and redemption  I’ll show you what it means to be human in the shadow of life’s irrelevancy and made up fairy tales
the elites are wrong  money is not power  love is  love will change the world
careful is never good enough
I preach insurrection I preach dignity and justice  revolt against illegitimate power  I preach rebellion
we are not the subjects of the billionaire class we are men and women  with hearts and dreams  and a real life that we live everyday
the machine will defend itself
the time for questioning authority has passed now is the time to challenge authority
If I return next year and everything isn’t sorted out I will be very vexed. I’ll be coming from a place that being very vexed isn’t necessarily a good thing.
people are not made of stone  they are malleable susceptible to reason in most cases  but the programming is state sponsored and weaponized
white privilege pretty much only extends to white males keep them thirsty ladies  revolt in every way you can
everyone deserves a place to stand  everyone deserves justice  everyone deserves acceptance
rejoice in your fleeting youth
The world is 75% cretin.
there are many devil accounts  this one is mine  there are many like it it’s only here that I show you what despair looks like while telling you everything is fine and whispering a hot  I love you into your ear
question everything  even when doubt is forbidden
everything you know or have read or have been told is a lie  that’s why it’s important to see with  your third eye
be wild
that’s why the wealthy elite hates democracy
in a democracy authority ultimately rests with the people and is at will
teach your children how to think rather than what to think
spend your emotional energy discovering yourself
"‘to me organized religion, the formalities and routines, it's like being marched in formation to look at a sunset.’   ~John S. MacDonald, “A Deadly Shade of Gold” (1965)"
I never let anyone in
I’m the worst distraction ever.
my apocalyptic message is essentially a positive one
"be prepared for the death of many millions, billions even, nature will have its way with us and our hubris will not save us but balance will be restored one way or another and life will survive"
everything’s going to work out
orthodoxy and dogma are sins
when the curtains fall and the doors and windows are opened we see each other for what we truly are  infinite
people lie because they have to
we are here to collectively observe and experience existence  for as long and as deeply as possible
we’re all different in person
stoicism goes a long way
I’m rarely melancholic  and when I am it’s more pensive
do you think that maybe sadness is the default state of mind  for most people
support the arts go to museums create
without the normal range of human emotion  one has a certain detached and objective sense  of the human condition
her name was midnight  and dawn was blood and fire
we’re all fucked might as well start  living like it
midnight tolls
I’m far from sleep no rest for the wicked
There’s a special place in Hell for morons who cannot manage their car alarms.
it’s easier to sin and by god it’s much more fun
"the demons will always run amok and saints will be, um, saints  but it’s a high price getting to be one"
the wisdom of the damned
the world will never change history continues to ripple  through space and time
I’ve loved  it echoes inside my heart that’s good enough for this world
all love either flies away  or finds the grave
I’m not that excited about getting back into the arena.
human relations are essentially  chemical reactions
"mindfulness, as much as our frail egos allow"
everyone’s story is huge
all monuments are relics of the dead to their kind
trees have always taken care of us they’ve allowed us to breathe they’ve witnessed our history  but were never complicit in it  they’ve sacrificed  to shelter us  to feed us to advance our knowledge  they are like nurturing grandmothers to brat children  always giving
quiet is soothing while silence is loud
the meaning is there is no meaning  save that we’ve created to comfort ourselves and I’m fine with that
anyone ever get tired of hearing people’s righteous indignation? unless you walk on water shut the fuck up
the past is the pst it should be filed away or forgotten the present is where we breathe with an eye on the future for that’s where the wolves are
each life is a millipede  spanning thousands of miles dancing with others because that’s the nature  if time
forbidden is an aphrodisiac  and an act of rebellion
the guilt of touch  and other weaponized  systems of control
harden me  swallow my universe
sweet sleep the dry run for death
loud people are typically stupid people
relax it’s just the vomit in my drafts folder
I feel the wasteland of emptiness the silence of despair the loneliness of loneliness
show me someone infallible and I’ll show you a liar
most people seem to be more of a leviathan than seraphim or cherub
I’ve always been quiet contemplative  reserved  but my mind is a lion’s roar  and sometimes  I am too
do what thou wilt
freedom is having nobody left to apologize to or ask forgiveness from peace is letting go of the wrongs that have been done to you
a forest to get lost in
some people have felt old their entire lives while others never do it’s better to be the latter
we need this
this is a tough day  for those whose fathers are gone or were never there or who are rotten people abusers or enablers  take care of yourself  people love you  in the space of their  absence
a monster of energy  a behemoth of thought  experience manifesting  from infinite points  of perspective
you are the universe  and so am I
you’ve got to dance with the demons  before you can walk with the angels
see with better eyes  listen with a kinder heart
life is never boring  if you have love in your heart
we are right here in this moment  being who we were always meant to be
we are not our past we are our present  pointing to the stars while saying “I want that one.”
people cannot make you whole only you can do that
walking alone in the forest  sunlight dappled before me  through the canopy of branches  I stop to rest in the cradle of grandmother trees
this is a heavy glass of wine on top of a mescal evening
we have all taste death  the moment we took our first breath it's what we do in between those moments that matters
I never dream of the god you’ve dreamt up
when your only tool is a sword every problem looks like vanquish
death is only a measure of the life we’ve lived
while you’re sleeping...
I’ll only accept dangerous love  safe is mediocrity
careful is cowardice
just unfollow me you shallow cunts
love is the undoing I use against you so I may feed
I’m what’s left of your illusions
meet me at the end of your dreams
I don’t want your love I want your crucifixion
your perfect kingdom  of wanting more
you don’t understand raw  it means truth
in the end I just want to own you whatever that means
there’s a moment  where everything  descends into nothing  but still the sun  rises and falls
I was your everything once  nothing and never doesn’t suit me and is a poor reflection of you
in the end we must choose our own interests however they manifest
we’re all sacred  manifest as such
blocking is such a bitch move  engaging on a rational level is punk rock
never is a bitch isn’t it?
oblivion is anal sex  oblivion is life reimagined
you want my fingers in your mouth penetrating your throat   while I fuck you raw  tasting yourself on my tongue and mouth and cock  and forgetting the world for a moment
nihilism is better than false hope
our dreams are the foreshadowing of death
intelligent people are lonely
most people are too stupid to understand  most people are too stupid to be found
where we wandered was immortal  where we’ve dreamed was lost
I’ve never believed in the party line
most people have been shit
compassion is survival of the fittest
I get it the threat to hegemony
every living thing deserves to breathe
once we get rid of tribalism and manufactured hatred we will manifest the universe
the universe is only our dreams
I’ll defend anyone’s right to be
here’s the deal we are all one tribe we are meant to explore  the stars not tear each other  apart
life is fun once we get past the bullshit
you can have my roses
invisibility would be mercy
I’m made to be a ghost  I’m made to be a god I’m to be nothing and everything  I’m made to be a dream  inside of a nightmare
our universes were incongruent  but collided for a moment
it’s okay to drown  figuratively speaking
be your own hero in your own story in your own reality  fuck everyone else
working title: fuck
don’t fuck with her child bearing years old man
life is a child’s laughter  and everything evil is alien by comparison
sunflowers somehow hold the secrets to life
we all deserve to be seen  our pain acknowledged  the universe made smaller more intimate less alien
on the precipice the wind on my face sharing space with the sun
I do shit with grit and my bare fist
I draw the line at predators  I know them well  I will call them out wherever I find them
None of us can grow untill we’ve experienced the trauma bond of a toxic relationship. @elfincharms
I’ll write my truth elsewhere come find me  no DM’s.
the only person I’m saving is myself
for those who married too young twitter is so eigth grade  be better than that
I’m about done with this shit
I’m never the fuckboi always the savior  I hate to break it to you I’m not saving shit
weirdos rule the world
I think I’ll go back to anonymity.
be prepared to kill anyone you meet but hope for the best
your parents can be the worst emotional abusers in your life  find your people find acceptance
comfortable will enslave you
But I hate autocorrect even more.
Fuck I hate peoples
Ducks I hate people
Fuck I have people
Dixie I sure people
Fuck I hate people.
life is the draw of a beach the awe of a sunset  sinking beneath the waves
normal is the mediocre surrender of the possibilities of life
I’m a little crazy  the best of us are
tequila and sunsets  better than heaven
everybody has made a mistake  some of us have survived  while others have been damned
we are in a sense prisoners of the choices we’ve made  breaking the cycle  liberates us  to a future  based on the choices we make
I’m a dumbass when I drink.
the heron and the sidewinder
someone played my dreams before  I’ve been wary ever since
the other half of your life is lived in your dreams
money cannot buy time
fumble at the edge of my  fingertips  I’ll look for the words  to undo you
the concept of humanity  is a social construct  we are all divinity  looking for the right words
all I’m saying is  you are the flower  that makes you so happy
you’re being manipulated  and until you realize this you will never be fee
ever been to a speakeasy in a ruined city by the sea?
where does time go?
the best among us  never expected understanding  they just wished for decency
the universe is us and we are so fucking beautiful
get crazy for once forget your comfortable life  and change the world
I get crazy  because crazy makes shit happen
Most people are not deep thinkers. Most people breathe until they don’t and nothing happened in between.
"I’m essentially a peacemaker.  A heavily armed one trained to kill, but I believe in peace."
Repeat: there should be no violence in faith
You’re not fucking thinking hard enough! Fucking think about shit for one moment in your life! Let’s make this experience better.
nothing matters everything matters if you understand  I need some psychedelics
we are limited to five senses  the universe requires much more than that
every dream is another universe
a little secret  there’s no such thing as death  we made that shit up
when I write about death I want you to think about living
death is a given do something cool beforehand
we’re all skulls at the end of our time
The truth is uncomfortable and challenges our comforting self conceptions.
look at procreation politics the hierarchy of getting laid there are providers  and fuck bois and they are seldom the same
humanity disgusts me it’s a failed species  a parasite strangling the earth  and each other
you’ll only get a couple more drunk tweets storms out of me before I must succumb to silence
"on an aside, I hate liars"
show me someone who’s never lied and I’ll show you a liar  everybody lies  that’s that part about being human
I love some of you
you survive when you’re bored you live when you dream
Sage advice.
This has been a thankful escape.
the high ground is everything to credibility
when I pass out the poetry echoes in dreams and in the shadow of eternity
I’m a clown with the soul of a saint  and a sense of irony
never sellout  never  always write your truth
I’m writing  not ranting where are you
I’m just a clown with the heart of a saint  drinking the blood of redemption
my passion  and conviction  gets the best of me sometimes I get crazy  radical I want to tear  the whole shit down  but more importantly  I want to build  something divine
most people are vampires  you have to find the ones who carry the fire
the wolves  are in between my words and will devour me in the end
the shadows  hold all the secrets
I’m lucky I defeated death  when death had a foothold  wisdom springs from  perspective  and perspective  holds onto its life
I gave you fire  and that wisdom  only fire brings
I have a handle on what evil is.
"dreamt we were eating at a Middle Eastern restaurant in the Middle East. I shit my pants, found a pistol in the parking lot and shared a table with a retired cop and his wife who had a seizure. The food was delicious."
your phone is a palantir
If your god carries a hammer or only has one eye BECAUSE HE PLUCKED OUT THE OTHER ONE TO SHOW HOW TOUGH HE IS it won’t be easy to attack and destroy god
welcome to the suck
sleep seems like giving up
I’m leaving in three weeks do you guys got this or no
Whew! What a week.
Half the time I don’t even remember which account I’m writing under.
what a ridiculous moment in history
"Attack and Dethrone God? Yes my minions, let’s!!! #attackanddethronegod"
This wasn’t supposed to be a political account. I’m ending the political tweets here and have moved over to my political one for those.
I don’t condone violence whatsoever whether it comes from the police or from the protesters. Those who resort to violence undermine their position.
Me: “Not all cops are bad.”  13: (screaming) “Bullshit dad! The good ones aren’t speaking up and the entire system is corrupt!”  19: (screaming) “All cops are bastards!”  😐
The police have sullied their reputation for a generation to come. They had every chance to take the high ground but they squandered it on sadistic and malicious brutality.
The clothing of the American fascist. You’ve all seen the black trucks. The Punisher skulls. The subdued flag. Here’s an explaination of why.
"By the way, the American flag is red, white, and blue. It’s not fascist black, grey, and white."
The jails will be filling up with former cops.
The two officers have been suspended.
This is the state of our police force.
I’m an insider. I know the game. I know how the machine can be stopped.
I’m with General Mattis.
I don’t think there will be a second civil war. I have faith in the people. I have faith in the police and the military even though some have been misguided.
Tyranny depends upon complacency.
The GOP turned out to be the traitors of the Republic. Watch them scramble like rats when they try to get into our good graces again. The only revolution here will be at the ballot box.
Now let’s get rid of that fascist imbecile in the White House. America needs normalcy.
Fucking ridiculous.
Now a bunch of cops are going to be fired and sent to prison. That’s the measure of freedom. That’s how a free people hold their public servants accountable.
Los Angeles removed their curfew after the ACLU sued them. Austin PD are no longer present during protests. Fascism has played its hand and lost.
It’s a class war. The racism part comes in when the state determines who is in what class.
Neutrality was never an option.
no peace  no poetry
#bluefall I couldn’t in good conscience be silent. Neutrality is the device of cowards or of those without conviction.  Injustice needs resistance.
I’m complicated.
I’ll rage down soon. Hear me out.
Swastikas and Confederate flags are the symbols of the traditional enemies of the United States who’ve we’ve beaten the shit out of in war. They are the symbols of the defeated.
stand for something
I’ve always seen those sworn law enforcement officers who knowingly  violate the Constitution to be a greater threat to Democracy than any foreign adversary.
I’ve said my peace.
They need to be winning hearts and minds not turning the public against them. I see a disastrous failure of leadership in the ranks.
Police officers have a tough job with overwhelming stress levels at times. It takes the good cops to enforce their ranks. I’ve seen some crazy shit in the last week but I think they’re starting to get it.
"You have the government you deserve, the one you settled for."
I’m aware of my hypocrisy. I’m aware of its boundless possibilities.
The Republicans and their man in the White House as well as his supporters are a national security threat.
The former Secretary of Defense and war hero USMC General Mattis just compared Trump to a Nazi. That happened.
Police brutality is a stain on my otherwise honorable career. I’m ashamed of belonging to the thin blue line and I’m speaking out against the injustice. If you are a cop on active duty you should be ashamed too. Change this shit.
If I was black the situation would have played out differently. My privilege saved me. My privilege shouldn’t even be a factor.
I got pulled over in my rural community. I lived .4 miles away. A black SUV came racing down the road behind me and was tailgating. I rolled through a stop sign and CHP pulled me over from a situation they created. I passed a field sobriety test. That is policing in the US.
Nobody should be terrified of the police.
I spent four months in Europe on an assignment and visited seven counties and I didn’t see anyone pulled over by the police. On my daily commute in the states I see several traffic stops daily.
The unjust Rockefeller drug war. That’s how.
Policing as we know it in America must be destroyed. They are a standing army much like the British were in 1775. How did a free people let this happen?
Courage means doing the right thing even when it’s not popular.
The police could have been heroes in all of this. Instead they revealed the monsters they were all along.
I investigated human rights violations and war crimes. My team were modern day Nazi hunters. Government officials violating people’s human rights under the color of law. These were the very people I would send to prison.
Collect video of all police brutality for litigation later. They will be held accountable for their criminal actions.
Maybe everything makes sense now.
I used to be the man. I mean the man.
I can finally speak my mind.
We are going to see some shit before the year is over.
2020 is like passing through Satan’s  bowels
fucking earthquake  fucking hell
I was a federal agent for 20 plus years and by the way almost everyone in law enforcement is a Trumper. This explains a lot about what’s going on.
Tell me what that elderly man was doing to deserve being shield bashed. What the fuck is wrong with our police. They’ve lost their goddamned minds.
Look at this shit.
Everytime the police assaults a peaceful protester they violate the constitution. Hold them accountable. Take them to court.
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
freedom of speech  freedom of the press freedom to assemble  are all under assault  by fascist traitors  under the color of law  who want to normalize  the deprivation of these rights
Know your rights. Exercise them vigorously.
The people watch the watchmen for it is the people whom they serve.
A corrupt cop’s worst enemy is a good cop with a conscience and a sense of justice.
The ACLU has a mobile app to record violations of police conduct for future litigation. The video goes straight to the ACLU and cannot be deleted. We need to hold the police accountable.
Paul Revere
they burned down the DMV fucking pirates
we all experience the unknown  and that’s the essence of everything
hold on! don’t block  it gets better  this is just  a dialogue
I never remember what I write by morning anyway  good night and good luck
Sorry if I’ve offended you and your uncle is a cop. Just remind him that the Constitution either rests on his shoulders or he is the emissary for fascist rule. I always sided with the Constitution but I’m a radical patriot like that.
you’re all fucking beautiful  and deserve a place to stand  everyone does  remember that
the truth is  the truth  is what  we make it
I usually don’t fit  into any narrative  that’s why I’m hated  that’s why I’m the devil
is this a race war  or a class war  inequality or barbaric  tribalism  I appreciate your  perspective
dialogue only happens when the radical fucks leave the table
there is no moral justification for looting or police brutality
the truth is looters are no better than the cops who are brutalizing the innocent
I can call out evil wherever I find it regardless of how political expedient it is
life is hard for everyone  your sense of  social justice  should never  trump a family’s  need to eat
Maybe someday I’ll tell my story about government corruption.
so an immigrant family braved the border crossing managed against the odds to  create a business put their kids through school   but in your rage over injustice  you burn and loot that business  explain how you’re not a hypocrite again?
I don’t give a shit if you agree or not  I have the perspective of an insider  you can fuck right off with your self righteous delusions
income inequality is what this is about
this is a class war  in the guise of racism  the elite want to  divide us
I was a good cop  I reported corruption  my reward was being  passed over for promotion but I made a difference
we need the good cops to step up
when we burn it all down where do we go from there?
injustice is injustice no matter where your brick was manufactured
Looting is a stance of moral cowards.
I don’t mind restructuring my followers in the name of truth and justice  I always speak my truth  and fuck you if you don’t understand
the high road is power
protest is seeking the divine
rioting  is rape
burning down cities  hurts economic opportunity  those who do are the enemy  of a free people
you have your agenda which isn’t necessarily the truth
I’m also highly critical of cops who are out of control.
people are picking sides history is judging
there’s a difference between protesters and rioters  the former want change  the latter want destruction  and nihilism
I’m for community  if you’re against that you’re my enemy
I feel  I’m not silent about it
shame me if it makes you feel better but I try for the truth even if I fail  the pursuit is the end
I don’t need to be anybody  but I’ll shout my fucking truth from the rooftops with an army of fuck you’s behind me
"rioters who burn businesses suck cops abusing their authority suck the victims are freedom, peace, and democracy"
a failed state
I try to be a peacemaker
To the good cops  I’m with you
I’m with you. So are so many others. Don’t alienate us by shitting on your allies.
people who try to put food on the table don’t deserve to be made an example of in your misplaced rage
don’t loot you’re ruining the message
I’ll stand my ground someone had to
The standard is the minimum force necessary to affect an arrest. You can’t draw your weapon and murder someone because they are resisting. I would like to see how those big guys articulate their fear for their life.
Cops are just fucking killing people. These two dirtbags are prison bound.
Be careful of false information. I just posted one that was questionable.
"The Constitution is under seige by the men and women who swore to protect it. You’re all complicit if you wear a uniform and don’t speak out or report excessive force, assaulting journalists, attacking families on their own property. Call internal affairs. Do the right thing."
Americans need to purge its police departments of pieces of shit like these.
It’s just a matter of time before the shooting starts.
“A house divided cannot stand”  ~Abraham Lincoln quoting the Bible
"“Well, if it’s on motherfucker then it’s on G.” ~Easy E"
2020 belongs to the devil
keep your heads
All of them at one time or another
These are my brothers.
the Republic is in jeopardy
"For my brothers in the police and military. I am one of you. Remember your oath to the Constitution? For you who are out of control, what the fuck are you doing? Take off your uniform and turn your shit in. You are a disgrace to the uniform and to a free people."
If you are brutalized by the police or witness abuse of authority get identifying information. Record record record. Let’s prosecute these motherfuckers. We need to rein in our police if we are to be free.
We are not subjects. We are a free people with the right to self governance.  The police work for us. Period.
“Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.” ~Benjamin Franklin
I think she died
I’ve always treated people with respect even if they didn’t deserve it
It’s a class war  that assumes people of color have no skin in the game  let’s change that
you deserve the peace  you’ve suffered to attain
my honor held me back but it was worth all of it
I could probably destroy the world with my words.
you’re all anonymous minds no matter how beautiful  my love for you is of a different nature  than if you’re in my contacts  or you’ve seen my face in person
Poetry seems trite right now.
all my heroes are dead
whether it’s a bullet or a bottle  I’m not waiting around for death  I prefer to confront that motherfucker head on
play me the sad old songs  I’ll write the words that make folks feel what I feel inside  pour the whiskey  pass the joint
it’s the reckoning  it’s best to walk with perdition by your side
the angel of death spreads her wings  and marks the year as her own
you motherfuckers awake because I have something to say
Play me
everything is connected  shit doesn’t just happen in a vacuum
a class struggle where money is the only real privilege
at the intersection of inequality and class warfare

the version of me inside your head probably isn't the version I'm used to
"are drunk tweets at 3:25 pm inappropriate? shit, look who I’m asking"
honestly things are still weird social distanced drinks served in styrofoam cups masked waiters  weird  but I’ll take it
I’m sitting in a bar  on the beach drinking tequila motherfuckers  things are opening up
*update for a new reality ready to install
so many dystopian paradises
losing ourselves in the fallout
the casualties are mostly invisible
"oh, everyone's working sucks to be you"
the essence of evil is theft or some variation thereof and it's a spectrum
locked inside a fortress of solipsism with a need to be human
weave your fingers into mine I’ll not turn away this time
fingers in your hair fingers in your mouth fingers penetrating the sacred
being weird is okay when you think about it everything is
you can only get so numb before you're drinking in death's parlor
she's always there to remind me I'm not human
devils cannot help themselves from being devils
we all navigate minefields before sleep finally takes us
nothing is more lonely than California at midnight
be the brilliant light shadows fear
leave me for dead I deserve it
some of you beautiful motherfuckers help me through the night
Spotify does not know me
shine for me
I do go sane sometimes
indeed
the mediocrity of the crowd made the twitter elite I'm out peace
when you are a lie everything else is also
churches are sacred
it doesn't but it depends who delivered it
most of you don't know what pain is
I haven’t dealt with my life yet
my core is a black hole I can’t love  I can’t feel I can’t do anything
it’s all good send me nudes or some shit
I was a good human once
if I could only  dig you up from the grave  just so I could choke  you out
my silence  is my confession
I don’t think you understand how much of my core is damaged
the only one I dislike is sloth the wicked aren’t lazy
most of the seven deadly sins are motivational
most things are permissible  in moderation
be hungry be ambitious and by all a means covet
life is easy once you get past the wolves
If you don’t love yourself  nobody else will
guilt drives us to be better people it shouldn’t consume you  it’s not a destroyer it’s your inner voice  telling you to overcome  weakness
I was in love before many of you were born. Lovers fade away. The disappear from memory and yet they never leave. They become new creatures where as I’m the same old devil.
When two weeks became indefinitely.
Some of you are just fucked up humans that I don’t have time to entertain.
I’m not the one.
Twitter is dangerous we fall in love  with minds expressing themselves  in words  in photos  in attitude  in compassion it’s just as real as any real life I’ve known  when someone disappears you can feel it in your bones
I ate horribly today locked my keys in the car a Lyft in the mountains  takes a while to find  if even available  lucked out  found one on her way  back from Big Bear got my spare key came back  it only took two hours it was freezing by the time I ran the lake  in running shorts
I picked a bad pandemic to quit drinking.
don’t burn down churches assholes
I’m not worried about the pandemic. I’m worried about government overreach and the erosion of human rights.
turn off the news they want to shutter  your third eye
I picked a bad day to be the devil
even I’m tired of my bullshit
alcohol unlocks my darkest thoughts  there’s enough darkness in the world
no more drunk tweets for a while
and when you drink too much it should be batshit crazy and deleted in the morning
keep my attention
beyond my rage are fields of honey
I spit blood
that’s the edge  it’s calling you
"your words should be rock and roll, cabaret, avant garde, abandon, wanton, raw, vulnerable. and a fat middle finger against mediocrity and death, which are the same thing"
half of my unfollows are cognitive dissonance while all my blocks are denial and lack of introspection
sometimes I feel like fighting  sometimes I feel like fucking  all my words come out as poetry
I picked a bad night to become a saint.
you wanted corruption  I’m here to deliver
you already know your soulmate you are just wasting time with distractions
the vintage doesn’t matter the truth however is all important
bleed me  as I feed on that energy

devils may fuck you raw but you’ll find god in the end
the mediocre are demons
we all need a worthy death whether that means  doing something worthy or living life on your own terms and thumbing a finger to the establishment while giving the mortician a used up corpse  that’s it  I plan on doing both

Good morning
"Bernay's work with the United Fruits company, CIA, facilitated the overthrow of a democratically elected President of Guatemala. Propaganda against their government/military convinced them they were overrun by guerillas. It was a coup, a puppet government, and 40 year civil war."
"Bernays also used propaganda techniques to get women to start smoking in 1929 when it was considered taboo or even a crime. He hired women to march in a NY parade to brazenly start smoking ""torches of freedom"" and cigarettes became a major part of the women's liberation movement."
Edward Bernays was Sigmund Freud's nephew. Contracted to get people to eat more bacon he enlisted doctors to change public thinking about breakfast to being the most important meal of the day. The European style breakfast of coffee and a roll was replaced with bacon and eggs.
"I never say goodnight but goodnight fair people tomorrow is another day and to quote Matthew 6:34 ""Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof"""

why I have cognac is a very short and boring story
we've lost people here  I've noticed
found some gin and a little vermouth there is a god
I'm down to cognac.  I'm down to...cognac.
this is the time of night where I drink too much write too much and fear opening twitter in the morning
perhaps we don't need a return to normal
"my thoughts on the pandemic... we're all going to catch the virus some will die, others will not but eventually things will return to normal unless we take the opportunity to change things up"
we all have to die sometime why not just let it play out
It's all going to work out
if not everything I say has to make sense then we'll probably get along fine

I had to stop yesterday and then drank myself into oblivion later in the evening. Does that count?
it's one of the 'afraid to open twitter' kind of mornings
sex is the corporation's most powerful weapon
"I know, I know, you want the sex tweets go get laid already and come back to the table ready to think, ready to change the world"
judgement is reserved for hypocrites
we become wildflowers when we die
your worldview was manufactured in a lab
you're human you've made the most heinous of mistakes yet you are redeemable that's what love is
addicts see a truth most of us drown in religion or denial
I see the absurdity of it all and laugh
"I died tonight by tequila and was resurrected by the documentary ""the corporation"" if you want some poetry"
few in the the world are deep thinkers most just care about how they get their orgasms
I’m more worried about typos and puking on the alter of the porcelain goddess
Art never needs applause  it needs the truth
“irrational  attitudes  to the submission  to authority”  ~Noam Chomsky  *show me your tits
tune in turn on  drop out
"there are people on the media  whose job it is to decide what you think, think about that for a moment"
we are people  we bleed  and we are judged
Create to stand your ground.
I know I know when I assault your carefully crafted socialization you shut down that’s the mediocrity I’ve learned to accept
"I like to think I’m generous in sharing the writers, artists, intellectuals, and the people who feel and express themselves. I appreciate all of you. You make my life better."
Generation Z is our only salvation.
“They who have put out  the people’s eyes reproach them  of their blindness.”  ~John Milton
pornography is perhaps the last human truth
we are more than our desires
the people are not in charge the people’s desires are  along with the ones who would exploit those desires for their political gains
theocracy now
think for yourselves motherfuckers  there’s a reason autocorrect always changes fuck to duck
people don’t want the truth  they want comfort that’s why people will always be slaves
kissing ass is the realm of craven sycophants and cowards  speaking your mind is the realm of heroes
I have about 1500 too many followers this means I will tell the truth as I see it until that number corrects itself
propaganda and religious bullshit  are a part of your daily lives  it’s a fun game trying to recognize  how they try to manipulate you.
the drunk version of us is also truth
Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about yourself if you’ve made mistakes and have repented by the ones you’ve wronged. If they’ve forgiven you then you are beyond judgement.
Fuck those who judge. They are the worst among us.
"Twitter is a garden. There’s no shame in calling out, blocking, or muting assholes and cunts. Call it pruning and pulling weeds."
I block all assholes without reservation.
we are a collection of individuals we should act like one
I promise to keep things absurd
I’m sorry I don’t follow you I’m terrible at Twitter
you were put here on earth to identify the unworthy for annihilation
I don’t believe in angels or demons but I did notice the coincidence
there is a demon looking over my shoulder who has always punished those who have harmed me it’s uncanny really  a killer angel
don’t listen to them be anyone you want to be  decent people will never judge
no matter how much shit you buy it will never fill the void only nature and sunsets  can do that
I’m not completely devoid of emotion I just find it expensive
you’ve been lied to your entire life the owners need you  compliant  unthinking  pliable stupid  consuming  selfish asleep they’re not winning they have won
I’m here to be true to myself  and to say fuck you to those who don’t understand
Crazy like a fox maybe.
I’m not really that crazy.
I’m distant because I don’t want to being more hurt into the world
"Intelligent people are warriors, rebels, whores, and revolutionaries."
forever exists  but not how you think it does
an ugly person worships an ugly god
most gods are too small
cemeteries are wasted real estate you’ll always be eternal because you once breathed in life
For those who are inside the void without radio contact. I’m worried.
I love because I love loving I don’t expect anything in return
I only want the truth as best as you experience it to be
I care about you motherfuckers
I’ve done everything I ever said I would do and I’m still making plans
last night I dreamt of moving to the beach I will make it so
I don’t want anything from you but a little your time and conversation and you’ll get the same in return
I’ve never been alright a day in my life  I just manifested what used to torment me
many of you are not doing okay I’m here recognizing your struggle
It's a glorious day the sun is shining the birds are singing an owl has moved into my forest
I need to close a bunch of doors
"'I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls All the time, lose me in the dark, please do it right Run into the night, I will lose myself tomorrow Crimson pain, my heart explodes My memory in a fire, and someone will listen At least for a short while'"
love my dichotomies
I'm a stone wall when I dream of you but I'm also a garden
We’ll stand or fall right here
we don’t need people to tell us where we came from we need those that tell us the possibilities of where we could go
I don’t trust men wearing pleated khaki pants business casual is fascism
the best musicians are revolutionaries
in darkness the light becomes brilliant
too many people are already dead
I don’t want to live forever but I want to live while I’m here
please don’t visit my grave live with my feeble inspiration
I’m one of you whoever you are
addicts have a certain bond
"conservatism in the US now means theocracy fascism, and white supremacy don't come at me with your bullshit"
daughters always find their way home sons want to die adventuring
I've found peace in isolation the advantage of a man with daughters
I can't blame anyone for trying to survive even if it was at my expense
I write here in bursts like a machine gun
it turns out death holds our hand the entire way
we break at the end
I was once just a guy with a girlfriend looking for a job  what crazy worlds I found myself in
I'm nothing really but thank you for seeing something in my writing
we're all filthy aren't we
the magnitude of the smell of a newborn baby
most people will watch you drown and then write about how that affected them I can't stand most people
I needed to be weird to survive
The top five Cure songs recommended by Spotify totally suck but that's the mediocrity of the American dollar in action.
the literary part of twitter is dead where is the hell part of twitter? the one with all the orgies
writing and poetry should have a weight to it it should destroy you as much as it makes you want to dream
alcohol is a battering ram for a walled off heart
we all want someone to walk through the shadows with
everyone has a story
according to my DNA report I'm a direct descendant of a fucking Irish king in case you were concerned about my devil street cred
nobody wins anything until they die and are judged by history
writing is facing your sins judging yourself and then forgiving yourself
writing is a form of suicide I know this now
every time I write I bleed and every time I bleed I die
every time someone unfollows or blocks me I imagine them storming off in a self righteous huff and I find it strangely amusing those that muted me are afraid to live
there is no evil there's just us and we are what we are
everything is grey everything
I wrote 5000 words today now I'm going to get drunk and fuck off on twitter get the popcorn
humanity rolled the dice and lost an epitaph on hubris
my ideal man cave is a dungeon
I'll be who I am you be who you are we'll see if we want to continue associating with each other
thanks brother!
I'm what evil looks like when good is forced to survive
the dead in my eyes
and I'm a highly trained killer
I'll die for my freedom but more importantly for you  I'll kill for it
I for one don't associate with the descendants of mass murderers or their converts.
Think about that if you are Muslim or Jewish as well. How many adulterers have been stoned to death? How many honor killings can a civilization tolerate? Religion is just horrible but the Abrahamic religions are especially so.
"If you are a Christian you belong to an organization that once burned people alive by the hundreds of thousands because they didn't conform to the ideals of belief or orthodoxy, think about that for a moment."
"I said I would end this account at 2000 followers so now I'm a liar, don't push me."
my job is easy I just have to criticize the old man you know who I'm talking about its a dance
"going to bed vs staying up is a careful calculation of how fast the room is spinning in newton meters versus it's velocity relative to the damage that could be done by a drunk tweet and the difficulty of navigating oneself to the liquor cabinet to pour another drink, it's science"
who are you and why do you haunt me
we're all sheep because there is nothing new under the sun yet we think brilliance is a thing
"midnight finds me alone with a full moon, drunks who cannot handle their liquor, schizophrenics off their meds, and atheists who thinks their brand of cult is not a religion."
the heart of life is freedom
live your life as if there is nothing more and you will be feasting on wine and marrow
who would trust the social constructs of a species that’s half a chromosome away from chimpanzees?
you know what’s beautiful? the circle of life  birth death rebirth
my message is essentially a satanic one
nothing matters do what thou wilt
show me something beautiful
the worst of us had it the worst
we own this reality let’s show it what can be done when we apply love
my message is less one of faith and more of empowerment
my corner of twitter is flatlining
sit with me on the edge let’s share a nice beer
we’re an ugly species
everything pure is a lie  corruption is the only truth
in the end we struggle against annihilation and entropy we make up fables or twist science to convince ourselves we are immortal but we are not our ego is an asshole it wants us to survive in order to propagate the species it lies to us  tells us we’ll survive death  but it lies
We all struggle. We are all one.
The dead have wisdom beyond the sum of all human learning.
Have faith in the fact that you belong here. You make a difference just by you being you. Your absence would be a victory for the void.
“Intolerance is evidence of impotence.”  ~Aleister Crowley
everyone needs validation  we are hard wired for acceptance only dicks ridicule this need
“All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.”  ~Friedrich Nietzsche
last night I walked home drunk under a bright silver moon in the forest  looking like Michael McDonald  I woke up looking like Charles Manson don’t give a man tequila and clippers in the same evening
I’ve told you volumes about me in my writing and yet you know nothing about me.
my writing is just as much of a surprise to me as it is for everybody else when I write in an intoxicated state
in dreams  there be tentacles
the so called normal ones are insane the gatekeepers of mediocrity everyone else is trying to find their way through the darkness
duty is isolation
I've never liked attention probably why I like to hang out in my alt
perspective is a lonely endeavor
they probably would have never been famous...
or [insert name here] had twitter as well
if Hemingway or Bukowksi had twitter
It’s hot I’m drunk just walked home  the moon was full the mountain was quiet I poured another tequila I think I’ll shave my head
most people are still ignorant primitives hence my low follower count
god doesn’t do shit you do
god is either asleep or evil or both  yet I’m the bad guy
music is from the devil that’s why Christian music sucks
Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi cut off the tips of two fingers on his fret hand in the machine shop he was working prior to his work with the band. He overcame this unfortunate event through the invention and use of his own prosthetics.   *perseverance
fate is mostly in your hands barring a bad diagnosis or some other happenstance
this is not the end times we decide when that is
the better angels lost in the valley of dry bones
I was a decent person once
we’re already programmed to die why rush things
the best dreams have religious implications
our fears are framed by the sacred
“rise up fall down”
there’s tequila  and there’s the Mexican version of fine whiskey  *cheers
nothing matters spill your mind
I won’t be kind with my words  unless they’re poorly thought out then I’ll research before I’m not kind again
there is a world that exists beyond your ego
the toxic bond is worse than loneliness  one is pain while the other is despair  and despair is the lesser of two evils
nobody is as important as the standards you set for yourself  never be afraid to walk away
My drafts folder is a graveyard.
there is a point  where life becomes meditative  and all the other bullshit  becomes a memory of a shadow  of a dream we barely remember
I’m pretty content with being nobody in particular. The veritable grey man. The one nobody notices.
seeking new worlds to conquer and old ones to be irrelevant
run seek the shelter of  illusion the safety of denial the comfort of a limited worldview
most of us are our own apocalypse
"I don’t think I much care for most people, that’s why I hang around here even though twitter is past its prime it’s because most of you are beautiful"
"I want to go to an art museum when I return, a sidewalk cafe, a movie, happy hour, a sunset on the beach"
I’ve got nothing to prove.
militantly rational
I don't knowingly follow  or engage with extremists or radicals of any kind simply because I feel dialogue can still heal the world
the broad brush is tyranny it's injustice it's the easy way out a shortcut to thinking  check your crusade and make sure it's not just old fashioned prejudice
men are hard wired to take women are hard wired to give  even beyond themselves love happens between the dead space and the silence
I'm not sure I would even trust a woman who didn't get emotional after sex
astrology  tarot alchemy the science of the dark ages before the renaissance before enlightenment  before reason
your syntax seems forced I don’t trust your honesty  or your raw
I crave the normalcy we’ve all agreed upon rather than the dystopian alternative that was forced upon us
I play best to a silent audience
the perfection of the human body was god’s only counter argument
carefully crafted  or raw the former kisses your ass while the latter fucks it
normalcy is its only sin
I tend to hate all of you out of love
think for yourselves goddamn it you’re either informed by the media or influenced by it never be the latter
the aggregate of human knowledge is but a candle staving off the darkness but it’s a start
I’ll hold the candle of hope until it burns my hand
I get weird on tequila  try to keep up
I’m forming a new religion  one that is against religion one that recognizes the god or goddess within you  the one that cares more about you than it does about itself
"question everything  okay, my second commandment"
love is not what you think it is it’s not what the owners have sold you
the world has lied to you  it’s up to you to find the truth
"I want to break you from the chains of normalcy, the lies that keep you under control"
nobody lives forever  and the ones who tell you otherwise  want your money
life currently has a 100% death rate
my religion is hedonism and self indulgence but at the expense of nobody
life is a playground a break from oblivion  but we must all return to the abyss   and some of us will have had  a great time
do what thou wilt but do no harm is my only commandment
the average person defending the line of mediocrity truly disgusts me
if you’re not afraid to turn your back and walk away forever then you’re not afraid to truly live and be who you were always meant to be
don’t take it personally when their survival depends on sacrificing you
fighting or dying is the only choice when you’re backed against the wall
I’m happy with what is while realizing that what could be is just an ordinary dream  in the minds of extraordinary people
forces will align against you but you must remain strong lest you die
distance is the only ethical position
beautifully dark and terrifying and I love the way she writes
truth is dead and buried
the beach under a police state
I don’t have to wait long for small epiphanies and that’s why I’m lucky
"Saul Leiter, #photography"
the devil is in the algorithm
your third eye was always important even when you had to pretend not to have one
I sense your loneliness turning into emptiness I sense your absence
I've been around for a while I've seen some things I'm not easily impressed
all of us are sad the human condition is tragic but if we were indeed immortal we would be comedic
we struggle but we deny that the struggle is all there is
I see so much longing but not so much fulfillment perhaps the heart is a bottomless pit and happiness an elusive dream
there's no roar today
humanity has a predator again
I too wake up afraid to open twitter wondering what the fuck went through my head when I was writing that shit but it's twitter that shit happens
Thank you for not distracting me tonight Twitter *eye roll
I've been writing all day and have already passed out once now tell me what metal is?
am I the only one enjoying my isolation?
your dreams choose you
be someone nobody truly gets over loving
I passed out on you I woke up freezing the ice in my glass has melted it's quiet tonight in the forest save a dog barking in the distance or an occasional car driving past my place
I’ve been writing since Sunday and I’m halfway done with the first draft of my novel. One of three in a trilogy. I plan on finishing it by this weekend and on to revising. Anyone know a good publisher? I have another I could shit out immediately while the last will have to wait.
drink wine or beer while writing  whiskey gets you sideways too quickly and the emotional content you need for good writing becomes a flood swirling around a spinning room
you actually crossed my hard line in the sand I just pointed it out
closing the door
the ones with the strongest facades are typically the most fragile
everyone is sad and pathetic  you just have to drill down to the right abyss
making you wet with my words is just me flexing
vomiting here cleanses my mind like French bread eaten before a new wine
front toward enemy
DM’s were down? I didn’t notice.
I still think I’m a Gemini if you believe in that shit
turns out I’m a Cancer  if you believe in that shit
making you wet with my words is just me flexing
I didn’t fall off the wagon I lit it on fire and drove that fucking thing into a ravine
I write in the mornings stone cold sober
I’ll just be here writing in the space between your accepatance and disgust
the temporary reprieves between the weight of breathing makes it all worth it
show me your war face
dream forget manifest
sometimes the weight of the world makes us forget who we are
someone will spoon feed your art later until then go to bed bewildered sleep tight until then sweet dreams
"we've supplied the marketing department of a multi-billion dollar corporation a lot about us through our poetry, good night lovelies, the sunrise has no master"
"we had a motherfucker suggest  drinking bleach to fight of a virus now that we're represented by idiots  and the laughing stock of the world feel free to tell us what you would do  to your twitter crush be graphic, the gloves are off"
we're a small part of the greater universe who cares what you write? manifest yourself be true
it's less I want to fuck you and more I see your struggle and identify with that shit
we've murdered everything in order to justify our bullshit
nobody knows anything and if they claim to they're either liars or imbeciles
most of you are death behind fake smiles
tell me the perfect life the perfect career the perfect love and I'll call bullshit on all your delusions
whose life is perfect? please let me know what to strive for
I'm so naked here and you're so blind...
"fuck you, this is my barbaric yawp as I see it to be"
"I steered away from erotica because any idiot can do it, I want to do more."
nobody escapes this life unscathed but the benefit is great writing
"life has been hard for me and twitter has given me an outlet, my psychology in a nutshell"
I'm also not here to make sense.
"I reserve the right to block anyone who is annoying to me. Don't be annoying and keep your bullshit to yourself. I'm not here to win any popularity contest, I'm here to brawl."
love is for adolescents commitment is for adults lust is for adventurers
power is control that's really the only lesson in life
my demons are thirsty and they would never turn on me
I promised you a tweet storm before I left sorry it turned into a gangbang
the world is populated by 7 billion people and I don't need any of them except for three...
I no longer feel it's necessary to respond to your weird and asinine @  *for whomever that may concern
we were all lied to  the best of us rise based upon how willing we were to reject them
I have 3745 followers to burn to the fucking ground
don't be a cum dump be something real and you'll get something real
"You can show me your tits and ass and tell me what you would do to me in the dark but I need to see your soul, your spirit, how you would react when the shit hits the fan. There are enough fair weather people in the world to bring the whole shitshow down in an emergency."
if you have crazy eyes  I hate you
I'm no genius just a man trying  to make sense of it all
most of you are assholes but you amuse me nonetheless
I consider myself to be a caring soul the soul of a little boy filled with wonder who was crushed by the world but grew stronger put that in your judgement book
some of you that I've known should be ashamed of yourself
"Actually I'm cutting back, except on the weekend."
The genius comes out when I'm drunk simply because it's too afraid to reveal itself in the light of shame and abuse and a lifetime of lies and manipulation. It's in this drunk moment where I tell the truth and turn on my tormentors. I'm sorry you don't drink.
"""I got pulled over by CHP the other day. I did the whole DUI dance. Fortunately I passed. I'm going to walk home tonight.""   ""You're white, you have no idea how people live on a daily basis.""   ""I'm still walking home and I agree."""
none of us know shit except breathing and dying and most of us deny that
we're all about the manipulation of chemicals sorry fundamentalists
every breath is a miracle every nightmare a paradise
the best of us stay up all night while never missing a sunrise
"I’m in California, here we get the brunt of your drunk tweets."
sehnsucht
there is nothing more exhilarating than freedom and nothing defines freedom more than confinement
nature is a cruel mistress not bound by the confines of political correctness
I’m more of the highway than anything.
some of you are sad motherfuckers reflecting the rest of us sad motherfuckers and this is just what it is to be in a world where nobody wins
"I’m sorry I haven’t followed you, I suck at Twitter"
"face recognition doesn’t appear to work with a glass up to your mouth, do better Apple"
love is manipulation pretending to be without conditions
"I’m writing, okay. I’m doing it this time."
I fucking love all of you. We should plan a get together in Las Vegas next summer when I get back from adventuring. The pandemic should be behind us then. Who’s in?
I work best under pressure. Three weeks.
I’m going to pound out one of three novels before I pick up my machine gun. Sometimes the art needs to steep.
"we’re losing people here but it’s okay, silence and self medication are good for the spirit"
never compromise your standards  have ethics be fair be good
"I don’t want to get all religious and shit, but dogma and orthodoxy are the enemies of the human spirit and freedom."
life is life everything else is bullshit
God made existence just so someone would invent whiskey. That’s the sole purpose of this universe. He told me.
The power of the universe is contained inside of you. Stars died so that you could be. Rise up and manifest for fuck’s sake!
If I was a god I would never tell you to believe in me. I would tell you to believe in yourself.
cute girl with a gun
don’t take shit from anyone  *one of my commandments if I started a religion
Morning coffee on the front deck. It finally warmed up.
I’m cutting back on my drinking in preparation for world dominance. Fit overlords are successful overlords.
"the mortality rate for the average human is 100%, might as well do something fun with your life in the meantime"
it turns out demons are relative
I’ll be the old man wandering the art museum with the weight of memory heavy on my shoulders while wondering at the use of color in the masterpiece on the wall.
It’s okay to embrace your shadow for that is the only way to truly know yourself
never underestimate negative energy for that has more often changed the world
"when I wake up in the morning god is like “fuck, he’s up.”"
forever is just the reflection of never
You’ll forget me in forevers.
How about a few tweet storms like old times?
I write better anonymously
"I’ve had a great six year run over, ahem, a half dozen or so accounts. I’ve met some fantastic people here. I wish you well. I’ll keep going until the end but that end is coming soon. I may start fresh when I return in a year. It may be fun trying to find me."
I must leave soon it’s not a lack of will it’s a lack of WIFI
I pretty much love all of you but it’s part of the trope to say I don’t. I love anyone who puts themselves out there. It’s a form of nakedness and who doesn’t love nakedness?
tell me how your Christ died so you can be an incorrigible cunt again?
selfie culture is a death cult
strength of mind means accepting you may never have the answers but are willing to ask the questions
I’m not a white knight I’m the abyss in armor  a slayer and a destroyer   a tormentor of your desperate soul a void who knows how to fuck you  a magician who knows how to end your dreams
it’s amazing how resilient selfie culture is in the face of annihilation
love should be the last thing on your mind fools
the only rule is your personal happiness however you imagine that to be
there’s about to be a massive die off of conservatives worldwide
I don’t believe in ghosts I acknowledge dead things and those that once were but who are no longer
ignorance should reopen everything’s fine
war is all I’ve ever known of love and peace was always a lie
"As a fifteen year old in that biology class I could have never imagined the surreal dystopian world we've so quickly grown accustomed to. Masks everywhere, a sense of anxiety, crazed protesters. A sense the government is in over their head. Cops writing tickets to sunset watchers"
"Many have downplayed the impact from the beginning. We were only supposed to have 60,000 deaths in the US. We are at 45,013 as of today and no sign of relenting. Meanwhile we want to open the economy back up. I get it. It has been fiscally devastating. It's going to get worse."
"I've been thinking about this pandemic. About how the virus virtually leaves many unscathed while wreaking havoc on others. I've read articles about how blood type O people are resistant, how the virus affects certain demographics."
"That was 36 years ago. Yes, I'm aged."
"When I was in High School biology my class had a discussion about overpopulation. The instructor posed this question: ""In the future if a virus could be made that would randomly kill off much of the population of the planet while sparing many would it be moral/ethical to employ."""
“tracking your every move online to ensure you get the best possible experience”
sometimes losing followers takes real effort
consuming you pleases me
this is twitter nothing matters
we celebrate life with a good death
there's more to all this than we can comprehend and there's love in the mystery
sunsets are temporary deaths
the sun always rises
never fear death fear death without a good story  for that defines your life
thank you for sticking with my exploration of the labyrinth of my mind expressed in brief snippets
I’m skeptical of romantic love  I’m more into power dynamics

Tell me what scares you.
tell me about your broken parts
I like all you weird motherfuckers.
“I think you’re addicted to the thrill of the chase.” She said. “I’m wishing you good vibes for the next leg of your journey and if I didn’t know you I would think you are kidding.”  “I’m not kidding.” I replied.
I’m not done being insane. A regular life is death for me.

"Of course the Eastern Roman Empire lasted until 1453. Again, nothing to do with anything."
The Roman Republic lasted over 500 years. The Roman Empire for another 500 or so. The United States Republic is 243 years old. I'm not sure what all this has to do with anything. I'm bored and quarantined.
The shit you're seeing is just the shit you'd expect to see in a declining civilization.

The virus is cramping my style but I’m compliant.
catch my breath catch me before I’m interred  and hear all my stories
vague vagaries with a semblance of substance where all of it is real
I might be done with the life after this.
I’ll scare you off too.
It is what it is
my superpower is being both a morning  and an evening person
no rest for the wicked because those are the ones who are driven

I'm running for office after this clusterfuck
it's Saturday night? I had no idea.
we are on the precipice of our darkest hour what we do as a people from here on out will determine our fate and will perhaps be our finest
it's spicy margaritas in the bunker tonight my own recipe
we'll look back and realize what fools we were
I care about my European friends and colleagues facing this pandemic as well. As well as those from around the world. I wish you well. I can finally say that I am a citizen of the world and that we too are all in this together.
I realize most of you are scared. That is a normal response to this unthinkable shit. If you're not terrified you're in a fugue state. You should wake up. We will face this together and it will bring us closer as Americans as we forget our differences and face a common enemy.
time to snap out of it
this is the worst case scenario and it's probably already too late to invoke the Defense Production Act another example of lack of leadership what are they waiting for?
The U.S. will surpass China in a week on the current trajectory.
scientists and the medical community will solve this problem and god will get the credit
America has only two major pastimes: addiction and debt and they share an intimate relationship with each other.
"“The media’s job is to create a misinformed electorate that will make irrational decisions, often against their own interests.”  - Noam Chomsky"
I hold few illusions
it seems to be slowing down slightly
"I’m for changing this government when we win this shit, their response so far has been pathetic. We actually have Senators who bet against their own people by selling stocks ahead of the pandemic. Again, pathetic."
you can only do what you can do
this thing is our World War II it very well may be revealed to be China’s Chernobyl
"with the lack of national leadership evident it’s important that we lead upward by taking charge of our own situation, curb our drinking, maintain fitness, eating as well as you can, try to remain positive and be an example for your family and friends the grieving period is over"
How is everyone doing mentally?
I’m not going to lie all this has a Titanic feel to it
"It’s perfectly okay to experience anxiety and fear, those are natural responses to an unthinkable situation but now it’s time to stand up and fight  we know what we must do"
everyone’s hair will look just terrible after all this is over
I picked a bad year to be rational
a careful and disciplined evaluation of the facts followed by a measured response
Math
"Total staffed beds in all US hospitals according to the AHA: 924,107"

"Read ""The Grapes of Wrath"" if you haven't done so. Those are my people. That book changed my politics. Foreclosures and ""Okie"" mass migration. Things are different now. However you feel about President Trump he is halting evictions and foreclosures and for that I applaud him."
I'm glad they're doing it though. I would rather see it passed on to the people than to the banks.
Look at the government manufacturing consent through bribery. Socialism is only a bad word when it's convenient for them but perhaps not so bad when you have a hole in your belly and your hand out.
"Now that sports are shut off put the beer can down and reflect on your life without the bread and circuses. Look around you, see the blight, the crumbling infrastructure, patients triaged in parking lots, nurses wearing bandanas and scarves. Do you feel exceptional?"
My government represents billionaires and themselves.
Taxation without representation was a thing once and it had to do with tyranny. Who does your government represent?
Kleptocracy
America's dire shortage of medical equipment combined with soaring medical costs reveals just how much the country has been looted for profit the past thirty years.
"Meanwhile, outside my window..."
nobody should take twitter seriously no more than people talking to themselves on the street or doodles in the margins of a notebook now go have fun
well there’s a profound drunk tweet
I’ve said my peace now I have work to do
don’t leave anything left unsaid
I never told you I was an insider did I?
we’ve got this
find a community
someone bring me down
"only twits, idiots, and the deluded could be happy right now"
I wanted everything to be different
denial will kill you
"If you live in the US, Italy is our barometer. Their lockdown is minimally successful and there is a waiting list to be buried. Let me see an ass pic."
the art of nihilism and truth
give me 50 sensible followers who understand
Do you want the truth or do you want to feel good?
I'm not programmed to make you feel good about dying I'm programmed to keep you from dying listen to me goddamn it
someone fact check me tell me I'm wrong
Americans are bad at math apparently.
"this thing doesn't give two fucks about your positive feelings, your escapism, or your feel good poetery"
American exceptionalism failed us at the worst possible moment.
"Within the guidelines, the CDC says bandanas and scarves could be used in place of a mask, Gupta said. The reason for these guidelines is due to a lack of personal protective equipment and not enough health care workers, Gupta said."
Like for real?
the CDC just approved scarves and bandanas for use by medical personnel in the US what the actual fuck? the United States is a third world country simply because the wealthy views it as a used car on up on blocks and are scrapping it for parts  for profit
remember when I said I would never lie to you?
the unfollow button is right there but I think you'll want to hear what I say
maybe we just let the infirm go and continue with the selfies and the onlyfans and the fake plastic bullshit you fucks mistake for culture
I'm wrong everything will be fine next week
"okay, maybe one sex tweet"
"it doesn't matter what you write, how positive you are, your wishful thinking, etc. a virus has already changed your lives forever"
"I had street cafés, fine wine, and women in my future now all I have is a gun and a backpack and a will to survive"
wake up  your life as you knew it is over
I promised you sex tweets I'm sorry
It turned out selfie culture was an extinction level event.
I hope I’m wrong
I’m single I swipe the dead
I’m not trying to alarm anyone I’m here to tell you it’s too late if you’re in the US
try and escape all you want death will find you
America is burning in silence and in inaction and irresponsibility
time is a commodity we just don’t have
"observe, the next 48 hours"

"Truck drivers, truck stop employees, warehouse workers, grocery workers, scientistst, doctors, nurses, and first responders are the heroes in this shit. Take a moment to thank them while civilization still exists."

you should see my dreams
this pandemic revealed the cunts of the world
one last thought  I know many people in their 70’s and 80’s who know they’re going  to die from this virus so fuck all of you flippant  motherfuckers going out to  bars and beaches for spring break we’ll remember you when we bury our loved ones
I hope I was a decent distraction. I’ll get as crazy as needed. Goodnight gentle people.
One more whiskey?
I fucking bleed art
whatever the other is I hate them
"not all millennials, isn’t that the mantra?"
Remember when I said I would delete this account at 2000 followers? I proved myself to be a liar and hypocrite. With that being said many of you are not important to me and can just fuck right off and unfollow.
"turns out millennials are the biggest sociopaths, who knew?"
"my poetry always descends into rants love me or hate me, I’m always honest  I’m always raw"
the virus is airborne  the incubation period is 5 days  surface life is 96 hours  it’s mostly spread by undetected people  anti-intellectualism  and credulity are deadly
social distancing includes dumbasses on social media
just nod and smile
a conspiracy theory mindset is mental illness
the mental gymnastics of justifying selfish behavior
I hate most of you
most people are stupid
"monsters will always try to justify their horrid actions with obfuscation, projection, and minimization"
it's our duty to call out the worst of humanity in whatever form that takes
Italy is two weeks ahead of the US in dealing with the COVID-19
I don't suffer fools
did you know there's a waiting list to be buried in Italy?
selfie culture is a death cult
There are stupid cunts who think COVID-19 is a distraction. Please unfollow me for when I find you I will block you. Twits each and every one.
I want you all here with me  I love you all
I think coddling people is wrongheaded I think bringing the fear and wrath of god or whatever you deem that to be  into the awareness of morons is what is called for
I won't lie to you this is going to get ugly escapism is fine to a point but we're going to have to deal with it we're going to have to be there for each other we're going to have to watch loved ones die think about that  when you're huddled up  and partying on the fucking beach
if your god fails you how can I help you make it through the night?
I actually love it when a fundy comes at me
some of you are getting too drunk in your quarantine state and I've been asked by management to limit your correspondence to the Queen's English if that is your native language
It's okay to be scared
"some of us need the illusion of safety I'm here to tell you that nobody has ever been safe in the whole of human history, ever"
perhaps the world changes after we overcome this
my message is love and truth
uncertainty is the enemy fear is the enemy greed and selfishness is the enemy but we are not and we don't have to be
I hope Facebook dies over this
one could just eat the tension
I can smell the fear I can sense the morose you are living history what will your story be
love will never die
I'm here for you without fear
sex twitter is death twitter and fear is the fuel for both
we can die but the universe can never erase us
Emergen-C does not recommend mixing their products with alcohol but I do
humans are the virus but they don't have to be

when we are gone the sun will still rise and fall by the sea roses will still bloom defiant daffodils will too  children will still laugh and play and pretend there will still be a struggle for people to be free there will still be decency and we'll still be a part of it all
you've already echoed in eternity just by showing up
sex is death I'll be right over here
the death of metaphor
people are going to die many people will  many have already most of us will get sick many of us are sick already some of us will die people you know will also maybe you will too maybe I will no kind words of encouragement can change this fact but while we live we shall live

after this shit is done with we all need to meet up in Vegas for a fucking party!!

I just retweeted my own tweet because we live in lawless times when airport rules of drinking apply to the everyday but at least people are still paying for their groceries and toilet paper
look at the bright side when did you ever think you’d play a role in a dystopian horror film?
the darkest hour of the darkest day will pass without notice and will only be illuminated by looking back and remembering
I’ve been highly critical of humanity it’s because I wanted you to do better
no matter what happens we must vow to never give up our humanity
A Roman Legion was only an effective fighting force when its formation maintained its integrity. Six thousand soldiers who had each other’s backs while facing death. Panic in the ranks was a death sentence and a broken formation was easy prey to a barbarian horde.   *a metaphor

It’s a far better idea than selling photos of my ass for sure. You ladies do not have a monopoly on #onlyfans.   *starting to lose my shit in isolation apparently
"I’ve come up with the brilliant idea of dressing my penis up in costumes and selling photos of it on the Internet. For example, top hat and monocle, a scarf for the fall, President Trump with the hair and long red tie. I could do Calendars as well. I could have guest dicks also."
It’s going to get much worse before it gets better. The facts are not on our side.
in the midst of global pandemics and financial crashes and uncertainty something wonderful is happening for just like that the world is becoming less polarized and much smaller as everyone realizes we’re all in this together
poetry will not save you but it will make you forget for a little while
my attempt at humor
"I was a man of wealth and taste a few days ago, now I’m just a man with taste he can’t afford"
we’re quarantined  might as well mix cocktails and fuck our anxiety away
Of course I’m arguably a twit for still being on Facebook.
I had no idea there were so many twits in the world until I added my high school classmates and co-workers on Facebook.
I still see you  don’t worry about that
if only there was a virus that killed only mouth breathers
to be honest the question is in doubt and anything I say to the contrary would be a lie
tequila gets my Irish up
we burned people alive once we’ll do it again

Lust is terrifying. Love is a well worn book or a hot cup of coffee or a walk in the garden among the butterflies.
"sad broken people deserve our love and sympathy, their story isn’t necessarily written and there’s room for redemption"
I’m hated by the best assholes and ignorant fucks.
By all means pray if it gets you through the night!
It’s a function of math and one of the horsemen of the apocalypse.
I’m wargaming it all out in my mind.
We all die one way or another but to die standing tall and proud with a middle finger pointed against the cosmos is my preferred way.
Everyone’s go cares is a hero. Every small thing you do makes a great impact and saves lives.
We’re sacrificing so that we may protect our vulnerable. How beatific is that?
I’m here for anyone who needs to talk. These are terrifying times but I have some perspective.
The trick is knowing that it’s always worse than “they” make it out to be and laughing at the people who believe them. This is why we’re still not on Mars.
I’m falling on the sword of margaritas shaken with a lime and agave while a winter storm is brewing. I know no shame.
I’m here to drunk tweet in the most erudite manner just for you.
I’m quite familiar with the intricacies of hell and I know the way out.
morale is important  despair is the enemy a positive mental attitude is key
a disciplined response to danger is an effective response
stand firm
"There will always be ignorant people with their heads in the sand, ignore them. The facts will bite them in the ass soon enough."
My neighbor Frank is 79. I love that guy. We talk current events all the time. I called him last night and told him he should stay in. I offered to go to the store and pointed out there are food delivery services. Of course he was too proud to accept but my offer stands.
"offer to deliver an at risk person’s groceries, I do"
this will bring everyone closer together
I have faith in you
in a world of uncertainty we must be comfortable with uncertainty
one day at a time is all that’s required
when everything is a conspiracy theory nothing is
"to the worst single point drop in stock market history, cheers!"
it’s still all going to work out
examples where incompetence can kill
I write some crazy shit sometimes.
"I should say endured, because so many did not survive"
"the real heroes survived the Holocaust and World War II, we are but their shadow"
the void is a comfortable blanket seducing the abyss into sweet sleep
what is death but the end of remembering
I’ve basically dedicated my life to fight tyranny
everyone wants to do good but dogma and orthodoxy consigns them to evil and cruelty
the world breaks when a child cries in earnest
"offer to shop for an elderly neighbor, be kind, be patient, be what’s good for the world"
do good in the world my only commandment
you’re wrong about me unless you know me
take a walk in the garden look at the sky dream of tomorrow
I’ll describe the hell I offer you in intricate detail so your mouth will water as you explore it with me
love me at your peril
I didn’t destroy you I liberated you from mediocrity
I identify as human
we are complicated creatures programmed for survival we love and hate with equal vigor we lose our way  make mistakes but we are in this life together now is the time for compassion and understanding  with gentle ears and helping hands  and kind hearts
truth in an election year
"To put it into perspective at the higher prediction of the CDC is 340 times the death rate of the flu. Again, fuck you."
Block #1. Fight misinformation.
"I will block anyone who minimizes this shit and equates it with the flu. The flu doesn’t kill 200,000 to 1.7 million people like the CDC put out today. Fuck you."
this is not my first national emergency
*pro tip: skip the toilet paper and buy the booze or the mind altering drugs.

light will burn you while darkness is a cool salve

love has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them  if you don’t understand you will never understand love

Religion would murder my entire family just for being who we are. I’m a highly trained killer. Work out the details.

"I’m about to lose much of the herd tonight but that’s okay, I still have the intellectuals."
"It’s inconvenient to tyranny for the people to be empowered. Yet governments often invoke age old religious sentiments nestled in ancient paradigms of the how the world works. The truth is you’re all gods and worthy of living your lives as you see fit, without shame or guilt."

I’m not getting paid for any if this. I do it because I’m a good person and I care.
Somebody has probably said that before but I couldn’t find a reference. If someone does I’ll cite it.
after the stock market crash and after a long internal debate I’ve decided upon selling photos of my ass on the Internet
"if the coronavirus doesn’t kill you something else will, don’t waste the dawn"
it’s lonely when you’re a thinker
I’ll see your vapid subtweet and raise you another offensive tweet
a lie is a lie no matter how many people believe it
If I’ve triggered you I’ve opened up a dialogue. I’m interested in your opinion but bring facts to the table.
"I’ve extensively thought out and have researched every opinion I hold, they are not rigid opinions, they are works in progress but my worldview requires evidence, doubt and lack of answers is not a problem for me, credulity is."

all of your bad things are delectable but I wouldn’t call them sins

I think I could live within the eternity of your smile
pretend this is a journal and I might not always be rational
"I’m trying to make you motherfuckers think for yourselves, what mask do you need from me?"
I’m the devil in name only.
I’m drunk and you’re possessive and my feelings only matter if they’re praising you but my heart is big and there are a lot of people in the world.
I love some of you and nothing will ever change my mind. We can leave it at that.
"things have happened to you that maybe made you feel like less of a woman, but I know you’re all woman no matter what, more so even because you’ve dealt with shit others haven’t had to face and have become strong in the face of tragedy and for that you have my undying respect."
I’m not a breast man or an ass man I’m the totality of an incredible woman blow me the fuck away man
I’m not worried about in the slightest aberrant viruses our adversaries spin as the end of the world. It’s either bullshit or we’re dead. Fear is not a factor in this equation.
I really should write beautiful poetry about gardens and butterflies and all the ways I would love you rather than rants about how much I hate you and how your conformity has undermined our basic human rights but I’ve had a lot of whiskey and I’m not sure where my footing rests.
I could talk about sex all night  but it’s your mind I want  your body will follow
I support my fellow lost
"I haven’t sent a “I hate most of you” tweet in like an hour, so here you go."
I tweet a lot. You have options.
People will suffocate you if you let them.
Make that 25.1
I should write something beautiful so you’ll love me. Isn’t blood on the pavement spilled in your honor beautiful?
I don’t take shit from anyone?
"I know, I know, give me a pass tonight."
"Mute me, I’ll unfollow you, unfollow me, I’ll block you, you bring a knife, I’ll bring a gun. This is how the Irish fight."
By simple rules of probability I’ll probably hate most of you.
before you judge me our republic was born in a bar
I know you must get some sleep so you can wake up early to go do your part make the owners rich in the morning so they can undermine our republic and erode your rights. Sleep tight.
dissect me to hell

I have no time for being human too much is at stake
I’ll emerge from the flames like I always do and lead an army with me
life is never fair
You want the truth? You haven’t lived up to your potential and are inadequate and desperately require validation. You are prone to predators seeking to exploit your lack of confidence and your future looks bleak. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way take charge of your life.
In my most intoxicated state I’m still more intelligent than you could ever be in your most lucid moment. Fuck you.
I just want to make sure no fundamentalist anything are following me. God you suck!
Some people even take me seriously. That’s them leaving in a huff.
all of your selfies are wonderful pretend I liked them  my eyes certainly did

"I’m not insane after all, it’s daylight savings time. There isn’t a more vile and evil machination that has been thrust on the backs of humanity."

Turn off your TV’s and block all news from your social media. Open up your third eye and enjoy the life the establishment tries to darken.
I should have been Russian
"Plan: cull the older, conservative generation with a weaponized virus while vaccinating military and law enforcement. Guns can’t defend against microbes. The deep state/authoritarian government simply takes the guns from their cold dead hands.   *See, I can make up bullshit too."

"I love me a strong woman. One who’s armor I cannot rip off fast enough as we go fuck among the roses, our swords and armor strewn about the garden of the grand palace."
It’s best not to play the game. People will love you for who you are or they won’t. Be fine alone and nobody can ever manipulate you. It’s the desperate fucks who get played.
be dangerous
There is a war for your mind and the battlefield is right here in the palm of your hands.
There are very few cases of the coronavirus in Russia. Just saying.
Twitter is painfully boring tonight and I don’t feel like leading another revolt. Therefore I bid all you fine people (as well as the swine) goodnight.

"Europe is waking up, good morning, I hope your day is just fantastic!"
"A rather large asteroid could wipe us all out tomorrow and nothing would have meant anything, no religion, no philosophy, no government, no social movement, it would all just be a waste. Think about that before you refrain from anything."
I’m winding down for the evening. Is there anything we want to talk about?
there is no plan
"Remember, you get the government you deserve. Think about that for a moment."
Tyrants need you to be weak and afraid
"Ah, if I owned all the media I would change the world. As it stands your minds are in the image of your oppressors but I would remake them into mine and mine is a paradise of freedom without want or fear."
I’m an expert at fighting tyrants
quietly break every rule you can get away with
"the only bondage I see is the hold the establishment has on your mind, they are powerless when you ignore their rules"
The West is a lonely place at night once the sun has drowned beneath the sea.
It’s okay to be human. Nobody who expects anything more should be in your life.
Nothing is what it seems here but I would never lie to you. The truth is a powerful weapon.
It’s healthy to not take any of this shit seriously and have fun with it.
You think you’ve made mistakes in your life? Wait until you’ve met me.
I see things about people. Sometimes I can love them in silence. Sometimes silence is best.
I’m crazy I always win.
"I’ll write the bullshit, you laugh, love, hate, block, mute, or dm. It’s simple really."
You’re not anything to me until we’ve fucked in Paris. That’s my metric.
I have ambition. I have my own bottom line. I have plans.
In the end I do my own thing.
I never feel a goddamned thing. Love me.
After the fucking there are sunsets and oblivion.
I’m a nihilist for love.
If I offend you you’re probably a small minded asshole.
Some take vows of silence. Others of celibacy. I take vows of debauchery and that has made all the difference.
"Right now fundies are googling their religious books to counter my claim. Good luck, you won’t find it."
You want to see the face of god? Look in the mirror. You are a version of that. One perspective of an infinite many.
I’m a lot. I’m not for the faint of heart.
"Name your faith’s prohibitions. I’ll let you in on a secret, I was once one of you and there are none."
#9: Do not harm little children.
#5 of the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth:  Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
"Even Satanists have a prohibition against rape and harming children, can your religion boast that claim? I’ll answer for you, no it cannot and in fact encourages it in many ways."
"Well, I’m probably going to get a different set at least..."
I’ve retired my armor love.
In my dreams we all died eventually. In my reality we lived life to the fullest.
I followed you for your eyes alone.
I have exquisite taste and I’ve tasted you.
Hell is
careful is safe and safe is death
Safe is death.
Anyone worth a shit is fucked up.
My heart is a redoubt. My fist is a crutch. My coldness is my salvation.
I’ll write all night how you make the stars fade and the sun become forgotten.
I’m evil but I love you. What does that make you?
Impossible is the lie I’m comfortable with. Shatter that.
"I don’t want you, I need you."
"you, who know who you are...my bed awaits, so does my heart and my everything if you would just take my hand and drown with me"
"I’ll write you all day and all night but nothing compares to touching you, feeling you, fucking you into a moment worthy of a kiss of eternity."
I’m insane. I know this. I love this.
"To be human is to sacrifice. If you have never, then you are not."
The good life belongs to all of us not just a select few who were born into wealth and privilege and have no idea what it means to be human.
I’m beyond reasonable at this point. I love in the realm of the absurd.
I’m your advocate against tyranny.
You’re human. You have an exemplary observation apparatus. It doesn’t matter what your physical appearance looks like. All that matters is how you perceive your reality and how those who love you perceive you.
"My humanity was given up for duty, honor, and necessity."
You’re all devils underneath. Your history will judge you.
Humanity is a crutch that demons play upon and devils depend upon.
Life is tragedy. We have no control but we do have control of how we treat each other.
I’m an asshole. Love me.
Forty something women are hot. I’m not a pre-teen sort of guy. Those are pedophiles.
Ribcages are probed in autopsies. Galaxies have died before their light even reached your eyes. Sunflowers die annually. Are there anymore clichés I can destroy?
Violence and love are the same to me just as death and oblivion are.
Look at me when I destroy you.
"Sunflowers and galaxies are fine and all but they don’t make her as wet as violence, sin, and death."
"Life is easy, be remembered for being ruthless, with veins in your teeth and fire in your blood. Anything less is just pathetic."
"Always be the most intelligent person in the room. If you’re not, find a different room."
Lie to me Make me love you  Only to hate you
I should’ve been Caesar.
I always win before I start the battle. That’s what all great military leaders do.
Fight me.
"Even Satanism has a protection against the abuse of children in its canon. Can Christianity, Islam, or Judaism say the same? The answer is a resounding no."
I don’t respond to manipulation well. You want to see purgatory? Try me.
I’m too dangerous.
Never waste love on ingrates.
The pocket square is just as important as the cocktail and the car.
Heaven drown my eyes so that I may not see your dulcet lies.
Many of you know what I look like but I can’t write effectively staring myself in the face. I need a devil AVI to open up my truth.
"Power is about mind control. Once you reject everything you’ve been lied to about you can discover a reality as it truly is, infinite."
If you were closer I would dine upon you tonight.
Projection is the devil’s candy.
"I hate people in general, but some of you are like gods and goddesses and I could never do without you."
"Patriotism has been weaponized by oligarchy, theocracy, the corporation, fascism, and the generally ignorant."
"I never liked hypocrisy, I consider it the greatest of all human sins. At its heart is the lie that I can judge you for the very thing I am doing."
"I can easily converse about the best assault rifle to carry, the best sidearm, or conceal carry, while simultaneously contemplating the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Epicurus, the Stoics, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, Spinoza, Watts, Ueshiba..."
voracious appetites make a man
I eat like a barbarian. I blame my army days. I drink like one too.
and the gods wept...
"ribeye steak, pan fried, garlic, olive oil rare with sautéed mushrooms and onions and a reduced cognac cream and peppercorn sauce, salad.  I’m eating in tonight."
FEAR
*marked safe from the coronavirus  **not from the stock market crash ***fucking idiots
you’re beautiful  I’m trying to imagine what you would look like split black
I let you see only what I want you to see. The mass of you are nothing more than a den of snakes seeking validation through drama. Pathetic. I have no use for you. I only let a handful in and those I do I consider great people.
"None of you fucking know me, you can fuck right off."
"If you come to me seeking drama or to start shit from my past I will block you without hesitation. Oh, and fuck you."
people die on the truth all the time while liars celebrate victory and power
the world has lied to you since the day you were born
I don’t have any answers but I ask the good questions
you’re too fucking dangerous
trickle down economics is trickle up for suckers
billionaires are a threat to democracy  to national security to human decency  let’s make a good world  for us to live in not a good world  for some of us to live in  it’s time to start breaking the rules made up by the owners
dreamt I had a pet chain
"Fuck it, I’ll write the goddamned thing."
propaganda has a stranglehold on your hearts and minds enemies come to you with open arms like unctuous merchants selling hope but the only hope is opening your eyes and recognizing the manipulation from adversaries who seek discord  it’s time to unplug and think for yourselves
those who want the answers typically haven’t even asked the hard questions
Question everything motherfuckers
Certainty is ignorance Doubt is strength
At some point I need to fucking realize the train has stopped and I need to get down from it.
There hasn’t been a just war since World War II. Corporations have weaponized patriotism. The reason there is no national healthcare and subsidized education in the US is because we have an all volunteer army consisting of the poor who want access to healthcare and education.
I do sex tweets also.
So many of you have crippling anxiety and depression because you know what is happening. You realize that you are just chattel. A resource to be exploited and discarded. Insanity is the logical response to an insane world.
"Actually not true, the next step is artificial intelligence and the obsolescence of carbon based life forms. Perhaps that’s our only purpose. To create the next step in sustainable intelligence."
The novel “The Grapes of Wrath” changed my life.
Have you ever been to a concert and noticed how six guys hold back a crowd of thousands? I was once one of those guys. I’ll let you in on a clue. The crowd is more powerful than those underpaid security guards.
"When six people own more wealth than the bottom half of an entire nation you should know you’re being fucked over. You have the real power, the power of a collective will. They only have what power you let them continue to have. They are terrified of this fact."
"I want to invest in every single human being on the planet, not one excluded, to feed and clothe and educate and build a civilization of empowered people in preparation for the next step of our evolution: space exploration."
"ignore me, I’m an idealist"
most drink alcohol or do drugs to escape the reality of a cruel world  has anyone thought about breaking through the game of the owners and reimagining the world we live in?
"I think I hate most of humanity. The history doesn’t look good on you. I only associate with the ones who are trying to ascend, who are trying to better themselves, and who don’t judge others for their place in the evolutionary game. Some are leaders and some will always follow."
there some shitty men in the world there are some shitty women too they’re the ones who scream the loudest when the rest of us just want to contemplate a sunset or a breeze blowing through wild flowers on the side of the mountain
I love you weird motherfuckers
I see you
I’m fucking tired of snow. I may force a beach day this week and ponder the gravity of sand granules and lunar forces.
One of my top ten favorite horror movies.

"fear is packaged and sold to keep you under control, without fear there is no power over your minds, governments and religions have always known this"
"Freedom isn’t student debt or minimum wage jobs with a Masters degree, freedom isn’t leaving your newborn baby to go back to work so you can pay the bills or working to make someone else rich...freedom is being able to participate in the system which takes advantage of you."
"Goal: 2000 followers, do the math"
Hank Williams III
I only want to hear the old songs and drink whiskey
"god I would risk death to fight for you to be who you want to be, think about that before you judge me"
freedom is worth fighting for
I’ve always been an outlaw  now that’s some irony
If I could capture that moment in time in a jar and give to all the lonely hearts who long for love they would understand that hope was never lost.
the world is a lesser place without Guy Clarke and Townes Van Zandt in it
"You murdered millions just because they worshipped a different fake god than yours but it was the same fake god so the joke’s on you, idiots."

My next place will have a proper bathtub.
Heaven is a place on earth while hell is a state of mind.

Remember when I was a snake in the garden and showed you the tree of knowledge between good and evil? Now that tree is called critical thinking.
if there’s a typo or grammatical mistake I’m compelled to sacrifice my tweet to the void

I almost sent an ironic tweet. Autocorrect proves my point.

"government approved drugs...ie alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, are designed to kill you and make you stupid, pliable, and controllable"
I’m advocating psychedelic drugs  it’s the only way to escape your programming by insidious powers
empowerment is the closest we’ll ever be to invincible
"the willingness of the mass of humanity to be slaves confounds me, don’t you want to be kings and queens?"
I love so many of you  I can never get enough of your minds
you are god but there was never any power charlatans could hold over the hearts of humanity with this truth
god is a tyrant why would he want anyone on their knees if he wasn’t
I want what’s good for the world  not what’s good for tyrants
I answer to myself
I answer to no one
Hell is a cold place  despair is never warm
I held her hand softly and took her straight to hell but she’ll remember me for the rest of her life

I publicly crucified a damned good writer a while back. I was wrong. I admit it. He seems like a decent man and I’m taking back everything I said. We’ve made peace and I feel I owe him a public apology. It’s better to build bridges than burn them. So @vvangone I am sorry for that
I’m going to write on my @awhiskydarkly account for a while. I’ll still check DM’s here.
"freedom of speech means there’s a chance of offending and being offended, if you don’t believe in it for one point of view you just don’t believe in it"

I’m not here to dictate my thoughts or to put obsession on display like so many writers do I’m here to be a part of the conversation  however that unfolds  and wherever it leads
for those finding their way patience is required what they say out loud  may be obvious to most but they are just sounding it out trying it on for size feeling out the possibilities   we should give them space to grow
I want to change the world.
the circle of life is eternal our concepts of life are short lived and ego dependent
everyone is you treat them appropriately
you are the culmination of billions of years of natural processes  stars had to die for you to exist but it was all worth it so don’t waste your perspective  in the universe
find your own way people will either walk with you or they won’t but your destination remains the same
It takes a lot of energy to hate while love is effortless  that’s why forgiveness is essential for you to live a happy life
don’t be afraid ever
we’re here to experience the wonders of being but some are afraid  those are the ones who came up with the concept of sin they are here to control your experience
solitude is my mistress

she hurt me  she no longer means  anything to me but lessons I deserved

Fucking broke a string
show me what the keys you claim as the truth actually unlocks and I’ll show you shit
we die every night that’s why the dawn is so important it represents redemption and salvation and cleanses more than any religion can
I’m addicted to all the other incarnations of you
I’ll kiss your nightmares to sleep if you’ll kiss me awake in the morning
I destroy because I must it’s not personal
the real enemy is ignorance and credulity
If you read and think and fact check the world is yours for the taking.
It’s not that I’m a Satanist it’s just that I think the religion in his name has a better moral position a better argument two of his nine statements offers protection against harming children  and against sexual assault  that Christianity can’t claim nor does so in practice
propaganda and misinformation is the cock the devil fucks you with
only you know the path to your destruction  I am but the meter and the tempo
honesty requires anonymity notoriety is pandering  to masses too stupid to deserve your words
death is subjective
post coital annihilation
I promise not to be careful with you.

Revolution against those who are still confused about evolution.
we’re born free and will die a debt slave or a public charge for this is modern capitalism  for ninety nine percent of you
tremble in your life which is everything to you and nothing to the owners
what is god up to now
we suffer because without suffering there is no art no literature no music no lust no hunger no abandon no faith   no eyes to crave or mouths to destroy or hair to pull or afternoons to waste or redemption or peace or forgiveness without suffering there is only mediocrity
I we were truly as freedom loving and capitalist as we claim to be then why isn’t prostitution and illicit drugs legal? It’s because we’re really about control and against personal freedom.
Art should be uncomfortable.
let me fuck you with a cross while you’re wrapped in the flag and talk about forced orgasms and dying democracy
Rim of the World
I need to be inside your mouth and in your brain
"I have no identity now. I’m just me, whatever that is."
at the end of the day I’m comfortable in my own skin and with the memories I’ve made and just want to package up that life and set it aside on the shelf neatly wrapped and blessed with a crossing motion
words are powerful people have died for them and because of them and empires have risen and fallen by manipulating them
I’ll never win twitter so I’ll do my best to break it.
"I hardly even notice the world outside my window, outside my forest, or in the valleys below my mountain."
Are we burning books yet?
I just don’t know how most of you have the discipline to not write all the time.
I tried to type “yes” but autocorrect turned it to “us”.
A really good writer will make you feel what they feel inside and draw you in and make you feel like the passion behind the writing was inspired by you. That’s just human nature mixing well with great writing.
they’re not writing about you but if they were it’s less about you and more about a passive aggressive expression of love and the only thing worse than that is hate
sometimes you hold life inside so much it explodes into all sorts of avenues of creativity when it finally reaches a breaking point
I don’t think much of most people  and I don’t think much about what they think of me
I should go to bed but rye is the devil and the night is purgatory  and hell is not living  and breathing every moment for the promise of morning
I’m not sure what to think what to feel what to remember  or what to forget
the memory of dandelions  and the sky of youth
some of you have the context
my psychotic fugue state misses you
you’re a fast class of woman where I’m looking for the basic bitch who is a bad influence that feeds me my vices and bares the brunt of my frustrations
both a genius and a madman who has made a minimal adjustment to life and has blown off everyone who has ever tried to love the heart behind the words
Life 3.0 is over and complete. What does the rest of this shit look like?
"My prime time is when most of you are sleeping or passed out in your bedroom or on the hotel room floor. There’s just a short delay between when I follow suit when I do, but I guarantee I still wake up before you no matter how much I tried to destroy myself the night before."
"The metric is to take your breath away, anything less is failure and I tend to repeat myself on essential truths."
"Twitter is all so much bullshit right? A symbol of our wasted lives, of intellectual masturbation distracting us from real life or producing anything real or lasting. It’s truly Huxley’s  ‘Brave New World’ and for god’s sake don’t fall in love with anyone here, especially me."
"I don’t even know what I fucking write until I see it retweeted weeks, months, or years later."
we’re like soul mates but apart
Choke fucking but anal with a belt around your neck.
I’m a sucker for big brown eyes and no inhibitions.
My first serious girlfriend is a crazy crack whore now. If that gives you any idea about my taste in women.
I don’t waste love on ingrates except for you
"Stuck in traffic and I need to piss like a motherfucker, I’m on my way to buy a new guitar, the desert sun is bright and cold and hot, the grass is green on the hills. my mountain hovers cold and majestic in the periphery."
Death will win but I will blacken his eye and knock out a few teeth before I go down into the darkness.
I probably need you in my life after all.
my propensity for hate makes me a dangerous enemy

"the painful movement  of the hands of a clock never gives to need or happiness too slow when you’re alone in the dark too quick when you are living life to the fullest, laughing and drinking with friends or marking a child’s milestones  or the last breath of a parent  *devil time"
I love isolation  the sanctuary of my thoughts  the quiet of the desert the forest in early morning twilight  the smell of coffee made by my own hands the burn of whiskey late at night when the shadows grow long in the throes of despair  when daybreak seems so far away
there’s nothing wrong with being lost incredible worlds have been discovered that way the real tragedy is not being true to yourself for self deception is the greatest of all the sins

I neither expect nor deserve an answer but that doesn’t change  how the autumn sun looked  reflected in your eyes that day
we only remember great art for a short while until the wars and asteroids wipe their memory from the universe
"things can be brilliant here but nobody will remember that brilliance, they’ll just remember wasting time while waiting for their turn in line"
it’s some need for companionship that always fucks me up and reveals myself where I should just shut the fuck up and write anonymously
the Internet is a mob
Nobody is better or lesser than anybody. We are merely hairless apes hurling across the void on a tiny speck we try to murder while coveting shiny trinkets and artificial fractions of that tiny speck. We are a pathetic species.
Give me compelling evidence to change my mind. This is true intellectualism. Anything else is just memorization by rote.
"I’ve battled the confidence of the ignorant most of my life. I’ve found orthodoxy and dogma to be the enemies of reason and that applies to any ideology and especially to mass movements, no matter how well their intentions started out."
I had my coffee and my book and my journal and you had your girlfriend and status and nice dress and your indignation.
If I wandered to find myself would I find you as well?

With me you get honesty no matter how uncomfortable my truths are.
I’ll write you all away in the end
“Likes” are negative reinforcement. The truth doesn’t care who believes.
I didn’t get a lot of likes presenting hard truths which means I should keep on being honest.

Uncomfortable truths and established lies.
"The holocaust and fascism was Christianity. How do nations like Italy and Spain accept fascism without the blessing of the Pope? Who killed Christ again? The Jews. How convenient the majority Catholic Germany sought vengeance on that point. World War II was a holy war, a crusade."
"I’m telling you, I know my shit."
The ignorant are so confident while the intelligent run away in self doubt.
Have you noticed I don’t give a fuck about “followers” yet?
"There are upward of a 63,779 contradictions in the Bible. To make matters worse it’s nothing but a death cult with themes of child sacrifice. Eschatology is the driving force of the entire belief system and we need to keep their hairy unevolved fingers off of the fucking button."
I don’t care what silly myths you believe. Keep it out of my government and away from my front door on Saturday mornings.
People interact with the world of the enlightenment only to go home to the dark ages every night.
Being a contrarian is soothing.
Religious freedom is important. Live and let live. I would fight to preserve that right. I would also fight to preserve the separation of church and state. America is not a theocracy nor is it a Christian nation and those who believe it is have no idea what the United States is.

God is un-American. We don’t like kings here.
Stand up for what you believe in and fight when it comes down to it.
Barbarism under the facade of culturalism in the harming of children should not be tolerated. Fight me and fuck you if you agree that little girls should be cut.

"Yeah, that’s some shit. Educate yourselves. Welcome to my world."
"Little girls get their clitorises sliced off in Africa (Ethiopia and Eritrea and in the central nations) at rates of up to ninety percent. Ninety eight percent in Somalia. Female Genital Mutilation is barbaric, it’s a crime against humanity and must be stopped."

I don’t
Sometimes I write something important that you should take to heart.
"The irony is that the so called information super highway, or Internet, has ushered in a new dark age; one of misinformation, lies, manipulation, and obfuscation. We encounter parroting robots and their talking points daily. The truth is out there but takes much effort to find it"
I’ll be honest I hate most of you  but some of you  are the fucking best
a devil is nothing more than a self aware demon
the echoes of a thunderous roar are still only echoes and will fade eventually
the people who react to beauty and goodness with hate because they hate themselves are exactly the people to avoid because they are the demons  and there are so many of them
it all seems so surreal and dream like  as I learn to be human again  if just for a moment
what do you want what do you need what is attainable what must remain a dream
“the drunk tongue speaks a sober mind”
I get full on political when I have insomnia
"That punisher skull painted red white and blue that military and law enforcement like to put on their armor and vehicles is the most un-American of symbols. Not only does it mock the flag code it’s the US version of the totenkopf, or Nazi deaths head and is the symbol of fascists"
"and that was the choice I had and I chose the latter but that’s not freedom, that’s herding cattle"
being a patriot means questioning patriotism and when that stops so does freedom
"There is a subtle compulsory military service in the United States, especially for the poor who are denied educational and healthcare opportunities outside of enlistment. There is no draft but the thin veneer of freedom boils down to a choice of being a debt slave or a soldier."
I’m not done
I come from a more ignorant part of the world where most are still afraid of the dark. It was never hard to shine there.
there are people who love you they’re just far away
all of my memories are lies
there are too many crowds on the weekend and I’ve never much liked crowds
You have no idea at all.  Whatsoever.
somewhere between real and art  fact and fiction raw and curated
I’m a dying god  that always wakes up  in the morning

making a difference isn’t all it’s cracked up to be if you lose yourself in the process...don’t lose yourself then
I wouldn’t change a thing
I have the craziest fucking life!
If I can make you laugh I can damn your soul.
bullshit beliefs and the bullshit people who believe them
I take risks to ensure I die on the toilet

crowds have been responsible for the worst atrocities in history and despots know how to manipulate them

Sex is great and all. Sex is great and all.
Wisdom is recognizing a human face in others.
I want to wear you all over my face  and remember you all over my fingers
breathe live  fuck love feel anything
we stare into these tiny little boxes while death plots
If you can’t see that everyone is one then you are lost and there’s nothing worse than being lost.
She stole the truth from everyone and took it to her grave. That’s what evil does and it’s not admirable.
Write me something beautiful in your native tongue.
"Empowerment is what all movements are all about. Everyone struggles for a place to stand and to be heard, understood. Movements tend to distort the message by becoming too rigid, too dogmatic, too tribal. When there is hatred of the other there’s no progress, there’s just hate."
Orgasms will enslave you as you willingly give your soul to the ones who can facilitate them.
Love finds a way through all our bullshit and the rules we’ve made up for ourselves. If only it could be weaponized.
Orgasms are the gates to the soul.
"Anyway, enough with archaic thinking. You don’t have to worry because neither exists. They were dreamed up by terrified nomads lost in the desert."
Has anyone really contemplated Heaven and Hell? What a fucking choice. Eternal boredom with assholes or eternal torture with the best fucking people who ever lived.
The seven deadly sins sounds like event planning to me.
"I’m kind to you fuckers even when you don’t deserve kindness, it’s because I love you, even when you don’t deserve love"
a delusion of a cat walking into the kitchen and bones in my hands
seek the shattering of the illusions that marketing firms and religions have sold us
be enough for yourself that’s all that matters fuck everyone else  realize you have power
fucking by the sea  becoming mountains and oceans
Of course I couldn’t live without them either but they are a convenient scapegoat but sometimes they are ducking too much!
The people behind autocorrect are Satan’s spawn! Holy shit it’s so irritating.
"You can’t be honest without pissing off someone somewhere, but fuck them, the art demands sacrifice."
just so you know I don’t hate anyone it’s such a waste of an emotion
it’s all masturbation really it just involves the mind and everyone is watching
"there are no rules for twitter interactions, on “likes” and “RT’s” but don’t break them  like I always do"
get to that point where you stop seeking so you can observe objectively
‘We sometimes catch a window A glimpse of what's beyond Was it just imagination Stringing us along?’  ~Neil Peart
so many beautiful things written out of the wreckage of a shattered heart
forever was a woman and she was a cautionary tale
I’m a little tired for the binge I’m about to go on but somebody has to be out there representing hedonism.
I’ve spent a lifetime destroying it’s the only thing I know of love
If I cannot dream of you I want sleep to abandon me
“Delicious pain.”
You make me hungry for everything  I might have to devour you all at once
empty rooms against crumbling walls the cracks of a foundation cracks at the corners of a smile eyes that drift too long staring into the distance  a tell that is noticed  a fleeting moment transformed into the memory of roses
I should just drink some more and write something beautiful because we’ve all had our fill of blood.
a world of secrets that are little devils hungrily consuming it’s gatekeepers
Every word is justified if you just knew the backstory. It would probably break you.
"I’m stupid when I’m hurt and the world has hurt me, it has hurt us all."
"I visited a small corner of hell again today because I needed to remember what bullshit people really are, what monsters they can be, and how they try to hide their monstrosities from the world but nobody can hide from me and my kind."
I just just drink some more and write something beautiful because we’ve all had our fill of blood.
I’ve survived by destroying myself on an installment plan.
the most recent incarnation of myself
not too controversial not too real
it was a day it was a lifetime
we need a fuck a first responder month
I can’t put everything here and that sucks.
unscathed
one gets used to evil but it’s never normal it’s just compartmentalized
If you only knew what I’ve seen all of this would be put into context.
"Remember, every psychopath, every deranged nut job and sociopath is on Twitter and there are a half a million predators online everyday."
"Embrace evil, it’s honest."
When you’re in the ground it won’t matter how much money you made but it will matter that your children hated you for that will be your legacy.
Beautiful and real are often incongruent.
we’re all dying  it’s what you do  with that knowledge  that makes the difference
A careful mind bent on societal sensitivities.
"I choose my own enemies, there’s so many to choose from but I need a solid reason to hate them and I don’t let assholes decide for me."
This is a really fucking good song.
"Um, fuck!"
It’s all going to work out.
Before early morning twilight
"I own everything I’ve done in this life, good or bad. There is no bigger threat to the establishment than that."
I count on my friends here to keep me from falling. Tell me I’m an asshole when I’m being an asshole and protect me from myself. I love all of you.
“All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.”  ~Friedrich Nietzsche
the death row of Twitter
Do Americans understand irony yet?
look at what god hath wrought in the world and look at what the devil has done for you because he loves you more than the evil tyrant telling you not to masurbate
"That photo was taken three years ago or so, surprisingly I look younger now."
Lancelot after he went crazy and became a priest in Excalibur
Gandalf
"Civil War general, ha ha!"
I’m vexed. I’m vexed on the AVI I should use. I look different in every photo. The only way to truly see me is in person.
"I’m a machine that remembers being human. In that, hope."
"I love some of you motherfuckers but it would go against character to let you know so when I say I hate you, you can nod and smile."
Lucia Berlin is the female version of Charles Bukowski in my opinion. Dirty realism isn’t necessarily male.
“but flies will lay their eggs”
This is actually a humor account but my jokes are too highbrow.
You know I started this account with Bronte’s Heathcliff in mind and now I’m doing full on demonology. It’s just a phase.
"On the second level of Hell, ruled by Asmodeus who oversees lust, there is a fantastic Tiki bar.   *pro tip"
I’ve been feeding off of all of you for some time now and I’m always ravenous.
war will be my detox program  until then I’ll drink up thank you
I’ll undo you painfully slow and deliberate because the explosions taste better when they’re not rushed.
my hands have muscle memory and they remember your throat
Write motherfuckers! I need minds to consume.
Going rogue
Just kidding. There is no such thing as the devil. There is such thing as critical thinking though.
"Okay, so I really am the devil."
both will send you to Hell but sins of the flesh are far more fun than thought crime   *pro tip
we are but an amalgam of presumptions reinforced by evil minds behind everything our minds consume
we’re all dead we’re all shadows remembering
"Nothing like a bore to point out the obvious while feigning some insight that in all honesty is lost on a person like that, but I tolerate the insufferable."
the fires of honesty  are hotter than those  of flattery
the men in my town are hardworking expendable and thirsty
I do quite enjoy interacting with the mindless products of media manipulation on occasion.
the heart’s magnetic field can be measured up to sixty feet away by sensitive magnetometers  take from that what you will
I forget to play the game sometimes and lose myself in the greater mysteries of the universe while existing on an insignificant speck at the outskirts of an insignificant galaxy that is crashing into another one and yet there are still fevered egos. Pathetic.
I could write about how much I hate you but my words would never end and I have more to talk about than your petty evil.
Everytime someone in the twitterverse angrily shouts “fuck you” to me an angel loses her wings but Hell needs an army.
Drank with bassist Steve Kille from Dead Meadow tonight in our local dive bar in the mountains framing nowhere and forever.
Most people are bullshit. They’re the residual leftovers of our primate ancestors. Their only vision is violence and themes of procreation. Show me something more.
fighting evil is my first priority
when I write I imagine myself swinging a sword against a relentless foe
It took a lot of work to get here.
I’m nothing.
when someone says “I’m nothing” it just means they’re full of surprises and don’t necessarily want to explain everything to you
you can find so much loneliness in a glass but after a couple you no longer care and the opiate becomes a hammer
"I write because I must. If the words make you feel angry, repulsed, tantalized, or inspired, or opened up, or exposed, or shut down, or challenged, then I suppose by default I write to make you feel something, however grand or insignificant, but anything beats feeling nothing."
teetotalers have ruined the world
I have skin in this game it’s worthy of my criticism and ire
"we should consider war with but grim temperance, the vanity of fools have christened too many battlefields in history and mocks the memory of fallen men who have bravely died in vain  fuck the king"
Silence has ended us.
I’m my own thing
The only political tweet I will write here but it needed to be said.
"Iran is not the enemy of the American people, tyranny is. The Republic is dead. It went down without even a whimper."
“All governments are lying cocksuckers.” ~Bill Hicks
I want you to be the best you  I don’t require anything but the satisfaction of you manifesting into your best self
I’ve been warned about you you’ve been warned about me but we should take a long hard look at who is giving these warnings  and their motivations for doing so
the darker version of hope
"In my youth I set out to change the world, after aging I looked back and realized I had already done so before I even took the first step"
ignore the typo and call it art
every life means something every life means everything  we don’t know who’s lives we’ve changed just by breathing
"dying alone means nobody else gets hurt and there is no transference of pain, but if you are loved, everyone dies with you nobody is truly alone"
This man is the quintessential knight errant. His honor is impeccable and so are his standards. He lives life on his terms. A woman would be so lucky to be with a man like him but not many are good enough. I’m proud to call him friend.  @cardiacscars
Tweet storms = boredom + intelligence + altered headspace + not giving a shit
"We fail at attachment, at possession, at selfishness, not love"
When even observing changes the order...
I don’t need anything but my wants are numerous
The grotesque figures and shadows in the bar will fade away this time leaving only the light I suck from your mouth.
I miss fucking you. I miss the taste of you. I miss your every goddamn.
I’m not a give a fuck sort of man.
Regarding lies and the devil. He gives you the unadulterated truth and you deceive yourself for what you secretly desire. The only lie therefore is from your fear of the truth and the dark cravings you deny. Don’t blame him for your self deception. Blame yourself for not living.
"Don’t worry, I’ll write something later that will repulse you just to see who sticks around."
Your nightmares are just me loving your everything.
I don’t know what I’m doing most of the time but it’s with you in mind.
I destroy things with the very hands I heal you with.
I write while you’re sleeping so I can fuck you up in your nightmares.
Life is all about navigating the garden path to the grave. When you accept this fact that garden path is pure ecstasy.
"To all of you who are trapped in the life you’ve chosen, cheers! It will get better if you want it bad enough."
"I’m not drunk I’m insane okay, I’m drunk too"
sometimes we step a little into the grave when we love the wrong person
we’re only here for a little while so I figured I would make my mark in case you’re wondering why my real life is so insane
so far death has been the one who has always flinched but I know he cheats
let me inside let me course through your veins and penetrate your dreams so that you’ll want me forever
I’m probably writing about you
life is full of endings and that’s okay people teach you lessons that help you stand alone and you always take a little of them with you
Writing about you is like painting you. I’ve written about so many of you.
we’re all different versions of the same existence
"I get the sense that many here are sending out an S.O.S., their tweets are messages in bottles reaching distant shores"
you can never fail at love
I destroy everything completely by accident just by showing up
If you were here I would drown you in me in you in me in you
All my tweets are sex tweets
If you can walk away from the world you’re invincible
I’ve done the love thing now I’m doing the hate thing tempered into a weapon  it’s strange how I can’t tell the difference
I know nothing about you except what you’ve allowed me to see of your beautiful mind
"I want to know what the stars look like in your eyes in your part of the world, in your version of existence"
make me notice you it’s the only way
I can’t sleep let me trigger some random strangers
I can’t be domesticated
I’m a wanderer sojourning through  distant lands adventure is my companion  my blood drives me onward  and death is only the loss of love
"We’ve all survived some dark trauma of one sort or another, that’s why we’re here. Unscathed people have less interesting things to talk about but I still listen to their stories."
I won’t hold onto youth but I will remember its lessons.
the world is not enough
sext: vae victis
I suppose I should have said I’m @awhiskydarkly as well.
"I’ve always had a problem with conceptualizing time. I don’t understand it like many seem to. That’s why I must assign a date to an event in my head otherwise passing years only seem like weeks ago. It’s why I never forget a person or relationship, because they still seem alive."
Fucking you was like trying to hold a storm together.
my muse is the broken glass that I pick up by the handful and throw against the wall
show your face  what are you hiding from?
my eyes are green I’ve fallen too many times for brown eyed girls
you have to die before you can say you lived
I take a deep breath and conjure the dark that comes to mind so easily  and lays down to die in words
I think we can afford to be kind to each other
be a threat to mediocrity  let average despise you
failure is not an option but death is
I never stop loving I am just good at making you think I do
Peace would destroy me
thirty days...
perhaps some parts of you are still alive and there is still some glass left unbroken
You have nice mammaries for a human but I have alien eyes that only see energy and yours is quite negative so I think I’ll pass.
Love is the last thing on my mind. Hate is the energy I need but I don’t want to sell my soul for that so I’ll settle for numbness.
"The day after your death the sun will rise, the sun will set. Wildflowers will bloom on the mountainside, bees will pollinate, and a child will be born somewhere to proud parents too caught up in the moment to see any sort of endings. We were there once, but now we’re here."
There is only light framed by darkness.
"If your truth speaks to me I will accept it, if mine speaks to you then feel free to do the same, dogma and orthodoxy are the only real evils"
I still pretend I don’t know who you are.
Every kiss is the last
I need to be back in a Mediterranean villa by the sea as I was in childhood growing up
there is no pain left my face is granite my eyes are steel and I’m made of spite
books and covers and intercalary chapters
pretend I’m a leering skull  and I’m throwing it at you
let me kiss your nightmares awake
"apparently I’m not as empty as I purport to be, life has its screws, life has its knives and it’s chainsaws"
loyalty is the heart of all virtues but honesty is actually more important for it is the latter that will reveal the former’s demise
I rise but fall mostly
2020 is my year
Heaven fill my eyes  and wash away my everything
the architect of your corruption
sinister cravings for pure black hearts
writing is easy I let the blood and darkness do it all
every river is your rubicon
fucking you is like storming the gates of heaven
I don’t want to reign in hell I just want to lead it’s armies
misunderstand me harder and make sure you fuck right off
let’s stop pretending we’ll ever meet someday
a restless heart a rambling soul
there are evil people here
the way the universe works...
"who are you going to find who shovels the snow, gets the generator working, repairs the truck, loads the dishes, brings you wine, devilishly handsome and can write you a love song in poetry form that would make your panties drop   *as she swipes on Bumble  **my attempt at humor"
empty hands are better than empty arms but both represent possibility
age has tempered the edge somewhat but the bloodstains are still there
I don’t really do resolutions but I think becoming more mindful never hurts
who do you reach for in the dark in those brief moments between sleep and awake and when you forget
I’ve been fortunate in this life I’ve loved with my very being and until I broke and have been loved and have died by hands that swore to never hurt me and I have ruined and been ruined more times than I can admit
I could never have asked for you to wait for me when the wait is possibly forever. I’ve chosen my career over love.
I have no room in my heart for deception  there’s no need for it and a foundation built on lies will only crumble into the sea eventually
let’s not call it love until we swallow each other whole and wake up to room service
I don’t love recklessly I’ve done madness  it only leads to ruin I’m careful about what  destroys me now
I know nothing about love but I know the touch of her hand the smell of her hair the way she looks at me the way her smile seems to grow forever taking me with it
they watch some hate you others are in love while every word is a sword  swinging blindly in the dark
like meteors falling from the sky tragedies become more complex and more frequent as we move through this life and the big one is always lurking somewhere waiting to pounce
I pretend I just got here let me have that
I forget who I am when I’m here I forget what I am
don’t assume anyone is writing about you  even if they are that’s healthy twitter
sitting down for breakfast
find your bliss it may not be a person
Drunk Smiths channeling ha ha!
at some point the sea will be beautiful again despite all the love it has drowned
I stand on my own and I’ll fall on my own
I’m not looking for love I’m looking for redemption
imagine writing and never challenging anyone
I’ll just tiptoe past your heart in the night
I’m spending more and more of my waking consciousness weighing the value of the AK-47 versus other kits in war torn backwaters
we are but a lonely god
write a bunch of brilliant throwaway shit while drinking yourself into oblivion and call it an evening
you’re so fucking beautifully dark I imagine your mouth can suffocate the unsuspecting but by that point they’re already hopelessly lost
my world is iced over snow is everywhere the power is out and as I ruminate by the fire  the darkness and cold are closing in
we all have an emptiness to fill who is anyone to judge how that manifests?
slut shaming is thought control  be yourself be free
show those nudes partial nudes swimsuit poses in the snow we are not puritans the human body is beautiful  and if you’ve got it flaunt it fuck any hater
"meet me in a dark, quiet place  before never becomes real"
I’m a shadow but I loved you
I just watched “Spirited Away” with my youngest. The last time was two years ago and I slept through the entire movie because I was struggling with a trauma bond. What a difference the passing of time makes.
my rabbit hole is an abyss
if you haven’t noticed  I’ve combatted evil and have been left with the scars to show for it
most have a loose grasp of just how barbarism can enter your lives and change it forever your god cannot protect you your government cannot protect you for they only sell dulcet delusions  and therein lies their only power
you might find me beautiful if you could hold on until the end
I never judge I observe
I have a lexicon of evil that I can pull examples from to illustrate just how humanity is fucked and irredeemable.
when does the good will end exactly?
I care about too many random faceless people who could be anybody
I no longer write about what I would do to you I write about how I would free you  anything else is just a process
we are “it” each of us
all of you are beautiful  thanks for following me and interacting when you can to another year of intellectual masturbation and wasting time that we enjoy wasting Cheers!
"when you stand your ground you don’t lose friends,  lovers, family, or opportunity you lose the shadows posing as them that seek  to pull you under"
I’m a hand reaching out from the darkness the last redoubt between you and the edge
the sinister found in the painfully normal
there is not a more painful and cruel endeavor than the search for love
I’ve spent a lifetime trying to love and be loved but it came out as cruelty every fucking time
be my violent attachment
you might catch an elusive glimpse of heaven on the threshold of hell
you’re my favorite apparition on the frozen wasteland outside of my window
my backstory is relatively unknown outside of these halls
there’s snow in the forest and I still listen for you in the songs of the breezes that twist themselves  through the pines
live! You fools
the graveyard is pregnant with  plenty of love lost and lovers who would never be
I believe in honor  and courage and strength and integrity  and seek truth  I have strived to live by these virtues but I am also human and imperfect
I can’t save you but I can lend an ear
peace on earth  goodwill toward humankind  when will this start again? You’ve had 2000 fucking years.
go to bed you little shits Santa wants to get through this bottle and there’s a lot of crap he needs to bring over for your magical Christmas morning
too busy living a life worth writing  about to actually write about it in a meaningful way
I write so random people I don’t follow or follow me can call me a “lier”  I write so creepy old fat men can hit on young girls on my timeline and give me veiled threats when I call them out   I write to defend my tweets from those with thin skin   People fucking exhaust me...
“The scar of Bethlehem” ~Banksy (street artist)
only the British salute the wrong way and say Happy Christmas
the last moments of the sanctuary of my solace
once you ignore the absurdity of existence life can be pretty decent
strength requires suffering and perspective
It’s never over  it always was  and forever will be
If this was five hundred years ago I would have slapped some of you down with my gauntlet.
I know the risks I also know that life isn’t worth shit unless you take them
I’ve had a good life
I’m already complete  the void doesn’t exist in my world
it begins and ends with all these words
when anyone will do I will not
my bed is like a womb  and so are you  I never wanted to crawl out of either   but you get used to the cold
I don’t exist
some people will believe anything
put your clothes back on love you’re going to catch your death
I see you
The truth is nature will always take care of things if we don’t. The next pandemic is an overcrowded meat market away. There’s an excellent series on Netflix called ‘Explained’ and there’s one on pandemics.
all of the worlds problems boil down to one issue: overpopulation
you know the thought of you drives me crazy
I’m not good for you you would know this if you are honest with yourself
pain overpowering words
I would drown with you if I could
feeble words fail to describe the loss of my world  she’s not coming back from that dark place  and I will never love another like I loved her
she’s talking herself down  into being human again
*a note for my daughter
embrace your anxiety it’s a byproduct of freedom  it means you have spirit  it means you care
she has a nice aesthetic I’ll give her that
two years ago today I returned to California after a year and a half in DC a year ago I returned to California after living in the Netherlands a year from now I’ll be abroad and Christmas will be in Italy with my daughters but California is my home
At least my shit is decent enough to steal.
when I contemplate nothingness I come up empty
existing  at the frayed ends of forever searching for a lighter  to cauterize  the unraveling
never is a far more powerful statement than forever
my thoughts are just echoes reverberating from past lives  that are mostly forgotten  mostly
I’m a knight in my mind and a devil in hers  somewhere in between lies the truth
take the pain I gave you and plant something beautiful
it’s okay the sun still sets over the sea  and wildflowers still bloom in spring  on the  mountainside
I did make promises I never intended to keep  or I changed my mind and for that I am guilty  as charged
"my supervisor at work gave me two lottery tickets and a $2 bill stuffed into a miniature stocking, I fucking love my supervisor"
next week I’ll be seeing an old lover in Los Angeles and I’m acutely aware of the passing of lifetimes
we could have been everything but nothing was easier
I’m easy to love...
just a ragged human  powering though
I’ll write you into the grave
there is no real me
you are the marrow  I want to suck from the bone
fear no whiskey
I’m going to write the fuck out of you
pain and loss is part of the human experience  oblivion isn’t
to paraphrase Charles Bukowski my machine gun is my keyboard  and so is my machine gun
I’ll borrow a little against death tonight but I want to write I feel inspired
art in the modern age isn’t the words lying dead in the graveyard of the page bound in the mortuary of print  but rather in the words  that are alive and thriving through digital interaction where minds come together to feel creative power  we are all a part of this keep talking
I write about fragments of the past shards that hit an artery about the present wounds that won’t heal  people I love but don’t want to hurt about dreams and nightmares gods and devils of love and the power of hate  of purgatory and redemption  you’ll see what you want to see
you were incapable of loving me in the way I expected to be loved you became nothing to me  when your sex and beauty fades you’ll be nothing to anyone
"‘my words aren’t poetry they’re battlefield correspondence’   I wrote that three years ago on my @awhiskydarkly account. It’s in this spirit that I plan to keep writing my thoughts on here, my blog, @thedevilswhisky, and Instagram of the same name throughout next year."
we all face death everyday  some are just more aware of the dwindling odds some do shit where the odds don’t even matter
I often write about death  because I often face death
I go crazy sometimes because I’m one of the good ones
I’ll write what I write in whatever form that takes across several platforms  I’m not interested in being noticed pick through my bones  when I’m dead
let me just fuck those sweet sensibilities right out of your mouth
I don’t trust people who don’t have enemies to me that means they’ve eaten a lot of shit and continue to do so
for you there is no remedy
I’m a brute in real life
there are no answers just questions circling  the drain
to dissect  is to murder to define is to destroy we hammer the universe into fragments put them neatly into tiny boxes carefully labeled  ordered manageable  comfortable  so we won’t feel so alone but we are alone and no opiate in any form can change that reality for long
the game extends far beyond the boundaries of the sandbox
clarity of mind gives you strength
I’m beyond your petty evil and twisted machinations  your intrigue bores me
one year ago my life changed forever one could say  I emerged from the cave my advice don’t hold your reality too close or too dear  because illusions  are fragile
make me something in bone
a writer who does not write a lover who does not love a life that does not live  all the windows are open the doors are bolted there are stars piercing the darkness  above the treetops  a cold night and nothing nestled in the dreams  of everything  like it’s something important
"I got work done on my sleeve yesterday. My tattoo artist told me about an assisted living facility near him where 80% of the elderly have no families. Nobody visited them last year for Christmas. So he is organizing donations, asking people to spend time with them this year."
this season is hard for many  because we’ve made it empty  shallow we’ve marketed an ideal impossible to live up to those who are alone  loved ones long gone are not concerned the economy depends on ‘in the black’ illusions of ‘Peace on Earth’ and war the irony is not lost on me
In a society where youth is everything I’ve hit the wall and I’m okay with that. It means I workout harder.
There is a serious grammatical mistake in this tweet that has haunted me for a little while now. I should use my drafts folder more but raw is raw and sometimes raw is ugly and makes mistakes.
I’m on the precipice of a grand adventure. I can’t sit still. I can’t be in one place for long. I want to experience the entire world. I crave freedom. I have no time or desire for a love that would possess me.
things can happen off the internet as well and still be real
it began in wonder and ended as a mistake  but the world seems full of wonderful mistakes
"“you boys can keep your virgins give me hot old women in high heels with asses that forgot to get old.”  ~Charles Bukowski, ‘Love Is a Dog from Hell’"
I sometimes remember  I remember still that both of our backup plans was me
deathless for one night
my future is isolation and living for myself it’s decided
less of a soulmate more of a brush with evil
we’re nothing but bones  and plastic and fabricated realities
this dance is death but we keep dancing
this isn’t a dating site it’s the apocalypse  fucking purgatory
I’ve known love it’s in the form of a woman who gave me a lifetime and two beautiful daughters  and nobody else will compare nobody
if we survive long enough we become the machine they’ve always wanted
we’re all looking for love most will never find it and the ones who do will never keep it
she’s fragile in the way she destroys worlds
I get told to fuck off quite often for just being who I am but I will always carve out a place for me to stand  and in that place I’m a mountain
we deal with life until we don’t anymore and nobody remembers
I feel the darkening of the day
you were everything I wanted
"‘in the back of a car I just met them tonight I feel like such a star what’s your name what’s your art nobody knows about my broken heart yes I'm a party girl crazy girl see my lips, how they move can’t you see I'm a natural life of a party girl sexy girl I used to be so fragile’"
you’re not real until you help me look for the cum rag under the bed
you know I’ll be dead soon and all this power in my words will fade like each day passes into memory  if we’re lucky to remember  for most days are lost
someone broke her heart once  so she spread for the void  so that she might feel again
my gaze defines everything you are
I’m beyond you
"I have two point five seconds to capture your attention oops, lost it to a vacuous fuckwit  but he reflects well on you  and what you’re really about  which is nothing much"
you have a miserable life because you’re a miserable person you seek your own kind  you’re average seeking average while extraordinary is alone in the dark  dreaming of extraordinary
doors are closing tides are ebbing  suns are setting winter is near death plays his hand
what do you fear what makes you hurt tell me your hopes and dreams the things you’re ashamed of desires too dark to reveal what do you dream about when you touch yourself  I want to know  what’s inside that mind of yours
just know hope is torture
I’m going to wake up to erudite drunk tweets with no need to delete
as long as your cup is full no one else’s matters
I gave up everything for you and you gave up nothing for me wisdom is understanding the dynamic of manipulation and survival
just when I hate everyone  and have written off humanity an angel reveals herself at a bar and I have hope again
I don’t know any of you really
most people are the void some are sunflowers penetrating the melting snow
I would sacrifice myself to right the world but even I know  it wouldn’t make a difference  but I’m that very archetype
god there are amazing people out in the world
I’m famous in certain circles and anonymous in the ones that matter
I have a mission I always have had one and the collateral damage was always us
death is my drinking buddy
I’m your past your present loves you
there should be a future  in your future
I know you’re hurting and a part of me dies everyday just knowing that fact
make me a blood pact and I’ll keep your soul in safe hands
I’ve defiled myself I’ve defined myself
*the faint sound of googling
"Remember when I wrote a thousand tweet ‘novel’ under @awhiskydarkly, deleted it and then rewrote it? Ha ha! So fucking crazy. I lost like 500 followers who got tired of my shit."
nobody has been crazier more depressed a bigger mess the loneliest worst bastard  motherfucking arrogant asshole at the farthest end of their rope than me  and I turned out okay and you will be too   *eye twitches  **so does the corner of my mouth  ***thumb is doing a weird thing
"art  a reflection of life Twitter  a mirror of modern life plastic, fake, short lived,  vacuous, vapid, shallow in the now but it’s pliable  resilient moldable  and great minds have gathered  to make something great from the noise  and the trash  you just have to keep scrolling"
"the brilliance of twitter  is not that we create long standing masterpieces but rather we have the ability to and instead create ephemeral ones while standing in a drugstore line or at a stop light at a bar or when work isn’t watching  works that are read, absorbed, and discarded"
I wish we were lovers
let’s be chaos together  and love hate love and can’t live without and quiet explosions  in the night when the world is spinning itself uselessly outside of  us
I would take you  I would make you mine and gorge on your mind and body with fists in your hair and blood in our veins burning hot  and bright  and as beautiful as the morning star  beaming through our window
the only true forever is a silence taken to the grave
a library is a dead planet
writing is a form of suicide
words die the moment you write them down for the page is a grave and a book is a cemetery
I blame me for you
I’m trying to get in your pants love I need to be in your head then my hands will be free to roam unchallenged  and together we can find and release the butterflies you keep caged under your skin
"the only reason I still write here is because I realize if John Fante or Charles Bukowski, Henry Miller, Anäis Nin, Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck or Hunter S. Thompson or Gertrude Stein or Corso, Kerouac, or Burroughs were around today they would be writing here just like us"
the edge is old age and disease addiction  and obsession the edge is a warning and a teacher  it’s draw is alluring and simultaneously repulsive  for it is us on the other side  calling us home
I had a wonderful dream about flying through a carnival  of light and color  you were there with your life you were happy there was ice cream children laughing  and somehow that’s the meaning of unconditional love and the undying connection to each other we pretend doesn’t exist
our brief existence is a marvel of the universe each life a brilliant flash in the pan a moment of clarity  in the dark I wish more people would value their existence for each breath is a win  holding off the entropy of the void  if but for a moment but a moment is all we have
when you lose a diamond in the dirt one hand scrambles to find it while the other slips into a pocketful of loose change and worn bills  pennies and lint and despair
I don’t talk to her anymore but she saved me with the music
walk through the fire love me hate me love me again and call each sunset regret  after our last one died in that city by the sea
suit and tie up against your cute little black dress charming your friends with a martini in my hand  I notice the way you hold your glass and who you think is important  and the jokes you pretend to laugh at I slurp my drink my green eyed gaze envisioning slurping you later
you’ve invited me in now explode in a thousand directions
her devil horns are removable and I want to fuck her with them
time is a shelter from any storm
you know I’m here and I speak with anyone and everyone time permitting
I pretend I don’t but I like people
Andy Dick If you’re listening you still owe Joe for two drinks  Bishop sure as shit won’t pay and I forgot with all that police commotion outside as they were wrestling that robber to the ground the boys say hi
I could probably drift inside of you if I wasn’t so crazy and thirsted for speed snd adrenaline all the time.
I don’t either other than an ear to listen.
I stumble through all the games and machinations because I just don’t give a fuck.
drinking with the truly broken none of you have shit on these people
The cops caught a robbery suspect just outside. The King Eddy is in Skid Row. I’m wearing a suit and tie. “Whiskey neat” I tell the bar tender..
I suppose “our story” remains even when we don’t
I’m just giving Texas a hard time. I’m from that part of the world. I was a Sooner at the University of Oklahoma. A rival of Texas.
Ever read ‘Blood Meridian’ by Cormac McCarthy?
there are a lot of Texans in heaven just sayin’
I’m a stripper but with words  and my naked soul
sex is 90% mental intelligent people fuck better
I am an ass and it’s perfect
this is my juicy don’t give a fuck account
some men are pigs with weak father figures suicides who’ve lost their nerve begging for better men to lead them into the light
you should invite the devil inside
that dysfunctional nectar I crave so much  and fuck my rockstar heart  it never once served me well
there are no happily ever afters there are only a series of nows  followed by so many nevermores and could have beens
wake up someone is manipulating you and murdering the truth
I feel no pain  no more forever
a haunting piano by candlelight for outside there is snow and the forest  and the dark
I savor the silence of your wake
If what I write hurts you don’t read them they saved me  however
"Aren’t men who lie and claim to be a US Navy SEAL, Green Beret, Delta, or other special forces a special sort of cunt? It’s easy to fact check your service history or lack thereof dumbass. Don’t steal valor from those who actually served or are currently serving. Own who you are."
"if “don’t be afraid, ever” could be bottled up and sold in a jar"
This one needs its own light
the unfathomable deep water that is you
in the aphotic depths
the good never wins we were lied to  evil rules this world and the hearts of humankind
"I’m basically just a sensitive human being finding a way through the darkness, through circumstance, and the horrors duty has thrown my way."
salvation is also a lie
I would save you all if I could but I can’t even save myself
we crave what makes us real afraid and willing to give it all  away
I’ve smelled death seen it’s face held its hand  and pulled it from the river  and will never eat that brand of pasta again
death love sex and how they’re all  intertwined
my veins are in love with you
I’m already dead the whiskey carries my memory and my words
are you happy  with the banal life you’ve chosen? there could have been chaos  blood violence and sex magic
it is all within  and beyond my control
nihilist pleasure seeker
cold and black  in winter white  suspended in amber  and orange
total war with my mouth and tongue
I love blood music whiskey and you
In the dark drinking whiskey listening to music
so many dreams
be amazing in your own right  independent of external  validation  and you’ll realize true power
the truth is the only way to enslave you for lies are dust and have no foundation
"I said I would shut this account down when it got to 2000 followers. I’m a liar five hundred and thirty times over, but I will always tell you the truth."
I’ve loved and lost and loved again before many of you were even born
love is a lie
I’m the machine they’ve always wanted
the majority of my life is lived inside my head  the remainder being split  between sheer boredom  and absolute terror
I’m at the top of the rollercoaster there’s a light breeze on my face  and I can see the span of forever except for what is right in front  and where I’m going to land
losing who I thought you were  was devastating losing who you actually were saved me from a life in hell
I would cull the best parts of you holding perfection in my hands before eating hungrily  gorging on wine and softness
at some point we evolve into someone who can no longer be hurt by our past
I smell like gasoline
I’m forever’s worst enemy and today’s best friend
you’re not their first nor will you be their last you can’t possess them it’s just your turn
wear me home love
"Winter has come.  (Sixty miles East of Los Angeles, California.)"
I’m so far away from that life  that sometimes it seems like I imagined the entire thing.
Twitter happens in those moments where nothing is I’m not a loser I type fast
this bed is no longer a womb when the day threatens to slip away and leave you behind
I need an angel to tuck me in and kiss my eyelids to sleep
I’m not good which makes me near perfect
you have the prettiest eyes but I can’t stop looking your beautiful hair falling around your throat
this is the marrow of the evening the sweet spot that’s hard to scratch where I’m drunk enough tell the truth and angry enough to break your bones with it
I ignore harder than most  in a world of desperation  and a willingness to eat shit
I’ll hold on to the last redoubt of the night because the morrow is always  terrifying
In the end I tried to leave the world a better place than I found it
you just need me to destroy you and resurrect you in my image  then you’ll be forever mine even when you aren’t
I don’t have anyone blocked.
"I never intended for you to give up on your god, love just pretend he’s not watching when I do those things to you  that make your toes curl"
keep torturing me with whiskey and you
I should be slowly going insane in my cabin in the woods watching the snow gently fall among the pines  a whiskey in hand thoughts that need to be put down but instead I’m at the supermarket in the snow dealing with humanity
I promise to never make promises accept the storm for what it is
where’s naked twitter *I mean spiritually
I need twitter to be a garden not an arena
you can never control a woman’s heart or her fury
I notice every goddamned thing but I keep my cards close with a stoic poker face  realizing some things I can control and some things I can not
those aren’t skeletons in my closet those are bodies
crush your enemies if and when you can  never forget their slights bring brick and mortar and a taste for Italian wine
let me mesmerize you  with my exquisite villainy
"I look at all of my accounts as a shared experience. I like talking and interacting with people. It doesn’t look as pretty as a TL that dictates their soul, but it’s more satisfying."
interactive art
you’re Cora my god you are her
but I do love myself
the worst people in the world are enablers
Regarding the devil...
warning: I’m an asshole  *but you won’t listen
forever wept
she doesn’t know who she is because she’s nobody in particular  but she was once everything to me
this song reminds me of her emotional abuse
I remembered
“DM’s are the devil’s candy.” @chiaroscuroflux
I have no rivals
part Hawkeye part Vicomte de Valmont  all devil
I am ice I am fire and I will destroy you
nobody loves or respects a coward
cowards leave accusations on the table unaddressed cowards never apologize or own their wrongs cowards just runaway and hide and hope it all goes away yet they expect someone to love them
"My ex wife by the way, yesterday. Context"
I think you are an amazing human.
a very Irish devil
"Tomorrow the sky will fall on our heads, by Toutatis."
I’m an overachiever I just wanted them to be proud of me even after their deaths
we are too busy looking for love to realize war is upon us and there will be no negotiation for surrender
"“If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.”       ~George Orwell"
my ex and my children still adore me I’ve done right by them let’s talk about character again
I strive for decency  to be a decent person to be kind to those who deserve kindness and sometime to those who don’t
your dick a sex organ for procreation it drives the reproduction process of the species  it feels good to fuck sex is a powerful human need you have every right to be fond of an organ that brings you pleasure I know I am but you need to bring something more than that to the table
"I do, everyday"
I’m all the great songs have been covered years old
it’s not love or lust or companionship I’m after it’s understanding  and everything else unfolds from there
you can’t cull anything real from here thirsty men chasing women who show their wares for all to see honey traps complaining about unwanted attention  from reply guys whose desperation  exceeds their sense of reality  the dance of the trauma bond is beautiful  and horrifying
"give me the troublemakers and the poor students, the rebels, the punks, the loners, the outlaws, the ones who stand their ground and raise high both middle fingers in the face of autocracy; for tyranny depends on good law abiding citizens willing to eat shit"
"I couldn’t wait to open Twitter this morning  *sarcasm, come on in"
my skull is tired goodnight assholes I love you all even the ones I hate
I’m a weaponized human I do a lot of unintentional damage to people just by getting near them
let me menace you
calculated heartache
I’m more machine like than human my mind methodically calculates how best to undo you
I’m just wasting whiskey tonight my mind is too elevated and squirming too much to get drunk
people are happy to be breathing to feel the sunrise bleeding into their bedrooms  to lose at love and to try again
"you’re not going to get away so easily, I’m not going to let you retract your claws just yet"
I’ll eat the sin right out of you
I’m the only god you need  you’ll definitely think more about me than him  for he’s old and weak and irrelevant  and can’t fuck you like I can
I’m the darkness devouring your light enveloping the internal voices telling you to run
my heart is eternal winter
bound  exposed taking in your naked form  writhing in helpless anticipation fingertips gliding along your soft curves   fingers sliding inside your mouth clutching your hair dribbling wine down your throat  licking the excess from eager lips
we won’t work without fear  I need to feed
the ache and the strain and the things you need
I’m not here to save you love I’m here to bind you in the dark and transform you into something beautiful.
I’ll grab your ass and your throat and raise your chin up to my gaze to take in what I’m about to defile the fresh snow I’m about to trample and make a mess of
"I shall ravish this woman from the god she holds dear her rosary clenched in hands  grasped and profaned by my own  I’ll fill her insides with an unholy spirit her defeat, her remorse will be my victory"
I’m not amazing I’m disordered
I stepped in dog shit or was it a landmine
"well, I wasn’t planning on drinking tonight"
"“For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.”"
"“I know I’ll never find anyone like you again, but I have to try.”"
I’m never lonely but I’m alone quite often
I’ve said my peace.
A war in Twitter heaven...
I mean my ex was a real whore. Hopefully she changed because her husband seems like a real kind man. I actually pity him.
"I would have accepted an apology or an explanation. I’m a pretty forgiving person but no, closure doesn’t do for the disordered."
veins in my teeth delicious
"I wrote a lot of shot about this motherfucker and other pieces of shit last night when I was drinking that I stand by. However, I included one person who was a victim and being fair to her I deleted those mentions."
professional victims  I’m not saying I don’t believe you  but I’m not saying I do either
a war in heaven the twitter version  but that’s exactly how it happened
not the devil you imagined me to be
everything should be in the open the darkness only hides lies
burning the worthless bridges
Wrecklessly
I’m not infallible I’ve fucked up too
Twitter is a big place you don’t have to suffer cunts
I know good people when I read them.
I’m the devil devils hate.
I’m not looking for love  I have self reliance  and daughters who are my life
Courage is the only weapon against evil.
At least I own my shit. I’m honest about it.
One devil at a time.
Fucking pervert
I’m an open book my passions  my griefs  my failures  for all to see and judge
a society where truth is on the ropes everywhere
be a bad person  who does good things because good people are liars
herd mentality will destroy us
"five, almost six years is a long time on Twitter  I’ve met some wonderful people made some enemies and some great friends and through their expression realized just how beautiful and depraved the human species can be"
she walked through fire pretended it was ice
make sure you unfollow me after I follow you so you look important
"to those of us who thrive on our own terms, cheers!"
I don’t forget I don’t forgive  I burn until there’s nothing but a hole left for a heart  or a grave to piss on
most people are dead at this time
"“If you’re a lover and not a fighter you’re neither.”  H/t: @HonchoMad, this man has some wisdom and is a sexy motherfucker ladies."
"Twitter, a gathering place for fevered egos and nobodies. I’m both so I can say that."
when you love someone more than life itself you’re an idiot snap out of it
weird=elevated
subtlety gets you killed in my world
try accepting the choices you’ve made for a change
I’m basically just an amoral white knight who demands payment
your soul is worthless  let me love it
my reality is extraneous to this digital fuckhole
the complexities of solitude  and self determination
"Here’s my one FF @msbtx  Others are good, but he is great."
someday is never for me
so many pathetic assholes getting soft and old writing in the dark about nothing they’ve ever lived
fuck writing live the life worth writing about
you aren’t shit unless you have a troll account dedicated to your greatness
let’s start from zero
But seriously I’ll be abroad next year and a company asked if I would move to their country permanently in 2021. I’m considering it.
too many “stills”
"Ok, you got me. I’m not as quick as I may have alluded too but the door still should still clear my ass."
I’m never coming back
silence is denied me there have been too many explosions
"Yes, I’m originally from the South. It’s in my veins. I both love it and hate it."
must love sipping whiskey on the mint julep porch as the sun fades behind the trees and the fireflies come out to greet us
I’ll be damned  come with me
she wasn’t a real person and neither were the dreams
I like to make sure you have a little something to read in the morning
in the gloaming in the snow among the pines outside my window
do tremendous things when you can even if they’re small
"thank you for “warning” me about people, unfortunately I make my own decisions about who I associate with after engaging with them  your agenda has no bearing"
go ahead pick it up cast your stone be the first
some day I’ll laugh at my ridiculous five years on Twitter
we’re not meant to withstand trauma we’re meant to become it  and harness its power
if all of you are me how could I possibly love you? but I do but I do
tonight I’m drunk on insanity and chamomile tea
I’m beyond human that took sweat and hard work and a lot of pain and sorrow
fall asleep to the sound of my voice love
you’re absolutely right about me
some people are like the stars but most are the dark spaces between the stars
let the force of your words move mountains rather than the force of your following
honor in every endeavor logic above all
the opposite of love isn’t hate it’s apathy
love is a knife hiding in wait and is always brandished in some form or other
Cheers! A little scotch in a skull.
I hope you make it through the night  I care about you  *anyone who needs it
I’m in a pretty good mood I write for shit when I’m in a pretty good mood
It’s okay to like stuff with your eyes.
"at some point you must decide to either step back from the edge or go over, you can’t flirt with it forever"
"It was always hard to tell where rock bottom was exactly, or when. I just knew I had to be there if I was going to be anything worth a shit."
fuck poetry
If I can’t love her I can’t love anybody
the mind does not age cannot tell the passage of time or differentiate between dreams and reality
she was everything  and nothing to me because she was nothing to herself
So this person followed me on my main account so I followed back. She immediately unfollowed and I was like who cares until I saw her stolen tweet from a friend of mine. What an asshole.
unrequited love is the safest form of love it’s when they love you back that your soul is in peril
I want to drink you slowly as if you are a ripened vintage and swirl you around my tongue  so I may taste all of your floral notes
“The Peanut Butter Falcon”
everyone is broken and nothing makes sense
I own everything
Volker Burke h/t @xavierdaniel999
boys who never grew up want girls real men want real women  it’s that simple really
"you can keep your quiet, shy girls who are lost in books I require the fire of a woman who’s lived some shit to write about I require you"
I want to hold you in my hands and take a bite right out of the middle
the present has the future by the throat
you cannot possess anyone they belong to the world but you can have a turn loving them
live a beautiful life take your time with everything and everyone and everything will fall into place
This is an art page tonight. Art is joy.
it’s all going to work out
I may as well have hurt you hate fuck me
kiss me to death
most of you aren’t ready for space exploration  our minds cannot even comprehend the vastness of the known universe yet we are content to dwell on a tiny dying speck in a backwater galaxy that’s in its death throes we’re not thirsty enough
"some people defy labels lovers, exes, friends whatever she is I would be lost without her"
she is what fire would look like if it was a woman
nobody ever thinks to ask what I want
women who want to kill me women who want to fuck me who want to love me who want to love and fuck me and kill me hate me use me obsess over me control me manipulate me spread rumors about me women who want me to use them abuse them hate fuck them choke them  bind them love them
"I’m just going to quietly lose my shit in a quiet corner of a remote backwater somewhere. It’s okay, I do it all the time."
my how time dies
"“I never wanted it to end like this but flies will lay their eggs”  ~Marilyn Manson, “Tourniquet”"
holding onto to this coffee mug as if it’s the second coming
cliques lol!
In the end she was just trying to survive herself and find her place in the world
I’m not perfect I’m rash I have a temper  I made mistakes  and I burned for her
she was a seriously disturbed person  she had problems unscrupulous men took advantage of her like unscrupulous men are prone to do I tried to love her
I’ve been told my texting style is very dry and so is my sense of humor lol
trust your intuition and trust me
follower whores are pissing me off tonight
I’m a bad influence   *everyone I know
My spirit animal...
mirror me if you can
unfollow everyone who likes and retweets this
I need a strong woman who won’t take my shit and can handle a shotgun
memory is an old man weaving yarns
this moment is what’s eternal and everything has led right up to it  since the beginning of time which was moments ago
you’ll spend much more time not being than you will being
forever is a cemetery  followed eventually  by boiling seas acid rainstorms an exploding sun our galaxy colliding with Andromeda a collapsing universe entropy  cold darkness  ...
this place is mayhem swirling in chaos  and I fucking love it!
are you getting the secret messages I’ve hidden among my words love?
I’ll crawl all the way inside just to eat what hurts you
salvation isn’t a person
everyone must be carried sometimes
carefully navigating porn bombs on my TL while waiting for training to start slow peek scroll slow peek scroll  slow peek...
you can never compete with ghosts for their love grows stronger with absence
I give good space
The crux of it...
the night wins for now
labels are murder
* diabolical twitter
I can be nobody I can be ethereal  or a distant memory a passing thought the mist a darkening shadow
"I don’t consider I know anyone until I’ve met them face to face. With that being said I’ve met four total people from here, two are just awesome and two are the worst people I’ve ever met. Take that for what it’s worth."
* for entertainment purposes only
nothing survives ego death nothing except enlightenment
now back to my figurative death
fast forward in your mind to a point in time where everyone here has been dead for a hundred two hundred three hundred years think about that  for a moment  and tell me what’s real
that goodbye was a thunderous roar on my end
on the wall inside the wire before early morning twilight
happiness is a reference point on a compass with time left
"dawn, an elusive lover the night wants to strangle in my sleep"
"In case you’re wondering, no, I don’t ever sleep. I’m eternal."
I don’t believe many of you are real those who are  are not my demons while I walk in the light  you are my shadow
"“I will withhold death from you as long as you obey my one command. Bow down to no one. Worship no one. Not even me.”  ~Mike Carey, Lucifer vol. 3"
Do any of the voices in your head tell the truth?
what a ridiculous concept “forever” is?
One of us must die...
be happy with yourself  and maybe another person who’s also happy with themself  will love you
I hate you  but I want the best for you  always
I always piss off the wrong people when I piss off the right ones.
loneliness and boredom is our default state that’s because we were lied to about what’s important
"I think quiet acknowledgment is preferable to a man explaining to her what he thinks she meant, don’t you?   *a subtweet motherfuckers"
finally putting those wild horses on the wall
let’s be strangers together but with a beautiful back story
the first day  of the rest of your life hopefully there’s roses
I hope I remember to come back
I have no choice. Maybe you don’t either. Maybe none of us do.
and I hope those I have wronged forgive me as well this human thing should have a manual
we’re both victims  of people  we’ve both forgiven
when it’s all rot and you are left with cutting out  the good parts
what’s done and gone  can either tear you apart  or build you stronger it’s only a choice
sometimes silence is best
I’m dead to the world.
I think sipping rye with you out of tin cups  by the fire under a starlit moonless night in flannel shirts and skin under the shadow of the pines  may be one of my versions of heaven and I would die in your arms just to find out
You’re one of the important ones. I’ll dream of you tonight and hope you’re okay in the morning.
I don’t want anything from you but conversation and  mutual understanding.
I’m going to be afraid to open tonight’s shitshow in the morning.
I love you all we can talk  or admire each other from afar and in silence  and in darkness by moonlight or as the sun rises over the pines  but never trust me or any man completely  that’s our rule ok? open and honest communication preferably in public
I have a vested interest in who I’m fucking  it’s emotional for me it’s your energy that makes me squirm that’s the sweet spot followed by earthquakes  and coffee
I’ll disappear because war needs me  more than love does and war has never abandoned me
there was something perverted about the way she smiled the vacancy in her eyes the way she feigned perfect the plastic meals she prepared the convenient cock she stroked  while watching Netflix getting fat and weak dying in between the emptiness that dwells between everything
“God’s going to cut you down.”
I never made it past the duty part  but I’m okay I’m in it for me from here on out
we deserve the planet to burn us out the economy has never been stronger
Fuck I hate people.
I’m an open book. Ask me anything. Let’s work together to dispel the darkness. Anyone pretending to be me is a liar. I’ve posted my accounts. I have no need for deception. I don’t want anything from anyone. I’m only here to write.
I should terrify you if not you’re stupid
Nothing means everything to me.
I trust few men. The ones I do are exemplary.
the twitter elite predators and their sycophants
And the ones who know I know should be very fucking afraid
I know a predator when I see one. I’ve made a career of hunting them.
predators play off your needs they tell you what you want to hear make you feel good about yourself give you praise and gifts so you ‘owe’ them it’s called grooming  and I see it everyday on Twitter
keep me a secret  while I’m shouting from the rooftops
the only thing we deserve  is silence
the very thought of the human experience makes me sad
I’m not a poet I’m a destroyer
the sort of poetry I write is exactly the sort of poetry you would expect to be written from a weaponized human
remember I fucked you back
I made it to Saturday night. Everything from the last week has been a sober tweet.
I’ve already written the ending like I always do I’m just trying to figure out where you belong
everyone deserves a place to stand
she’s been several people since I loved her
"I want to reach out to many of you to tell you that you are awesome, but I don’t want to interfere in your reality. If you are awesome, this tweet is for you."
anyone as overstimulated as I am but dread the deafening sound of silence?
Most of us are just trying to survive existential dread. Fucking helps.
"you know what’s sexy? nuance, finesse, class, taste and depraved debauchery tailored just for your lover  whoever that may be"
I never “like” any tweets directed at me even if I do.
I’m comfortable with uncomfortable truths.
"So did a heretic, a native person, a homosexual, a child, a member of another faith, an adulterer, a sinner...there was a time religion didn’t have to approach you like an open armed unctuous merchant. There was a time when nobody had the choice whether to believe or not."
"remember, a witch died horribly for your right to freedom from religion"
if you burn me at the stake you’ll just make me stronger
even when I write about you it’s not about you
I’ll just continue being who I am and you can decide along the way if you still like me and I’ll decide whether I care or not  fair?
I’ve got photographs  and an idea a snapshot of nothing  misconceptions plastic enough to love you  when I should have made an exit
If you think I should be following you send me a DM. I’m terrible at Twitter.
I try to follow most people back if your ego is so fragile that you unfollow me so that you look important that’s okay too but if your content sucks our relationship ends ok
Twitter is my machine gun  *H/t Charles Bukowski
photographs and memories bleed don’t they?
I wouldn’t want to be anybody else
even the ones dancing in the head of a pin  *bonus points if you get the reference
every time you unfollow/block me an angel gets her wings back
I write to lose followers not to gain them that’s my metric for honesty  considering the audience
pick good heroes especially the human ones
‘Never give in”  ~Winston Churchill
nobody was ever lined up to save me and I could never trust myself to do it not that anybody could so here we are  a rage filled overachiever with a death wish
A poetic description of dissociation.
I’ve settled into this sort of detached observer of humanity. I’m not in the game but still an honorary participant.
I see art in the most unlikely of places
‘All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.’  ~Friedrich Nietzsche
broad brush strokes about any given group of people is not only lazy it’s intellectually dishonest and plays into the over-generalization fallacy be better
your trauma changed who you are but it can only own you for so long for as long as you need it to before you own your trauma  and yourself again
some people you’ll never forget some people I don’t want to
I’m no white knight I can’t save you but I’m a great listener  and have some perspective
your obsession over those who threw you away will keep you from finding your bliss  they still own your happiness  and the keys to your heart
"‘a pill to make you numb a pill to make you dumb a pill to make you anybody else but all the drugs in this world won’t save her from herself’  ~Marilyn Manson, Coma White"
Thanks brother. It seems like a lot.
I’m not sorry.  I’m repentless.  Fuck you.
I realize I write too much. What I don’t understand is how nobody else doesn’t.
We should be shouting from the rooftops. We’ll all be silent someday.
"No, this place is real. Full of real people with real lives, reaching out to be heard and loved. To be felt and to feel."
I don’t give a fuck about the feud between boomers and millennials. Let them eat each other. Gen X and Gen Z are where it’s at. We’re all pouring drinks and making popcorn.
sober weekend twitter because I’m twisted as fuck
“I remember you would walk into a room and walk around without saying a word. You looked right through everyone. It was as if you were calculating how much damage you would cause.”  *an old friend from my youth
You can say a lot about me but I do my best to be fucking there for you.   *everyone
I’m my own thing.
"When your enemies all have sad, pathetic lives while you thrive. That’s what revenge feels like. Living a good life is the best kind."
I strut around this motherfucker like I own the place.
I’ve lived an extraordinary life this place is fun but it isn’t real  and the validation is fleeting  and shallow
why the fascination with followers? add me to a list and read me you don’t have to be my paper friend
"Everyone is redeemable. Everyone, but it’s their choice."
Twitter is not either or. For me it’s effortless to create here. It’s a notebook for all to see. It only becomes distracting when I need it to be.
the handwringing and subtweets of sycophants
Her love is stronger than my darkness.
I never wanted to be a devil. I wanted to be Jesus. Jesus at his angriest. The “not in my father’s house” Jesus who violently overturned the money changers tables. The Jesus who shook up the status quo and threatened the corrupt establishment. That’s the Jesus I wanted to be.
do what thou wilt
the forked tongue whispers of serpents with venom on their lips and poison in their heart
Evil flourishes in dark places.
"Down to the devil music, but all music is devil music."
For once I’m the only sober one here tonight. Is it getting cold in here?
Fuck no you don’t!
all that remains of that love is the embarrassment
"I first came here to clear my head. To distract myself from a dark period in my life filled with nightmares. It was an outpost, a last refuge from a world gone mad. Clumsily I hammered out awkward words in  the image of horror and pain until eventually they cut sharp as knives."
worst. dating. site. ever.
not all humans
some of you are brilliant lights that I know make the world around you a better place simply because you exist
obsess me
I’m not seeking  and that is the most powerful feeling
my world is never silent
I’m a proud member of random whatever Twitter.
your past isn’t real  neither is your future  but everything in this moment  is the only thing that matters  make it count
It’s much easier to do heinous shit to people when you dehumanize them.
I actually do love my enemies. I think they are a collection of the finest examples of shitbag humans. Motherfuckers each and every one. A collection years in the making. It was hard to find such near perfect  specimens of despicable people. Here’s to you.  Cheers!
you people still alive out there? do you even know what that means? breathing is not living  and when you stop the universe should shudder a little
I don’t want anything from you except understanding. My detractors are liars.
keep playing it safe regret will come much later
those tender moments  where fingertips taste like forever  and forever feels like murder
let me inside your veins
every ‘I hate you’ just makes me stronger
I’m only vulnerable after I spill into you  that’s when you can kill me
“I can’t decide if you wear me out or wear me well.”  ~Marilyn Manson
her rain is a storm her storms crack the sky
my tongue a serpent writhing inside of your naked garden whispering tales of ecstasy and corruption
I’ll explore that little abyss of yours  fingers deep until I find heaven
you are my tongue and it’s an earthquake
flood me
"I do have this job thing to go to so all you beautiful people have a wonderful day. Even the few of you I hate, because everyone is redeemable."
An idle mind is a dead mind.
It’s not that I fuck off all the time.  I just write fast and think even faster.
she was worth it
you must learn to identify the honey trails that only lead to your death  but some deaths are worth it
every time I feel her looking my way I stab myself with a fork so that I may remember the ravages of love
my eyes remain
some things are better left in the wild captivity will change the thing you covet
music and art makes life tolerable
toxic people are weeds in your garden pluck them out so you may bloom
life is just life what it looks like depends entirely upon us
I’m not lonely now maybe I will be later but right now I breathe free and the world is full of magic
I really hope you are not me for that would be terrifying.
The trance failed me tonight. The blank page wins. The jumble of fumbled words laughed as they were kicked down the street when I stumbled to pick them up.
I’m four days outside of a three year binge.
I would like a drama free space to waste my time here with.
"You know, we just sit here and write little emotionally charged missives all the time. Pretty silly when you take a step back and look at it. However, nobody really knows anyone here beyond the masks people let you see."
I don’t look back
dead vines  a murdered vintage drying in the sun
I will eat your faith  with a heretical mouth and devour your ecstasy  while destroying your temple I will become the only light you need  and you will be my darkness
I just need to know the edge is close to me all the time
I’m no empath
you have no idea how difficult it is to do all this shit when you are about to leave orbit
fuck me back to goddamn
we’re all broken at this stage in life the strong ones are stitched together with wires and staples needles and metal pins you know them by their scars which most are invisible
I’m heavily stalked
delve deeper always
you’re not my lover  but I want nothing more to fold you up inside my pocket and take you wherever I go a nickel soldier with his paper doll
4:39 am sext to nothingness
it was better being your victim in the end than being in love with you
I want nothing more than to make a home inside your mouth and a garden in your hair
all these empty moments thirsty for you to fill them
I want the acoustic version of you
let me have you and a dark quiet place I’ll whisper sweet everythings into your ear  and start a fire with my fingerstips
worship me  worshipping you
somebody save me from my solipsism
If you see me use the word “soul” in my writing I mean it exclusively in the context of the spirit of a person’s energy rather than our immortal sense of self.
We fabricated the idea of a symbolic self that transcends death and bypasses our evolutionary survival instinct circuits. We called it a soul.
It’s the struggle that make us feel alive
And free will is a lie.
"Time is an illusion. It’s static although we perceive it to pass. Everything that happened and will happen occurred at the very beginning, but there was no beginning and there will be no ending. It just is. We just are. We have always been immortal inside of each moment."
"There are roughly 100 trillion atoms in a cell. About 60 billion cells die everyday, yet you still live as a life system. One day all the cells will die but the energy in those cells will continue on. Our language and ideas about death fails us. Death is disorder and ego loss."
"Death is not absence of life, it’s disorder."
I hurt you and destroyed me
titanium pins under my skin into my bones I refused to break love me through my machine and artificial pieces and hold me back together
I want to feel you  your small against me I want to down into your eyes and inside your mouth
I need you in my veins for you to be real
no sleep tonight my eyes may sink into eye sockets  but won’t close  and my skull grins
that fissure that runs along the inside of your heart is me
what would “us” even look like?
your halo will not be my noose
to all of you drinking tonight fuck you and your government approved drug dens in a bottle
I only seek the company of unrepentant sinners
swallow my metaphors
let’s drink blood and be damned together
baptize me  in you love
come here let me stimulate your mind
tonight I’m drunk on my inner rage
craving your lawless mouth
don’t fret over whether or not I am looking your way once my gaze has found you I always know you’re out there  and you won’t always feel its burn  on your skin
"all of these beautiful, lonely succubi waiting to devour the unsuspecting they are never satiated  they are always dining on the flesh of good intentions"
loneliness is being misunderstood  it’s a mall or a church or class or a family gathering loneliness is independent of company it’s a state of mind
die doing something dangerous die doing something you love that whole dying in your sleep as an old person is painfully boring
walk without fear wherever you go
I just come here to see shit I can’t unsee.
I’m climbing higher and higher without a place to land
"I’m proud to be the the kindest, most cruel, most insane, most loving person here. I hate you, get your body over here so I can give it the love it deserves."
If I had a personal life it would be shit
you can’t take seriously  anything this mask vomits
there’s not enough room in this heart for either of us
live free in a dying world
so many claws have sunken deep into my flesh that there are no organs left rip me apart devour me  but I’ll never be yours
"live, love, laugh become a murder of crows  or decay that works too"
I’ve had a few somedays but they always turned into never agains under my guiding hands
she picked a fine time to be dead to me
meet me in Kabul
Someday I’m going to meet one of you in person and make you mine.
Words taken from my very thoughts
I collect broken people because I can relate to them  together we are stronger in the fractures and the seams
freedom is a threat
I go my own way you can walk along if you want for as long as you wish
"Yes, there is a lot of deception here."
"Sorry, I was so...uh...anyway I thought I was on Reddit. Friends don’t let friends tweet while drinking."
I know you love me but would you hide a gun for me?
always confront the wolf
Some dumbass fucked up and triggered a pet issue of mine. Read this. It’s going on right now.
Twitter can not contain me
blame me for everything but still be able to look at yourself in the mirror
a typo...an angel lost her wings
strong people don’t hate they love unconditionally
hate is such a pathetic emotion
they hate your because they want you to be weak like them
You’ll find that you cannot stand your ground without someone hating you for it but stand your ground!
It’s better if things are butterflies
"nobody is really, we just name our shortcomings after “the other”"
I’m not the devil you think I am
“I want to get sick from you.”
I don’t dream about love much
perhaps she was my tourniquet perhaps I never made it and now I rove her halls forever
speak softly and carry the nuclear football
"I’m disposable too, I just made sure I got my knife against their throat early on. I always made my own luck."
none of you are special once you realize you’re disposable the entire world opens before your feet
the old man’s words echo inside soft brains confusing bones for sunflowers
I loved you before the flies
I’m perfect for you but time has run out
there are no endings with me there are just endless beginnings  recycling themselves over and over in nightmares and in purgatory
I’m shedding the world behind to descend into barbarism I won’t be coming back even if I do
I don’t have conquests I have failed hopes and dreams
If I don’t trigger random hate I’m doing a piss poor job of being relevant
never it’s in the cards  it’s my ace of spades
don’t define me you don’t know what you’re talking about
It takes a devil to fuck one angels break too easily  but the corruption is divine
"I’m impervious to your charms, she devil, get over here and  let me prove it with your flesh"
Twitter: where most succubi recruit their victims
I get bored and need a strong dose of hell every now and then  sometimes it’s a place sometimes it’s you sometimes it’s both
the ending was worth everything
open the portal let me in
tonight we dine on debauchery tomorrow is a hangover of flesh from overindulgence  and evil
there’s a thin veneer of willpower that keeps me on the human side of my mind
finish learning all those life lessons and hit me up for a dry run
ravens croak her name or does it just sound that way in the fog of madness
I could claim her I could jump into her dark but the unknown is a void  and there be dragons at the edge of the sea
ink has spilled onto the quatrains or is it blood  a murder of crows sings nonetheless
she let her past taint the present and the future  turned its shoulder
"a life in bullets who once fell for her, a life in needles"
I’ve got to ramble love  like I always do
Loving me and hating me is the same for me.
Closing the book.
"love, in harms way"
somebody save me for once
I didn’t break her she was like that when I found her
some here are permanently broken
that path less taken isn’t even a path it’s what machetes were made for
For some strange reason I seem to be automatically unfollowing people. I don’t usually unfollow anyone. Fucking Twitter.
Loving me is a sin.
I’m only here to prove I’m still human.
You have to own your life. You just do.
"Your god is a lie but I understand the need for myth to get some of you through the night, but deep down you know it’s true."
I’m a wise fool.
Hit me up when you’re in the same frozen corner of hell as me.
"Living my life to the best of my ability and making choices that allow me to grow, attain my goals, and contribute to my happiness does not hurt you. If it does, you are not for me. I need someone who lets me be me, whatever form that takes."
I have a deep seated hatred of credulity.
"The man who named the devil as his username, a self proclaimed authority on love. Or at least a willingness to be a student in it’s intricacies. To explore the matter fully. How ironic."
Romantic love is a myth. A lie. It keeps us from attaining a mature level of love which is unconditional and all inclusive. It obscures ego boundaries. It’s addictive like a drug. Some flitter from one new relationship to another. They don’t understand. They’re not real.
The dynamic changes when I remove myself from the equation.
The things my mind does to your body.
I should just stick to the dark erotic sex tweets.
"I’m at the point where I have to distance myself. Not for me, but for you."
I don’t wait in lines. The universe either opens up or it doesn’t. I’m indifferent either way.
For some Twitter is everything valuable in their life. They’ve got nothing else going on and it gives them meaning. For me I’m embarrassed to tell people in real life I’m even on here. It’s my intellectual masturbation place. I do have a real life. I’ve done some shit.
"Twitter, the land of make believe."
I don’t care if you love me or not
I would love to meet all of you over drinks.
I’m probably not intimidating. Approachable even.
"I hate humanity as a whole but individually they can be surprising, charming even. Quaint."
I’m dangerously charming in person
I corrected it but two angels lost their wings and my favorite bar in heaven burned down. Damn. I secretly loved drinking there.
Where is the god who would hate to see their creation on their knees?
give me all that’s yours  I’ll plunder it brutally once you open the gates
grammatical mistakes burn a part of heaven
for every typo I make an angel loses her wings
training for war my drunk tweets will suffer
tortured and brooding again inside my mountain eyrie
I’m the devil  make me explode into a billion gods
I want to grab your hair spilt the fucking sky
love me deceive me
keep the knife as evidence keep the memories as faith
nobody wants to read my hate but they want to feel it
you’re in no position to save me love but I can save you  just so we can drown together
the bar is a well of a thousand memories
but you’re my favorite dead end
I walk up to a bartender and feel a connection that would last a lifetime  or I could write ten thousand tweets that results in so many what ifs and dead ends
love the machinery hate the man
beyond human
there’s so much to tell you so little time
I’m glad none of you are too distracting today. I have some debauchery planned for tonight and I need to run.

"When your values are shallow, lacking, and or easily compromised you may find life to be pointless. For you it is to be honest. For others with awareness, kindness, and introspection, life is priceless and is something to be cherished."
"There’s a solitude, a peace, that can only  e found in the middle of the night when the city is sleeping."
I’ve stayed up well past my time zone.
"It’s late. I just want to say that there are a few people here who inspire me. I think you are genuinely good people with love in your heart. Your kindness is a beacon, your voice drowns out all the hateful ones. Thank you for being who you are. Those who are close are lucky."
I’ve already passed out and rallied  *professional
"If you understand the relationship between distance, circumstance, and time you’ll understand me. I’m the long game if I’m any game at all."
you remind me of something real
break me like a vow
there’s no wisdom here there is just a lost soul leading you astray  feeding on your pain
I might be past feeling but you can try to revive me
drain my life force from my loins then  *a subtweet from a woman I respect
all of you reek of death and decay
someone once told me age is just a number  I believed her now I’m here to tell you it’s a real thing  more than a number but less than understanding
"I have one last daughter out there in the cold of night that I must retrieve, because that’s what Dads do."
I was deeply hurt by a selfish heart and I vowed ever since to not be like her.
I had something erudite to say that would have probably changed your life but I forgot what it was when I took a sip of my finely crafted beer.
Just break your heart upon my rocks and let’s call it love.
I’ll be ready for love when I’m too old to care.
Trace my scars  hold them up to the map of the universe
I’ll never be domesticated
I hate everyone she loved.
I’m a poet. I’m an intellectual. I’m a warrior. A lover. A stone cold killer. Love my dichotomies.
I’m voracious for you  get closer
You are the reason the world sucks and will die on your watch.
Listen to me Don’t listen to me But secretly do
Twitter: wisdom from dumbasses *including me
I’m sorry. I have to go fight in hell. If I make it back then I’ll love you.
"Just so you know, it’s never over with me. I always exist in your cellular structure. I’ve changed your DNA. Just add water and we’re in love again."
That’s fucking beautiful!
I’m stuck in the sleepy part of Twitter. It’s cool. We can sip tea and talk about needlepoint.
I’ve been drinking. Is this the part where I tell all of you that you suck and are all a bunch of fucking slaves? Or is it the part where I tell you that you are beautiful and I may be in love with that thing you do with your mouth? I never know who you think I’m supposed to be.
everything is just fine and just how it’s supposed to be  it’s our hubris that tries to force things to our will  when even that is an illusion
I don’t think you know shit about love any of you
Good luck America. (A non political tweet).
I don’t expect anyone to understand I’m beyond that  I’m beyond most things
the knife of memory is always on the coffee table but I never reach for it
the end is always someone’s beginning
she was the universe in a world of worlds the stars were inadequate and so was the sun and the moon
I dream of a simple life
never is a real possibility
I don’t feel like writing and that’s my poem.
I’m just going to create art from sex for a little while. It’s easy. It’s intuitive.
war is my language of love  everything is framed within that context
"meet me in Rome, Barcelona or Malta, let’s lose ourselves in the countryside, or the cliffs over the sea, in wine and cheese, in sunsets and cool breezes, in language and art, and in each other, let’s make literature with our bodies, art with our love, tragedies with our orgasms"
I tend to fuck in libraries and bookstores.
"I can feel you in those nights when I feel nothing and everything and you are underneath me, with me, above me as if the void did not exist. I feel you becoming me as we fall into the moment, that moment that has always been, that moment locked in eternity, that moment we are us."
writing so good you’re afraid to like it
I’m hungry. You should be here.
naked in Paris or Berlin it doesn’t matter where we go when the map of the world is right under my hands I trace your lines and contours with my fingertips and kiss butterflies into your skin
I don’t want you in the dark I want you in all of your brilliance I want to see what I’m taking I want to burn with you  in the dappled sunlight of the afternoon spilling through blinds desperately fucking ourselves into each other until we forget where either of us begin and end
with a fistful of hair your mouth inside of mine I’ll eat your tongue I’ll suck the void from your womb pour nectar down your throat blaspheme the gods as I defile their temple and make it mine
“Love you to death”
I hope you’re not reading me and falling in love when you should be running away.
I write about death a lot because I face death a lot. It’s important to understand.
"Death isn’t to be feared, it’s to make worthy a life well lived."
Temptation should be avoiding me by now.
"Okay, I’ll save you but I need to destroy you a little first."
I see people hurting and my first instinct is to try and save them. My second is to try and destroy them. My instincts are best cancelled out.
I’m safe. I’ll be out of the picture soon.
"I scare the timid off too easily, without effort."
"Ok, the East Coast has passed out. Now we can pull out the whiskey and talk shit."
You can’t disappoint me because I refuse to have expectations.
I don’t not want to disappear  I just want to be invisible at will.
Wrap up pleasing your man or carving pumpkins or whatever it is you’re doing. I need you. I need to read you.
"Just how I work as well. You’d be surprised what I’ve done with a martini, a laptop, and wearing polar bear underwear."
I’m drawn to intelligence and good taste.
You don’t need anyone love. Fix that void and you’ll fix you.
When everything you write is brilliant nothing is.
“We all owe death a life.”  ~Salman Rushdie
I have no doubt that you’re watching remembering hurting bleeding  dying  when all I want is for you to forget and find your bliss  and feel the sunset
sins of the flesh sins of regret of hopelessness  angst and fear and the other ways I feed
"Don’t make me hungry when I’m satiated, I’m not beyond metal on metal fucking until we burn out together."
I’ve smelled your core and now I want to devour you.
Let’s plant trees with our indifference.
I would just fuck your fear.
Lots of sins of the flesh here but where is the music?
"You’re better off being alone. You seem like a decent man, don’t get mixed up with reptiles. We’re all damned here. @TheRealTWolf3"
Shakespeare and autocorrect don’t mix well methinks.
my words are a shadow a distortion shaped by the sun  a perversion of reality but they are truth
The last of my humanity is a seed.
"I’m not going to cut my ear off or anything, but I get it. I understand the cold."
"Many people’s lives are dark. Some can recognize it within themselves. Others can write about it beautifully. Cherish the latter, for they know what it means to be human. They know what art is."
Letting go is your best option. You won’t win but you won’t be destroyed either. Love is dangerous and phyrric victories count.
give me a cold rain fog in the trees and haunting piano music  inside my skull
I still write about love  as a good poet should but it is as strange and alien  to someone like me as it would be for the dead it’s something lost never to be found again but its essence tastes sweet  on my tongue   and so do you
My love is a virus.
Sometimes the game is played brilliantly but the monster always wins.
"One self aware, self actualized devil."
I’m just an observer of human nature. You could touch me but I wouldn’t feel it. If I touched you it would be violent.
I’m about to ride into the sunrise and dream of sunsets.
Emotionally neutral.
I have to guard my heart.  Not for me but for you.
You matter in the silence.
Hatred has slammed the door but love has opened a window
I’ve settled into perdition quite nicely it’s comfortably home
notice I didn’t change my screen name for Halloween
everyone is redeemable everyone
I’ve pissed off a lot of assholes and terrible people here
I’m fond of this one
I deal in knowns the tangible things I can touch even whispers in the night  everything else is just mist ghosts weeping in the forest  trees creaking in the breeze
you can have any man you want they would worship you be a slave for you  exalt you and sacrifice everything for a mere taste of your love
What would you do for me?
morality predates religion
I have nobody on a pedestal
I can’t find any music it all hurts
ignore me I won’t even notice
cold empty vilified
reply girls suck just as much as reply guys
stand back let me finish
I’m angry tonight every breath is rage and I hate you  almost as much as I hate myself let’s fuck
poetry is sex  sex is death and death is poetry
nice guys end up dead
you don’t know me too bad
I almost let you make me soft  I cannot allow that
feel my hate
you know come to think of it I don’t really hate people I’m just more comfortable if they kept their distance
you love me as if I was redeemable
only two people have seen my void and now they’re both insane
pushing you away is my kink
I’ve never once said I wasn’t an asshole and I’m sticking to it
name your trigger render it powerless
I don’t need anyone  it’s as simple as that
I am already there
he’ll never be me none of them will I’m okay with that if you are
get past my dark forests I believe in you
sociopaths do it better
sex is the means to an end  and the end is you in every way possible
and just like that he disappeared out of her life forever
I’ve prepared my own little place in hell with all the comforts of home
I love dark beautiful things
with one hand I both tried to elevate her and snuff her out
sometimes love is an ember that never really dies
do what it takes to survive  if he loves you he either always will or he never did
this is a beautiful fall afternoon to fuck to and never leave the bed
let’s be nothing together and everything apart  until we stop defining/murdering every fucking thing and just be free together
I’m stronger than ever I wouldn’t change a thing
so you got knocked down again you only lose when you stop getting back up
your body is beautiful  but it is just a vessel
but seriously  I’ll keep writing in isolation
I sorta hella love weird
Fuck your mess with mine
desperation stinks
It’s amusing how a young woman can bat her eyes and expect the universe to fall all over her. Try harder love.
I realize I may be intimidating  I realize this may be for the best
I’m someone  you should have held onto  someone you should have regretted losing but you didn’t and you did and you were just a stupid girl  but I wish you the best
this glass is painfully low this heart is the same weird how they’re connected
the old songs reminding me that I should hate you
you were everything when the stars were aligned thusly so
mothers are the heroes from whence the entire world emerged from caring cradles
the past is a lie it’s not real now what are you going to do with your present? your future? this moment?
"If nobody else in the world loves you just know that I do, each and every one of you."
the human condition is a jungle nobody can judge you for trying to survive
cracks are revealed at midnight
I’m fading love the knife is on the table don’t let me down
I have more dragons to slay.
I think the single most wisest thing any philosopher has ever said came from Joseph Campbell when he said “find your bliss”.
"I won’t write anything too crazy tonight, for one I don’t want to hate myself in the morning."
insanity is just the gods dreaming again
life is hard if it wasn’t would it even be worth living?
scratch me off of your love list I’ll write you a poem instead
I think happiness is as simple as waking up to coffee with you every morning.
You = goals
I fucking love this trope!
I will never lie to you I’ll tell you the raw truth and let you find your own path to hell
"I’m just here to write away what hell hath wrought, nothing more, but if that also includes you and me in a dark dream where we surf the void then so be it"
I want your earthquakes cracking my teeth and dripping from my chin
I live on the outskirts of the second largest city in the United States and one of three major cities in the world counting New York and Paris  why can’t you live here?
I want to rest my hand around your throat  pretend we are possible
love is not my language
I want to be inside of you I want to spread wild flowers around  and die at dawn
I dreamed I came home to my garden after being away a year adventuring
today I’m nothing but incoherent thoughts waking in the sunlight
we always love the impossible because the impossible is safe
I always assume I’m alone here in love with the echoes.
I admire the shape of your skull.
I think if we met I would breathe you in so deep we would become each other.
I’ve made a career and cultivated hobbies from my death wish.
I’m just here to mark the ravages of time.
if you’re into horoscopes I’ll judge you a little
wildflowers can only love a mountain for a short time before one of them fades away forever
If you’ve never felt inadequate and isolated and misunderstood like Joaquin Phoenix’s character in “Joker” (pre-homicidal maniac) I’m not sure I want to know you.
"I dislike going out on Fridays and Saturdays because I hate crowds, but Thursday evenings and Sunday afternoons I’m all over."
we’re finally ashes
It’s okay to sit quietly and watch the sunset when the words/love/blood runs out.
Your heart should have a foyer.
My entire life has been driven by a self-destructive energy.
"“A poet's work . . . to name the unnamable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world and stop it from going to sleep.”  ~Salman Rushdie"
Time really does heal all wounds the trick is to not get any more wounds. Be careful who you let in.
It will get worse....
What if we stopped attacking those with differing points of view? What if we accept that there are differences and that our differences make up a diversity of viewpoints that make life interesting? What if we celebrated what we have in common rather than what divides us? Media?
the only way to win the game is not to play   -War Games
I’m looking for anything in particular I’m just here for the intellectual masturbation
I believe in you
I see everything  I see you
It was dark when I got home. The drive was long from Los Angeles. The highway up the mountain was illuminated by the moon. Eerie trees passed by my window. The cat has been missing for 24 hours. She’s dead. I know because I know my cat. I chose a hell of a night for sobriety.
being broken is necessary for growth
you know it’s rough out there  take care of yourself be kind to people avoid the toxic ones (they’re still seeking) and love will find a home  in your heart
"I always hate myself in the morning for what I wrote on here the night before, that’s if I even remember."
I’m not one to fade away  and that pretty much sums me up in  a nutshell
I want to thank my followers and fans  (here and @awhiskydarkly and wherever else) for being with me while I descend into temporary insanity every night. My day job demands me to be a consummate professional. This is my release.
music allows us to see the infinite when we close our eyes to the world and just listen to the sonic waves inside our head
"I don’t participate in the politics or the economy of love or it’s many forms and manifestations, I just let it flow when it wants to flow."
"I write shit all over the place. I wrote this on July 16th, 2019. It’s called “Neat” for my Instagram page (that I’m locked out of) but I have another."
you can drink my blood if you can handle the ecstasy
I always wait until Twitter dies down in the evening so I can have a little corner to myself.
Halloween is when all the amateurs come out to play. It’s cute.
Hell isn’t hot it’s ice cold and desolate
peace is having someone put you to bed at night when you tend to fall sleep on the sofa fully clothed most days when you’re alone
I want your naked mind and your love raw I want you on the half shell (as Joan Baez says) nothing more  nothing less
"nuanced and understated is the new shocking and edgy, few understand the former in this overstimulated world"
a story of hope and despair of redemption and loss
I’m always conversing with her even when we’re silent and unseen
"I want to be the song you listen to late at night, drunk, the lights low and everyone else is passed out on the floor and I am speaking only to you with words that mean everything and you understand  you understand"
I’m never there until it’s too late and then it’s all water at the bottom of the ocean
A song and a memory is sometimes my best muse.
and if I’m honest with myself she was the last woman I truly loved.
"She later told me she fell in love with me at her wedding, where we first met."
I think most of us forget how much pain we’ve endured until a date or a smell or a song slaps us right across the face
"I took the train to LA it was spring I lost myself inside the last bookstore drank a Vieux Carré across the street at the Little Easy I took a car to her house in Silverlake where four of us dined, laughed, and drank all night. We went for a bottle of whiskey late in the night."
"I may have needed you  but I was too proud to let you know too strong to be vulnerable but talking to the dead is safe as houses, unless of course the dead talks back"
"“You’re trembling” she said as she held my hands and stared intently into my eyes, looking for my truth. We were sitting in the garden, the morning sky was overcast. Her eyes were big, steel blue with flecks of yellow. “I want to fuck you.” She whispered. Context is illuminating."
I tend to love inappropriately  I never get to choose
we were undefined but I loved her and she loved me and somewhere we crossed fingers and mouths in the night  and somewhere a grey sea is named after her in that moment but fall is when she fell a year ago and she’s gone  I felt the weight of her  while walking up to the church
How many arguments have been in the drive thru or over the dishwasher?
"I like to sleep with the window open the curtains blowing gently in the breeze and trumpet jazz playing softly in the background over the sounds of a city that never sleeps, an open book lying facedown next to an empty whiskey glass on the table next to the bed."
I may be a bad influence
this place is great! who wants to slowly go insane in private when you can have an audience?
only intelligent people are insane mostly
I want to be a subject matter expert in you
I hate that all of you have lives to wake up to when I want to own your minds all through the night
I’m alright so are you  go find your bliss I’ll do the same
it doesn’t seem worth it does it?
I’ll never look your way again
you were worlds ago
I’m trying my hardest to get into Valhalla. It’s a real bitch getting a spot there.
someday my adventures will come to an end and I will love you
who will still be here next year?
"I’m not looking for love at the moment. I have things to do professionally that will keep me physically and mentally unavailable as I  work abroad for the next year or so. I may still write here or I may have to take a long break, I don’t know yet."
I’m a dead end
"I’m of the impression, and against popular opinion, that men and women can be platonic friends, at least where I’m concerned."
avoid weak woman  and women with low self esteem they’ll never be strong enough to have your back  and they can’t say no to anyone
I ignored her once but she’s the type of woman who can’t be ignored she won’t be ignored steel blue eyes long brown hair  spilling over muscular curves  she’s a fighter  a rare beauty with an unquenchable fire  she’s going to take life by the throat you must be strong to love her
"Tell me how to ignore you harder, I haven’t quite mastered it enough I think."
never go to bed without making peace with the day and by day I mean her
"We don’t have to understand each other to fall in love, we just have to plant gardens together on the bridges"
It’s late. I’m spiraling into control. That’s bad for all of us.
the purgatory of the middle of the night
soldier first writer second
I grew so much from her toxicity
Unless you address me directly I don’t read subtweet nor do I think it’s necessarily the adult way to communicate. It is the more childish way to communicate. Much like a temper tantrum.
I’m a real motherfucker at times but at least I’m honest and you know what you get
There’s a line of dicks waiting for me to leave. Go fuck one of them. Take your pick and take care.
Listening to the new album by Eric Truffaz and drinking a Negroni. It’s a high brow evening.
I hate that I still see some of those people around here. They suck as people.
"I don’t need anything I don’t already have. I feel so powerful being alone that I doubt I could really let anyone in, at least for a while. You could say I’m married to my work and the life I’ve chosen. If you walk on water that might get my attention."
I never apologize for who I am.
"Historically I’ve always been someone to grow into, savor over a period of time. I was always hard to reach. I was always inside my head lost in worlds I’ve created. I’m easily bored and have a short attention span, but when I do rarely fall in love I fall hard and completely."
I’ve have loved. I fell hard for my second love but it must have been two years before I ever told her I loved her. What is love anyway? Is it the commitment to my ex and the mother of my children? Is it lust exemplified on a pedestal? Or is it completely understanding another?
there’s no way back from that just let the fires burn down and let someone else build something over the ruins
she’s next to me drawing listening to music her breath is my breath her heart is my heart I know one day she’ll have her own life her own dreams and triumphs and failures  it won’t be cool to hang with her Dad or ride on the back of the motorcycle with her pink butterfly helmet
I’m goth inside
I actually like going crazy I do it all the time
There’s always an opening there
I have an opening in my friend zone
"I have a hold on my sanity tonight if that’s what you mean, lol!"
she sees things nobody else does
"she’s the kindest person I’ve ever known, she was born from fire  her hair is long and wild and her heart bleeds for everything  the rage she unleashes is always quiet until it’s not"
"that typo wasn’t my fault, I was dictating"
and when I drink sometimes the words to choose me
"an abandoned old church that’s it, that’s the tweet"
writing fearlessly without worrying who you’ll offend is the greatest expression of truth
the wars will outlive me
all fundamentalism is a crime against humanity  wherever it is found to be
those who will rule the world are those that understand human nature
I’m an atheist I don’t believe in your heaven or hell  or paradise or purgatory if you need to believe this to get through the night  then I will support your beliefs all the way up to the point where you harm another because they disagree
hell is laughing
I never get political  I get survival
don’t understand me go back to bed
the love-sex economy is alive and well
you’re all a bunch of fucking slaves lost between media hype and the self preservation of delusion  I’m done hating you tonight
All good citizens are in bed by midnight
the boot gets tighter on your neck when all you worry about is true love and getting laid  there are forces banking on this
real bondage is the crossroads where corporations meets religion and government  which enslaves us all
Your boring triggers me
I’m writing the strangest sexts tonight
take what you need  in the end this is all that matters  and the owners are afraid
somebody needs to kick the can wake you suckers up
pay me fuck the world
"I’m a shameless hypocrite  that deserves your judgement  it’s okay, I don’t care"
how can any of you afford to sleep?
you’re all dead like me
I’m beyond sins of the flesh stop trying to tempt me
I hold back all the time except when I don’t
"sorry if your tenuous grasp on reality is easily shattered and you never noticed the ass fucking you’ve been receiving all of your life from the establishment, but someone has to be the whore it might as well be you"
"I’m American, I don’t get political unless it serves my self interest I also want to fuck you in a church"
you were waiting for me to rant I know you too well
every cookie is a state sponsored  spy where the state is now the corporation
every time you accept the terms and conditions an angel loses her wings
"I always write when nobody is looking, it’s the pact I’ve made... terms, conditions, you know, the things that kill democracy"
we still appreciate the dawn even though there is enough murder in the world to extinguish the sunset
sitting next to my youngest while she narrates and walks me through her favorite video game may just be my idea of heaven
It think it’s time to make some jalapeño infused simple syrup for a spicy jalapeño gimlet
If I seem to be at arms length it’s because my life is like a falling dagger right now  you’re better off just letting me fall until I stick somewhere  that’s the safest time to pick me up
"I’ve never been one for playing it safe, pathologically so"
there will never be peace
perfectly isolated within myself I crave stimulation to feel alive noise to silence the devils  and drink to drown my favorite demons
So I decide to go inside. I was greeted by a white trash devil and his bride. They were eating some sort of flesh. There was no apparent way out of the room. He asked me how many disciples Jesus had and I fired off “12”. “That was quick” the trashy she devil said.
street tacos from an LA food truck
“You like blood? You like violence? You like freaks? The. This is the place for you!” the insane clown said to me hawking his club  “The Beetle House.” in Hollywood.
there are no second chances  there are only the recycled problems that ended things the first time  that we pretend didn’t happen
Now that’s a fucking drunk tweet!
I’m always restless
Imagine for a moment if all the great writers and musicians had twitter Townes Van Zandt Bukowski  Fante Burrows Kerouac Hemingway Steinbeck Hank Williams  Lucia Berlin I can’t list everyone but you get the idea
I see you  it’s that simple and that complicated
"I don’t know how people can write sporadically here, it’s all or nothing for me. Once I start bleeding I die. No half measures exist in my soul."
"I’m probably more like Jesus than the Devil but I’m done saving people, it’s time to save myself."
"two years ago I strolled through Washington Square in the fall with my children and their mother and that was one of my best recent memories, but life moves on and I never let nostalgia stand in the way of finding my bliss and new love"
be kind to the least among you
I have a big picture to worry about
"I’ll keep writing, don’t worry I have no choice"
Is it normal to have “Shadowplay” by Joy Division on repeat over and over?
she’s the brightest star in the night who pretends she’s a void
I found truth in your absence and she was a seductress like I’ve never known
"can’t,  sucking the marrow out of life"
you are unforgettable love
Twitter is dead
we all die do it while doing something you love
I don’t pray to any god who would allow human existence
I am art I am pain I am perdition
"I’m here to disturb you, shake you from your comfortable life, to illuminate what’s really going on around you"
"Loud music, really loud but nothing drowns out the din of demonic violins scraping your soul off of their soiled feet"
"Day 12: Drunk again, not writing except inside my head."
"you’ll never understand, none of you, not really, and if that’s not the loneliness feeling ever"
"stress is stress, pain is pain, it’s all relative and doesn’t matter at all who’s dick is bigger"
I still pretend that I could actually love you
"I know my machine gun like I know your body, every curve, every button, every trigger, and I’ve slept with both on cold nights where I thought I was going to die, and I still dream of that level of intimacy, that softness bringing me back from knives"
I’m pretty much beyond being careful
"reply guys gross me out that stink of desperation  smells like “look at me! I’m a douche like all the others” a dime a dozen, a stereotype  a disingenuous played out player"
"there are no more lying naked in the sunlight dappled through soft blinds on a lazy afternoon while sipping wine, tracing your lines and admiring the roses I brought for you, everything from here on is death and fighting death and drinking myself to death while remembering you."
indifference is worse than hatred and I’m sorry
there has never been a fall so far or so dark or so permanent as that which you let yourself when you finally let go
"there are wars that I must be a part of, but on my own terms"
I hate many of the people you love
you can’t unsee hell you can only try to drown it as best you can
I’m listening to the new 2019 Nick Cave album. Nobody should ever have to lose a child.
defeat is more important to success than privilege could ever be
In the end we don’t want to be alone in our pain we seek understanding community peace
"the best among us are the lonely, suffering in silence, in the cold and the dark and who struggle with the complexities of being human these are the ones I love"
when there is no trance there are no words
once it grows roots love never leaves me
she just ignores my masks
I’ve lost enough people permanently to know to cherish the ones I have left. This is why I no longer hate the people who were once in my life that were imperfect and proved to be a disappointment. We’ve all had dark moments. We all have dreams. There’s hope for everyone.
stop painting me human
good job society
"we’ve distilled the essence of a person into a tweet, a swipe, a passing snapshot with bad lighting, a nothing of a moment"
From my bookshelf
Nevermore
"You’re a vessel brother, an appliance. She doesn’t give a shit about you. You’re a short term solution to her long term problem. She’ll shake her ass to keep you hooked until she doesn’t need you. Realize this and have fun with her, but know you’re not the only one she’s fucking."
I make the most delicious spicy margaritas with agave nectar and jalapeño infused tequila. So good I’m not even going to scroll my TL to see the crazy shit I wrote last night.
this world turned its back on me so I took what I wanted  I forced open closed doors and I made fools of kings
the currency of flesh
show me your god  and I’ll show you you
you don’t win until we spend Christmas morning together
and nobody has had me because I’m not a whore
I don’t want what everyone has had  it’s really that simple
you can never know me until you taste my secrets
I never want the night to end and I never want to wake up
"It’s okay, I know there are others. I’m hard to attain, the path is narrow. I don’t mind being alone."
I’ve eaten sin it’s taken me this long to recover  to see the brilliant sunrise
I’m going to leave the world a better place than I found it even if it kills me.
"I tell my daughters even though you are beautiful you need to stand on your own two feet. Never rely on someone else, especially a man. I know my kind. Get educated, get a career. Self reliance is power."
You should read the novel I’ve written inside my head that’s slowly making its way onto paper.
“I am the bullet in the gun”
Everybody gets it wrong. Intimacy is  the natural progression that wells from mental stimulation. It’s the next step in knowing a person’s soul. That’s why one night stands feel so hollow. It’s because you just skipped out on an entire person’s essence and rushed to the ending.
I don’t want to fuck you. I want to know you.
People are redeemable. Never forget that.
The devils who know they are devils will steer clear from your light if you have the courage to shine on
make peace  wherever and as often as you can
she’s in love with my violence  I’m in love with restraint
I want to be your nothingness
"My words are like a combat knife, simple, deadly, and I hope you bleed over every one I write."
we might just fuck around and form our own abyss
I’m still in love with your smoke and mirrors. Fuck you for not being real.
It’s the last song that I take back for myself. It was more about me than you anyway and you’ve never heard it.
"become the pain, do something great with it"
orgiastic words
I spend half of my time trying to scare you away and the remainder trying to reel you in. That’s what purgatory is all about.
sometimes dreams are as simple as waking up next to you naked and warm on a loop forever
You’re the one
I see good people who are assholes at times and I still see good people
I find comfort in blackened skies
Distance is our only obstacle. That will change next year.
From Sweden by the way.
I’ll stop haunting you
I’ll stay this time
Your opinion of me is none of my business as mine is none of yours. We do our thing as best we know how and we have no choice.
Tonight it’s Duvel and spicy margaritas and insane writing
I don’t read subtweet
it’s a good thing you can’t catch an STI by reading someone’s TL
everything is a lie
let us pretend that none of you are here as I dig deep into my skull for something real to say
I’m not sure I can do painfully “normal”.
the twitter version of shaking your ass while looking over your shoulder with big brown eyes and a coy smile as the boys drool all over themselves and chase you down the street   *a subtweet
the last one did all she could to destroy me but I just laughed and slurped the spittle off my face with my fingers
I’ll only hurt you in the end but it will be delicious
"the words, the photos, the melodrama all mean shit until you meet me in person, then you’re  fucked forever"
"We don’t seem to understand the fragility of life on a conscious level and things can change so quickly, so permanently, that we are fools for not trying for the ones we love and desire."
talking with ghosts
and like an idiot I’m still here
"most days I feel like writing here is metal on metal and should just move on. I have every reason to do so. It’s a fruitless distraction, this shit almost ruined my life at one time, there are no meaningful conversations, I write better anonymously(but some of you always find me)"
there are hellscapes inside my head that I’m dying to show you
"Perhaps I do care about you as a human being, despite mistakes born from love. We once talked about unconditional love, remember? I still believe in it but it’s difficult to attain. The passing of time makes it possible, while the throes of passion blinds us to the possibility."
"Twitter/thought police: No pineapple on pizza, no replying, or even worse quoting an RT.   Me: So basically no conversing, is that right? It seems like there are serious rampant unchecked control issues going on and I happen to fucking love pineapple on pizza sometimes! Fight me."
she collects little memories  from men who wanted to love her until the last sunset
*must love museums
"the way I love, when I love, there are no half measures, that’s why it’s so fucking dangerous and I don’t do it lightly"
"If I fell for you we’d just end up depraved and irresponsible, drunk on lips and asses and eyes and hair and raw flesh, warm and heaving, lost in the darkness, lost in each other, becoming one body from two as we try to fuck ourselves into each other"
"I just had a bowl of Count Chocula, ho, ho, ho..."
has anyone seen where literary twitter has gotten off to?
"I’m taking care of myself, getting fit, eating right, cutting back on drink...well, nobody’s perfect..., I’m writing, forgiving, spending time with my daughters, so right now I’m not looking for anything but friendship and laughter. Next year is going to be a wild ride."
"Fuck you Brits for getting Peaky Blinders before your pan Atlantic cousins. Tonight motherfuckers, tonight!"
I clearly don’t drink enough to be the writer I want to be
"okay, laying off the whiskey fueled tweet storms"
I’m not very good at the rules
"I don’t think you were a good person but I’ll lift my glass and toast to growth, both mine and yours, and perhaps to happiness and wisdom and the power of forgiveness"
if I could just reassemble your broken pieces pieces of pale flesh and silken hair and glazed over eyes  stitched together into one raggedy insatiable little fuck doll
you make me want to use you up  consume you completely until there’s nothing left of you but my desire and your submission
I can still taste your nectar
the knives we have at each other’s throats reflect a cold steel sunset in a particularly beautiful way
I subtweet random strangers because I’m diabolical
"I’m not ready for earth shattering at the moment, give me a gentle rainfall, a cool breeze whispering through the trees and a hot cup of coffee and call it insatiable"
you can collide with a person and roll with all the calamity of not being ready and still wish them well in another life
"I miss DC, New York, Philadelphia, Amsterdam, Brussels, Brugge, Köln, Trier, Xanten, Paris, Den Haag, Baltimore, Leiden, and Laon."
you can’t get into Valhalla by being a wimp
I won’t die in bad blood  If I can’t make things right I can at least paint things in perspective
"just think, had we fired up our insatiable romance back then we’d be done already"
whoo! that’s quite enough banality for one evening.
your eyes are demonic in the most unhinged sort of way
when she tells you who she is believe her
I can’t shake you can I? I’m fucked and lost and never want to breathe outside of you
if you met me live and in person you wouldn’t let me go ever
companionship isn’t that the ultimate elixir?
I have a few redeemable qualities but I’ll always be a rogue at heart
I’m off to war I wouldn’t want me for you in that context
I want you it’s that simple  and that complicated
people whom society has deemed can do no wrong are tyrants in the raw
let’s spend wistful afternoons half awake in post coital bliss inside each other’s arms in Paris or New York
life is short what a joke
we’ll all be dead in less than a hundred years nothing you do or say even matters in the end
sometimes hate is a scream without an echo in the void  sometimes it’s a memory
"Nobody under 32 DM me, we won’t work out"
give me your perspective  help me understand
"you can either hate me or change my mind, either way it says much about you"
hate me if it makes you feel better I do
who else can I pick a fight with?
striking nerves end up as the best orgasms
don’t get caught dead with me
"I push you away only to see if you come back, to see if you’re the one"
for this to work you have to love me more than I’m capable of loving you but I’ve already written all the “I’m sorry’s” and tucked them away in little envelopes
I hope your PTSD gets better love thinking of you
"I’m an asshole but I’m a mostly honest asshole, except when I’m not"
I’m so close to you my world is in fact your world
the things we murder to dissect  *credit Wordsworth sort of
Tequila makes me a mean writer
the whole sugar daddy/baby thing is a little pathetic don’t you think? To each their own but I would rather just be alone. Fight me.
I thought I loved you but it was my mirrored reflection in your eyes that I loved all along
let me be the one who dilates your eyes and owns your breathing
stoically watching snapshots of lives bleeding from the minds that drive the words that flow past my feed
a world of adventure awaits us
Bela Lugosi is dead
our rear view mirrors are still in love
I’m not trying to be anything to you but the passing smile of a green eyed stranger
it amazes me at how I can completely control another human being with two fingers a mouth and a tongue
there are sunsets where you could never follow me nor would I want you to
she came to me in the night and never left
I’ve lived a long time and the tragedies pile up among the leaves in the cold
a lover I’ve touched is dead now it doesn’t get more real than that
October is my comfort month
she’s a mystical magic woman
I belong on the East Coast
you’re the one  even if we never meet
teardrops can be miracles
what shall we get up to tonight?
the invisible barriers standing between us and bliss
feed me orange slices and laugh when I look into your eyes
I’ll just gorge on your energy until there’s nothing left of you but devotion for me
"yes, I’m writing about you"
I could really fall in love with you if we weren’t both so damned
Fuck I’m tired
all of these words are just a small part of an elaborate suicide note
just so you know I will never imagine you without my hand around your throat
distance and circumstance and a hammer and an anvil and coals in a hot fire
New York’s finest  thanks brothers
I will never fit into the planter you’ve built but there will always be roses
"I want to be on your world, your reality, but you seem so far away, so impossible"
god you
my dead other accounts feed the life of this one
crash land me
I had nothing but sand spilling through my fingers and a thirst only mirages can beguile you into
In many ways I’m a saint I’m a devil in all the worst ways though  I’m not sure what cancels what out
Americans can’t drink worth a shit
my only crime is I did what it took to survive
there are some of you I could really fall for if I could ever forget who I am
if you want to love me you need to keep pushing the sky away
I was beautiful before you
bury me in my best memory
I lose so many followers because I bring them art they can’t handle but I’m grateful
sometimes I think life is too short to shut someone out no matter what they’ve done  unless they’ve moved on in that case leave them alone
the past is a spectre  the present is a ghost a banshee screaming her regret  and lost love is an angel crying to forget
"you know I cry for every beautiful thing I write, I’m not afraid to admit that for that is the standard for great writing"
forever is a memory that has forgotten the present moment
I know I could love you forever but forever for me is much shorter than it used to be
it’s weird how time distorts the music
I wish I knew you
I could love you but I’m old enough to know not to love the impossible
"I should be doing everything else but fucking off here, but I’ve already met my deadline and this is the vomit aftermath mixed with bourbon and sadness"
I’m cool dying alone better than dying broken
I can do a lot of damage in an evening and then disappear for weeks essentially
she’s a stranger who keeps me real
people find their way they survive even at the expense of other people
my words are holy
I wanted a different future this one tastes of bile and regret
I tweet too much who cares fuck you and your restraint
mermaids are real in their own way
the sea will always remind me of you
I’m reclaiming the music and the memories
I wish your pockets held more stones  that water was warm and you wasted it
"I never heard this song before, I’ve heard the notes and the rhythm and the lyrics but never the song  even when I was with you"
just read me I’m not looking for love just maybe a little understanding
love me in spurts love me in absence
I’m all over the place all the time it’s okay I’m enjoying an existential crisis I actually love when they happen.
Based on a conversation I had last night...  Men: wash your fucking hands...with soap...so you don’t give your woman UTI’s.   *Fucking gross!
carving a moment whatever that means but it means the world most times
interacting with you is like spitting into a volcano
"I’m the best writer here despite what sycophants following mediocre accounts would tell you  they’ve got nothing on me with their rehashed bullshit that’s been over recycled to death my shit is a rollercoaster a loaded gun an over friendly, if insatiable lover"
I live life pretending I haven’t seen the abyss and it hasn’t seen me
I’m weird go away
"I don’t know what half of you write about half the time, but then again, I don’t know what I write about half the time either, but somewhere in all of it may be some truth and an assorted Oxford comma"
I remember where I came from
I’m the quintessential American story I grew up poor snacking on cold corn on the cob in Southern Louisiana beans and cornbread once a week depression era farmer’s rice my great grandmother made private schools abroad feast and famine and feast again in the end I make my own luck
be real even if people hate you for it literary greats were honest  and the best ones didn’t write what was comfortable or what they thought people wanted to hear they wrote what they thought people needed to hear
LA is home base. Let me know.
dark rabbit holes are the only rabbit holes for me
I was a dreamer as a child and the most awkward of teens my young adult years were spent doubting myself  It wasn’t until they taught me how to kill that I leaned about confidence and the sanctity of life  and humility and I’ve been trying to reconcile life and death ever since
"I’ll be working in Midtown Manhattan until October. I would love to have a get together with Twitter writers at a local bar for an evening of drinks and conversation, my otherwise demanding schedule allowing. It would be nice to put some faces with usernames. DM me."
some of you are too hard on yourselves
pretend you’re my light enshrine me in the dark
ground zero in my drafts folder the void has more to say
go for the thirsty ones so I am sure you’re unworthy
"In a bar there aren’t two hundred motherfuckers talking to the girl you want, unlike Twitter. I just skip it on the latter."
"Twitter, like people, is 99% bullshit It’s that 1% that keeps me scrolling"
I’ve stopped looking
I’ve done acid which makes me pretty much immune to your hot selfies I’m more likely to admire the shape of your skull over the shape of your breasts or ass or the soft contours of your beautiful legs
I have her to thank her for showing me how bad bad could be
with age comes wisdom with wisdom comes the realization that I don’t settle and that solitude isn’t so bad it might even be preferred
the universe has other plans
"flattery is much easier than telling the truth  *Dostoevsky, sort of"
it was a fool’s paradise built on the foundation of rot
I think sailing on the Mediterranean is an idea I could obsess on until it became reality. For those who don’t know me this is how I’ve accomplished everything so far.
I write crazy shit sometimes and maybe it doesn’t make sense to you but I’m essentially writing for me without concern whether my audience understands/likes/cares and you have a complimentary ticket stage side to me calling out the demons that bedevil me  while calling it art
I plan on finishing this week
*a suicide in the desert
Chapter I: Somebody
I play with words but the reality is my reality would terrify you
darkness is real life
I’m retiring from the life next winter but it’s become a part of me it’s who I am I’m not sure I can walk away without looking back without being haunted  by the things I’ve had to do by the good I’ve done  and the evil I’ve seen
death is all I know it’s my only intimacy
I sell death  from the back of a pickup truck where loyalty died and was buried in the flag I’m a merchant of misery now  and I sell my soul to the highest bidder
the congregation of the lost beseeched my help to protect them sought the help of the devil the irony of this does not escape me my skills are universal  my skills are for sale
I was raised by the sea
"When we die we, wait, we don’t actually die. Death is an illusion, a human construct. We are, I mean I am eternal. Since you are me and I am you and everything I suppose we can stop fucking around with this whole death/separate from the universe bullshit and learn to love ourself"
"One year ago today I was hiking the Swiss Alps, eating fondue in Mürren, and watching waterfalls in Gimmelwald. Thanks Facebook for making me feel bad about how pathetic this summer has been."
I can say one thing about her she’s repentless  she can justify almost anything
"I’m weird, so what  you’re normal, boring, and never took a chance on anything"
I have restored the Eyrie it’s gardens it’s life I still brood inside of its dark halls next to an ancient forest  above the clouds  above the city far below
spending an afternoon at an art museum followed by good food and drinks and a sunset on the beach may be my idea of heaven
never question my nerd credentials
I’m not really the devil but you wouldn’t know that from what she tells everyone
"I was making sushi with my youngest daughter when we noticed the kitten wasn’t around. “I hope she didn’t get outside somehow and get eaten by a bird.” She told me. Just then a huge raven flew by. Several panick stricken hours later we found the little shit in the pantry, asleep."
the best tweet marred by a typo
you know I would be good for you I take care of my woman I know how to fix things I know how to fight I cook and clean  and know how to load a dishwasher
"I’ll never make it to 2,000 followers so I can delete this shitty account at this rate!"
fuck your galaxies and sunflowers and rib cages you unimaginative motherfucker
this is my universe  all of you are just renting space and time
I’m the only god you need
I hate autocorrect!  *your
I wear the mask of a monster so only the brave enter my forest  I forgot what I was going to write after that
I’m so beyond you  you’re abuse helped me fly  and for that I’m grateful
the west is the best  but she’s on the east coast  and I’m torn between sunsets and sunrises
demons and devils aren’t real...before autocorrect
"Chapter I haunting me, I break down in memory...it will happen this week."
I cannot end this night
"have you ever been drunk and staggered through a cool night in a dark neighborhood with the smell of jasmine in the air, the band you just saw reverberating in your head? Then you are still alive."
"I let you see a glimpse of my mind every now and then but you could never know me from what I reveal, from what I let you see."
"sometimes I’m immune to alcohol, ghosts, and graveyards"
there are no other lifetimes
“Raise your horns raise them up to the sky...”
With this view
"after six weeks of rebuilding three staircases, power washing, sanding, and staining I’m finally fucking done with my massive deck project! An 80 foot long deck with a dining and jacuzzi area next to a forest. I’m exhausted tonight."
write drunk delete sober
It’s late kiddos  the east coast is either vomiting or experiencing post coital ecstasy fly over country is passed out with their bibles clutched in their credulous hands  and we hold outs in California and the Pacific Northwest will see your hungover asses in the morning
I work hard on alienating everyone
"I’ve been catfished three times in a row, one was two years long...I’m done with human relations"
long legs and tight abs make up for any perceived shortcomings and that’s my fucking problem
I’m also an unapologetic asshole  never forget
"it’s like im in the dark the silence is comforting then a voice whispers loud, thunderous, like a knife stabbing the still of contemplation  and then I’m self conscious again"
personally I feel invisible here every like is a start every retweet a jolt
I’m probably not writing about you nobody in particular
There are people who put a period after texts/DM’s and those who don’t. I prefer the former. I’m a purist.
and to think I hold back all the time
I have bad taste in women go away
I hate text speech it makes you look stupid
*memories
"god, have some taste in who you spread your legs for  your choices of who you fuck behind my back reflect on me"
I don’t need an orgasm I need creation
at this rate I’ll never get laid calling out vacuous bitches
a homespun diva dancing among the sunflowers longing for an aged galaxy with old man hands
"I’m not promiscuous, I’m sorry you had the wrong impression."
I’m vengeful I hold a grudge and I have a long memory
living a good life is the best revenge
I do enjoy the torment  you’ve set up for yourself  now contast that with the beauty of the freedom you once enjoyed  this is my revenge
"I’m nobody really, just a man who takes a look around every so often and observes the world around me"
we all have regrets some are forgivable enough to press on with a beautiful life  others just need to be forgotten
I will never hurt you I will never know you
loyalty will be remembered while betrayal will be thrown to the bone yard of regret few possess the qualities of the former
Jesus!
"I know, I’m weird tonight"
"most of you are just highly evolved primates with cellphones and an internet connection  you can see it in your base needs and urges rutting is fine, but ascending to futant status is exceptional"
sure you have a pretty face your eyes are captivating I imagine your mouth in all sorts of situations but it’s the shape of your skull that I truly admire
I have the ability to see your inner reptile no matter how nice you seem
"I’m going to regret a lot of tweets tomorrow, I can already feel it"
I’m too old for all but the most serious of bondage sessions
I’m completely unprepared for weekend Twitter don’t sideswipe me!
the worst devils are doe-eyed
what sort of sick shit shall we get into tonight?
Do something even if it’s wrong
"Today is the last day of your life. The past and future don’t exist, they are constructs."
Holy shit! I wrote that? Lol!
"listening to old men, working men, talk about the game tonight whatever that means"
drinking at a dive bar at the edge of civilization  again
this place is toxic only if you let it be but you may have to fight once in a while
I’m not sure I’m in the right headspace to come back down to “normal”
“You’re the worst influence ever by the way.”
she understands me we were in love once for over a lifetime  and we are close  as close as two people can be who are going their separate ways she knows how to keep me from destroying myself I make sure she doesn’t pass out in her clothes on those too many glasses of wine nights
the worst part was giving up the madness  regular life doesn’t do madness so well
I’m a decent person ignore all the skulls and shrouds and ravens and stuff
I struggle to keep up these human pretenses the truth is I see all the ugly nuances of this thing everybody pursues sometimes I indulge them
there’s no pain there never has been
It’s happened a lot and will again and again for most of us
give me old school jazz playing on vinyl and a warm afternoon breeze making the curtains breathe
the unknown is as exhilarating as it is frightening but we move forward into the darkness with confidence and courage for there are new worlds to be discovered
I’m finishing up the last chapter of a long drawn out book of a life I will not miss.
"someday I will feel you from memory but today it is only from dreams, maybes, and what ifs"
I call them the trauma bond triumvirate harpy works too
I never knew her  nobody has
I plant gardens to surround myself in beauty
she’s a broken girl and the only thing I know how to do is destroy
if you can live with yourself then I can too
I’ve survived much more than you but you were my favorite failure
no pain  no pleasure just grayscale indifference
I like the bad ones the raw ones the ones who know where we stand even if that is nowhere in particular  or on the precipice of never
you have the eyes of an insatiable lover but one where I wake up in an ice bath minus a kidney
all dark things have fled
"I’ve lost access to my IG page, enjoy it as it is. I’m on to other things."
I’m never where the crowds are including on your TL
"I took both my header photo and Avi. The header is by the beach at Sheveningen, The Hague, Netherlands, and the AVI is from the Walter Museum, Baltimore, Maryland."
I never sin I make you do it
it always gets better until one day it doesn’t
fuck
"I like to reach out to old girlfriends on occasion to let them see what they’ve given up, lol!"
going down my list of why I hate you and nothing seems relevant in the today of distant memory
one last martini before sinking into oblivion one more time
fight or fuck it’s all the same to me
Our bodies are but vehicles on the road to the infinite.
I’m rarely tempted by sins of the flesh. Sins of the mind however? Fuck!
I’m really surprised that I live just outside the second largest city in the US and nobody on my feed lives there.
I try to follow back. I really do but I’m bad at the mechanics of Twitter. I’m basically here for the intellectual masturbation.
I let you off to easy. You let me go too casually.
I like the freedom to say whatever fucked up shit crosses my mind. It doesn’t mean anything really. I just like to read my drunk rants in the morning.
I get real crazy sometimes yet you still follow me. That says much about you more than me I think.
my story is hollow played out
I’m too hard on myself I’d rather take it out on you
love is the lie that will consume you in the end
I never hide my scoundrel past
"I may be suffering the fruits of my sins alone, forever"
don’t tempt me with ecstasy when I deserve nothing more than oblivion
I’ll regret engaging your mind in the morning
I’m not anybody you want to know I’m just a nobody with a perspective in the end
arguably I’m no longer human
my emotional side is dead and engraved in stone all that’s left for you is the machine
judge me I’ll reserve the right to do the same for you
"I’m weird, eccentric, intelligent, and could fuck you into a new reality"
"I could tell you the myriad ways I want to fuck you but then I would have to kill you, online data isn’t free"
even though I have much on my mind
I’m drunk but you won’t get anything from me tonight
I’m not going to paint you in a good light for that’s not what the truth is. I will put you in context though.
This fall I’ll be living in New York. I hope to do Oktoberfest in Central Park when I’m not working my ass off.
I was in Paris a year ago drinking wine and beer under the Eiffel Tower I had retained (ie bribed) my own vintner of sorts who kept us in supply
"listen to the rumors judge and get the fuck out of my life I only respect those who are not sheep, gullible, and make their own decisions"
I bite
the same for holidays
there’s a loneliness on the weekend only the lonely understand
my time of year is arriving
every exhale is the breaking dawn
every inhale is a sunset
I’m probably not for you
give me an insatiable thirst over the gluttony of the force fed average
there are no more gardens for me
most nights I just pass out after the struggle of the day
she tried to quell the pain the past with the touch of average the mediocre the undeserving  those better suited to be pitied rather than entertained  unable to drown out the thunderous claps of true love  that echoes in the darkness  she settles
cold blooded
nothing new can happen for me my bliss consists of recycled episodes of the same lover with a different name
I think if I knew you’ve forgotten me I could forget you show me some mercy
it was whispers in the dark that kept me awake not of love and building futures  but of marriage and abortion  of secret affairs and arrangements of dignity sacrificed in the name of survival of which pretty young girls never speak of in the sober daylight
attachment is tiring
I don’t mean to brag (yes I do) but my entire life has been sharing the days of wine and roses with elemental evil
"my drunk tweets are my skeleto...er, bodies in the closet."
All the assholes preemptively blocked me.
I’ve grown to pick carefully the people I do associate with. You know who you are.
anti-social anti-you
I avoid people on purpose yet there still isn’t enough alone time
"I’m quite liking this quiet loner phase of my life, it feels invincible"
it’s sad to me that ghosts want to remain bones
I should be by your.side
confession: I’m gauging “likes” posted during core hours against the hold the plutocracy has on America...
"I tweet what I want, when I want, how often or how infrequent I want. Fuck your rules, your judgement, and your so called sensibilities. Click that unfollow/Mute/Block button and go take your banal/vacuous/boring life elsewhere."
I’m the best thing that’s never going to happen to you
"you, on the half shell"
I saw Americans in Europe when I lived there I avoided their loud mouthed bloviating asses I don’t identify
we have a simple whore in common
I hate you you motherfucker but you can be poignant at times
at 2000 this account will die as well
nobody likes honesty or raw or real the twitter elite have built empires on recycling plastic
I’ll have old hands soon
nothing about me is measured
I love in bursts
pent up you
You have to deal with my explosions
I’d rather be drinking you
cold against my lips hot against my groin
trust is important actually without it you don’t have me
I’m less interested in being defined as I am being experienced
my syntax may be deteriorating soon  love me while you can
some words need to bite your neck and fuck you deep
taste yourself from me
"dirty, raw, filthy...my promise to you"
the gates of heaven lies inside your ass
correct my typos with your mouth
you didn’t try hard enough you let the wrong ones in that’s why your life will be hard
I’ll write about how I want to fuck you simply because if I write about how the government wants to fuck us all I could go to prison
I want to write what I want to write but to pay the bills I’ll write what you want to fuck
pushing you away is my erogenous zone
you won’t hear from me for a few days drink my words while you can
suck the void from me
earning NSFW’s
exploding words and warm receptions
a tweet storm fingers deep orgasmic event
that thing I do that you love  it’s actually an art form that’s lost on most
"three fingers you decide where no, I decide where"
one hand on your throat the other gripping your hands I won’t stop pounding  I just won’t
your orgasms are capital  and I like to spend irresponsibly
let me have your orgasms to do with what I please
whiskey cunnilingus
two fingers to define you
let me tease your everything with my tongue
fucking me won’t be as good unless you’ve found yourself  then it’s everything
I’m an asshole out
I’m fucking ruggedly handsome and experienced unlike that dork you’re talking to
I need you to submit
I hate all of you  but I’ll make you feel good within that context
don’t fuck with the desperate  don’t engage them either
"don’t be reading me during work hours you proletariat scum, your owners demand more of you"
let me vomit poetry in your lap and place flowers in your hair
hell is where the heart is
I have a soft spot for German women  my grandmother was German
the ones who want to fuck me haven’t been alive as long as she’s been gone
the one that hurt the most has been gone for decades
just because you’re dead doesn’t mean I don’t remember the awesome fucking incredible legendary shit you write about times  It just means I don’t care anymore
once you’re dead you’re dead  to me
"It’s not that what I write isn’t brilliant, you’re just too stupid to understand"
I don’t give fourth chances
she wants to drown in my shadow I want to get drunk in her beauty
some of you are heartbreakingly beautiful  like me
I don’t have anything eloquent for you today
"I can tell you one thing miss priss  you really fucked up letting that man go, you may be an idiot"
“You’re being more anti-social than usual.”   *what real friends notice
no writer has restraint  no writer can be silent for long
I’m going to tweet storm the fuck out of you
I’m going to make this dive bar famous  maybe I already have
my time zones are off again
once you realize you are nothing it becomes everything
looking at sunsets through the thorny branches of old roses
her leather biker jacket the smell of her hair the way she is nothing pressed against me
I ate the worm
It’s not that I didn’t love you It’s just I didn’t want you to drink wine out of my skull
everything about you reeks of death
absinthe  a city by the sea dead flowers in the arboretum
too tired to be clever too tired to make sense
I’ve staved off decay for one more day
I’m secretly the ghost of Tom Joad and Jim Morrison
when I say I hate humanity I don’t mean you specifically individually some of you apes can be quite charming for your species  it’s cute seeing the petty machinations and hidden agendas develop behind your beady eyes  like I can’t see right through you
I like the company of broken people
"It’s okay, I don’t understand me either"
missing Jane my complicated beautiful dead lover
so many people are out of sight out of mind out of I wish I’d never met you
"don’t let them fool you brother  they don’t find the “Dad bod” attractive, they find the stability and income attractive, they’ll find the ripped bod behind your back"
"unless you’re a boomer, in that case we are all holding our breath and waiting...unfortunately we can’t fix the shit you’ve fucked up beyond repair. Worst. Generation. Ever."
"this shit show is coming to a rapid end, not in your grand children’s lifetime, in yours"
you twits keep digging carbon up from the ground while allowing your rain forests to burn  what do you think absorbs carbon dioxide while creating oxygen? humans are obviously too stupid to live
Is it political to criticize imbeciles who destroy the planet through environmental ignorance?
together we’ll keep this account small intimate  real
"our sexual imagination has been polluted by the flash of overstimulation, like chaotic city avenues flooded with bright lights, billboards, glitter, noise, and plastic everything extinguishing the smell of musk roses drifting honey sweet in the air horses grazing in wildflowers"
restrain your words and bring nectar
the best ones leave when you make it impossible for them to stay the worst ones hold on  and continually kiss your ass
"humans are ridiculous  they create art and poetry that evoke emotion, sure but typically revolve around the act of procreation  elaborate mating dances of words and images  just another species in the jungle  the best among them having more to say beyond primal mating acts"
"we are just selfie loving hairless apes hurling rapidly through the void on a rock we’ve turned into a carbon dioxide pressure cooker, not an enlightened one among us, yet there are those who would have you believe they are enlightened and that we are the center of the universe"
art can never hurt you
more disciplined than you give me credit for
I dreamt I was in a Christian/Nazi re-education camp ala “The Handmaid’s Tale”. I’m American. It’s not so far fetched.
"I’m always the most intelligent person in the room and I have the guns to back it up, thank Odin I’ve never had to use them"
the detractors for people like me will have you believe I never cared that I just wanted your fuel your appliance they could be further from the truth I wanted to absorb you to love you without reservation  and make you  me
the rules are for everyone else  I go my own way
"most people are painfully average in intellect, in the way they live, the way they dream, I need more than average I require excess insatiableness I require the edge I need to be a little concerned  about who I choose as a lover  and she should be really concerned about me"
everything I write is true
sociopaths fuck better
ruin is when you think of me every time you’re with him  it’s when you wish he was me
I’m probably the end of you  I’m used to it for me
nobody but you knows me here
you’ve filled in a lot of your own blanks but I’m still the void
I figured out I can write and tweet at the same time
I’m the empty side of sadness let me in
when enough time has passed you no longer fault her when enough time has passed  you respect her decisions  but learn to never get close again
most of us are disgusting when the veil is removed
don’t understand never understand  the crowd beckons
I don’t like being drowned out therefore my silence is louder than bombs my reservations are like steel
"I should have posted this here as well. I’ll peek in every now and then, but I need to concentrate my efforts on other things besides intellectual masturbation. There are a lot of moving parts in my life currently."
I sometimes scroll the void looking for some truth
"being blocked by strangers is my personal metric for success, whatever that means here"
I’m going to get lost in the noise for a little while
why did I stop? a moment of clarity  after pounding 12 drinks in an evening sitting alone in my living room I’m not that man plus that’s way too many calories trying to get fit here
I will always be a drinker just 90% less so
struggling with the clarity sobriety brings my relationship with addiction is over  you’ll have to find another way  to kill me
woke up to a world where Brad Pitt is 55 where the mall is dead and there’s nothing on the radio Tarantino made his last movie  but there is enough violence  in any given shopping center at any given festival  any given school at any given time  for a Reservoir Dogs style ending
"I suppose my haters can be summed up as “the mass of men lead[ing] lives of quiet desperation” as Henry David Thoreau once wrote in “Walden”, and perhaps deserve pity and definitely a mute button. It’s sad seeing them reach for negative attention actually. Suicides probably."
At least my enemies can fucking write and put a thought together.
"Imagine a nemesis of Sherlock Holmes as a pathetic reply guy, socially awkward, sexually frustrated, unresolved childhood issues, vague mental illness. It just doesn’t make a good story. Moriarty on the other hand is dark, sinister, an educated Machiavellian criminal mastermind."
"There’s always someone who hates you but the enemies I choose don’t have sad, pathetic lives. My enemies are worthy of my hate."
you should always keep hand written love letters
social media is a lie it’s merely a platform for personal propaganda everyone’s life is shit
there’s nothing out there
everything
I am my own
I smell like motor oil and sweat  my hands are stained with grease slick black within the lines of my hands the motorcycle is up and running  tomorrow I’m breaking weeks of sobriety  maybe even tonight  but everything is back under control
Belief is useless isn’t it? The universe doesn’t care.
I’m a Gemini/Cancer and I’m judging you for asking.
you’re hardly a cult when you have tens of thousands of followers you’re more of a mainstream religion with a watered down message
shameless self promotion...
don’t fuck up my isolation
I’m up to my eyeballs in sin  I always deliver
How many insecure men am I going to trigger tonight? Jesus!
you’re not a wolf or dominant male if you’re under 40 in most cases...you haven’t put in your time to be respectable
Not everyone buys your bullshit
I won’t follow those who follow assholes. Let’s call it guilt by association. Twitter is a large place and I’ll find my community.
I’m tired of everything tired places tired people tired emotions that should just die I’m tired of the past  I’m tired of the future and the present  I require much more stimulation than most can give or are capable of and that makes this world  lonely indeed
I’m tired of reading this schizophrenic’s shit
I just turned down group sex to be with you tonight you can’t say I’m not dedicated to my fans
I know I could have you back with a word but that word you’ll never hear
as for you I’m glad you’re gone my life is the better for it
I’m an asshole in my own right never forget that
I’ll only have coffee with you if the place is crowded and there are lots of witnesses   *call me paranoid in these modern times
"Never go back to a failed relationship. Always forge ahead, discover new ground."
I trigger some people with Daddy issues. Sorry.
I like Bukowski fuck off
Thank god I once had a toxic relationship that has made me invincible
"Dude! Why are you giving her the time of day? She’s vacuous, emotionally immature, has nothing going for her except she has a nice ass and will send you nudes. She needs to leech off of someone, don’t let it be you. She’s essentially a succubus. Do better."
"Oh look! Another tired mysterious account followed me with no followers but following the same people I am. Hello tired mysterious account, I wonder what you’re about?"
don’t be thirsty  it’s unappealing
so many of you of don’t want love as much as you want to win
"True confession: I totally fucking wiped out yesterday in front of two hot women at a convenience store and ripped a large hole on the knee of my favorite jeans. I mean I totally ate shit! I wasn’t drinking, just stupid I suppose."
This thread is already a wreck and I’m not even intoxicated
And fuck you autocorrect!
Just kidding. How in the Hell can I torment you if I delete Twitter?
"I just wrote out a reply, stopped myself, deleted it, and pored another beer. I might delete Twitter soon. It’s bullshit."
lose me I don’t care
I will only make you complicite and devour your innocence
anyone you meet on a dating app is ridiculous
I really only want someone I lust after when I’m away destroy when we’re together hold when we exhaust each other within ourselves  and feel the warmth of the afternoon sun on our bodies through half opened blinds as we sleep in each other’s arms and dream of forever
I don’t swipe because there are too many thirsty men blowing smoke up your ass and inflating your ego
grudge fucking has been some of my most intense experiences sexually
I know. You hate me and love me at the same time. Let’s work out those conflicts over an afternoon of naked bliss.
"If you consume everything from Bill Hicks, George Carlin, Christopher Hitchens, and Alan Watts you will have all the role models you will ever need."
go be with one of the 500 idiots who you swiped right on that’s who you probably deserve and you are probably what they deserve
I may already love you forever and you will never know
Chances are I probably will never love you at all
I don’t really care for the “some people” tweets. Name the motherfuckers or shut the fuck up!
"That was in my drafts folder, lol!"
"scratch your head and hit that block button and go back to your pathetic life, grey and unfulfilled"
explode me love and I’ll do the same
I know exactly who I fucking am and I am laughing at the pathetic lives of the once popular adolescent herd
art is never careful
I want you to lick tears from my face wet and salty memories drowned by obligatory masculinity  lapped up by your tongue the same muscle that danced on the tip of my cock  exploding sunrises in the desert filling up your void  and annihilating me  just for a moment
I may be a real motherfucker but my endgame is to leave the world better than I found it
I have moments of brilliance contained within a life of brilliance framed with idiocy
forget your past it only wants you dead the future loves you unconditionally
death the anthropomorphic symbol we equate  to phase change like heartbreak  pushing you to be a better person
we don’t write we survive  and words manifest
a fist is a universe three fingers a galaxy two is a solar system one is a moon
I’ll carve out this corner of Tuesday evening all for myself
that smell of leather that smell of fear that coexists with nurture
every orgasm is immortal  all aftercare is infinite
death is tomorrow  let’s breathe this moment let’s breathe each other
distance is our devil
when loneliness is a glass the false hope of ice and salt the sting of a spirit on the tongue  the rush of intoxication that lie that replicates the infinite   and nothingness
are you ready?
I no longer believe in unconditional love and there are very few people I would die for
you’re absolutely right I can’t handle you at your worst or won’t rather  but I don’t have to  there are plenty of non toxic people out there
"you’re just a tiny speck on the horizon babe, not that I’m looking but I am thinking"
reading me is like watching a bad car crash but with an intense orgasm
It’s Monday and most of must be slaves but I’m not
nobody are my favorite people
emotional falling down a stairwell and sex should be congruent
she gave me head in the forest  and I exploded into a starry night
sometimes sleep is the best poetry
I always have to sort out my insults in the morning
"“Hey babe, do you want to watch me piss blood?” -an early, yet unsuccessful pick line that never worked in the malls of plastic America"
I’m boring until you find yourself penetrated too deep biting the pillow gripping the sheets
sometimes I even enjoy talking with schizophrenics on the Interweb
I know how I am when I love you I want to consume you
some loves are best left untouched observed from a distance left to remain pure
"I would never slide into your DM’s, I would never want that for you for that’s how much I love you"
"only a fraction of one percent of the world are compatible with me, be elite, love me"
the purveyors of profit want you to believe death is real  those that want you to be enlightened are selfless
"100,000 digital friends equals 2/3 of a real one. I’ve done the math."
for those of you who blocked me you’re sorry cunts anyway
those women on Tinder never realized that right swipe opened a hell mouth
I should be alone for your sake
I only tell you the truth to scare you. Lies are the dulcet deceptions we cling to.
"I forgive all you motherfuckers who don’t deserve forgiveness, just know a fist isn’t destined to knock out your teeth. Thank Jesus, he’s my drinking buddy."
"a message to you from the void: just be okay, find your bliss...everything will be okay"
Hell is where I am so is bliss
I’m not like the devil you read about in Sunday school I’m all that devil but delicious
I tweet when no one is around I’m a ghost like that
regret is a necessary life lesson perhaps we are instruments after all
the broken love me  more than they should
I just want a lazy afternoon with you naked in the bed your warmth in my arms the smell of your hair in my dreams
I tear up my lovers
the blond woman sang a beautiful rendition of Janis Joplin before returning to sit next to me. “That was beautiful!” I whispered into her ear. The music was loud. “I can tell that came from a place of pain.” She looked at me hurt and walked away as if she saw the devil in my eyes
is it too early to rant?
who the fuck orders Bloody Mary’s at ten o’ clock at night?
she realized what I was and the danger her soul was in
I used to concern myself with saving the world now it is trying not to pass out on the sofa until 3am in my clothes
let me scar me you
please
I’m too much for anybody
my most brilliant self always manifests when you motherfuckers are sleeping
you can fuck right off with your Snapchat filters
she sang her soul out at the bar “that came from a place of pain” I remarked and then she disappeared
the smell of ass
I’ve bored you and myself enough for one evening
enjoy my silence when you can
while you’re reading in that sundress I’m dreaming of rope and wax  whiskey and the filthy things we do with our mouths
"wait until I’m famous, you’ll be proud of that retweet"
all of those art museums mean nothing  and everything
meet someone at the library love them forever
go for the one who doesn’t fear death for they won’t fear love
none of you will ever know love until the world changes  you’ll only know temporal gratification  based on the lies of the self interests of those in power those who tell you how to feel what to think
I hope I disgust you because you disgust me
fall in love with a sociopath  you’ll be the better for it
I’m more of a fighter than a lover  I’ve built life on it
I will tear you up  and you’ll never forget me
average will kill us all
I am more evil than tequila
go for the other men they possess just the right amount of mediocrity for you

I hate all of you  I hate myself
I don’t want most of you as followers statistically you’re what’s wrong with the world
I’ll mock all religion  fuck you for being an idiot and destroying people’s lives

I lost three Puritans today good luck self flagellating for your savior
I just swiped on the anti-Christ I’m sure of it
an evening where I’ll be afraid to open twitter in the morning you’re welcome
I am the most intelligent person in any room fight me
and I hate you for you are what’s wrong with the world
two thirds of you don’t possess the intellectual capacity to follow me
Twit twitter is entertaining
to those of you in the oppressive countries of the world I feel for you  and drink a libation  for your struggle  for power is only held by the unworthy  the incompetent the weak the pathetic
tell me things  let me smell your hair
I love solitude  more than any unctuous lover
once a US politician realizes we’re all one and rejects Christian notions of reality the world will be a much better place
remember when that final chapter was in the same book as the beginning chapter and somehow it’s all the same?
I hate your notions of good and evil  read some history  reject your faith
everything you’ve ever been told is a lie
you’re not feeling me tonight  that’s okay fuck you
loving me will actually kill you that’s why my single most beatific act is to leave you
I’m a terrible liar I just know the truth will enslave you
I’m nothing if but real for good or bad
pleasing everyone is lying to yourself
all of your rage is muted by the void and the deafness of it no longer matters
"Them: “Oh look at his cute little tweets, I think I’ll follow him...”   Me: hardcore sex tweet  Them: eject, eject, eject!!!!"
“I’m a dominatrix but I would just melt in your arms.” She said...
there are no tidy little poems here from tidy little people whose insides are torn up hidden behind fake smiles and ill intent while dancing  there are dangerous angry poems hate filled that will choke you out  spit on your face penetrating you wherever they can  making you come
"I imagine you imagining me tearing up that barbecue brisket voraciously, downing each bite with a gulp of beer like I would tear up your pussy"
I write what I fucking want to read fearlessly
"In 37 novels and two short story collections, Burke writes about characters who struggle to do good in a context of pervasive evil.   via @americamag"
fucking me is jail breaking heaven
"I get into this sort of trance when I write, especially the longer stuff I put on Instagram. I key off of an event or a song or a momen or a feeling and when there’s nothing but ash I write about that too."
loving me is dicing with death
genius is too often recognized long after it’s dead
I need you tortured
your photo/video made you feel wanted by the dregs of humanity  congratulations try a real connection sometime
we forget the eternal in order to survive the temporal
we love who we are and who we see ourselves in others nothing more nothing less
I hate all of of you for the way you see me you cannot know love therefore you do not see love
I feel nothing ever  run away
I pretty much observe humanity from the outside
you were everything  I wish I could have convinced you you weren’t nothing
subtweets are dead to me
I don’t belong anywhere come love me
contemplating the room I’m in the space is occupies the time it exists in
fuck digital reality  it’s a lie
"ever read Instagram “poetry” and think of Stuart Smalley “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and dog gone it, people like me.” if you don’t know who Stuart Smalley is then you’re too young for me"
I’m far from safe
we elevate mediocrity  because it feels safe
every moment feels like forever because every moment is
now the memories flood  as I near the end
some bridges burn forever
sometimes just after waking I realize I’m not supposed to miss your psychopathic mouth
if the sex is phenomenal there are always strings no matter what
if I could transform your absence into long afternoons of fucking and sleeping and fucking again holding on to each other while the world spins it’s irrelevance outside of our window
this morning’s bed head makes me resemble the Night King from Game of Thrones
“you’re intimidating as fuck”  *as fuck?
"two thirds of you are fucking idiots  I can usually tell within a short conversation, pleasant as it might be"
I lie when I tell the truth because the truth was never meant to breathe
"just kidding, I don’t have an FBI profile as far as you know"
the moon mutes you
stars are suns but none of them burn brighter than you
if you understand me you’re deluding yourself
love is a marker in time
there was this bookstore in the Deep Ellum back in the day called “forbidden books” and that’s when my FBI profile started
hey babe do you want to watch me piss blood?
just know that I’m alive and you’re alive and we should experience this life in intimate moments that will last forever
I hate you but we had our moments  nobody can touch
Or as the Hound said “I’m going to eat every fucking chicken in this room!”
"I ate a half a chicken for lunch and I was still hungry, I could have eaten the whole goddamn thing"
ruining you is loving you
she must have swallowed two universes that night
I’m looking for a place to put my darkness is it you?
“can you give me sanctuary I must find a place to hide a place for me to hide  can you give me soft asylum  I can’t make it anymore the man is at the door.” - the Doors  *except it turned out I was the man all along
my story ended when time began
"all of my exes have been haunted by the ghost of Jim Morrison, the Miami incident playing out in our living room two or three time per week"
I may very well be the reincarnation of this motherfucker!
"Emotionally I always seem to be in that scene from the movie “The Doors” where a drunk Jim Morrison, swaying to and fro between sets while holding on to the microphone, bellows “YOU’RE ALL A BUNCH OF FUCKING SLAVES!!!” as John Densmore rolls his eyes and drops his sticks."
I’m not sure I can write honestly without pissing a bunch of people off. Fuck it. Fuck them.
it’s never quite goodbye with us is it?
"I’m essentially lazy, it’s all about delegating..."
there are not enough upside down crosses in the world
what does one do when their soulmate is their succubus?
most people are lame  I don’t want to know them
I hunger I hunt
a tweet maelstrom
there’s a fire where all of my former lovers burn
I’m like nobody you’ll ever meet
taste your death on my tongue
I need your filth I demand it my survival depends upon it
my love wants to destroy you but you’ll love me forever  no matter how hard you shut your eyes
my love will not leave a clean place on you
let my fingers penetrate your void
I want those afternoons where we lay naked in bed in each other’s arms and fuck all day  the sun warming us through the blinds
she struggles with mental illness her victories are silent ones her accomplishments are invisible
I manoeuvred you into who I needed you to be
some goodbyes are forever
I’ll choke you with the rope I allow you to run with
If I love you enough I’ll set you free before the kill shot
I don’t love I consume I kill
if you know me  you could never love me but you will forever
I don’t date I engage another human on an intimate level and experience her in all of the ways she is in all the ways she manifests  and after a few weeks take her out  to make it complete  most people don’t understand
"there are people from my past, though I will not seek them out, but should I happen upon them I will beat to a bloody pulp...this I promise."
death is a lie
the fear of death has caused all of our problems
that bitch robbed me of the truth
“trust in me and fall as well”
the monster has made me the monster
"“Okay Lucifer, I’m here!” I shout, knocking on the gates, dragging death by his collar. He’s nothing."
when death finally takes me I’m going to beat his ass down all the way to hell
I’m too weird for you
crawling out of my crater cape smouldering
“queen to queen’s level three”  *street cred
I love you by not loving you at all
I get sick of looking at people sometimes
Eating alone in the the tree line as a band and July 4th celebrations commenced without me for a moment. A brisket and pulled pork plate held my attention. “Are you trying to recover from a hangover?” a man asked. “Yes” I said. “Well you look good doing it!” his woman replied.
Dive bar
I’m just not a writer I’m a pithy little bitch like the rest of you
art isn’t recounting anecdotes of your fucked up lives it’s seeing something nobody has ever seen before
fuck my brokenness  let me pour into you and let a moment  be eternity
how is your boring life treating you?
broken people are my favourite they’ve been through some shit and lived to tell about it
this time it’s over for real
take my hand
probably none of you will ever be okay and that’s okay we can be broken together
Earthquake!  7.1 this time.  The cat was worried...
life has broken me more times than I can count but it’s only when I don’t get back up that I fail...and I never fail
"You’re fine, all of you. Just let time do its thing and hold on for dawn."
*waking up in Paris
I hate that kid
waking up entangled in your nakedness whiling away an afternoon my fingers in your hair yours play on my chest and the sun paints its own version of the blinds over our bodies
"Fuck forever, I want right now."
I am exactly who I say I am. I offer the raw unadulterated truth. Everything I write is non-fiction and based on experience.
I always come back
I’m an asshole but you’ll love me anyway
I’m now friends with all of your enemies
women who scowl in online dating profile photos perhaps that’s why you’re single
I found another version of you  I’ll be thinking of you when I fuck her  hope you are well
"“You can never step into the same river twice.”  *Heraclitus, loosely"
"In hindsight I’m fortunate to have experienced you, us, that moment in time, those feelings that emerge between sleep and awake."
relationship statues: “Where’s my fucking fiddle?!!!”   *as Rome burns
relationship status: you’ll do
I move on after 10k for this very reason. I might move it down to 2k. Don’t follow me.
"Huge accounts scare me, trying to interact with them is like waiting in a long line for an amusement park where they take your money for a plastic idea of reality. They’re fun to look at though."
"“So what are you going to do when you change careers next winter.” she asked, her unfocused eyes I imagined trying to find my face. “I’m going to sell photos of my ass on the Internet.” I told her."
“Move in with me” she slurred. “I’ll suck your cock.” I took a sip. “Actually that’s a lot of work.” she continued. A woman caught my eye. “They call it a blow “job” for a reason.” I said dryly. “Otherwise it would be a blow “ vacation.” She laughed giving me a high five.
"“You could have any woman in this bar.” the drunk woman said, clumsily high fiving me and clinking her Coors light bottle against my glass. “And yet I’m sitting here all night talking with you, defending my life choices.” I thought."
I’m only relevant  because I am you and you are me
part of me wants to grab your hair grip your throat  another part wants to love and nurture you cherish you forever
have you ever just wanted to absorb another person? make them a part of you? that’s how I feel about you
let’s destroy each other  as predator and prey  and history will decide  which one of us was what
I can’t wait to fuck you
I want a good girl in a bad way with bad intention
it took getting over a universe to experience yours
explode  for me
I already know you I know how to make you explode  to feel to love  to experience
I’m better than you...
the past is not my past I’m better than that
I could end up in a city near you
"I purge my inner circle every few years, taking applications"
you don’t know me too bad  *turns shoulder
she always leaves she’s always around  but you just have to recognize her
They’re all you aren’t they? And they’re all me.
someday I will forget to miss you but I will never forget you
whispering “good girl” into your ear as you flood for me
please stop loving me and love yourself for once
I need to get out of here. Europe or DC. I need to call some favors.
“In my life you’re the most special person I’ve ever known. It’s just time to part ways I think.” she said  “I think so too.”
the feel of her skin the taste of her tongue and the smell of her hair may eventually disappear from memory but the music never will
writing is a lot like sex once I drop a big word load I’m spent the next day
loving me will literally kill you so when I love you I have to leave you
I’ll chew up your soft parts before spitting you out I will exalt you before bringing it all down
the double entendre of  don’t lie cheat or steal and the few who know that this means
I write in a trance
she said “I’ll always associate Tool with you” as if she knew forever was a lie
It’s just music It’s just life
sleep might be death  so I fight it off
there was a cat cafe in DC that I regret
I can’t even explain to the common person the things I’ve seen
I’ll never be okay and if you’re okay with that I might love you forever
you still have my diamond eyes  when I think of you...
I died for my country yet my heart still beats
there is not enough time  or enough whiskey or enough you  to satiate me
I remember you  this beautiful human  on the coast  loving cross bone style
"I just see the world differently I see it raw, visceral, horrible, unbelievable, and naked"
I blame all of you for the world we live in and me too
the crowds are definitely not up past 1 am
I don’t translate well online
a world where everything is safe Including thoughts and words
you’re beautiful let me spit into your mouth
There are one or two of you here that I would beat to a bloody pulp should chance put us in the same room together
my rib cage wants to fuck the sunflowers out of your galaxies under the gloaming against the walls of your bedroom
if you were closer we’d be fucking clichés of galaxies into existence
I hate some of you more than others
I could tell you all how much I hate you but I don’t want to be redundant
I risk losing followers after everything I write but what are followers anyway  but symptoms of mediocrity  and the rules we’ve accepted
I create by destroying  it’s who I am
you have a beautiful face let me mess it up and ruin you
the good anal requires hair pulling and spit
I’ll destroy you if you let me I won’t respect you if you do
just cracked my knuckles on my skull it reminded me of your voice
I wrote some brilliant shit in my head but it never made it to paper due to trauma and alcohol  take my word for it
The crowd is average The crowd is mediocrity  The crowd is death
"Photography by JB Fort, Barcelona, Spain"
most people need their art spoon fed to them I hate most people
I’m too old to fuck you and you’re too young to have dozens of orgasms
"I’m 51 years old as of last Friday, I know what it means to be fetishized, I’ve experienced it"
It’s time to ramble on again...
"Don’t make me make my my 18 year old daughter go, lol!"
wasting time with you would never be wasted time
Illusions have power
all those unwanted memories bleeding into my conscience fuck you for that
her filth is magic
I write what I want to read
to be defined is to be murdered
I’m not sure there’s nothing I can’t stand more than “I’m basically looking for a mutually beneficial relationship”.
I realized I don’t know who you are but I know who I am and that’s all that really matters
"I’m cool, ignore your irrelevant conscience"
I don’t write for applause
"perhaps the rumors have some truth to them, perhaps I’m a monster, but nobody can ever question just how good of a father I am"
I think I’ll have one more Rye to cap off this what would be an otherwise unremarkable evening except  I watched Gravity Falls with my sunburnt child who went to the lake today with her friend. She’s still at an age where she loves her Dad.
the dead emulate her
she’s long dead but I can still feel her whispers in my ear
Hell is nothing
some endings are bittersweet and that’s the best one could hope for
stay ruined
I have nothing to say but I’ll say it anyway
I’m really good at letting lifetimes go I’m really good at thumbing my nose at forever
a night where I should be silent
she’s not writing about you she’s just very good at being relatable
I would recognize those crazy eyes anywhere
the serenity of solace
I’m probably the best worst thing you’ll ever have
I’m not in love with anyone just so you know where we stand
I deleted that list with all of your personas trying to grow
seeking dysfunctional relationship with insane crazy sex
the anti-Christ just came home
you’re beautiful love
"“Is all of your beer this cold?” the old man at the end of the bar asks the bartender as he sips from his bottle of Coors light, his long white hair frame his eyeglasses. A myriad of sports events are glaring on a half dozen big screens, flickering distractions on the periphery"
"here’s a feel good tweet to print out, fold up and put into your pocket for good luck"
most of the time I like shit with my eyes
"today is the last day of your life that’s right, the last one for every tomorrow is a rebirth  and every yesterday is dead"
a good portion of the people here play act at being human
one of the components of love is to feel the need to avoid hurting the one you love if you don’t understand this not only do you not understand love  but are most likely incapable of it
stay weird
no more engagement no more will no more splendor suppressed
I deserve some of these destroyed evenings
it was a good run
seven months to irrelevancy  seven months until I warm my bones by the fire and recount my own fable
those wounds we conspired to make still cuts to this day
"you’ll find that many people are better off as strangers, especially the toxic ones you once knew"
when everything is a priority nothing is
I’ll take the best parts of those days anyday
“Poetry is what happens when nothing else can.”  ~Charles Bukowski
to understand is to love
a kind voice in the darkness a hand that reaches across the void
I have a Dad bod pic I’m pretty fucking impressed with
forever has always been right now anything else are the lies we tell ourselves
"you know, everything is going to workout"
drinking in a hole somewhere as far as you’re concerned
today fourteen thousand million years ago I was born along with light and time and you as well
don’t make me like a bunch of cat photos motherfuckers
my shit is always different expect nothing
I don’t want your nudes I want you
reveal yourself
"Mood? Shit, lifestyle!"
I want to be ugly in your eyes
the water is boiling in the electric kettle in the kitchen I set down my book open to the page I was reading three and a half scoops  of coffee from the dusty pink tin into the red French press the aroma smells terrific as boiling water fills up the carafe
It’s all make believe
"I make every effort to avoid political tweets during the US cold civil war, but goddamn it choose your country over party affiliation! Our enemies want us divided."
took the morning off motherfuckers
"I’ll follow you if I think you’re interesting, no follow back required"
you just know who the beautiful souls are and who you should avoid
In fact I prefer to be hated. Hate is a real emotion.
Who wants to be the putz everybody likes? There is dark shit lurking beneath the surface of those people.
It’s okay if you don’t like me it really is
you were my girl on the half shell
there is no ghost my bones were interred by the sea
"I would have totally gone for Joan Baez back in the day, maybe even now"
"be you, love"
"there are three people I would take a bullet for, there used to be many more   @HonchoMad to answer your question"
fly then little bird
people have been some of the worst experiences in this life but a small few have made up for all the terrible ones
don’t love me unconditionally have some self respect for christ’s sake
I’m aware of my presence but I don’t really feel it
Thank god Europe is waking up
if you are so inclined you can never have too many selfies love yourself and ignore the faux common sensibilities
"It’s 11:11, time for all good Republicans to be in bed"
the mundane often stare in silence  mouths agape
my church is a whiskey glass but it’s black
southern gothic swamp porn
you were my favorite dead end
between silence and Tweet storms  and when I have to get shit out
at some point the bed disappears leaving only the monster and the shadows
I only like cat photos
if you don’t hate something how can you love with any amount of intensity?
I used to know this cool Russian chick from Denver who blew my mind in music
I hate you  *everybody **including me
I didn’t forget to hate you today
the difference between the mediocrity of the twitter famous and genius is that genius is rewarded by silence while tweeting “spaghetti” gets hundreds of “likes” and “rt’s” it’s because most people are morons give me the small accounts every time
don’t mess with my cat or my cat photo likes
maybe you need the devil in you
"I may be a lot of things but at least I don’t subject you to commuting videos, not that there’s anything wrong with that"
I like you dig me up sometime
less writing more performance art
stalk me
Twitter is dead and so are we
I’m kind but I’m also an evil fuck  love my dichotomies
fuck the violence out of me
just look into my eyes motherfucker
this place is barren but I hold onto hope
we get enraptured in the moment but time and the reflection of its passing always reveal a reality of lesser grandeur and within the cracks of this perception lies the grotesque
Amsterdam
your black is blacker than black your rage is a fire eyes so deep they drown me but not as much as your crooked smile
we read someone for a long time and fall in love with the secrets their mind spills through their words
somebody tell me to quit fucking around tweeting in my car and go inside and workout
people who think for themselves are awesome!
smear me harder
getting blocked by random strangers means I’m doing something right  I always want to be where the crowds are not
“Two thirds of humanity are complete morons.”  ~Mrs. Pettibone
listen to my detractors  and run away never mind that they are cunts
can you actually love someone you’ve never met?
I’m insane at times but I’m solid I strive to be a good person that’s why they hate me
you are a stunning beauty but I like to think I have a sense about people  that’s why  *a subtweet of sorts
you can shout lies from the rooftops but eventually they all kneel to the truth
I don’t miss anybody. If you’re no longer in my life you’re either dead or not worth knowing. I don’t look back.
reliving the opening scene of Mad Max
the truth is everyone is insane but the best ones aren’t afraid to admit it
"writhing, lol!"
drunk tweets are much more difficult than you would think while writhing them stone cold sober
wasabi flavored almonds and coffee tastes a little like fish and a lot like ass
drunk in a five star villa on a golf course in Palm Springs whiling away the days by the pool is not much inspiration for good writing but by all means keep the cocktails coming ma’am
if your scotch glass isn’t heavy enough to kill a motherfucker in an emergency why are you even drinking scotch?
I just sort of love my little corner of Hell
you let the monster win but you didn’t realize it was me  all the while
we look to the stars above  to forget the bones below
I love you all
goodbyes are fires that require tending
if I love or have ever loved you you’re always on my mind
I never leave
trying to sober up for dinner  this is where I’m at
you’ll never know me that’s who I am
forget those dreams those memories  they were only mist on the river in the dale
lock yourself in shut me out
"you’re no more miserable than a baby crying, or a sunburn in paradise, or a hangover in some tropical hideaway"
you’re no more miserable than a sunset
I’m working on writing something beautiful but until then you must accept my grotesque
"It’s hard to have a soulmate when you have no soul, a slave is what I demand"
actually I don’t give a fuck   *a philosophy
I don’t think anything real or good comes out of suburbia so perhaps your vacuous wisdom is better peddled elsewhere
busy living the life I’ll write about later
I’m guarded I’m sorry I’ve been hurt
"I’m off work until Tuesday and heading to a luxury resort in Palm Springs (Titanium Platinum member) and I’m not writing a goddamned thing, maybe.  *flexing"
I did everything I said I would do and I would have kept my promises eventually
I’ve raised some decent human beings
we invent devils to avoid our shame while true angels are the ones who are able to forgive themselves
don’t ever stay on the ground until your under it
how can we make yesterday right?
your eyes are my only weakness
I don’t even break character when I break character

the truth is uncomfortable inconvenient and at times  completely devastating
sins of the past mended with blood and wine
unbroken
"in death nothing matters any longer, that’s its lesson for the living  *see Ozymandias"
the smell of burning plastic memories and forgotten photos
I just want to read something real tonight
I hope I was kind to you
the fact that it doesn’t flow is proof that is doesn’t work
of course others disagree...
I’m not the devil but I’ve stared him down on a few occasions.
I may be a lot of things but I’m a fiercely loving father.
I lost a great friend and his two children and I’m remembering him through the margarita recipe he turned me onto. Rest In Peace brother.
in the end masks don’t matter
shit gets real
death has a say
my life is in pieces all around me as I walk among the ashes remembering when those ashes were an oak tree with dark green leaves glistening in the sun
When I see a picture of you I always imagine what my hand looks like around your throat
I’m going to have to forgive some of you piece of shit motherfuckers at some point but right now I enjoy hating your sorry pinche asses
I think the world would be a slightly better place if I was alone
you deserve me
we’re done for the fifteenth time
her memories are worthless
Hell is my only muse now
many find love  few ever find understanding
I need to delete my drafts folder
I’m going to write the fuck out of you
I’m drawn to you like none other
I forgot to think about you today mostly
that girl was in over her head and she knew it
Yes I’m mocking you motherfucker(s)
"I know, I’m so strange at least I don’t write about how fucking lonely I am all the time or repeatedly hit you with tired sunflower/galaxy/rib cage metaphors"
I’ll take flight I’ll unfurl dark leathery wings and unleash the stench of black death and rot  upon you
and I always do
it’s all a game to me everything  and it’s only over when I win
the devil sold his soul to me
don’t cry for me don’t you dare
there is no home to return to I’ll always be the wandering traveller
I leave pieces of my mind here and there  and all over the Internet I’m difficult to find and I’m always around
mediocrity is a crowd
I tend to avoid the “popular accounts” mostly
I fell out of death not love
I’m trying not to be too hard on you mediocre motherfuckers
"I’m different, I know"
"if I’m writing about a cat sitting in the sunshine or an orgy, I want you to feel it"
comfortable is boring  and dreadful
"I want to finger bang you with my words, that’s how it should be done"
everything that feels good is mostly fake
punch me in the gut with your poetry or don’t even bother
don’t ever live long enough to become a villain  that number depends upon the person
"I’m a king in between dreams and awake, otherwise I’m a ghost"
you deserve only my silence
I fucked everything up
I’ve found my way
don’t tell me you are stalking me I’ll give you a show
"when someone says they’re nobody that just means they are somebody fucking amazing but are trying to get back to a place where they can be real again, it’s the true nobody’s that are offended by that sentiment"
where’s that quiet corner where people are scarce except for the good ones?
judge me with your own heart rather than the poisoned tongues of man hating harpies
From my Instagram
she took off with my book in the back seat of her car I’m tired of writing tonight tired of watching videos reading horrible news articles so that means I’m stuck with you (until my book comes back)
some of you are just capital
Philip Larkin
I’m not ignoring you it’s just our paths diverged into opposite ends of the forest they’ll cross once again I’m sure of it
there are no happy endings
opinions are worthless without power
my disdain for twitter grows by the day
with that being said I hope you’re well
I never dream of you but last night I dreamed that you died I’ve been living as though that was already true
I don’t put that much stock into people
be authentic
"make me feel something, anything, write about something real, a real fucking emotion, or describe something in detail, but skip the bullshit inspirational whatever the fuck that crap is..."
the world is full of dumbass homunculus people who breed more dumbass homunculus people who shout from the rooftops paeans to ignorance while the intelligent ones doubt themselves in silence
a modern day version of sewing the ground with salt
"iPad crashed, taking all the memories with it it’s for the best"
drown me in the noise
I keep telling myself she’s good for me that’s what I do
the wall beckons
quiet tonight with herbal tea
it was nothing personal just unresolved candor issues
repentless
inspire me
I think I craft drunk tweets just to amuse myself the next day
"don’t be sad, remember the memories but make new ones"
there are no dogs and cats in Heaven just saying
I write from the heart which is locked in an iron box on the seventeenth level of the abyss  guarded by a hundred succubi (some of them are cute though)
I lied ( go figure) darkness is beautiful
"some of you are so amazing but I can’t tell you because I don’t want you to think I’m hitting on you, I would never do that"
I like some of you souls...a lot
it doesn’t matter who kisses you to sleep at night it matters who you dream about
my “likes” are a minefield
most of you don’t even know where the edge even is
but I did save myself
I’m not your savior  remember? and now I’m not your anything
find someone who has your back and hold on with both hands
I’m this close to disappearing into the real world
the dead are asleep
I still have the plastic wrap I wrapped her in she has the hitachi
I will never @ you again go find attention elsewhere
I’ve been too careful the lovers I need don’t do careful
but will you love my violence
I might fuck around and stick to writing
one of many none of no one
beyond love beyond human
despise me
you get too close to people  you get careful art does not need careful it needs truth
if you’re comfortable with me I’m not doing my job
my resolve has not changed
I fell from grace once never again
"Just kidding, I never fuck anything up"
I always fuck it up at the last minute  and every minute in between
I am tired and difficult to love
I won’t let you quit
I like living up here in the mountains. I don’t even mind the bears. It’s the fucking vampires though...
Memento Mori In Silverlake (Los Angeles)
"I misspelled copyright, lmao"
"Just kidding, NOBODY in their right mind would steal my shit, lmao!"
"steal my fucking tweets, I don’t care technically they are copywrited and time stamped and you can’t imagine my satisfaction in seeing a thief claiming something they couldn’t possibly think up themself. With that being said, @thedevilswhisky is me."
darkness is never beautiful
words are wasted on Twitter
"there’s the way it is, the way things are, and neither gives a shit about what you want, or need, but sometimes life gives you a pleasant surprise...try not to fuck it up"
"This is why credulity is dangerous. Sacrificing goats, chickens...What? I’m sure that’s illegal in civilized places."
"I started a new Instagram account for putting some longer material down. It’s   if you’re interested. There’s stuff from “Midnight Somniloquy”, A Whisky, Darkly, and alt account Manufactured Minds as well as fresh stuff."
sober people are psychotic *Monday D.T.’s
the hibiscus tea I hold with cold hands is steaming red inside a cup with the words “California” inscribed on it another foggy evening where even the music seems to scrape it’s tired old bones across the hardwood floor a melancholic piano  doling out emptiness  between each note
The devil’s mescal more like...
all I ever wanted was you everything else feels grey
I’m not sorry for anything
The best moments in life always seem to be unplanned and can never be recreated.

We all pretend we are not god.
"I just don’t only write about how I would fuck you, sometimes I like to just fuck your mind."
What was so wrong with knowing the difference between good and evil in Christian mythology? Only a tyrant would want that and religion conditions humanity to accept tyranny since medieval times. Even Mark Twain said “god was un-American” in his book “Letters from the Earth.”
"That could be why so many buy into the nine to five, the worker vs owner mentality, and governments that undermine their self interests. Pathetic really."
People who want to be slaves worship gods who want them to be slaves.
"When anyone will do. That idea of love sounds more like a position being filled, one where the appliance of convenience supersedes the magic of falling, where the fear of loneliness is assuaged by an emotional tourniquet. That’s not fair for them. Demand more or be happy alone."
"I’ve never subscribed to the absolutism of the nine to five, I’ve always negotiated my own terms one way or another"
if living was easy we would never grow
and some loves are forever it seems. I imagine she compares every lover to her ex. I saw the love she had for Phillipe back in the day and friend zoned her immediately. She asked me why she and I never dated. I just shrugged and changed the subject.
It’s important to let go
"I once had a love interest who couldn’t get over her French ex boyfriend. I didn’t pursue her because I heard the way she talked about him. I saw her last week, found out they were married for a year. He has a family of his own but still I can hear the way she talks about him."
Jackass twitter  is the new zombie apocalypse
how dark shall we go?  how deep into the aphotic depths can you call home?
who the fuck are all these people inspiring all this fantastic poetry? They must be amazing.
if you don’t have enemies you’re not doing it right
"I have no nemesis but my enemies are losers  with not much going for them they live sad, pathetic lives and frankly I’m embarrassed to even call them my enemy  because I’m better than that"
sometimes I reflect  because like it or not  you made an impact as I imagine I have as well by the mere span of time invested and in the end I’ve come to the conclusion  that he needed you more than I did
I haven’t been mad in some time and sometimes I miss those days
A twitter storm is rising
writing is my counter to jackass twitter
the best of us go crazy the worst of us don’t have the capacity
people are not commodities  that’s the secret to a better world
the bones down here are made of the stars up there
"I came upon a horrific car crash last week. A mustang crashed into a boulder on a mountain road and consumed in flames. I rode slowly past on my motorcycle watching the helpless bystanders, hands on their foreheads, smoke in their eyes. The body consumed by fire. I felt nothing."
"I’ve given up on slow suicide I no longer want to slip into a languid death brought on by a melancholic hand that lifts the glass, tilts the bottle, mixing away loneliness and pouring regret with charon’s bony arm around my shoulders, a shot glass in his hand, grinning"
the dead speaks to me from half awake dreams when the sun turns long over the top of the tree tree line  pushed around by a Santa Ana  breeze
ours is a dead language the ink long since dry and faded scratched into dusty old tomes  and forgotten in the vault
TBT selfie. Don’t laugh. Let’s see yours.
"she’s my favorite nameless, faceless, muse"
my last shot at isolation
"of we don’t work out, you and me, no one else will either"
"I’m just going to just sit here with a drink, be exhausted and write what the fuck ever"
the immutable silence
I’m a highly trained consummate professional. I’m adept at compartmentalizing pain.
“I never dated. I find it a quaint notion though.” I replied
“I’m terrified that so many men are taking violent porn fantasies all wrong and not only objectify women but are violent towards them in an unhealthy way. Respect has been lost.” she said. “This has been my experience on the LA dating scene.
“Everyone seems to have this inflated sense of themselves in Los Angeles. Men are no longer polite. They won’t hold the door open for you and won’t share the sidewalk. It’s tough being a woman these days.”
"“The men you find there can be the worst. So many have a King complex and expect you to fawn over them,” she continued. “I told this guy I wasn’t interested. He sent me a long text telling me how I’m a loser, the most boring person etc. Later I saw him waiting breakfast tables.”"
"“I hate dating sites. They’re dehumanizing.” she told me, taking a sip of wine. “It’s not about people anymore, we are just the commodity. We swipe through as if we are buying something. A virtual love market. The people behind the profiles are usually so different in person.”"
throwing back a beer while the carne asada cooks on the grill it’s a cold dusk as the pines sway in the breeze
"“I think she wanted to have a foursome with you two that night,” he said while referring to his wife and  smiling at us, “that is until you started talking about fisting.” He laughed, looking at me, shaking his head.   “She was pissed.” I replied. “She stormed off to bed!”"
“You look good in green.” She said
a hangover  a dead battery on my motorcycle  knocked out all my plans this afternoon my friend took me to get it charged and I bought him and his kid lunch at Rockbird the late start meant I had to  white knuckle lane split all the way from Glendale Fuck I hate LA traffic
I go crazy all the time  it’s nothing
If we don’t have trust we have nothing and I don’t blame you
I feel her now her hand upon mine lips to lips  mouth to mouth lust to lust love to love  I didn’t recognize eternity  until she fell from this earth
I feel her
"I’ve let other soulmates drown into oblivion, why do you think you’re so special?"
I’m a metalhead at heart. Ever notice the headbangers always win Rock n’ Roll Jeopardy? It’s because they just love music.
"my unsolicited advice is don’t worry if you’re good enough for anybody, worry if you are good enough for yourself and fuck everybody else"
A motorcycle ride straight to Hell-lay.
"“I don’t have skeletons in my closet,” she said, “I have bodies.”"
"Millennials find the shit you wore out listening to back in the day like they discovered a new world, but it’s cool."

Goodnight Twitter
the obligatory next day self loathing after an evening with strong drink... and Twitter
*melting back into the shadows
I’m an ass love me anyway
I’m not that complicated just steer clear of me when I’m hungry or tired or just woke up or had too much whiskey or am working on something difficult or it’s Tuesday simple really
look at her you haven’t been seeing her but really look at her she’s been right there the entire time
it’s all love and butterflies now but the end game is to kill each other remember that
From the living room.
everything that fell out of place
nothing hurts
The bear came back when I was out of town. This looks like a different one.
did Easter last weekend because why the fuck not?
"in a hotel room she’s in the shower salt from the sea is thick in the air daylight has made its way I look around the empty beer bottles, wine glasses clothes mixed up on the chair some brown glass shards on the bathroom floor  swept away with a towel today I am the resurrection"
"wallet, keys, phone (x2) wallet, keys, phone (x2) waller, keys, phone (x2) Wallet, mugs, phine (x2( Wallet,  keys phone x2 wallet.  Keys phone x2 Walket  Key#  wallet, keys, phone (x2)"

I feel you dancing in my arms it feels like a lifetime
I couldn’t let you drown me babygirl I had to cut the cord I had to fly free
stay hidden
As it turned out...
"why yes, I am random"
another city by the sea  a room by the shore the clouds break and the sun becomes infinite across the water
how are those gods you created working out for you?
I’m a sociopath come love me
kind of bored with sins of the flesh  I want sins of your very being
There was a print of this in the hallway leading to my office in that secret place I used to work.
show me your decaying form that which death has not yet touched let me drink from your youth so that my death tastes sweeter
“I wanted to fuck you in the bathroom of that that coffee shop when we first met” she said.  “I bet you do that for every guy.” I thought.
damn!  some of you need to be here
he writes like me so I must be him
the restroom at the back of the bar is akin to the gates to heaven  ignore the urine smell and graffiti
I need some silence
one day I won’t cross your mind  that’s when it’s finally over
I have the best demons  perhaps that’s why I keep them around when no one else will stay
write me something beautiful
The Devil isn’t so scary the propaganda machine Demonizing him is though  all tyrants rule by fear and misinformation
remember when we talked about unconditional love? this is what it looks like
watching it slowly die is the hardest part  embers can burn a long time
"your heart will only break so much, love before it is replaced by wisdom then you will be invincible"
people who don’t know that they’ve got don’t deserve anything good in life
"I should have fought for her. I shouldn’t have burned the books of poetry I wrote for her. It wasn’t meant to be but I’m glad we loved. I didn’t see anyone romantically for three years until I met my beautiful wife in a roadside bar in Texas, but that is another story."
"We were together three and a half years. There were a few breaks here and there, but I always considered her my girl. The first time we broke up I was devastated. It was my fault. At some point one must choose their love above all. I treated her as an option because I was a fool."
"She was beautiful. She modeled, danced, she taught me about the fine arts. Our dates were plays and musicals, art shows, and fine dining. When I fell, I fell so completely in love with her. I was a better man with her. She elevated me. Who I am today comes from her love yesterday"
I took her out on a date. I no longer remember where we went. I drove an old beat up Datsun with the word “FUCK” scratched into the hood. She didn’t care. She came from wealth. Maybe she saw something in me beyond the asshole.I still see something in her after all this time.
"She pursued me. I was a reluctant lover. We lived in Oklahoma. You know about Oklahoma, right? She bought tickets for a dance show and I stood her up. She was crushed. I was a young imbecile like all young men are. “I’ll make it up to you.” I told her. I saw tears welling up."
She was tall and thin. A dancer. Her hair was long and luxurious. Her eyes were like amber jewels when the sun caught them in its light. Her voice was dulcet like Marilyn Monroe or Jessica Rabbit. Her colleagues called her ‘Black Barbie’. Political correctness was in its infancy.
"“You like being above others” she said, as I sat on the theater’s counter above her as we talked. “I suppose so.” I replied. Her name was Anita. Her parents immigrated from Ghana. She and her sister were actual princesses as their father was a tribal chieftain. I was a nobody."
The twins walked into the theater where I worked through double glass doors blinded by sunlight. Two beautiful Naomi Campbell look a-likes wearing shorts and tank tops sauntered through the lobby laughing. I will never forget my first great love. It was a long time ago.
A self imposed long weekend. Should I nap or write my Friday rant?
fuck you for making me happy
sitting and drinking tea with all those empty memories
The neighbor
I don’t want what’s good for me I want what stimulates me
the sort of love that puts me to bed when I’m exhausted and wakes me up with a knife at my throat
the edge has always been so close I’m going to miss it
In college my photography professor referred to me to other students as “The Mind”.  It got back to me. Unfortunately he passed away a year later but I liked that man. He reminded me of Richard Branson and always wore black
"If the nucleus of a simple hydrogen atom was the size of a peach its electron would be two or three miles away. The material world is made solely of this energy in the form of matter. Therefore there are no objects, only relationships. Tell me what’s real. Send nudes..."
"the sad part is you are all me and I am all of you but we dwell in an illusion of otherness, separated by feeble membranes of our own design we are merely thought and imagination bouncing against nothingness, pretending we’re not alone in our isolation  to and fro etc.."
drunken introspection but without the drink sober writing is my altered state
I need to take an eternal power nap between moments of awakening and enlightenment
mine is terrible
anyone want to fuck around and tweet their drafts folder?
it’s like the old saying “you can’t step into the same river twice” people are like that
I sleep because I’m dead
we always look back don’t we but those spirits will always be us  laughing at ourselves in that dusty old mirror in that dark old bar in that ancient city by the sea
my humor is so dry so very dry and wry
I’ll get back around to writing about hard fucking on hard beds  in the rain at sunset by candlelight  but first I need some better source material
"I’m not going to make sense for a while but that’s okay, nothing ever does anyway"
"what I’m saying is you get that one shot and make of it what you will but there are no second chances really, just the waiting to die of old wounds"
"you don’t understand this is the way time rolled the dice and the numbers are what they are human folly says we can change what is, what will be, and what will never come or be again"
be worth reading
I should write something anything but all I can do is listen to this morbidly sad fucking song and stare out of my car window waiting for the train to go by
when we end again I want to be alone for a while
the question is in doubt
the cat moves around the room jumping down from the sofa and then onto the coffee table I’m surprised she can move so well through the heaviness in the air
we might not get back up from this one
“You sounded annoyed with me.”  *the third  call from her during my workout   “Not at all. The last one was fucking people during my workouts. I’ll take the phone calls.”
I was being serious.
I’ve done all that shit. It’s not all it’s cracked up to be...
don’t vote for an official who never ate beans and cornbread or beans and rice for dinner or never had to deal with a utility shutoff notice
When I mean ‘my’ I mean ‘your devil’
My first and only political tweet: We get the government we deserve.
you’re all beautiful
"there’s a reason I drown my sober mind but I’ll enjoy this insane because, you know, calories"
the only magic she had was in the way she disappeared or did I do that?
"You know there aren’t really flowers under your skin and butterflies are born from a cocoon, not from soft kisses."
"Let me see, okay, your eyes became galaxies when I accidentally poked them with a sunflower. I’m clumsy. Oh, and sorry about what happened to your rib cage last night. There’s some universe where all that never happened."
something about an abyss or some shit
"Our breaths have been numbered since time began but it’s okay because time doesn’t really move, it’s stagnant. Its our minds that make it dance."
Black is the new black
all the bodies are buried in the “likes” folder
There are teetotalers and there are people who don’t drink.
I would become a teetotaler if I wasn’t afraid of becoming a teetotaler
there was only ash among the ruins only mist in the fields  but I remember it differently
those things that are destroyed are made new for that is the will of resilience
all sacred places are defined by the cycle of ruin and repair
my mistress is addiction and she’s a bittersweet siren
You wouldn’t want me any different
"rope, belts, silk, and satin, fingers inside of mouths, inside of cunts, inside of love, gripping hair, digging graves down my back, a firm grip around her throat, fucking hard, while the rain cascades down the window next to the bed, next to the writhing, floating, desperate, us"
trembling hands write that’s what they do
it’s a sad piano and pink flowers sort of day
there is beauty in letting go
why can’t I settle for exceptional?
"I’m not interested in your procreation rituals, love. I want to open up that pretty mind of yours with wet fingers and stir up those delicate thoughts that bend just for me. We can discuss what to do with those curves and thighs afterward."
the hive mind is what’s wrong with the world
"things are only weird until the herd/hive catches up, then it’s mainstream"
in a stark detox sort of mood going to drink the shit out of some tea!
hold onto your little piece of the universe as long as you can it will be gone in a flash but remain at the same time
I have more leisure time paid with blood
paths cross we walk together for a while then it diverges one way or another
all this talk of forever stop that silly shit
now is so much more important than yesterday or tomorrow
life can change so rapidly remember that when it seems stagnant
thriving in right where we belong
I will always choose to do the right thing even if it’s the wrong thing.
I’m only here for the meltdowns
I don’t know you and you don’t know me too bad
"Carl Sagan, “The Demon Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark” 1995"
The Texas legislature debated last week over giving the death penalty to women who get abortions. Seriously. In America.  Blessed be the fruit.
there are no more heroes and we fell short of legends
I will always be there tingling among your fingertips darting out of the corner of your eye
I’m not looking but I see you
lunchtime nudes obscenities pounded into poetry
sins of the flesh are no sins at all between consenting adults
taste of my heartbeat from fingertips that only taste of you
aroused  by life and by living each breath an orgasm in its own right  for that’s how it should be done
“She’s always loved you.” He told me recently. “She always has.”
"The last time I saw her was the night after the dinner party. She opened up about their marriage. “You smell delicious”, she whispered as she hugged me goodbye. “You smell like cake.”"
I’m not sure I’ve found closure in all of this. I chose not to tell him about her advances and decided our lifelong friendship was over because of her. I didn’t want to get involved in their problems. After her death he needed me. I am there for him and his five year old son.
I spoke with her husband after her funeral. “Days before she died she screamed from her hospital bed “WHO HAVE YOU BEEN FUCKING?!!”” he said. All of a sudden the memory of her trying to seduce me when I was drunk and passed out on their sofa seven month prior flashed. “I’m sorry”
“I caught him masturbating to porn on our wedding day in Ireland.” she said. “I hate him. I want a do-over.” tears welled up in her eyes. Seven months later she died.
someday I will feel again someday indeed
to sit on the veranda with a cup of hot chai and feel the cool breeze on your face and the warm spring sun on your forehead...
empty rooms  empty hearts  the darkness is no friend
she’s always the storm
let the stillness be your teacher
eventually the sea will take her like the wind already has
“you’re beautiful” I said to the silence
I don’t dream sometimes at all costs
if I could but escape circumstance
maybe I don’t deserve the you I thought you were  maybe I don’t deserve peace
I want a sweet love
Russia is the Florida of the world
notice that most assholes are either from Florida or Russia it’s the same place in my mind
the anti-Christ is angry again
never lies in the shadows of forever
I’m never alone I’m always alone
isolation is a universe
I’m an island
find someone else who will put up with your bullshit I’m not that man
I want something different
she’s a pale comparison of who you pretended to be
when she’s difficult...and when I am
the words I write while waiting for her
coffee with her  every morning
will we make it? who knows? perhaps the question is best left open  for certainty is the enemy complacency is defeat and contentment is the devil
she’s beautiful and loyal and looks like Monica Bellucci but she has a passion and temper that matches mine   *what war looks like
I’ll give you my heart  but let me pull the pin
a scorched earth love affair leaving nothing else to burn nothing else to lose control over  nothing else to dream about
I’m not going to work this morning because I don’t fucking want to. You’ll thank me later.
I hate the stink of humanity
I hate most people
demons are labels shortcuts to thinking for yourselves
Salem witch trials the Scarlett letter not so far removed from the social media social justice warriors of today
we love to demonize that which we don’t understand
there are narcissists selling self help books warning against narcissists and I find this delightfully ironic
narcissists are evil          *debatable narcissists fuck well           *settled science
she didn’t understand the infinite  she didn’t understand me
I imagine artists are the loneliest of people for very few can see the worlds they live in.
that moment in time will always anchor the best part of me
I’m just as easy to hate as I am to love but I’ll fuck you to the edge of the edge either way
I loved watching her mouth form the words ‘I hate you’.
"Pain can control the actions of so many, childhood atrocities left to fester in the shells of adults. I understand survival in this context but I wanted salvation and I was prepared to give the same. In the end desperation had it’s way."
I like cheap whiskey
I’ll write bullshit in between revelations
I need you desperate and willing to please
Fuck your comfortable poetry nestled among the flowers
“I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.” ~Charles Bukowski
my mind is inappropriate to minors and prudes

"Actually, all of you are weird. I’m normal. I just don’t like herds."
I’m a little weird
it’s no fun unless we risk everything
let’s get unhinged together
cheers to you missed another one
I ran into a homeless kid at the post office eating a sandwich  dejected and lost in America we do everything to make sure you are born but nothing to thrive  we toss you to the curb if you aren’t the right sort of person because our politicians need an animal class to demonize
nobody survives me not even me
"I never write about lost love because love is never lost, people are"
our love would be Armageddon  beautiful mushroom clouds brilliant light flashing piercing the blackness of death as we fall among the ashes sprinkling ruin with us
trees disappear in the night
I have a fucking problem and it’s that you aren’t in my arms and your hair isn’t in my grasp and that I don’t know your name or where you live  or anything about you but the color of your eyes and the smell of your soul but I am drawn to you nonetheless  nonetheless
if you search for heroes too long you’ll go blind the world is a spectrum of villains of varying degree
brutal are the daffodils blooming soft and yellow in the garden
at that level poetry becomes political they publish each other’s books   while true geniuses lie naked and drunk on their bed in a shitty apartment or in a tenement somewhere scraping their life from the floor and waiting until death to become famous  that’s literature
A Thousand Points of Light Hope and change Make America Great Again we are a stupid kind of people
"it’s okay, you don’t have to understand and I don’t have to write anything that’s understandable except for me I understand  and I love my shit"
"I just want it to be rock and roll but the rock gods are long dead, face down in a puddle of their own piss in some forgotten back alley even the stray cats avoiding their stink"
except for the fucking telephone that keeps ringing and ringing every half hour or so
came home from the gym poured myself a beer and ate half a chicken I don’t want to write a damned thing all I want to do is sleep

I never count the lost among my blessings nor do I remember them before the gods
"It’s  always too much for a Monday isn’t it?  We parse our expectations based on some authoritarian idea that art is only for the weekend, madness is for the wee hours of the lonely night. I for one live my life every day of the week, my heart beats 24 hours a day."

rummaging through the old books on the dusty bookshelf in my daughter’s room I was looking for that Bukowski book she “borrowed” while thinking to myself who wouldn’t love a daughter who steals her dad’s Bukowski
people die here but we seldom notice until someone else reminds us  of them and the loss is set in the stone  of our awareness
"I awoke from a late afternoon nap, half a beer stagnating on the ceramic tile table next to the leather sofa  I wondered where I was in my disoriented state, questioning an existence seen in a light robbed by the shroud of night pulled halfway over disoriented half mast eyelids"
they’re young and slim and dark with the tan of sunshine captured just under soft skin holding onto water beads as it drips and falls from supple breasts taut against cotton strings emerging from the azure sea dark hair whipping through the hot sky
the sun just drowned itself over the horizon of that California city the remnants of a dust grey sky lying dead in the air waiting to be snuffed out by the darkness held up involuntarily by the twinkling landscape struggling to be seen through the haze of human progress
I need to go fuck off somewhere else for a while.
Americans are such prudes.
"I once got kicked out of a DC bar for making out with the woman I was on a first date with. It was the only date actually. It was me, not her."

a disturbed sleep jolted me awake leaving me unprepared for the day no amount of coffee will help she called and said two deer were meandering by my truck the smell of breakfast I imagined still in the air the sun banishing clouds buds appearing on the snowball tree birdsong
“I hate you. Come fuck me.”
"“Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not. All sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain. The fear of death arises from the belief that in death, there is awareness.”Epicurus"

"“I think you are an evil, Machiavellian asshole...”  love me anyway"
the past becomes clear looming into focus in the present  as the future unfolds
I deserved better than that
as if there weren’t enough reasons to  inter your bones and seal your tomb
the lies keep revealing themselves
"It’s okay, the gene pool is bigger than Twitter"
I make my own realities
I said I would
Have a lovely weekend everybody!
"I remember that weird sad kid with the broken heart who made a career writing about that one love he lost. I hate to break it to you brother, but I lost a universe."
cults that overtake empires and the poetry that survives
"I’m waiting for the Middle East to wake up, they understand me somehow"
"everyone’s either asleep, dead, or both, but that’s okay, I’ll breathe for you"
"I was the crazy thing she did in her youth, nothing more. stop."
she was a silly girl trying to live before her time
love is a stew
we both feel amputated  for that’s how powerful love is
I was her tourniquet and she was mine and we held on for different reasons
"Artist uncertain, but beautiful"
I’m no good for you *everyone
beautiful
I might be over
On the precipice of never while entertaining forever
I will always be hungry
give me what is lusty and good
give me your words squeeze their nectar into my mouth paint them onto my chest and let’s taste them as the sun rises above the sea
pain doesn’t hurt
let go if you want the future to unfold as it should
love is a used bookstore  where things are passed on  when they are not forgotten
“are those a bag of bones in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?”
"drunken lines have no quarter here, no room for expostulation or reply unable to be rewritten or explained and are cursed with their original sloppy sentiment, noble as it might have been, and cast upon a misunderstanding audience"
the jails are full the madhouses are closed and there’s a gun for everyone
"I know, not very erotic, but I write what needs to be written"
"you told me not to consume myself, begged, pleaded, but that’s my lot, don’t you understand, the muse can’t be released unless debauchery calls her name, summons her in the name of the bacchanal, of lust and excess, the stench of the ripe morning nestled in the aroma of coffee"
I guess you just didn’t understand...
I found that I could not do and do forever that way
"I haven’t written anything in months that choked me up or made me bleed, or feel, or think...a poem or piece of prose needs this pain to fuel it lest it just lies there, useless, under the flickering neon lights wrapped in plastic, waiting for consuming hands."
let’s be nobody and go nowhere and just feel this moment and call it forever
I would hold you in Haarlem and kiss you in Bruges and fall asleep in your arms as we pass back through  Breda on the dry train carving itself through the countryside.
"This bookstore, not quite how I remembered it but all poems have certain lies to them."
we were in a hotel room by the sea a bureau lined with empty bottles an afternoon whiled away fucking and sleeping and fucking again the sun peering into our room like a god and god I love afternoons like that
who a woman fucks and who she loves tend to be very different people
"I remember that wet cobblestone street leading up to the black painted doors framing the glass of that old bookstore, the door was locked, the proprietor gone for the evening. I was full from the duck and wine I had from the French place in the alley under the cathedral’s shadow."
“keep his belly full and his balls empty”  an old adage about love and devotion but I saw it on Peaky Blinders
live your life as if none of the big questions are answered because not only are they not but anyone claiming they are are manipulating you
"writers here, when they realize they’re naked, often leave only to return behind a more guarded mask"
don’t disturb the resting place of old bones sprawled in the dust
otherwise perfect electronic transmissions
the distance is too suffocating
"You know, I’ve never like hashtags. I guess I just don’t care who reads my stuff or who follows me. In fact, I don’t give a fuck about much at all on here."
“Make me feel pretty” she whispered  “with your mouth”
"In the decade that I’ve lived in the Eyrie, on the edge of the world, I’ve seen two dozen bears, a giant snake, deer, coyotes and several Lynx. A bat and a bird have gotten inside (lots of drama there) and yesterday a chipmunk dodging the cat that I just now caught and set free."
and sometimes I do think of her when the sun is high in the sky and I’m feeling pensive and bored and need some self flagellation to stir me awake to do something else  to keep busy for she is nothing but a painful memory
she could only bend for me so much before she broke right in two
“I hate Bukowski” she said “and I hate you.” she thought  and this is how we ended in that cold afternoon
I don’t believe a thing you feel
loneliness has never been a problem for me and it always is
maybe one day when the earth is quiet I can hear your siren song calling through the still
"I have always been driven, my ambition defines me and no accomplishment has ever been good enough as I eyed the next big thing and that is my curse"
"I can’t wait to be done with this work, this life, I have many other lives yet to live, many more worlds to conquer"
in the end I’m a survivor and the world never completely broke me and it never will and tho’ I will one day sink into the inevitable nothingness I can say that I have truly lived
Your soul served with a nice Bourdoux on a plate of you.
I’m just going to remain enigmatic if  that’s all the same to you.
JC Cabral photography
wrong always feels right to me
I’m not sure we’re doing the right thing trying to do the right thing.
I don’t think we can ever truly embrace the nothingness we have become.
I follow all of the classic narcissists they write the best stuff
I need to work off some of the weekend’s hedonism
"we never measured up to eternity  but those moments, my god those moments if we could have just strung them all together to make our daisy chain"
love is great and all but would you hide a gun for me?
I am intimately familiar with your smile and can tell the difference between when it’s radiant and when it’s propped up.
"us, in real life"
make your own hope
My daughter fell asleep on my chest tonight. I listened to her quiet breathing as I felt her weight pressing against me and the weight of time passing since she was a baby. I stirred her from sleep and tucked her in bed like I used to do.
I may be the worst Twitter Crush ever but I’m a pretty damned good asshole. One of the best.
“The Cursed Woman” (1859) ~Francois Octave Tassaert

"a sojourn to the south a salty, sandy escape  where we walk together under the gas lamps  of that city by the sea"
If I am to be judged for anything let it be for the love I let go.
‘The Rime of the Ancient Mariner”-Gustave Dore
"My grandfather, he was an artist who painted landscapes."
It’s lonely at 2am but I like lonely at 2am.
a storm is rising  the fog surrounds the pitch the night is long and deep and there are no stars the wind groans through the trees  and all hope is lost  in this moment
Tell me what hurts you.
us is now them but you are still mine  and I am your ghost
"tortured, brooding, loving, waiting for your ghost again to appear in the fog"
I cherish the part of our world that didn’t die
she was a thousand tiny earthquakes sewn up in skin waiting for the right man  to unleash them
each button undone was a premonition of the explosions he would render
she exists and I write to assuage the nightmares and water the dreams
I want to commit suicide inside of you.
“I want you to unzip my last shred of decency.” she said  “With your teeth.”
our love didn’t die it shattered into a million stars and like diamonds others picked them up  and put them in their pocket
"control is an illusion, her degradation is by her permission, her will, her need, it’s what is required, and in that she is the one in control and he does her bidding"
There are too many casualties of love
"I have two beautiful daughters, the youngest of which I’m about to pick up from school on my motorcycle.   Coolest.  Kid.  In.  Class."
“The problem with dating is there are too many goodbyes. You get to know someone well and then things fall apart and you are left with experiencing  another loss in your life. It sucks.”
respect is an aphrodisiac
just remain after the storm
too many no more tomorrows
"I’m selling myself, but in reverse."
"Fall for me and find the love of your life. The love of your life is not me, it’s the man you run to after dealing with my shit."
I’m no saint.
I like crazy a little too much.
I don’t feel like being clever today. Today is a wash.
"Unsolicited nudes are fine by me but I don’t require them. Again, it’s more fun if I take them myself."
Someone should open a twitter account for all the unsolicited dick pics. A sort of hall of shame.
"pro tip:   many women don’t like unsolicited DM’s for the same reason many feel uncomfortable going to a bar alone. They don’t want to feel harassed or threatened, and for god’s sake don’t send an unsolicited dick pic to anyone. If a woman wants one she’ll take it herself."
everything we worked for gone in an instant
If you think you’re the only one they are talking to I have some bad news. There’s a line of others waiting to take your place. A few are up on deck. Do you really think you are that special? They’ll make you think so. That’s how they have power over you. Keep your composure.
the darkness cannot be removed without killing me
Ground zero + three hours
"Watching her abuse cycle, but from a distance."
How long is it after a breakup when an ex is downgraded to just another stranger?
You can’t reach me anymore.
I’m not your ex
The eyrie is cold tonight the sky is clear the city lights below are crisp there is a pall of resolve in the air  as our fissures deepen
Your Twitter Crush is fucking their real life partner right now. Sleep tight.
"She’s working twelve guys right now, they each think they’re the one she’s writing about."
I deleted that list you were on. It was called “The Devil”.
I see your manipulation and raise you a mute.
I don’t try.
She had that “you’ll never live it down” look in her eye.
"I’m an asshole, but I’m an honorable asshole."
"I think we are near the end of our ending, the rest is mere formality."
I realize I’m the type of man you just can’t stay mad at.
Some people are just drawn to each other. I was in a tightly packed crowd in Amsterdam and a woman made eye contact with me. It was a look of recognition from both of us. She looked somewhat like Jennifer Garner. We talked for a while. It was like old friends meeting again.
"“My god look at his hands, they could just ruin me, look at the way he holds his cup, delicate, firm, contemplative. I need his fingers inside me, deep, wet, filling me up, driving me...”  “What are you thinking about?” he asked, while taking a sip.   “Oh, it’s nothing” she said"
my hands smell like gasoline
everyone wants that ‘desperate for each other’ lover  otherwise sex is like doing the dishes
I’m women just want to use you years old
so I’m fucked up I have kind eyes
let me pour the horror into you
the explosions never go away they just transform into beautiful thighs
I write in bursts  like a machine gun
for the first time I see my fate isolated in the dark
hell is inside my mind
I hate you for what I did to you
there’s no going back ever
I need a lover who understands me but first I need to be alone
I ruined you so that I would be immortal inside your dreams
I can’t slow down enough for you but when I say you’re enough then your fucking enough no matter what’s you think your gut tells you
another storm  raging against the walls there will always be gardens inside the keep
It turns out the Rubicon can’t be uncrossed.
I’m not for you
another ending again
I’m staying right here this is now my main account I’ll still monitor the others but this one is where I’ll be
the human species in general
getting bored/disgusted with Twitter again...
try to be decent people that’s a worthy goal
Zdzislaw-Beksinski Poland
there’s no reason for loneliness in the world
humans an ugly species  on the inside and out vicious they have perfected the art of war love?  not so much
let me be your death knell
place my words between your legs and let them taste your poetry
Your silence is deafening.
"One of the best, most stand up people I know, from here and in real life.  @HonchoMad"
we weren’t supposed to fall in love you were supposed to be my fuck doll and you were just supposed to bite your lip
Now you know you did the sorts of things that would drive a man away forever. Own your shit.
I never fuck lust up.
I fuck love up all the time.
She’ll never see this. She has me blocked and I don’t blame her.
"I try not to hurt others, but I have."
I’m sorry I let you go so soon. I admit I was wrong. I was just standing in a minefield of circumstance and just left a relationship and you were too fragile for me to make a mistake and hurt you further. I valued you too much for that.
I don’t have to be careful with what I write and I never am.
I’ve found the path to love myself  you can stop now
"I rarely “like” the selfies you post, but I love them. I swirl them around in my mind and taste every smile line, every contour of your face, and every sparkle in your eye."
left on the edge and frustrated in the dark
mi vida loca
"There was a menagerie of women in erotic dresses and masquerade masks, men in tuxedos, masks, there were trapeze artists, fire breathers, and a naked woman on display as a whipped cream fruit platter. People were fucking in the shadows, women publicly riding the Sybian in ecstasy"
write the tweet people are afraid to like or retweet and then go for the ones who aren’t
"For hours she’d been tied to the bed and blindfolded while he went about his day. He would come into the room only to adjust the ropes and her body. Sometimes he would fuck her or gorge on her pussy, but she wasn’t allowed to orgasm, she was only allowed to flirt on the edge."
I love to watch you touch yourself I love the way you spin exquisite ecstasy with your fingers
the kind of words that wander down between your thighs and dance with your fingers
that way she kisses my eyelids awake
I miss her dark her olive warmth and amber eyes
running my fingers through her hair releasing butterflies from her skin
she’s a dirty girl wrapped in eloquence and refined tastes
the most beautiful thing about her is the way she looks deeply into my eyes and sees the worlds I try to hide
she’s the kind of girl who frolics barefoot in the grass with flowers in her hair and a sundress kissing her thighs
"I tasted the fragrance of spring on her neck butterflies and warm honey, wildflowers swaying in the cool mountain breeze"
show me your honey
all of you should feel pretty
I have this brilliant idea of turning this account into a cat video site.
My philosophy in a nutshell.
"you have to make it through the grotesque, the raw, the base, before you can find the gardens in my words"
she has sad beautiful eyes dark pools of amber reflecting the blue of a morning sky  her face obscured in my imagination
there would be no art without heartache
"endings are just as beautiful as beginnings, you just have to look at them with better eyes"
including me
be good enough for yourself and fuck everybody else
the next time I plan to see you is when you place tulips on my grave
I threw two notebooks of poetry into the trash can when I met you lines for a love that is no more lines that I wish I had kept
I’m old enough to know  lost love fades to nothing in time the once love of my life never enters my thoughts and that will happen with us as well
she woke up tender in my arms there’s love in the coffee I bring her from the press
remember my cruelty sensual and terrifying  and the way it transformed you into who you are today
remember me by the part of you I didn’t touch
the ache and the strain and the things you need
we both have to sleep in the wet spot  it’s the entire bed
I’m not here to save you princess I’m here to bind you in the dark and transform you into something  beautiful
If I stare into the abyss too long the abyss becomes you
her mouth is the ocean and I’m lost at sea
her body could have been a statue sculpted in Carrara marble and placed in a temple  that faces the setting sun  above an azure sea
"“I would do anything for you.” she whispered, her fingers playing on my chest. I slid my fingers into her hair, caressing the side of her face. I kissed her softly, taking her bottom lip between my teeth and pulling lightly as I backed away. I looked into her eyes. “We’ll see”"
commitment intimacy passion if you lose one you’ve lost them all
"I’ve been getting a lot of DM’s requesting I write dark erotica again. They must remember my old Whiskey account when I was writing like that in 2014-15. Well, here you go. I’m looking forward to it."
both of us know how this will end
orgasms so hard she joined a convent
"“Good morning love” I whispered, kissing her neck, the softness beneath her ear. I traced the lines of her throat, a rough hand exploring slowly down her body, aroused nipples, belly, pelvis, the warmth of her panties flooding. Moving them to the side, hardened, I entered her ass"
Johnny Walker Red label-not bad. Black label is always best.
I’m too proud I set firm boundaries and I’m not afraid to walk away when they are crossed
Are we falling apart for real this time? Can we part with a clear conscience now?
I’m never afraid to admit fault  but at some point if you don’t forgive me I will need to move on life is too short to argue all the time
the way it all crumbles with the slightest breeze I did that I’m to blame
our pages have turned brown and our love smells like an old book
"She was wrapped like a mummy in green plastic wrap except for her mouth. Tiny holes were cut out for her nipples, two clothes pins pinched them painfully. She moaned like a wounded animal as the hitachi, taped to her, was destroying her soaked cunt. He got up and made a drink."
"We spent the afternoon fucking on a hard bed, rain beating down on the skylight above. I gripped a fistful of her long black hair. I was hungry. She was soft and giving. Her dark olive skin warm against the pale of mine.  She took me in. She nursed my wounds with a healing mouth."
remember me with wine and candlelight and music turned low filling the darkness seeking the empty spaces fingers slick with need  a memory of sunlight bleeding through an afternoon  crisp white sheets  destroyed and stained with ruin
From my self published book Midnight Somniloquy
So many plans. So little time.  The world isn’t going to conquer itself.
The drunk version of me wrote some good shit last night that I don’t remember writing. What was in those drinks?
get the toxic people out of your life do it now
there’s not a person living who can make you happy but there are many with whom you can find happiness together for it’s a journey not a destination
for those of you waiting for the next life I’m afraid this is the only one you get and it’s not a dress rehearsal
I’m every anti hero you’ve wanted to fuck
I sleep as I breathe you in always  and forever
It’s late It’s early I must sleep I must die
I’m a nuclear firestorm and a nuclear winter contained within the same skull
I don’t want to be your favorite person anymore
I will always ruin everything
I’m such a motherfucker
Too much has happened to be reasonable people
I tried to make it right  I tried to be honorable
we may be done
"I’m comfortable in bars and art museums, poetry readings, sidewalk cafes in Paris, or art house movies in LA, or exploring gardens on mansion grounds in Pasadena or hiking the Swiss Alps, or hunting food in the Rockies or fucking you just beyond the edge of your soft limits."
I’m going to go hunting with a friend of mine in Canada or Colorado. I would rather eat an Elk I shot over the processed steer that was slaughtered in captivity.
If it doesn’t work out between us I will move on or be alone but I will never seek her out. She’s married now by the way.
You go to bed early these days. Is it to escape the droll life you’ve made for yourself or is it something else?
I’ve never hated anyone more than I hate you.
"we agree, we have about a 20% chance of making it. There are contingency plans but until then I’m all in"
"“yeah, no, fuck you”"
I never gave a fuck about you. I knew you were a treacherous bitch from the beginning. All of my suspicions were proven in time. My biggest concern on the cusp of our break up was how I was going to get rid of you. You did me a favor by leaving and for that I thank you.
"I consider 2018 to be the best year of my life, hands down."
I consider 2017 to be one of the worst years of my life but with sporadic high points when I came to visit her or she came out to visit me. We weren’t together but with her I reconsidered who I would want to be by my side on my deathbed.
I worked the wall today
It may be that I need you to sacrifice yourself on the alter of my choosing  It may be that you are the alter I seek to sacrifice myself upon
don’t let me down
I held the gates of darkness closed today though it took all I had and now I am feeling depleted
I even scare myself
I’ve done it too many times
I sleep like a baby  *flexing
while most dream of not being alone I dream the opposite
there is no such thing as a final discard there is just disengagement in that lies your hope or your nightmare
"I mean fuck, I’m a self aware dark triad and I still strive to be a good person. I just don’t feel a goddamned thing but I go to great pains to keep myself in check these days."
I often wondered how much of their behavior was the disorder and how much of it was them using the disorder as an excuse for being a horrible person.
and sometimes I do come back and stay for good
I always leave and sometimes I never come back
"You can tell much about a person in the way they handle rejection. I’ve read my share of angry manifestos, some of which had brilliant insults. I find it sexy and a show of class when she bows out with grace. In fact that makes me want her more. The others were dodged bullets."
I just like the way you say it
half of you make no fucking sense
The Hand Maid’s Tale- ground zero.
"Branson, Missouri is the Las Vegas for Pentacostals. Good clean Christian fun."
my life is a hundred miles an hour  but I would trade that for chickens on a farm or a sidewalk café with nowhere to be
I wish you well
my bored wants to meet your loneliness  my hand your throat
fucking you was my creative outlet now I write
She’s thinking about rings I am thinking about the highway she is such a good woman it would be hard to ramble this time
Our love wasn’t meant to be forever it was meant to be what we needed it to be in the time and place we needed it to be in
I don’t even remember half the shit I write and hardly ever look back
you own every goddamn
the grave you buried me in is gone love it’s overgrown with weeds and the churchyard is long forgotten
we don’t love in the normal sense we obsess
Hell is for hipsters they fuck everything up by making it great
"drinking a Belgian quad and devouring a Devil’s bacon (thick bacon drizzled with a spicy maple glaze) wrapped duck hot dog with roasted tomatoes, aoli and German style coleslaw. You can’t find that in heaven, too decadent."
It’s better if you believe and still do that for me.
her love makes me want to be human again
feigning morality
"I’m just going to say it, I would never be interested in a married woman"
sometimes I entertain flights of fancy but then I remember the lessons of my classical education and the story of Icarus
the thing about failed relationships is they failed for a reason and those are the same reasons to not ever go back
if I’ve left you there is no chance I don’t drink from the same river or pay for the same boatman twice unless you are her
we could talk about nothing under the timelessness of the stars as the sea crashes on the rocks below us
I want your mind first your body eventually
send me nudes of your naked soul
I am the silence  when you are a desert
"“there is so much violence in your words”   *Sandy, and how I miss her"
I’ve grown too fond of war to ever love you less violently
use the knife stop me from loving you
you are the perfect amount
I’ve got nothing the blank page is a desert
she loves me I’ll probably live a long life of loving her
some dreams die some dreams never should have been
If I’m not careful I will fall for you (I’m never careful)
I don’t know what the future looks like for once and that’s fucking awesome!
"I’ve made some mistakes, like we all do, but I’ve done everything right in the end and everything is where it belongs."
I sure do talk about love a lot for someone who is incapable of it
I really hate poetic Instagram
love is a spectrum
and I struggle
"The day you become self aware is the day you realize that you’ve always been different, a monster even, and that you can love someone with your mind rather than your long dead heart and are still capable of great acts of kindness and compassion, even if you don’t feel it."
the forest is quiet this morning save for sporadic birdsong  I’m going to just linger a moment on the precipice of the world with a cup of coffee in my hand and the cares of the day tabled for now
"honestly, I do miss that one personality you had, she was quite charming."
"Don’t worry, I won’t DM you  *anybody"
I pretend I’m okay I’m very good at it
I’m sitting right next to you  can you even feel the worlds dying inside of me?
she inspires the darkest shades of hell
I convince myself that you are only a ghost a shadow dancing in a torn white dress a shade tiptoeing across the moors imagined through my window by the table with an empty bottle and a broken whiskey glass you are merely a spectre  darkening my door like I used to darken yours
you might as well be Lilith
you might as well be Juliet
and while we waste time wishing things were different  we are dying might as well forget accept what is and start living in the now
she was the one woman who left me for dead in the dirt in Mexico
I should stick with the myriad ways I want to fuck you up
there’s one woman at least who will never be a threat to us
she’s my favorite never again
That statement would have gotten me a death sentence 400 years ago in the West...and still in certain parts of the world. That’s how fragile your god is. He needs to hide behind the violence of cretins.
god is all powerful and controls everything  *taking a look around the world we live in
I could easily breach the briars you laid around your happily ever after but I find they are aestheticly appealing and go well with your rose gardens
if nothing was everything then everything is you
Anyone who disagrees is too drunk right now to offer a rebuttal. I win.
Having Saint Patrick’s Day fall on a Sunday is proof there is no god.
It certainly didn’t feel like love.
I build a certain following and then shit all over their expectations. This is me.
my eyes are death knells
I’m so cautious of who I let in and who I let share my life I am also perfectly fine alone
some little dark corner of my mind hammered out and displayed  this may be as close as you’ll ever get
despite the dark shit I write (of which I’m fond of writing) I’m essentially self actualized and happy  and life is good with so many plans for the future and a robust enjoyment of the present.
"In my case, sailing into that sunset...with a drink in hand"
once you ride off into that sunset that sunset owns you
oh shimmering sea
"NPD and BPD sufferers, the king and queen of cluster B personality disorders, tend to gravitate toward each other. BPD sufferers can also have narcissistic traits and many suffer from NPD as well. Their relationships are bloody battlefields as each struggles to get the upper hand"
"A narcissist is no match for someone with Borderline Personality Disorder. No matter how intelligent the narc is, the borderline will run circles around them. They are truly masters of manipulation. Borderlines will upend a narcs world and make them shadows of their former self."
"Their victim cadre tends to come from empaths and sufferers of codependency. Female narcissists seek the white knight types who want to save everybody. The white knights are themselves codependent. Male narcissists seek out the caregivers. Again, codependent."
Once you are ensnared by one of them you will not easily forget them. The trauma bond is complete. They will be present in your every waking thought for years afterward. You’ll be susceptible to their “hoover” or them trying to get you back. Don’t. It will be worse the next time.
"Finally you are discarded. They blame you for everything. They drive you into desperation then criticize you for being desperate. It’s not about you though, it’s about what HG Tudor calls “fuel”. You are just an appliance for the narcissist. Anybody will do. You are replaceable."
"If you find yourself in a relationship with a narcissist you’ve likely experience their love bombing. They pour affection freely onto you. They write beautiful things, the sex is tremendous and then it’s gone. You spend what dignity remains trying to recapture what they took away"
love will enslave you
My favorite narcissists are the ones who add tons of people on Twitter or Instagram only to unfollow them all later. This gives the appearance that they are in demand. Some of my favorite writers and artists have done that. Notice how unhappy they seem to be all the time.
But there are so many ways to lie.
Then there is the covert narcissist. They are chameleons. They try to pass as empathetic people. That’s how they ensnare their victims. Deception is more prevalent with these while the greater narcissists will tell you the absolute truth and let you find your own way to hell.
"Basically every writer here. The greater narcissists are much more difficult to spot. They are self aware, highly intelligent, successful, and pass for human. Although they do not feel empathy, they mimic it quite well. They tend to be great lovers, a tool they employ to ensnare."
"You can easily spot a lesser or midrange narcissist on Twitter by the dearth of retweets on their TL, large disparities between those they follow and the ones that follow them, rants for attention, portraying themselves as victims of tragedy or wrongdoing, and egocentric media."
we are wise in what we have lost
I’m a king in many ways yet the memory of her love makes me the pauper
she is love I am war and we are the same
"I’m so painfully,  secretly in love with you the devil miles between us saves us"
there’s nobody I would rather love than you
I meant your heart
you make it difficult to be a cold hearted bastard
Ink my pain onto my sleeve
give my fingertips a place to roam
entice me enthrall me
I miss your filth
stain me again
I should have just wallowed in obscurity
I don’t get political here but I don’t see compassion for other humans and speaking out against an atrocity as political. I see it as the right thing to do.
it’s time to let me go and move on don’t you think?
"Myrna, you’re hurting my damned feelings!"
my counter to emo twitter is fucking you senseless  then fucking you some more
my fingertips have destroyed worlds
she’s still in love with my diabolical nature
drain me into the void and I’ll fuck you into the abyss
let me kiss the scars from my own hand
watching myself fuck you in the mirror might be the key to my heart
insatiable desire and our attempts to quell them is what living is all about
the sun is like a god beaming through the blinds plastered against the wall next to you in my grip
let’s fuck into an alternate universe  realizing new realities with fingers mouths and tongues
spill your love all over me
let me devour your emptiness
"I have one piece of advice for those in the throes of a trauma bond.  Get out, stay out!"
the thing is  I know exactly what I’m doing I’m usually the most intelligent person in the room and three moves ahead
"fuck you for making me think you are her, she’s been dead for a long time"
but more importantly you’re not good for me and I think with my brain
you know I’m not good for you perhaps not in your heart but you should stop with the emotional thinking
truth was our highest casualty not love
“This above all: to thine own self be true.”  ~William Shakespeare                                         Hamlet
I think I’ll fuck around and take the rest of the week off work
you don’t have to love me it’s best if you don’t
where do you hurt?
you don’t love me you just need to feed and I taste so good an easy morsel
curled up on the sofa covered by a blue blanket a book by Paulo Coelho some music the lights of the city twinkle far below the windows of the eyrie I turn the page take a sip of gin and soda and wonder where the cat is
I had to give up on one or the other it might as well have been you
I’ve never changed  nor will I
she betrayed me from the beginning but the truth always comes out  the tragedy lies with wasted love and squandered time
what can I do to set you free?
I still wonder about her sometimes and remember her that day when it’s raining
tattoo the darkness onto my sleeve
I hate that you know who I am
she was young beautiful and studying music she had a dozen scars from small cuts all over her body signs of torture signs of self harm “I like certain American men” she said “Something about you entices me.” she continued as her fingers danced on my chest and through my hair
we met at a sidewalk café in the rain  her long black hair poured over olive shoulders the way she looked at me with her exotic almond eyes enticing Persian jewels as her delicate fingers lifted the porcelain cup to soft lips I traced her scars after we fucked away the afternoon
love will make you write some cold blooded shit
there is no sin there are just lovers laughing against the odds
It’s all I can do to silence your memory
Have you thought about perhaps it’s less about love and more about what I can do for you.
"So you love me now? What do you know of love? The affronts against me have not been reconciled. I don’t want your love. I don’t want to be an actor in your dreams, a shadow who once loved you. Give me your love from beyond the grave, after I’m gone, but never again in this world."
Emily Bronte
remember me when the villainous music plays
I need you hungry
some things are better left alone the dead painful memories lost love
the door is shut the vault is sealed
I’ll always love the one who has my back
It’s the impossible that we love too much It’s the impossible that haunts us
off to war
artists see other worlds within the one everyone else sees
do nothing the universe is where it’s supposed to be and so are you
"I’m going to make this a cat video account, wear cuffed kakis, no socks with my brown loafer suede things and troll creative accounts who write shit that I couldn’t possibly think up myself.  *sarcasm, come on in"
This trope is a tough sell.
I’m not good enough either but the difference is I don’t give a fuck I never do
you’re not good enough you’ll never be as long as you care
It’s amazing how we can get so lost in one person and time steps in and makes them nothing
It’s all poetic and shit but those scabs have healed and I’ve found a different sunrise for my sky
We drifted off the window was open it was hot a woman was fighting with her boyfriend in Le Marais what did he do? I wondered she sounded beautiful in angry French  and I’m sure he is a fool just like me
don’t leave me for real life let’s be in Paris let’s fuck all afternoon and let the warm breeze ruffle our curtains  as we drift between fucking  and in and out of sleep
some of you are great writers but I hate your fucking guts
I would overthrow heaven for you
now everything is dead grey and rotting in the field
you were wildflowers blooming on my tongue butterflies born from my skin I kissed roses between your thighs and my fingers harvested nectar from all of you and everywhere
I had a dream I was eating your pussy and it tasted sour  like a Granny Smith apple  the apple of sodom
a myriad of drooling fools the stink of desperation thick in their words the finest heavily filtered cockpicks  just for you go for the ones shot in ektachrome  or black and white  or in Juno
I don’t want to be your everything I want to be your nothing and never again
blood in blood out I don’t remember you blooding out
Huge bottle of bourbon Huge bottle of gin Huge bottle of Vodka and a grin  *Costco walk of shame
I’ll leave you now to your domestic cage gilded with ennui abandon subdued
I always love the craziest women
Hell is weeks of fog and rain with a badass motorcycle parked in the garage
I imagine you running in a long white dress flowing through the trees in a fog like this with your hand gripping the gathered folds your hair damp in the mist whether you are running toward or away from me is where the devil can be found in the details he wins either way
that moment in the morning where all is quiet except for lonely rain drops falling from pregnant branches onto the deck  or rattling inside the chimney  and the ringing in my ears
the forest is still now the morning quiet after the storm the fog weaves itself  between the skeletal fingers of dead dormant trees between melancholy and indifference
it’s deadly quiet
"“Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”  ~Epicurus"
"In Christian mythology the right hand of god is the Arch Angel Abbadon, Angel of Death, King of the Locusts. He’s tasked with God’s dirty work, helped with the creation of humanity. Some accounts paint him to be worse than Satan in his cruelty. Poster boy for the Problem of Evil."
water me down
"I’m not looking for love, love It’s the reckoning I’m after and I see the road to perdition in your eyes"
Never ever let them see you implode and turn into a thousand bats.
there’s nobody out there
Just a few drunk tweets before I finish that art film.
"Yeah, you’re right. The music hurts."
"I bore easily, I’m often in my head, my communication sucks, I have a passionate temper, I drink too much, take too many chances, I drive too fast, too aggressive, I really don’t like people, I question authority, I tend to be arrogant, I’m a part time asshole most of the time"
All is quiet now  All is where its supposed to be
we are nothing more than the Black Eyed Susans swaying in the breeze among the debris of the crash scene
I’ve done a little introspection and have come up with the conclusion that I’m fucking weird. I mean look at this TL and the shit I write about.
you’ll always come back to those dark places where your name was etched in stone no matter how much light you absorb your dark heart is impenetrable
I always return to the hearth of the nurturing woman Whose heart is strong
you can still hear the violent roar of waves crashing against the rocks from those green pastures when the night is still and the moon is full
It was more a comment about how ridiculous the puritanical US drinking laws are. Theocracy is coming if not already here.
The US should raise the military age to 21. If an 18 year old isn’t responsible enough to drink they surely aren’t responsible enough to carry an M16.
my god this devil rain
keep haunting me in my madness you might even convince me that you are real
if you make it out of this life unscathed you’ve hardly lived
Twitter  for doodling minds  but my god those doodling minds
nobody is okay really especially the intelligent ones who recognize their ephemeral nature
don’t let the past  taint your music
are we really stronger at the broken places
the egg a symbol of fertility of life of creation and the soul of the philosopher things both bound and infinite  signifying the cosmos and creative spirit  and the mysteries it’s the sun god the white goddess  the well from which the universe sprang  and I just ate two of them
she writes about someone she doesn’t even know anymore  a shadow trapped in time a ghost with no home
when I love I love in timeless waves
forgive those who sojourned with you in love  they are different people now  they are strangers once again but first forgive yourself
some monsters come wrapped  in pale skin with eyes that will haunt your dreams
‘what could have been’ that age old question sprung from love lost I saw nothing from the pale light  of a trembling lantern but the fog the darkness dead roses an early grave
this may be our last chance
I sometimes  see her apparition in the snow rising with the mist haunting dancing  tantalizing  tormenting  evaporating  into thin air like she always does
you think I pursue love? No. I walk through its gardens  plucking what I please
I don’t fear much but I’m most afraid of finding you again
It took me time to realize I own your brokenness and if I could piece you back together  I would  so you could fly  and I could find redemption
I never heal I just scar over like I always do
my pride ended her
tattoo my soul onto my sleeve
love loses  freedom wins but at what price
I’m the person I want to be I would trade with no other
“Some people are so stuck on who I was that who I am never had a chance” ~Samantha King Holmes  -for you
someone else gave you forever I gave you experience
be a little loose with your definitions and spill your mind sometimes  but always keep something back
faith looks like lilith  at a casual glance
it’s dark out and I’m left with my own reflection in the tall glass
when are we just going to love each other?
“The Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones” ~Gustave Doré
looking forward to silence
walked among the hills above the village where wildflowers hesitate to bloom
*ran into her ex and his woman
I would know you anywhere
our definitions of love are incongruent
people who don’t deserve you always settle for less because they never deserved to fly so close to the sun
this dance we do
let me be your only demon
I dream of freedom and she is a dream unto herself
“Don’t be shy” coming from a man with money and power is the creepiest thing ever
I’ve had to kill love and scrape the remnants  my from heart
I only exist with you defined by your love
the answer is no to all of it
in fact leaving you was the hardest thing I’ve ever done second only to staying away and forgetting
It wasn’t that it was easy to leave you made it impossible to stay
you can never find the truth but the pursuit of it is noble and an end unto itself
I write about dead things and dead places
I worship a different version of what she is now
I’m the worst we both know that
I don’t hate anybody
I will always hate you more than I even loved you and I loved you more than anything you did that you created that song
you would rip your soul apart if you broke away now
our love story was beautiful we just wrote different endings
I’ve been hard you deserved it
I’m cursed just like you I just have a better mask
at what point could we have died together love?
I need something beautiful today
you can stop dreaming now
those lines in the sand that had to be drawn are drizzled in blood and dead flower petals
I know more about war than I do about love  But I’ve never been defeated in battle
she had dreams my dream was to realize hers and for that to happen I had to let her go
I write the way I love across time and distance
when I’m holding you nothing else in the universe matters
she kept stabbing and stabbing until love’s corpse  became unrecognizable
so many doors we allowed to close behind us until we found ourselves on opposite sides of the maze
I’ll always be with you in some manifestation or other
life will break you if you let it but even if you don’t death always wins
every word you breathe is painful to me
don’t live for me or anyone else
the fog the storm the wind  the dark the eyrie
“Amour” photo by Annemarieke van Drimmelen
I was all in for you you were everywhere else for me
I’ll be old soon but I’ll fuck you to eternity
give up your sunrises for me let me own the sunsets
I will make darkness beautiful just for you
I try to strangle your light but my darkness has no power
you are in my bones the very air I breathe
I’m so in love with many of you
I brought her fire
I wear this grotesque mask so I know who is unafraid of my darkness
don’t you see? I wasn’t the darkness I was a hand lifting you into the light
a brilliant light destroys everything
believe me when I say I don’t know whether she is alive or dead
believe me when I say I’m better off without her
believe me when I say I never loved her
believe me when I say I hate her
my namesake is the prince of lies believe me when I say I don’t miss her
"Perfect! Don’t give away all my secrets love, this messianic complex was hard won."
most of the monsters in my life have been beautiful
the past is irrelevant
I find a certain peace knowing that you found happiness despite everything
I’ve made better memories since you
you gave up remember I had eternity in my pocket
thrive to the point where looking back feels like slumming
I’m not haunting your dreams the me there is you wearing a mask of my face
I won’t hurt you anymore let us pretend we never existed
accept the life you chose accept what you’ve given up accept the loss  appreciate the gains
I think I’m done remembering you
I’m worthy of forgetting  for your own sake
I should be every regret you have.
fractured again
I want freedom more than love my heart is untamable
I find the hells we make for ourselves are far worse than any by another’s design
you lost me the end
I want you I want the version of what you pretended to be not what you actually are
I bought into a fantasy laid out by a grifter. This is so damaging to a person. It’s been so long now but I still remember sometimes. I pity your next victim. This account is dedicated to you. My apologies for insulting true sex workers. I have nothing against that profession.
"I’m being generous. With a “cheap whore” there’s a negotiation and transparency. You never gave me that. Instead you gaslighted the fuck out of me for a long time, emotionally abused and manipulated me for your own selfish ends and then tra-la-la’d your way down the garden path."
never forget that you are the dirtbag that I elevated and put onto a pedestal but the truth is you are nothing but a cheap whore that’s all you ever were that’s all you’ll ever be
the storm rages outside fog obscures the city below rain pummels my house the tress groan in the wind  and I wait for a snow covered dawn
I no longer care about your ghost go dematerialize on the moors disappear into the sea
just shut up quit talking and go away
we eventually learn to accept the prisons we’ve made for ourselves each stone of each wall  carefully laid  and well deserved
I’m so easy to love I’m impossible to love but you’ll do it forever
"“I feel good about you, don’t fuck it up.”  *as I fuck it up"
my church is pale with long black hair her cross is grey broken and spent kneeling before a sallow alter of memory and regret we worship a different version  of us
she crosses every rubicon
what would you have me do?  *a subtweet
courtyards churches cobblestone lanes dappled in sunlight filtered through the leaves of ancient trees a street lined with colorful umbrellas fountains flowers the smell of baked bread a walled city overlooking the French countryside the sun sets on Laon we are out of time
how many more days will I brood on this perch
sometimes in life you just lose things down the drain
when the rain stops the forest finds solace  in silence
I’ve never had such an apt pupil as she was  she was mine to use as I saw fit  she was always a good girl except when she wasn’t
remember my fingers on your lips my eyes fixed on yours how I could make you wet with a glance?
heaven may be a stormy afternoon hard fucking  rain beating on the windows
storms rage outside my window the rain and the fog the grey standing among the ruins of everything broken feeling nothing not even melancholy  that’s how little humanity that’s left
there is a forever out there  it’s just not with her  no matter how many times we try to force love  we always wind up at the ending
never wait for the axe to fall or the shoe to drop know when it’s over plan accordingly
Photography by Edie Sunday
exactly what I look for in a lover
"she left so much behind when she left, it’s one of the things I can appreciate about her"
this dance we do over our own ashes
I never said it was complicated I said I was
I love the most when letting go I hate the most when holding on
fuck me into exile
morning star
never forget her magic even when she’s abandoned  she doesn’t give up until reality bends to her will  with you right back in her arms
we want  what we can never have she wants me I want peace
your freedom lies somewhere between when you stop looking and when you start again
the twins distance and circumstance threatening never tantalizing always
she’s on my periphery the one I look for but is always gone  except in dreams
forever is not meant for someone I can never trust
"I (imagining all this art coming from the evolutionary processes facilitating procreation such as sexual attraction and attachment fueled by hormones (oxytocin), neurotrophins (NGF), and pheromones as well as the social and societal concepts of romance) you."
there are parts of me that are abandoned cities
it was love that let go
I’m her end all
It’s okay you have that life thing to live
I hate this thing I am
I can still hear her voice whispering me awake
words like a Brueghel painting that’s dreaming of Bosch
you open her up like a bin full of crazy toys pieces of her past  patch-worked together in a daisy chain of insanity
it was a mercurial madness now we sift among the ashes the dead that were once possessed by fire
I’m no ghost I am a part of you  and dwell in your very bones
those words meant something once and like dwindling echoes the energy has left their meaning to rest among the lies
she’s lost under aphotic depths where light has no name and memory has no meaning
you know me
they’re all me and they’re all you depending upon which mask you remove
this rope has no ending no beginning either  only infinite entanglements and a myriad of knots
in the shadow of St. Bavo a cold Duvel meets my lips as she laughs with her eyes in the town of Haarlem
I’m not looking for love I’m looking for the reckoning
welcome to forever
I’m an asshole. This is not news.
Why did we even try?
One year left.
So here we are and here we have always been and always will be.
Pink desert skies
How can I breathe free when the weight of your memory keeps me from breaking the surface?
I should let both of you go.
your beige is wonderful but your devilish side was magnificent
she was a troubled soul which makes for a persistent and demanding ghost
the peddler of carefully crafted mediocrity
she is the desert and mountain ranges and sand dunes by the sea she’s the city that dreams of country cottages in the woods she’s the journey the sojourn the final destination
I can’t miss you I can keep numbing myself until I feel nothing at all
I love you run away
I am god
"take your dreams back they’re yours, not mine they always were"
if you think being my enemy is bad try being my lover
show me the lines crafted from your life let me read your vulnerable
if you ever knew me you would also know I see all maybe not immediately but definitely in time
I need you this eternity
we are two storms violent as earthquakes  but with no foundation cracks
her circles are squared everything fitting into a neat package of loss and pain and never again
thank you for choosing the void
we manifested who we were supposed to be and we still are
a drunk devil is unbecoming I’ll leave that for the demons and the lesser of my kind  raging into the night
I can’t write about love if it’s not about her I can only think about love letting the words fall where they may
I know how every ending is it’s the beginnings that can be problematic
she wrote me in December I should really write her back we never got our chance
channeling that other universe where reality isn’t so cruel and her hand is still in mine
I won’t rest forever  my heart is too violent for that
we’ll always be in that moment she and I
I tried to transform the world but all I did was become the abyss I so much hated
endings are about to begin beginnings are about to end and this long chapter is coming to a close
down to the last petal
the touch of her fingertips tracing flowers onto my skin her kiss in ecstasy releasing butterflies
the night wasn’t our fault I blame the stars  and the way they looked in your eyes
our shadows have passed into the night and the sunrise has recreated us in its own image
hold on to those memories they still live
she’s no calm sea many have drowned in her depths
I’m impatient to walk in the gardens with her hand in mine
I need to consume art and beauty the kind found in nature and in marble tiled museums
thunder happens in the rain this is true earthquakes need no such criteria
I know the monster under my skin it’s always hungry
one of my faults is not wanting things to be any different
words fail sometimes
my silence is a thunderous roar hers is a stream trickling under trees and birdsong in the morning
I miss being a nobody
she devastates every time I think of her I often dream of crossing paths  in the dunes by the lighthouse
she walks the shore at midnight dress flowing under the stars the pact she made with the pirate moon even though he was lost at sea years ago
it’s cold in the forest
My bet is on evil for the win
nothing is going to make sense tonight my esoteric mind
the old church olive trees pastures and fences  livestock roaming in the sun officers in their regalia swords ornate pistols clean with oil  a woman at home waiting a child or two the first cannon shot white smoke drifting away across the plain  the thrill of death a game of life
I have a war to fight love will have to wait
I no longer write about love
I’m the one who is supposed to be tempting you
you’ll have to accept the fact I don’t hate you anymore
I hear church bells echo through the trees as the morning mist greets the dawn wisps of steam rising from the porch  I take a sip of coffee and reflect on the cat (sleeping in the sunlight) my mind rambles the bells fall silent leaving me alone in the grasping dark of the triad
life is too short to keep pretending
make me gray again
little is left but grains of sand  clinging onto wistful fingers
I had to construct a new heart on the ruins  of the one I gave you
I try
my terribleness contrasted by my beauty
kiss my kind lips let us drink from forever
she will always be in my orbit a heavenly body that is sometimes too far away
I’m shedding this skin I’m becoming light
I still listen to your heart when your song is carried to me by the winds
"I want your gardens  your tomatoes, your peppers,  your mint"
I have plenty for you
"my blood, not wine"
don’t fuck with a woman in her childbearing years  let her fly
realizing the reality  of permanence
don’t worry love I know I’m a monster and I’ll keep you safe and away
breathe me once again
there’s nothing left to say while two worlds form outside of themselves
a toast to fresh starts finally
I’m better off alone at least for a while
“Let me go” she said. “Let me find happiness”
we tried one last time because we had to
I’m not broken I’ve manifested
she’s magic somehow keeping us together even though we’re apart the lies of us resting in the dirt
she’s cursed  to do everything again
she haunts me by candlelight  no prayer removes her memory
she gave up immortality for me
loving her was loving shadows in the dark
you should hasten I’ll be gone soon
you know what pleases me
what would ‘we’ even look like
"fly, love"
those rolling hills the farms the fences the mist echoes of that song reminding me of the road we took  on my way to set you free
"“You may conquer her love of God: you will never overcome her fear of the devil.”  ~Pierre A.F. Choderlos de Laclos, Les Liaisons dangereuses"
I’m too sane without you without the fires that burn only for you
I have green eyes  but they might as well be steel blue
I’m low key done with your angst
I don’t see a way back
let’s make a deal let us both let each other go so that we both can go on and live beautiful lives
that’s a lot of water under the bridge to be of any concern in the present
but fuck she was as perfect
you closed the door I merely locked it and turned out the light
we’ll all be dead someday don’t waste a single dawn
I don’t kneel before anyone or anything
two universes born from splintering love we are both  the master and mistress of our own domain
love is madness
“it’s beyond my control”
this death spiral we share  it never dies and we can never live
hate is weaponized love
you can never leave
I can’t give you want you need I’ll take from you what the beast hungers for it’s beyond my control
forget the past ignore the future the present is your lover and she’s insatiable
absence a monolith a void dark ominous menacing foreboding devouring light  consuming nostalgia imposing its will in the now
regarding yourself I never wanted anyone different
happiness and emptiness cannot coexist
I watched your propped up smile until I didn’t anymore
"you felt like you weren’t enough because I’m insatiable but I never once thought you weren’t enough, not once"
I’ve never been stronger
I think I’m done dreaming of you
this fucking beast just under my skin and in between breaths
I did the best I could I always do
there’s a splinter of time that has opened a crack in the void if we don’t tarry we can jump through before the fissure closes
how you cannot feel the ending at first
she is the wind echoing softly through the pines
complicating you is never my intention but it’s what I do best
and now we know
"metaphorically, Lol"
I have no heartbeat in the metaphorical sense of the word
every now and then I catch a photo of her and find myself just staring at her beautiful hair and eyes and curse the universe of time and circumstance and distance
never love those who can’t love you back
"I never allowed myself to disappear completely, just enough"
and just like that the darkness gave way to the dawn
If I’ve ever loved anybody it was her
“An unexamined life is not worth living.” A saying attributed to Socrates. In this spirit I will be working on being kind.
this year is going to be challenging
my resolution is to try and not be such a bastard
"Men like me have no exes, just lovers I haven’t seen in a while"
you would be taken aback at just how charming I am in person
"2018, 2019, they’re just numbers"
I need someone to take all of this out on
but not much longer
"“You are a diabolical, mean, evil person.”  I prefer complex but I’m otherwise aware of that."
nostalgia and emotional thinking will enslave you
I’m so self aware I’m so horrified
"you escaped, love I’m happy for you"
2018 was my fucking year 2019 looks like not so much
"don’t call me daddy, sir, master...ever"
there’s love in my violence
fear is all I need to be
I don’t need love I need fuel but I’ll pretend love is a thing in order to get it
try to save me and see where that gets you
you’re more valuable to me when you are worthless to yourself
I do want your pain
I don’t want your love
I’m never looking  my prey always finds me
I wanted it to work with her I didn’t want to destroy her love  like I always do
I’m dangerous to know
All of my almosts should count yourself lucky
I’m literally killing her in my presence. I. Am. That. Toxic.
"I never told you for that would mean giving up power, but you were always enough and more"
to love me is to die a slow death
when I’m exhausted I have trouble keeping the monster at bay
we were perfect and now you are
"you think you love me but you are just offering up yourself as an appliance, the fuel I need. I don’t care about you, I just want to feed."
"I don’t feel anything, ever"
some people never leave some people will always be a part of you
on the drive home dreaming of Route 66 back in the day windows down Kool Thing playing on the radio as I approached the city  what I would give to be back in your bedroom listening to legendary albums
"don’t, love"
I still sleep to her sheep’s clothing
memories like splattered blood from the trauma bond
the shore has become too far away the stars are beautiful out here
I always held her back together after destroying her
trust and loyalty is an aphrodisiac
I don’t quite know where to put her  somewhere between nothing and never or with forgotten things that have slipped through my fingers or with the loss of what once was or the finality of all that implies  she never felt lost to me and I feel her shadow by an unreasonable fire
let’s hold what we’ve got
you let go of the things you love that’s how it works
"Isn’t it sad that we go from spending lazy afternoons naked in bed, holding each other while warming our bodies in the sunlight that spills through the window to never seeing or speaking to one another again?"
I read her and my heart breaks and then I realize she’s only a stranger and she’s not writing about me
imagine about what is and what will be rather than what could have been for what could have been will never be for good reason
I’ve had greater tragedies since we were us
I want to avoid hurting her any further
It’s probably irresistible
her heart is a sunset  perpetually breaking  over the mountains  and into the sea
I saw a photo of you and had to look away lest I be drowned in deep blue eyes
everything is where it needs to be
an old friend  those dirty streets  of Los Angeles today I ate at the Pho place down the block where we used to meet an outdoor bar in the Arts District the Redisent down by Urth the smell of barbecue the taste of good beer and many partings
I’m going to stop pretending that I never loved you
you used to write poetry
the songs ring hollow
stop keeping me alive  bury me in the present
Raclette and vin chaud
why now?
Finalizing my diabolical plans for 2019. The world isn’t going to conquer itself.
I taste unavailable
I’m going to ignore the wind in the trees
why won’t you stay dead?
I taste like madness
S’mores...and Bordeaux
let’s get drunk and fuck in the closet
the cat is happy and if the cat is happy then I am happy
I’ll give you what you need to disappear
of shadows and ghosts
if you are not exactly what I want I’ll stain you until you are the perfect hue
"Retweeting that asshole is like sealing your tomb. Alright, it was already sealed but you get the idea."
I don’t want to be your ghost. I don’t want to be your anything.
Slept like a baby. I always sleep like a baby.  *flexing
when I’m silent it’s because I have to be
I do you a favor by ignoring you
I’m all out of blood

my drunk tweets have a life of their own
God you’re beautiful! Go away.
Dreamt I was riding a horse in Spain
Oh you love me do you? It’ll fade in time.
Drat! Foiled again!
Internet is capitalized buddy.
be kind to each other this weekend you don’t know what people are going through
she’s a timeless beauty she will be beautiful at 77 a Raquel Welch sort of timelessness
Do you realize there’s a fucking tree in your living room? Think about that one for a moment.
That way she holds onto to too late
I woke up madly in love
“An unexamined life is not worth living.” ~Socrates
we love our tragedies so much that we live them out
Save me from my sins by becoming them.

The road to me is narrow.
Hell is a Snapchat wonderland.
Just when I think humanity is going to make it I come across some idiotic Snapchat filter or goofy distorted video and I cringe.
reverse cowgirl cowboy weekend and wine
"I often wonder why people pine over that one person, that certain lost love. I wonder why they don’t try to find the qualities they adored in somebody else. If the relationship ended it was for a reason. Getting that same person back won’t fix anything. Love doesn’t work that way"
I would never be caught dead alone in a room with her...or her...or her...
Once you taste the darkness nothing is ever as good.
"I’m having trouble recalling which dozen or so accounts are yours and besides, we really never really know who we are engaging with. This is why I like being alone with my words and my thoughts."
"We drank wine. We laughed late into the evening. We talked about love and sex, former loves. She pointed out evidence of another betrayal in my past. Laughing I told her I didn’t need any more of that. Other’s choices will always decide what purpose they ended up serving."
I still think of her sometimes and wonder how her life turned out.
One of my first great loves was a model and a dancer. I loved her so much it hurt. We were together for almost four years. When we broke up I burned the three journals containing all the poetry I had written for her and never looked back. I don’t even know if she’s alive or dead.
I may break your heart but I will never forget you
a man is worth what he’s willing to turn away
I should have been dead long ago
"I’ll focus every ash, every ruin, every remainder of me into her and hope it’s enough"
I loved her in the time we had
you can stop pretending now I’m gone
I’ll write the remainder of my heart what’s left of what love did to me
Disappearing incrementally completely
after my next European obligation of course
I’m going to sell the Eyrie with the gardens the butterflies  and the bears and move to wine country
let me read you let me enjoy your words explore your mind banter and basque in your watercolor landscapes learn who you are as an artist a writer but my eyes belong to her  if I learned anything through all the pain it’s how to be loyal and forsake all others
I keep her in flowers
blood of the vine intoxicated hearts the corruption of her
she would have complicated me
when I fell she dragged me in from the storm and became my shelter and this is all that love is supposed to be
She’s basically a wonderful person but with a mental illness and a touch of evil
Please be okay with me as just another loss in your life.
Love will enslave you and is my weapon of choice.
there’s no hate left within me it consumed itself in the fire but the ashes are scars
hate in the way I fuck you love in the way I hate
Cheers!
you do know that a subtweet doesn’t count as communicating with the object of your message and is passive aggressive as fuck
real devils will fuck with you from beyond the grave
it turns out she was the monster under my bed my whole life
Every time you write something it shocks me awake.
Asshole
All of you spending the evening preparing for work tomorrow are really letting me down. Stimulate me. I demand it.
The holidays are kitsch hell.
I’ve made a mess of you all.
Turn out the light love.
Can I take a bite of that apple I gave you?
It’s all quiet on the frontlines. I think the danger has passed. She’s moved on.
"You know this isn’t a dating site. Well, it is if you want a fucked up personality in your life."
I make my own judgements about people.
"I’m not afraid to call evil out when I see it, fuck political expediency"
I’ll only destroy you in the end like I always do
great fucking album
score one for feminists they’ve gotten a Christmas carol removed from radio station playlists still silent on female genital mutilation  can anyone explain that?
you are the only equation I must consider the only one that needs to be worked out
Is it ever really over with me?
Like I do every day?
I fell from grace and found an honorable life from the ashes
what do I do with all of these hearts I’ve collected? What do I do with mine? Who can I sell my soul to?
all of the echoes are fading everything is quieting down moving towards entropy
that moment when everyone is quiet and half asleep listening to the music and ruminating about the night
I’m not serious you silly fool
stay silent don’t tell me how you feel and we’ll spend eternity on the opposite sides of forever
freedom is its own aphrodisiac
going back to Amsterdam
I had everything in place to make you whole then you scattered yourself to the winds
you were never as beautiful to me as you are right now
amicable partings
irony the subtweet
revile me
hate me I need that energy
so I got a taste of the other side of the coin and it’s just as bitter -no thanks
I never forget
she was so easily dispelled
split me black keep me there
don’t overestimate your importance to me
whiskey and nerve my coping mechanism
"throwing shade, lol!"
what the fuck is all this daddy/dom/wolf shit? I stopped playing Dungeons and Dragons years ago.
a moment of clarity
I love Myrna!
the mountains never knew her name
my rage my devil rage lashing out in the darkness at slights that are now but phantoms fading into the mist nothing matters from yesterday when goodbyes have been sealed in their tombs
sext: 2018 was a great year for me. Don’t hate.
the music the rain plays a melancholic overture  beneath dark clouds against the windswept mountains
I love your filthy
Just browsing social media will show you a species still in its infancy and still afraid of the dark.
indifference is half of my charm
I should include a trigger warning message in my bio.
you weren’t enough is that better?
I don’t like your beige.
if by happy do you mean me not having to look over my shoulder to see who you’re fucking? Then yes.
I hate you but in the most romantic way
I love your philosophy
is this what the final end of us looks like?
walk away from what you don’t want  do it now
an expat in Athens has a nice ring to it I think
I always want someone like you
another November ending
I’ll listen
I’m terrible
looking back I realized she existed mostly in my mind whispering the things I wanted to hear
tie me up she whispered
fuck it all away
the pains I go through in order to kill it all away
release me back into the void
flood for me
read me fuck me
defiling her morning before work
the kind of writing that drops panties down to your ankles and makes wet fingers dream
"I do know this this much, I’m tired of pretending to speak with ghosts."
"“You’re a difficult man to love.” She said, gesturing with a glass of wine held loosely between her fingers. Her eyes glazed over and her hair spilled over her shoulders. She looked beautiful in the low light of the room, her eyes staring intently into mine."
but I miss you too
you don’t understand I am bound by the demands of honor and by pride not to love you ever again such is the stench of the flower of betrayal you only have yourself to blame
unfortunately my heart isn’t in charge
leave goodbye on the ground where we left it
nostalgia creeps but must be abandoned
"I’m sorry. I think you are a beautiful person, one who shouldn’t be hurt."
I can write just as eloquently about sunflowers I can about crows
you’re safe with me
I’m disappearing slowly deliberately I’ll be gone soon  I’ll be back home
I want everything beautiful for you that’s why I’m not there to hold your hand
she’s heartbreakingly beautiful
the tingling in your fingertips when it all slips away
don’t love me I forbid it
we prepare a better hell for ourselves than anyone who would see us suffer
and the shadow passes just like that
"we are either going to work things out or part ways forever, but we have to try, we have to put to rest the question however it falls"
“Sadness is another word for not enough coffee.” - Scott Adams
I might be all out of me today
repentless
I try to kill you with every word I write
I think too much I write too much
all she ever wanted was everything and all I wanted was everything she had to give
raw is a distilled process
I’ll write until I pass out with a bloody broken bottle a candle and half formed thoughts manifesting clumsily onto the page
You should have been kept a secret
to write me about love evermore
on the backside of an eclipse sliding toward exclusive
I’ll never forget
I don’t do the love thing anymore
I deserved her
I’ve spelled out in plain English how I would destroy you love me anyway
I will just walk away and leave you cold in the dark love me anyway
pouring content into the most isolated part of Twitter
I tried to kill the memories with whiskey and wine sins of the flesh dicing with death dancing with oblivion I have only succeeded in killing what’s left of myself while the memories grow ever stronger ever present and I hate her for that she wouldn’t recognize what I’ve become
I’ll leave you with your sins to keep you company.
I write on my own terms.
she was a second hand casualty
take my hand consign me to oblivion
nurture your darkness for it cradles the light
I always know where the exits are
when it’s time to leave I’ll disappear and as I stand before you as I walk away as I write words without you in them as I twist their meanings  and string them together to form my walls you’ll see me but you won’t feel me you’ll see the words and feel my absence within them
the poetry of leaving
great songs killed by bad memories
I’ll teach you how to destroy me but you’ll have to do it for both our sakes
care about those who deserve caring don’t waste love on ingrates
I still think of you  over the sea waiting for my return
femme fatale
what sort of pretentious self-aggrandizing shit shall I write tonight?
she can never be loved enough
I’m here this is where I’m planting roses
I’m thankful for all of those who backed away from the edge and became the light in someone’s life after facing the darkness.
the fog rolling in through the forest fucking perfect
you won’t understand everything I write and I won’t either
let’s keep this place lonely  it’s comforting somehow
*fell
I’m cold like the void of space the passage of time the randomness of death  the unlucky break like the stars in winter a distant snowcap a city scape at night I’m cold in your memory in your love in your bed I’m cold in your wake in the love that has died but remains immortal
all of this drama just to propagate the species
I fall apart as well  I just contained the explosion better
"“Nobody fucks like you do. You pull me down from my shoulders as you pound me hard, crashing it all, meeting me all of me together in the middle. It’s all encompassing. It’s brutal and caring at the same time.”"
"she’s wearing nothing my my dress shirt, my black tie around her neck, a glass of bourbon in hand, her hair flowing around her shoulders as she takes my cigar between her delicate, manicured fingers and takes a puff"
give me the loneliest parts of you to water in my garden
I’m a hopeless romantic in the end
you love me best when I’m not in love
I haven’t changed I’m the same person you loved the same person you left the same person be you long for
there are two sides to every story I’m sure there’s one somewhere in which she is the good guy perhaps it’s a question of motivation
ever met a real Illuminati in person?
"half the time I want to fuck you half the time I want to discuss philosophy, literature, history, ancient languages, and the classics"
"death comes unbidden, unannounced  death is inconvenient  inevitable an unwelcome guest a failed definition a great illusion  whereas life the energy that connects everything this reality this experience an overly concern about death is not living and that’s not why you are here"
to borrow from the Buddha: let go of desire
I don’t want you to die I want you to thrive
nothing stinks on a man like desperation a woman can smell that a mile away
like oranges?
me neither
I’m terrible love me anyway
I swagger to the left
jagged little nine millimeter one hundred twenty four grain hollow point brass full metal jacket capsule of death
twist the narrative like a knife
I don’t really do the whole “madness” thing anymore
I don’t need you or anybody and that’s the part you hate about me
morning sun
cold calculating empty they need men like me doing this work
"there are fractures and dead flowers all around us love, what are we holding on to?"
I don’t feel anything on purpose
I never hurt you on purpose is the new I took you for a fool and thought I would get away with it.
“So I’m evil huh? That’s what you said last night.”   “You know you are. You can be a real fucker. It comes easy for you. All you need is the slightest provocation and all this shit spews from you.”
"we loved each other but that is no more, seek your bliss elsewhere"
the desperation of domestic life
I see the cracks in your smile
"don’t underestimate my hatred, love"
"quick, someone write something to take away my despair"
“You’ve become evil.” She said. “I think you are a fucking monster.”   She always loves me again in the morning.
not enough
What man doesn’t defend his woman’s honor? No woman I’m with could appreciate a coward. I don’t go around fighting but I don’t hesitate when it’s called for. I just chalked this incident up to cultural differences. I would never insult a random woman on the street. Who does that?
I noticed her arguing with his trashy wife. I realized these piece of shit weren’t  worth it. I was in a foreign country. I didn’t know the law. First strike? An assault arrest. Career killer. All of it running in my mind. I had to restrain myself. Let him go before it escalated.
"you vixen you, now you’ve gotten my attention"
"He stepped in too close. He was untrained. I could smell the alcohol on his breath. I was calm, heart rate was good. I had this one. I envisioned holding his head for a devastating head butt followed by knee strikes. Holding him close it would go to the ground like all fights do."
"“Bitch!”  rage welled up as I swiftly confronted the offending asshole on the street “What sort of man insults a woman?” my woman He stepped close. I shoved him hard. “Motherfucker.”  I smelled the fear, saw it in his eyes “I’m not afraid of you.” He stammered. “You should be.”"
“fuck you” is my middle name
those who say they have no regrets in life are either liars or have never truly lived
keep my secrets...
proximity equations but I’ll be gone again soon so the quotient is zero
of course I’m thinking of you I loved you more than anything
if my absence makes you a better person then I’ve done some good in the world
I’m not a fool for anything especially love or you
sounds like heaven
I won’t look at you because I see him I see them
I’ll be in Paris in the spring  anyone want to meet for coffee or cocktails?
the moors are empty save the wind and the sea
tonight I’m banishing the apparitions staring at me in the snow through a lead glass window
you murdered me cheers
close the gate to the garden when you leave
I could never hold my head up or be proud if I was with that woman.
set me free
Dirty. Rotten. Scoundrel.
I don’t need hell my own thoughts torment me just fine
so does hell
"my confession is too long for Twitter, I tried"
nope
she’s everything but lazy afternoons lying next to each other naked in bed
"I’ve talked myself out of a confession, that’s talent."
let me obsess over your delicate hands as they hold a book or take the stem of a glass and lift the rose red liquid to your lips
I’ll confess my crimes to the abyss
it’s never goodbye with me is it?
come change me
I take the term “all is fair in love and war” to its most extreme conclusion
in light of all the shit I’ve done it’s a good goddamned thing I’m a sociopath
I hope I disgust you
unspeakable crimes of the heart
"fuck, when I actually take a look at myself I realize just how horrible I am"
I left as her fool I returned as her devil
I’m not anything you are looking for but you may be what I’m looking for.
"yeah, no fuck you"
hunt destroy repeat
she wants to be my everything while I can barely manage being anything at all
I would rather be your elusive what if than your stooge I’ve already been the latter  and I’ll never be that again
Devils aren’t born they’re made
keeping things vague
it’s time to be human for a little while
I won’t cut you open again.
draw my attention
you love me? what the fuck is wrong with you?
you would be surprised how cold I am
it was all said and done  wasn’t it?
it’s just that I hate you...
Do something that scares you. Do it everyday.
I don’t speak subtweet. I never assume it’s me.
and who are you?
tonight I’ve stopped killing myself
it’s simple really you do dastardly shit to me you no longer get to be in my life in any capacity those are the healthy boundaries I set for myself
I’m constantly and always in love
I release you go find your bliss
lust then love then lust and back to love before it was nothing
I don’t exist
her everything distilled into someone else’s problem
fucking typos
it’s not love unless it’s absence fucks you up for life
there are no endings  there are just beginnings with a backstory
don’t send me nudes send me your naked mind your vulnerability

"my left eye is jacked and I look quite villainous, something out of HR Giger’s imagination. Considering an eyepatch until I heal."
I will love you without your consent I will love you  without your knowledge I will love you without hope without reciprocity without condition  I will love you in shadow and where darkness reigns I will love you in despair where all is lost and broken but I will love you
some love is impossible
always torn between lovers and circumstance
she’s novel worthy
I’ve done it all
she’s a composer from an influential family young and beautiful  born under a Persian sun she’s broken like me I’ll always remember the first time we met smiling at me  as she crossed the street I was at a sidewalk café in Europe we walked in the rain  through ancient the streets
when two people just fall together
I miss her her dark skin against my pale my hands entangled in long black hair like silk her tongue entangled in mine like silk  the urgency of her love the immediacy of the moment  her dark heart and mine the scars of torture  and deep almond golden eyes her in my arms her crazy
home for the holidays but I’ll be rambling again soon
Jesus knows you are doing the best you can I know you can do better
I don’t remember
"there’s no hope left with me, I’m a dead end for you or anyone else"
it was never her I’m so good at tormenting myself
I’m not a devil I’m simply a man who can love with every fiber of his being
the ghosts are ghosts shadows and the spectres  the corruption of lies and tormenting illusions have no power against a resolute heart
the spell has been broken all the rose petals have fallen and the sunflowers are burned up effigies under the sun there is nothing left but thorns and weeds among the brambles of the garden we once planted and the gates are broken down
some of you people are weird motherfuckers
"of these, hope"
I was in love once.
sometimes I just want to write myself to death
just have fun forever or for as long as you can for when the fun ends so do we
of course you can
"it may surprise you, but I am happy. I’m not in any pain whatsoever."
so I get a little drunk on the blood of the innocent  fuck me then
I love the people I hate seriously there are no more finer examples of despicable people that are worthy of my derision
I love your little version of the truth it’s cute
when you don’t love yourself you open the door for a love like mine
I don’t love you has been one of the most difficult things to say in the English language
I have every reason not to love her and I have every reason to love another  and I have all the reason I need to suppress an insurrectionist heart
too tired for forever
"let me guess, one of those accounts where the AVI is a faceless man wearing a suit and tie?"
“I forgive you”  is much more powerful than  “I love you”
I’m everywhere and nowhere but most importantly I am in  your  head  and that’s the place I call home
my username is the devil I’ve written almost 1800 tweets not one time have I mentioned sin think about that for a minute
you need the vile within me to bring out the woman in you
my brain tells me she’s bad  I don’t have a heart so...
I crossed the Rubicon she crossed the Styx
I love ruthlessly.
I’m worse than you think.
"“you always get what you want, you bastard.”"
"the eyrie those cold dark halls and overgrown gardens decaying with the changing seasons and with neglect my home, my mountain perch lording over the valley below an imposing sentinel above the clouds where I brood  tortured and in love, always"
these days I’m more concerned with my portfolio than I am with matters of the heart life is good indeed
see her with new eyes
the minefield of words that will never see the light of day
as it turns out I do hold grudges
a voice called to me from across the sea telling me I’m inside her head and that she misses me. We were lovers once but depending on how you look at it we will always be.
love is beautiful it is us who ruin its perfection
it’s not as much fun of your eyes aren’t glazed over
I have certain appetites  you have certain fruits
It’s not technically unrequited love if I don’t know about it
the fates photo by luciferious_glow
I just want drink whiskey and wine and write ballads all night but I feel it’s lost on most
I’m not lost but I don’t want to be your leader I want to be your god
I want you made up like a porcelain doll  an elegant dress high heels a respectable beauty out on the town every eye upon you your arm in mine laughing and smiling drinking  dancing but I will defile every inch of you when we close the door for the night
give me your filth we’ll call it art
every sunset is a rapture
give me something beautiful to ponder
when love must die
I don’t hold a sentimental view of the past there’s so much life yet to drink ahead why waste time remembering  the taste of stale wine  I occasionally see the memories when it’s quiet and the moon is full clouds rushing across an autumn sky  above the treetops over the mountain
we fuck a candle casts our flickering shadows against an ochre wall
too many of my kind
there’s nothing careful here my mind explodes sometimes and it gets messy but it gets quiet also
if I consume myself you don’t stand a fucking chance
a toast to all of you who have loved and failed and found love again I salute you
I’m not lost but I don’t want to be found
no rules no judgment let’s just break apart in each other’s arms
circumstance is a desert a vast ocean full of peril an impenetrable wall impervious to fire and the elements to try and cross is to die of thirst  of hunger of want
"yes, I hold back don’t want to scare you off now do I?"
I feel you pulling the universe bending it to your will but I am stronger
It’s someday and everyday hereafter
I know how to drown
love is not enough I demand your everything
drown me in your deep black water and breathe for me when I’m gone
let’s twist up together to where we no longer know which parts are you and which parts are me
it’s not as fun if you’re already corrupted I want to own the fresh snow at the break of dawn the first star at dusk the first sip of wine and the first taste of chocolate from your delicate hands and the tender parts of your breaking
the sorcery of her love the deviltry of her mouth the enchantment of her thighs and the unholy chorale of her whimpers her moans her pleadings in the dark conjured from somewhere deep someplace hidden desperate someplace suppressed and abandoned by the light
I don’t kink shame send me your bucket list
up and running again
I love best when letting go
realize me
pleasing you pleases me and I just love to be pleased
I’ll be the ache and the strain and the things you need
my ideal lover is one where we’re not afraid of the silence between us
I would just fuck you all up like I always do but I need you to do the same for me
it’s not that easy being diabolical
"you, for whom I would build a new universe from the foundation of your love I would become your light dispelling the darkness soothing your fears banishing your sadness I would create paradise and let flow all of my love becoming your everything obsessed consuming you hungrily"
"“I’ve never met anyone as intelligent as you, they all pale in comparison.”  *I have to stroke my ego on this one"
I can wait in the darkness for literally fucking forever
my charm gets me everywhere
all the stars cry for you merely because I touched your cheek with my hand
I just wanted to be god I settled for walking among the brutes pretending I belonged
she made a home in the dirt and then another in the ashes
let’s make a mess of you
"you deserve extra horrible, but in a good way"
size me up figure me out
I thought you’d never ask
despite it all I try
every dawn is a miracle
there is no hope there is only the opiate of self deception  the dulcet lies that lure us to sleep
good morning love
always appear to be less observant and watch what people try to get away with
be my canvas
it’s not for lack of trying
"the devil played better, he was just being nice"
a diabolical one
I’m not sure my heart can be tamed
I love too many of you
when I was in Paris a few weeks ago I purchased a bottle of hand made cologne from a small artisan shop. Although I liked it I prefer the Atelier.
Orange Sanguine by Atelier
dragging ass today as I tell myself “this world isn’t going to conquer itself”
"“your hands are so warm, hot even” she said, as we talked in the kitchen.   Her black dress was slipping around her shoulders, I wanted to taste her smooth skin. I could smell her hair, she was so close to me. Her large brown eyes staring into mine.  “I have a cold cold heart”"
I’ll never forget sitting with her in the garden
"“she can have any man she wants”   “except you, which is perhaps the main reason she wants you”"
I must ramble on love
she seems so far away like we never happened
“you smell so good”
green eyed devil
here’s the drunk tweet that will destroy your universe
enchanted she takes a little away from the mystery of the sea
I’m destroyed tonight I have no answers
I make it easier to hate me
it was suicide the same plan I’m subscribed to
lose the love of your life and then get back to me
I have some crushing words for you when I’m done
“Will you dance with me”
the teeth are revealed from the satin stitch of her innocent smile
I know it like the back of yours
you seem to know me well
it may all be black and white but I only see you in black grey is for the weak
you’ve said that before love it’s so unlike you that’s why it’s hot your feeble protestations your indefensible position
I’ll shake this off too like I always do
a black suit black tie a motorcycle  a bottle of rye dark sunglasses a yellow sun fall leaves a graveyard a funeral
I let her dance her dance
as far as I’m concerned I have no competition
I can’t
I represent that which you can never have
please me
there’s an ocean of circumstance separating us the wreckage of the past is haunted by the damned who are confined to a watery grave but you can still hear the howling on those still evenings when the moon is full
I’ll take your love I’ll take your hate the fuel feels the same
I hate that little prick and everyone associated with him
Lawful Evil
my Catherine was by my side the entire time I just couldn’t find her in the fog but the moors are a dangerous place the siren song of the sea submitting to the cliffs luring the lost into her bosom
"don’t worry, I ignore everybody it’s nothing personal"
infidelity is dishonorable and I am an honorable man
my memory is a spectre and no prayer can remove me
she tried to fuck away her emptiness a menagerie of the grotesque  isolating and groping her in the dark  she lost a little more of herself with each ugly thrust until there was nothing left  but the frayed edges of a lost soul  held by trembling hands
"I wouldn’t worry about what people think, they should let you be you"
and the red death
I just muted that crazy bitch
love people who struggle
you had that with me
"put that black dress on over your pink whipped ass and let’s go out for cocktails, I’ll finish you off when we get home"
I hate her and protect her at the same time
I’ll ensure you a life of flowers
a professional  a leader in the field  with a clear vision of the future a mission balanced centered ruthlessly focused on success while building his empire has no time  for petty bullshit or little girls in adult bodies pretending to be women
most people are twits tell me about your follower count again
I have no heart I have hunger and imagination
there are few careful words here
"tied down naked exposed blindfolded while I read sleep do laundry run errands dropping in occasionally bringing you close to ecstasy fingers, tongue, mouth, devices, men, women licking and hammering and fingering you so close but never quite there left in frustration in the dark"
I’ll take you to where you’ll never admit to wanting to go
I’ll bring rope my appetites and a rather large knife you bring anticipation desire fear
this place is a confessional
but I am self aware
love me let me douse your light
"“you would walk into a room and look at everybody one at a time without saying a word as if you were looking right through us all, as if you knew something we didn’t, all the while calculating just how much damage to cause.”  *an old   friend"
the past is a graveyard
my bed is never cold
I won’t lie to you I will tell you the naked truth and let you find your own way to hell
I can’t be held responsible for your love
that’s a shitty way of thinking about the space time continuum
"the lady knows what she wants, I know that much about her"
a mirage when you’ve had too much absinthe
reading Palahniuk with a crumpled up grocery receipt for a bookmark
she’s all hustle she’s always been
how far would you go for me?
everything I touch withers and dies
one last shot before the end
sext: otherwise unavailable
Jusepe de Ribera
actually the conversation is over
I’m not sure I love anyone even myself
I have plenty
life is so tragic how could there not be poetry
and makes her untimely death even more complicated
we talked sometimes after that day I watched the movie she produced the one she made with her ex husband it was an art film about sex and drugs and mental illness sometimes I think about that night she came to me how everything seemed perfect so natural I know when I feel it
she poured through my writing that day in the garden she said it reminded her of James Joyce she wanted to edit it for me after she wanted to fuck me all I could see were her brilliant blue eyes splashed with yellow there was a mist in Silver Lake that day and dew in the garden
she said she wanted a do over she wanted to escape with me and that she always loved me from the first moment we met but I had loyalties but don’t think for once I didn’t consider it but now she’s dead and next next time I see her will be at her funeral the day before Halloween

I’m here for all of you
all train stations are lonely places
remember those banks of Nietsche roses hidden in secret within dark forested places
we whiled away a Paris afternoon white sheets dappled in sunlight spilling through the blinds a breeze and the sounds of the city  spilling into each other my fingers through your hair and yours through mine mouth and tongue and craving eyes having no other place to go  but home
I may be a motherfucker but I’m a loyal motherfucker
nor do I
If I was a good person I would let her go let her be happy without me  but I’m not a good person there’s something within that wants her to hold on to the dream to hope to love the lie so I try to fix the broken things only to break them again it’s my curse and the demons laugh
"I may be a real motherfucker but I always try to be a good person. I try to fix the things that are broken and be a decent human being, but I have the soul of a clown that is always fucking it up and laughing at my futility"
to say that I’m a challenge is an understatement I’m the impossible
she’s hates me I feed off that energy
arrogant as fuck
there’s no getting over me there’s just compromising
when I split you black I throw you to the dogs and am entertained by your degradation
if you are my woman you have hell to pay
I require all of you all the time
Bordeaux and a little taste of you
my favorite kind
you should be scared you should be terrified
the rose is long gone but I can still feel where the thorns cut me
and other abandoned places
you’ll fuck me because I don’t give a fuck you’ll leave me because I don’t give a fuck you’ll hate me because I’m beautiful
"I want to fuck you, she said she came to me in the night everyone was asleep I was passed out drunk  she apologized for being rude earlier in the evening our tongues found each other  I made her come  expert fingers an empty whiskey bottle on the table as forever slips away"
back into the deep blue black photo by @knowyourdevil
"Photograph my Harry Michalakeas, Last Rights Gallery"
"No, you did"
"if you want to know why I didn’t fight for you it’s because you weren’t worth fighting for we would have ended abruptly once I found out about your proclivities and indiscretions, I’m happy you found another and are no longer my problem"
how many sunny days do we have left?
a very drunk devil is a very horny devil  *horned
relatively so
I’m find comfort in these close confines of anonymity
we fucked in Paris
"our place in Le Marais, Paris"
It’s complicated but the best things in life are.
death is the orgasm
she meant something to me my heart is cold as ice but she fucking meant something to me
I write here because these words fall into the abyss where they belong
you were radiant you were beautiful I’m sorry I refused you  in another life love
I can’t believe you are gone the anguish is unbearable
those steel blue Irish eyes burn into my soul and haunt my dreams
let me pull you from your coffin and hold you and take a lock of your hair
just give me your daggers
Devil
suck me into the void
I don’t either
darker than amber an old reference an old friend
everything fades to black
I need to taste your honey
I want you to feel everything like I do
I want to hide from the light I want the truth that can only be found in hidden places in the darkness  where there is no judgement
I’m here
god is tyranny
someone dear to me someone who loved me in secret has died and so have I
give me the darkness of whiskey
I have this thirst this hunger for what’s forbidden for what’s sinful for what’s not mine  and I eat voraciously
sex is more fun when it’s dangerous
I’m just a man and death is real and always unexpected
it’s always complicated this thing we do
the truth is I loved her and she loved me but I had certain loyalties
a toast to lovers  and shared moments hidden in the night
I need to work out some frustration preferably with you and some rope and my belt
the dark dark night the crickets sing a lone dog barks in the distance the stillness of the air the stillness of my heart
I should let her go let her find happiness like I always do
Jane
we feel forced
I can be so loving and so cruel
hunting...
I left you with nothing  and nothing is all you will ever be
"she dropped her panties for anybody who asked, she wasn’t worth my love"
I used her
what is beautiful is dark what is dark has depth the morning light will always creep into the room destroying the illusions we make for ourselves
manifest with me
I’m going to murder my other selves
shells and bones and twigs  laid out on the sand scattered remnants of a lost girl blown by any wind
eventually every lost love turns to ash
we’re all disasters aren’t we
I need the kind of relationship where when we fuck we aren’t quite certain we’ll survive until morning
beware of ingratiating smiles that are held too long or crack at the edges check behind the masks of unctuous strangers who are eager to be your friend and reach out with open arms promising aid and comfort you don’t know them don’t say too much  this place is full of monsters
she matters
love me through the haze of distance and from beyond the dream love me in our madness and in the mundane and through the fire
I’m here to stay
I will always be  misunderstood
I want so much more than what’s between your legs but I would never neglect that part of you
would you kill for your god
kiss me pretend that you love me
don’t look for me
I pulled everything down because I wanted to stop hurting you  now it’s time to forget
love me anyway despite it all
there is no future with me there is only now this moment this desire
a young woman on my arm two monsters walking in the darkness
none of you try hard enough
if only I could punish her now
I miss her psychopathic mouth
"whatever it is she deserves, whatever it is I deserve life is good so..."
I want to own all of your whimpers
I just gave her a taste
silence holds its own shadows
I won’t hate you forever
I want your body I want your mind I want your soul and I’ll win them all through your heart
*rearing my ugly head
I knew something was off with her I haven’t survived this long by not being observant
I know you now better than ever before
I don’t love anybody in the traditional sense  I love what you’ll do for me and what lengths you’ll go to please me
"I met another version of you, tiny, dark, and scarred"
I hate that you read me
the mechanical destruction of her is as close to love as I get
for her my only disappointment is my absence
let’s stay in bed all day love  I’ll trace your scars with my fingertips you run your fingers through my hair and drown in my eyes
"no, you are the best in my estimation"
the irony is that they pursue me
"goddamn girl, run!"
they all choose their own endings with me while I try to push them away in good faith
love between sips of bourbon
hold my hand love I’ll take you where you want to go I’ll become all that you need I’ll be your everything I’ll own you forever
love is a lie
we’ve lost our stomach for raw truths
"my advice son, be careful in idolizing her  she will show you an innocent side a playful vixen, solid and appears to be your everything seducing you with lace and pink flowers  while she lets the pigs piss on her behind your back because that’s what she feels she really deserves"
when my words hurt you there’s an admission there on your part
"I know many if you in all of your varied forms. I often see you, read you, with my eyes not the ‘like’ button."
"I wouldn’t entertain thoughts of me in your dream or fantasies, I just wouldn’t, unless you get close enough for me to hold you in some ancient European city"
the things she does with her mouth while looking up at me with those deep brown eyes
meeting her was worth everything that happened
we always make a mess but it’s usually her we have to clean up in the end
it never ceases to amaze me of just how much control I can have over another human with just two fingers and know how
"I caught her eying the wooden A-frame rafters in my bedroom, we looked at each other and smiled as I took off my belt..:"
we both have scars mine are invisible while  hers decorate her body but we understand each other
"I’ve always assumed none of your words are for me, why would I think otherwise?"
you can’t love me unless you’ve swallowed me whole
sleep well my little birds
god
my cursed destructive mouth and fingers and tongue
I’m sorry I hurt you  *to all those for which this applies **especially you
leave them be leave them to their life and never look back
I miss you there I said it
she delivered an ultimatum she wants me to give up my self destructive writer rock star lifestyle and settle down with her  my liver may have another opinion on the matter
what is this thing I do that makes you so infatuated with me? I would be content to be alone forever until the weeds win
she’s tall and beautiful with pretty blue eyes tall and intelligent and accomplished she’s German but speaks with a British accent she said she lived in Scotland for a while she likes my presence
she’s a fucked up mess tiny raised scars raised all over her small sinewy body she’s tall her eyes are deep and brown and when I look deep into them I imagine them reflecting a middle eastern sun setting over the mountains she’s a composer she’s seen some shit but then so have I
let me feed
the taste of red wine on her lips the feel of her writhing body inside my arms the energy I cull from within her with expert fingers and mouth like she is about to explode
don’t make the mistake to think it would ever work with me I’m not your salvation and you are not mine
the good ones always find me
"we kiss, her mouth is open in complete submission she wants me to destroy her but I just want a taste all good things take time"
"another brown eyed girl, exotic, primal, into magic, we lay naked on a rainy afternoon on white linen, we kiss as I trace her scars with my fingertips and lull her to sleep with my whispered nothings"
fall in lust with someone who is capable of destroying you sexually but know when to walk away
don’t fall in love with someone who is incapable of love
so much power within one little finger doing the just the right thing
I’m no gentleman once the lights go down
we did everything perfectly and we are where we are supposed to be
"she asked me what my likes were, my hobbies I just stared at her blankly not quite knowing how to answer not quite knowing how to take her"
she never knew what love was until she lost him
I’m about to beat the fuck out of these three douchebags at the end of the bar
hell is hardly
fuck for me
“My hair is okay for just being fucked.” she said  I finish another scotch and acknowledge her with my eyes.  Cheers
every now and again you invade my thoughts reminding me that I hate one person in this world
"I hope Mr. “short, cold, and utterly mesmerizing” visits you nightly in your nightmares"
I need you desperate and craving
never might as well be forever
I’m terrible love me always
the forgotten
this pretend little world inside this tiny box
silly nasty girl
"I wasn’t referring to you, don’t be so vain all the time"
I can never seem to reconcile my regret
I can never seem to wash her filth completely away
I don’t want your love go love someone else
everything ends
miss me in your crazy but I’m not so I don’t
there is no more dust
Her love was only for lease
"there’s no hope for us, I’m just always trying to save the world and you are one of its monsters"
love without deception or guile or face forever being alone
fight like the devil
we tried
surprisingly cold
capture my gaze enthrall me stimulate my urges reap the consequences
mornings aggravate my solipsism
let me fuck away your quiet let me taste your loneliness
fuck me like you’re trying to kill me
everything is where it belongs
I’ve noticed your whispers in every corner
"I’m unconcerned with how many lovers you’ve had, I’m concerned with how many you’ve betrayed"
double or triple your pleasure push your limits to the breaking point how far are you willing to go to please me?
the woman I’m with is a well fucked woman
stimulate me
you don’t deserve me and that’s beyond sad and pathetic
never is more powerful than forever
there’s no rest for her sinful mouth
fucking her senseless was the only sensible thing about the entire episode
I die inside of her mouth all the time but am always resurrected by her will for pleasure
it’s cold on the outside of me
hate me with your mouth
my only problem is that I’m not exploring you right now
satiate my darkness
you’re not real until my belt is around your throat and you’re pleading to be finished off
she would be in for so much punishment and degradation
"wear me out by letting me roam freely over your tender flesh, belt and devilish imagination in hand"
"I love what I destroy even more after the destruction, that’s when I can roam freely and take anything and as much as I want"
she survives by feeding off of others
I wasn’t even finished with her I had so many delicious plans  so many more ways for her to break
the rules are for others come with me and we’ll break everything
there’s more violence in my tongue than there is in my words
let me strain your jaw muscles
I grew weary of the same old cabal
I’m hungry I like how you taste
love will end you don’t do that with me
it’s time to end the story
working to be your favorite trigger
"It’s time to forget, don’t you think?"
off to the next party come with me
manifest your love
how will she burn for me
alone at last
this rock star sort lifestyle is going to kill me
I have a soulmate everyone else must hustle
"3am, drunk and a place to be in the morning"
I smell like the girl I was talking to but too bored to fuck
I don’t want to be loved.
just disappear
I think we’re all dead here
hanging my old words to rot
I murdered a part of me today
bulk writing for wholesale emotions
an appetite for exquisite things a hunger for you
bleed for me and I will love you forever
time to walk the city and stare the sun down until it is murdered by the sea
less trusting but more capable of love
he’s dead to me I say to myself
what is meant to be is beyond our control
the magic never really goes away it just hides for a while waiting to be rediscovered
fall apart under me
a love where you aren’t always looking over your shoulder
love is rough
the complicated nature of us all
healing means accepting her back into your life I won’t let her go again
I’m going to let her go  I’m going to do the right thing even though it’s against my nature
If she would have been loyal she would have had me forever
the immortal moments of memory
the stars can wait I need to see the intricacies of your lace
don’t hold back I need your everything
I’m still here
I want to fuck you
"no, I’m addicted to you"
"please don’t say “make love” especially if you are a fat man with pudgy fingers, it’s creepy"
I’m a liar if I say I don’t
an unassuming devil until you are helpless and trapped and only then do you see what you’re dealing with
I’ll taste you tomorrow
there are no shades of grey with me I’m all about black
I need you consumed
don’t cross me don’t touch my woman don’t talk shit because I will destroy you motherfucker
"you won’t like reconciliation, the punishments you would endure might destroy you"
I’m the one you crave
put the devil to bed so you can fuck him in your nightmares
reform me with your lips
I’m more evil than ever
we kissed under the lamplight down the street from the palace and I want more
everything is beyond my control
you’re just about the sexiest doctor in a mini skirt I’ve ever met
I’m trying to remain a secret
I need to paint something with my tongue
get used to the taste of not me
happy little trees
don’t think you can love me and get away with it
being elusive is part of the allure
against my better judgement...but good god
when you’re honest with someone their willing destruction tastes so much sweeter
so do I
the memory of flesh exploding at my fingertips
"After having a conversation about her being so vanilla.  “Guys just run from me.”  “You don’t get hit on at bars?”  “No.”  “You are beautiful, smart, successful, I really don’t understand why. Perhaps you have walls they sense about you.”  The same ones I sense, I thought."
“You just like the crazy ones because they let you put it in their ass.” She quipped.  I smiled and changed the subject.
looking for my next mentally ill ex because crazy fucks better
you only see a shell of a person when they build a wall for you
I am so far away  so far removed you can feel the wall  from way over there
hate me you’ll feel better
I’ve lived long enough to become the villain
as long as I’m in control I’ll share I don’t tolerate betrayal however
"I remember there was this one who said she was my whore as it turned out she was everyone else’s as well that’s fine, but she got put in context and the poetry became lies"
I’ll run you ragged
let my dark shine on you
she’s incapable of holding onto anything good and that’s why I fell for her
everything is temporary in this life
goodbye love
I dream of her in Spanish with her freckles and brown eyes
parting before we’ve begun but it’s her eyes I crave as I watch her take down her hair and watch it flow over her pale shoulders
the energy of never when she’s standing so close to me
the ancient mysteries locked inside her bones
retroactively revoking the importance of their presence
we can talk all night but you will only know when your tongue tastes mine
you had me at brutal
would you die for me
I remember not giving a fuck about her
sadistic satiation
a fine collection of belts
her flesh owes me
Zdzisław Beksiński
nothing good came from all of that
"perhaps it’s time to bury those bones, I’ll remember her when the trees die and the cold rains come"
"I wouldn’t care if she disappeared completely, this game had gone on too long anyway"
"I interact with the masks every now and then, mostly to show her that I see her"
two fingers to see if you’re ready
linger for me
real power is knowing what you can leave alone
"fall in love with the man who leaves you alone at the bar, who won’t stare too long, who won’t harass you, but he also won’t get your number"
"Southern girls have that something going on, a mix of genteel and vixen, but I love them with a mint julep and them in my arms on an old porch while watching fireflies wake at dusk"
perhaps I’m easy to look at but it’s my mind you’ll want to come back to and fuck over and over again
let’s keep it intimate
I know I can be intimidating stoic aloof but once you find my gardens beyond the shadows of the wall you will never want to leave
peeling off that tiny black dress was the best moment of that evening other than cultivating her blooms
the tremble of her
I know when it’s time to be rough and with her it’s all the time
I have strong hands but I handle fragile things delicately
keep your rosary in your hand as I kiss it and put your fingers in my mouth
come here and kiss my brazen mouth
I need the quiet girl with the insatiable filthy mind
"I’m not for everyone more importantly most are not for me but you, you are exactly what I want and must have"
if you fall in love with me I will own you forever
"I’ve never wanted to taste anything more than when my lips feel the warmth of her pale neck, fingers in her hair, hand on her shoulder"
dine with me  let’s drink wine and laugh and stare into each other’s eyes and forget the world that exists on the outside edges of your smile
the eyes don’t lie
"I tend to obsess about all the filthy ways there are to please you, for pleasing you pleases me"
"give me the raw girl, the one who is sloppy with her words and in the way she fucks"
give me your hot mess words and let me drizzle them into your mouth
silver haired devil I use my tongue for something else entirely
love should have no secrets
I hate that there’s someone like you out there
she had committed a dozen betrayals since the time she first said she loved him  she doesn’t deserve love
I always fall in love with the shy girls who are invisible to the world
the windows are open it’s pouring rain outside a little jazzy something plays on the radio I finally have some time to write
"there are many nights I walk alone on empty cobblestone streets, just me and the moon and the shadows of ancient places with stories to tell"
she breaks in remembering she dies in forgetting
she found love once in the weeds between the storms
hope will enslave you
you are beautiful and I want to love you
the ending was long ago the moon slips into another beginning phase while the dirt in the shadow was long forgotten
I should have left you there but I’m too goddamn noble for my own good
don’t forget to hate me today
everything was a waste
after this song I will hunt
I’m aloof I’m quiet and you can feel my presence when I walk into a room
one more gin before I walk into the night
the art of forgetting
in case you’re wondering if I’m struggling over you I don’t even remember your real name
cut the toxic people out of your life if you want to be happy
stay beyond the perimeter  the fire is not for you
hot as balls
"a steady regimen of parties and socializing keeps me entertained and distracted, boredom brings the evil and my mind thinks of you hungrily"
I must try harder than most to be “normal”
the door is closed
it’s too late it’s all too late but meant to be
I haven’t had a grudge fuck in a really long time
I wonder what he did?
without trust you have nothing
there’s comfort in not having to wonder what your lover is up to
the woman who never lies to you is the one you should strive to be with but the one you don’t deserve
tell me your story I’m not entirely without compassion
surveying the rooftops  of an ancient sleeping city the witching hour behind us and there’s a certain stillness in this dream of death
I’ve added another scar
I’ll get hungry again I’ll get voracious again
I don’t exist
I fight my monstrous nature  I really do
she treads lightly as if I haven’t always known she’s at the window looking in
the comfort of solitude
my third life since then
how many “oh fucks” can I draw from you?
I need you hungry and tainted
I like your philosophy
she’s afraid to let go she’s afraid of being consumed completely
take care of the devil in your life and he will take care of you
I want your apparition to keep haunting me
my hedonist lifestyle needs to slow down
this lonely place there must be a thousand souls within shouting distance yet I am isolated I am empty
"I imagine she could already tell by our conversation that she’s in over her head, I imagine she likes it."
get deep to drive away plastic lovers
"If I was a decent person I would push her away, but I’ve never found decency to be appealing. Enslavement is appealing."
"she’s elegant, beautiful, deep brown eyes stare into mine, her dress blowing when we walk down cobble stone streets, drinking wine at a sidewalk cafe I noticed the way she wistfully bites her bottom lip while looking away in the distance, while I imagine kissing her delicate neck"
"Oh shit, I realized I’m going to hate when she leaves."
I want her but there’s no time left
it’s Friday night!  unleash the hoary hosts of hell onto an unsuspecting city
"sitting across a young woman on a train, the way she smiles while texting and that fact she is completely absorbed must mean she is in love"
“you elevated a common whore and put her on a pedestal”  *I tend to do that
those memories just won’t die no matter how many times I drown them
some obtuse man I work with asked me what the purpose of art was I said nothing and everything
the abyss is not the same as the void here in the former we have plenty of entertainment
behind her last mask was the nothingness of the void
the best love was the one that was undefined and emerged suddenly from the shadows
perhaps I’ll watch the sunset over the city where I once lived as a child I could almost reach across the channel and touch it
show me how much you hate me make me feel you hating me
rooftop revelries
this ancient city by the sea suits me
the sea echoes throughout the city while the gulls sing their cacophony
I like things to be intimate
I know how to make your legs tremble
you don’t know me too bad
impossible to hate  impossible to love
coffee and the morning sun  the view of the waking city from my penthouse
I feel nostalgic at times it’s more about me and the way I perceived the experience and it’s more than any transitory lover or temporary circumstance
a toast to brave beginnings and fortunate outcomes born from bad endings
"yes, it’s me I’m still here"
is that blood or wine or both
I’m truly terrible and shameless
“an empty bottle and a gun”
everyone faces the edge late at night in one form or another
the little things give you away
she said she fucks for peace whatever that means but I’m all about peace
just notice me thinking of you I’m about to become too busy to give a fuck
you are way to aware way too insane way too twisted inside yourself
you survived me and I hate you for that
I’m just tracing the scars  they are so lovely I wonder what the ones I gave you look like
my soulmate would do anything for me
as I grip your ragged little mouth and raise your chin up so your eyes meet mine
I focus on your undoing I obsess over your enslavement
I want to see you satiated and reduced to a drooling mess
"I’ll take your mind away from your problems, if just for a little while"
my feelings are more numb than an opioid addiction
you could say I’m heartless but I’ll just laugh
when we talk knives she gets wet for me
my belt remembers her flesh
I’ll own her forever  she knows this fact she hates this fact
no rest for the wicked no quarter when she’s your girlfriend
she really does never sleep
beware the quiet girls who love books
be a slave to no so called god
I brought you bastards fire
I didn’t fly too close to the sun I am the sun
exiled
I hate you because I know what you need
so you’re insane but you broke the universe
“do whatever makes you happy”
once the ashes settled  and if we were judged the question remains who is the worst monster?
my lips will always be raw with her memory
she knew she loves too much that’s why she sunk the knife
I want to care I just don’t
predictable in my unpredictability
for many a life of mediocrity is a safe life don’t expect to be safe with me
she sat with me on a sidewalk café long shadows  swallowing the street a German couple kissing goodbye we laughed into the night we talked about lost love between glasses of wine her smiling brown eyes staying with me until daybreak
I could never be with anyone who disgusts me
It’s going to stay “over”
in case you’re wondering there’s no fucking chance between you and me
I’m not sure I’ve ever hated anyone more than I hate you
fuck you for burying yourself deep
I loved you you stupid cunt
"you’ve been nothing to me for a while now, I just want you to be even less"
"hot blonds on bicycles everywhere, I may reconsider my definition of heaven"
at some point the hate will fade and so will your memory
"the harsh truth, isn’t that what you expect the devil to deliver?"
"lately I imagine what it would have been like to walk these ancient streets with her but I realize she was never real in the first place and I only loved what she reflected from the best parts of myself, for she is an empty person with no sense of identity"
a strong emotion is a strong emotion and she always scrambled for scraps whether it was affection or revulsion but I’m afraid I can only muster the latter when I even think about her
she feels my hatred and it reminds her of me
"don’t let someone you hate stalk you, you will just prolong the inevitable, which is preparing the place in your heart reserved for the void of empty lovers that have lived past their purpose"
"I don’t usually get blind sided, but the depth of your madness is unfathomable"
the truth twists in her head as she spins herself away from any responsibility
she was in love with betrayal and that is the only way to describe it
repentless
I’ll plow right through you
I want to murder you with my mouth and tongue
I won’t accept you without the mask you know that yet you keep trying
the ones who are willing sacrifices touch me someplace deep
there are demons lurking here how pathetic
a macabre world in my image
you’ll miss them less once the truth is revealed
you should have hung around and not have been a dirtbag
I would have probably throttled her by now
judge me fuck me
we’ll die apart and it’s all her fault
"her pastel facade is the mask that hides an insidious monster, beware those who seem to be too perfect"
when she attains a certain level of maturity she will become evil incarnate
those who betrayed me are always dead in my eyes
of you have the will to walk away and never look back you would be invincible.
heaven lies just inside the brambles
"the kind of woman who looks at me, runs her finger down my horn, plays with my tail and coyly asks “Do you want to play, Mr. Devil?” You know, the ones I’m powerless against."
I want to fuck my way inside your head to where even your dreams are mine
you’re very odd now but your love is pure in your own way
I can be the most gentle of souls
I saw a few medieval churches today  I would love to fuck you in
go fuck off and try and enjoy the life you’ve chosen
love isn’t a game remember that when they want to play
nothing is more enticing than excess
an addiction to life  is that so bad?
my corporeal form is quite temporary  I’m more the spirit of your destruction manifested in physical form
I don’t associate with those who associate with monsters
forever is also tyranny
dreams of faith and the exile of vampire lovers turned with a simple nickel plated cross among the mist of granite monuments in the graveyard
what you succumb to will enslave you
the tyrany of lust
fuck the petals out of your mouth or some shit
When I’m thirsty and hungry at the same time  *your body
"“get me the fuck out of this Lyft, this woman is trying to kill me.”  *what hell is really like"
"weird enough for me, lol!"
and yes I hate you and that will never change
adamant is the only way I hate
you were my first choice until you revealed that you were a fucked up person then you were no choice
leather and rope is the new fire and brimstone
I suppose there’s never “the one” but plenty of “you’ll do”.
my lover keeps a garden
one intoxicated devil one insatiable lover
the way she handles the snakes with those goddamned beautiful hands
fingers inside her Lilith mouth
show me how love conquers all and I’ll show you how your heart is enslaved
your pain fills the void within me ponder that irony for a moment
I want to corrupt that pale flesh
her hate isn’t so bitter anymore
‘bag of bones in his pocket and anything you want’
there’s no lonelier place than beneath the sun
we all leave
I’ll leave you holding the mask next to curtains flowing from the open window but you’ll always be in my heart
the cold radiates
the only thing I believe in for certain is the depravity of the human heart
being diabolical is a lot of fucking work
if they say they will never hurt you they already have
I’m not much about religion but goddamn I love you Trappist monks and the beer you brew!
away again from those hallowed halls  nestled in the mist
I’ll torment you forever and will never set you free
to be beautiful and dangerous and all the while worth it
sail into the darkness forever
murder you with words and fingertips
the lamenting ravens outside my home
Those vixens are delicious aren’t they? Expensive but delicious.
dark triad love affair
dalliance with the damned
question everything including yourself
"I’m so evil, you have no idea. I’m unapologetic about it."
I was about to write “I’m going to stop pretending to be one.”
dichotomies
going for the heart is for rank amateurs
“you were one of my victims”  *how the devil was created
coy fingers curling around dark haired vixens with dark eyes are my weakness
and so it goes
then when we’ve exhausted ourselves put on that dress I love and let’s go to dinner
an autobiography
"fuck pitchforks, I require belts and flails"
"write your dithering poetry motherfucker, I’ll stay voracious"
she keeps me hungry
"I don’t repress my appetites here, I satisfy them"
by the throat
the ferocious appetites of a monster
fuck your colloquial sensibilities
"I’m careless, destroy me"
"I’m unmedicated, enjoy the words."
if I could make you me
remember those banks of roses next to the forest and the river
"let me prime your downward spiral, I’m an expert."
my god woman!
this is supposed to be a self help account but instead it’s a snare
the beauty contained inside dark hearts will blind you
enjoy your nightmares
"there’s nothing beautiful here, it’s all madness and damnation"
"ducking autocorrect, agents of the tyrant"
"my haters go insane with how much they hate me and I just dine with white linen and the finest silver, garçon another carafe if you please"
I’ve triggered people into purgatory
all the caveats are in my early tweets
"by they way, you fucks blame me for everything but I didn’t create fucking mosquitos!!!"
I deleted that tweet and got the facts wrong just to torment you
if you understood my pain you would understand yours
but it’s a mirror
"the truth is I am exactly who she wants me to be, who she needs me to be and who she tells everybody I am, it’s the perfect mask"
but so wrong
so wrong for each other but so perfect
I’ll be your pivot. You be my possession.
I always break what’s mine.
we might break the world
"hand me your favorite red flag love, I want to choke fuck you with it"
I loudly destroy my everything and it doesn’t even need to be in my path
fuck their little black hearts
“I’m bored. You guys want to conquer the world?”  *me at work
be my nothing
this is a sex account
that dance we do
I will love you hard and it won’t even feel like love it will feel like I hate and want to destroy you  if you could reciprocate then we would be a good match
she will die of a thousand heart breaks in her lifetime but I make sure mine hurts the worst
I need your mess all over me. I asked
I can’t make that promise
me to self
I’m insane tonight  don’t listen to me
darkness can be beautiful but not as beautiful as waking up holding you when the sun breaks through the window and paints our white bed linens in its glow among our naked forms
queen of multimedia ecstasies
"storms do what storms do but they all find entropy, they all find peace."
I would know you anywhere.
I play the game  because that’s what’s required but nobody ever wins
The eyrie The wall The fog
I hate people.
picking fights that I know I can win
Imagine if you will a tyrant who controls the propaganda of his kingdom. How do you think one would be treated who told you that you don’t need to be a slave and that you are a god in your own right? How does the one who brought you the fire of wisdom fare? Stand up. Fight.Rebel
Where is the god who couldn’t stand to see his creation subservient?
"you are the ones who want to be willing thought slaves to an all powerful, and unelected, tyrant. How pathetic. Get off of your knees."
chaos incarnate
I really am the devil.
fucking you the way you would expect the devil to fuck you
you don’t know the things I’ve done the things I’ve had to do to understand me  you must understand the hell that dwells in this world and within the heart of us all
my heart is a vault
I’m even more dead than before  take the turnout
"I got a good deal on that lake of fire, it belonged to an old guy who never used it."
careful what you wish for
"I won’t lie to you, you know that about me"
just know I’m out there somewhere
accursed mist strangling out the daylight
I need you in red
our combined forces are just too powerful for normal humans
the creak of leather
let me unleash my wrath into you
"it’s with a certain melancholy that I watch the white roses sway in the garden, daylight bleeding over them while the low growling wind rampages through the forest"
kill me or feed me pancakes
"I have a dark forest, chambered halls and a brooding temperament to sustain me"
let’s play the devil’s trI tone on vinyl and make manhattans with flamed orange peel deep into the night
she needs to keep the game going but it’s been checkmate for a while now
if you’re reading me you will already be more careful next time
succubus
be wary of those who try too hard to convince you of who they are  they are probably lying  and they have an agenda
take the rest of your sycophants away while you’re at it  there’s no room for credulity here
some sins are unforgivable
I hold no illusions
forever is a lie this moment is all there is
the darkness had fewer eyes less judgemental motherfuckers
perhaps that period of time was the pinnacle
voracious
we’ll delay things until our final parting in death where regret and missed opportunity live in eternity
the sea separates our insatiable desire and we ended before we even began
I move my hands along the spine of the world and she moans
I’ll fuck your mind like you’ve never experienced before and that’s just the foreplay
enough philosophy more debauchery
there are no soul mates and no souls outside of metaphor imagined to trick our survival instinct to cheat death yet we imagine that there is only one person in an ocean of people that can make us whole and dispel a lonely universe  but the secret is all you need is you to do that
If I’m not the destination just one hell of a detour
the pastoral care you crave lies under my hands and within my arms
I nurture the things I break I protect that which I’ve ruined
show me fear let me dine
I want to devour your garden
my hands are oblivion
when my evil machinations come to fruition and bites me in the ass
"madness is just another cloak passion, the dagger love, the mask"
if darker was possible this is what it would look like
every word I type shudders with the reverberation of someone who despises me
I do the haunting let’s make that clear
embrace the pain feel everything that’s how you know you’re alive
awe me
"forget the second coming love, I need you to concentrate on number twenty"
let me take your mind away from him let me own it forever
there’s something to be said about hot wet messes
"I need to stop looking, leave the dead to their kind"
"I may degrade you and fuck you senseless, humiliate and abuse you, but I will always respect you"
punishment isn’t that what devils do best?
I only fuck the ones who know what they have
I don’t share
devils cry into their hot sauce
bury your thorns inside my veins love
you’re beautiful but I need to dirty you up a little
the abandonment you fear the abandonment you crave
my karma debt is paid in full surprisingly and contrary to your narrative
the world is yours just take my hand
if you love me you’ll live forever
surrender to me let me consume you
she wants to claw it out but I keep my heart where she least expects it to be
she said I have no heart she’s wrong and it’s a voracious feeding machine
the only validation I need is your satisfied smile in the gloaming
you’ll never forget what flies from hell and what returns to it
I need a woman with hell in her eyes and abandon in her intent
let me carve a love poem into my arm
blood curdling blood wings
the perfection of solitude
blow me away
hell hath no fury no truer wisdom
I want you to love me  I want you to love to hate me either way I’ll feed
"I walked in larger than life, I noticed the star struck therapist fall over herself after reading my background. Of course I’m well adjusted, do they honestly think their blunt methods could penetrate my psyche? I agreed when she said there are no self aware narcissists, not one."
"Before you judge my kind too harshly, there is a direct correlation between PTSD and partial PTSD and borderline, schizotypal, and narcissistic personality disorders. Is the narcissist in your life a war veteran, first responder or has he or she ever been in trauma?"
that is beautiful
it’s not that my kind doesn’t love it’s that we love you all
I think it will be heartbreak and remorse and it will drive him mad until he finally perishes alone with the memory of her whispered upon his dying breath
how should the devil die?
I might have to kill off this character
"as you wish, but I have a full beard"
the only thing I will trace on your skin are your bruise marks and the words “my little whore”
I would recognize her anywhere but I let her think I don’t see her
beware what is too good to be true
this hell outside of her
I have certain appetites  they all involve you
I just want to gorge myself on you
I love writing here the most
don’t fuck anyone who doesn’t own a dinner jacket or a tuxedo
that dance we dance the music will always play on long after we’ve left the ballroom
how will you bleed for me?
most monsters I’m aware of are adapt at fooling everyone around them. A sheep in wolf’s clothing if you will. I find that dishonest. I prefer to present myself as a wolf in wolf’s clothing and give you the power to decide for yourself. Choose wisely.
the devil has drunk tweets too
I don’t want your love
it’s only blood
stop it  *a subtweet
fuck you for that
what even is love
I don’t even want to be in her heart that’s how much I despise her for what she has done
it’s best if you are the one at a disadvantage
when I’m finally done I’m done
what a woman with intellect does for me
her sexual self degradations  her easily discovered lies her many affairs and arrangements  were all about her warped defense mechanisms trying to escape me and then make sure I abandoned her  forever get out stay out
your pain should be better today you’ve always been a good girl but I had to destroy you you left me nothing to work with
when every word draws blood
I’m incapable of love in the traditional sense but I will consume yours and I’m easy to fall for when I truly love I will push you away
I’m coldest when I hate
the rage the slamming of doors the smashing of wine glasses the biting edge of scathing words feeling the power course through my veins embracing its energy welling from my gut and tingling in my fingers  I grow to ten feet tall my presence becomes imposing demanding unforgiving
nothing hurts
I need your hate
I’m a bastard for sure but I’m a devilishly good looking bastard
there is actually a harpy section of twitter comprised of women who are far worse than me
putting my evil machinations into motion
I looked up at her and made eye contact as I took a bite from her apple
she is as evil as it gets
there are real devils out there this is just me fucking around
There’s nothing wrong with making you feel good
we have earned stoicism
it’s a tragic story really about two people pretending to be human and the horrible things they do to each other because of the pain they can never escape
I’ll tell you all the delicious ways I will fuck your mind and body but not before I tell all the reasons you shouldn’t fuck me at all. It’s at your peril.
our kind lacks empathy the greater of us recognizes the importance of empathy and have the intelligence to supply it in a supportive manner but we don’t feel it we don’t feel anything we put on the mask to appear human we soothe and heal but above all we protect our supply
I see right through you like always
"dark, dreary, hopeless the torture of hope  of regaining the semblance of enchantment again to realize my only recourse is to release myself back to a former state from this sensible, broken, desperate one to regain the  madness the desire and appetite you fell in love with"
all great love stories end in tragedy
the slow exploration of a body that responds spilling its secrets at the softest touch the slightest breath in the right places kissing gardens into her skin releasing oceans with expert fingers  a maelstrom of feeling while simultaneously being  lost at sea
"the average man has no idea just how common dark fantasies are among beautiful, intelligent women, it just takes a little gentle enticement to unlock that desire and bring it into the light"
hopelessly dark and romantic
you are a religious experience and I speak in tongues and thighs...
I just don’t feel like being bad today
poor cunning creature I saw everything as it unfolded
that’s a lot of great art packed into one tweet
If I’m not ripping your guts out then I am failing
unapologetically
I write to destroy
evil exists within us all we don’t need a devil to blame it on
I would love to enjoy some tea with you in the garden and talk about nothing at all
I don’t even miss her
I just want to exquisitely destroy you
I warn you give examples of my villainy yet you still let yourself fall in love with me
for my kind it’s less about heartbreak and more about loss of control
goddamn me softly like only you know how
wear this for me all day when you find the discomfort think about me and how I am going to finish you when I get home be ready
I will never know what fate befalls her
"touch me bring me out of exile with your fingertips temper my arrogance with your lips let us lose ourselves in the darkly, enticingly romantic world we create with our love bind yourself to me so that we may wear each other  in our bones forever"
all I need is you  and I will have you
I’m her favorite anti-hero
"mad, bad, and dangerous to know, but I would never forget an Oxford comma"
I never want to hear that song again
if you can find beauty in the profane and the grotesque you will find beauty in me
there’s no end to the dark and terrible things I want to whisper to you in the night
tightening my grip
tasseled hair torn dress makeup smeared I need you to wear me on your way home
pleasing you pleases me
What I do for lust
sad girls with bare feet and naked thighs who dream of roaming hands under their sun dress
what shall we get up to today?
fearlessly take life by the throat watch how I do that with you
forever can wait until I’m done with you
you don’t have to be damned to love me but it helps
madness delirium desire
your enchanted presence
the taste of freedom is an opiate
you don’t want the tortured haunted words you want the words that fuck you up
pistons pounding engines driving loud violent powerful controlled you helpless submissive insatiable eager wet lost broken ruined warm protected loved
for what is this hunger that remains this madness this delirium born of craving the dreary dark days of hopelessness the ghost of you haunting the taste of you forgotten what hunger remains through the spectre of nostalgia the taste of betrayal and the taint of memory but you
her distortions  manifested her projections made real
a terrible love an all consuming madness that spiraled out of our control consuming flesh and bone and blood and left us dancing among the cinders and the ash of what can never be
feel the energy of the emptiness bursting inside your heart
tremendous wounds make tremendous lovers for they know how to feel
my actions are fathoms above my words in the aphotic depths
I mask the love for the pain to give her what she thinks I am
"beyond the wolves and dark forests, the fog and the formidable gates are gardens and roses and butterflies and wildflowers blooming in the sun waiting to be plucked and placed in your hair"
forever the fanciful dreams of little girls who wear pig tails and dresses to church and dream of their Prince Charming and true love now is the time for passion for abandon for lust for pleasure now I need you impatient for my hands mouth fingers tongue forever can wait for me
I shall possess her steal her away from the routine the mundane the average I will ravish from her all restraint and her fall for she is terrified to fall will be complete a sacrifice to my triumph as I let her succumb losing herself to me owning her dreams delighting in her ruin
you can have all of my secrets I will make more
I’ll burn you up
I don’t mourn the things that were already dust
I’ve said my peace laid to rest injuries of the past the truth runs free in the daylight once more while darkness is banished to the pit lonely consuming itself hungrily wringing its hands wailing into the night with tortured remorse as it plots revenge on the blinding light
Know thyself
torture me with your lies and infidelities inflict the pain you imagined I inflicted upon you tell me I’m the father knowing I am not let me make decisions based upon your deceit about a child I thought was mine I’m guilty of a guarded heart you will always be the finer monster
I am adored professionally there’s a coterie of sycophants who admire me and have closely followed my career they would do anything for me my superiors stay out of my way I have free reign to do as I wish I am highly respected for my significant accomplishments I am loved by all
It’s your mind that I crave it’s that which I must hold close to keep enthralled so that I may gorge upon the sweet nectar held in its dark recesses I need to own your every waking thought  and bend your dreams toward me I need you addicted ragged and willing to please me
embrace your shadow stare it right in the face and it will lose its power over you
I’ll slice you down to your center drag you through the dirt exploit every fear that paralyzes you twist every secret  I will take your mistakes and weaponize them use them against you  when I’m done I will tell you I love you before discarding you forever this is how I love
"A friend recently told me that when I was younger I would walk into a room of acquaintances and co-workers and without a word look at each individual person and smile as if I knew something they didn’t, as if I was assessing just how much damage I could do when I finally spoke."
"It’s somewhat of a myth that narcissists lack empathy. Perhaps true for the lesser of my kind. The empathy I feel is intellectual rather than emotional. I know what’s expected in a given social situation in order to appear human, but any emotional agency is dead at the roots."
let me consume you as tears form in the corner of my eyes
feel no sorrow feel no hate
because I had to
we are already forever
I’m the kindest devil you’ll ever fuck.
I will die alone an army of irreparably damaged lovers in my wake
I’m pure love I’m pure passion I’m pure obsession I’m pure pain I’m pure abandonment I’m pure purgatory I’m pure devaluation I’m pure hell and then disengagement and final discard
"I have a romantic heart and a sense of nostalgia. I’m sentimental, charming, intelligent, witty, and I’m a monster."
I’ve destroyed every lover I’ve ever had and yet they will still love me to the day they die.
I found myself trapped for a moment inside of her beautiful brown eyes that captured the light with such depth and magnificence. I almost lost myself there.
she was down to her last mask and I gently removed it from her beautiful face and all I saw was my own reflection glaring back at me
with you my intent is ‘forever’ you fill the void the emptiness and staunch the bleeding you quell my fury that’s always waiting to strike at some enemy some transgressor you occupy my waking thoughts my dreams and although your love is real you’ll never get too close
engage me
we lose everything
all of her desperate attempts to regain my attention my favor  is negated by my indifference my contempt
I won’t
nice girls who want to be told they are whores and thrown around a bit
a predilection for unavailable women a curse or blessing
the way she presents herself to the world as if on the surface she’s a tranquil sea rippling the light reflected from the solemn afternoon sun but I want to know her storms her dark clouds the impending dread forming on the horizon thunderclaps tempests I want her to churn for me
I noticed your scars the ones just under your skin the ones that hurt you the most I can see it in your far away eyes and in the way your smile cracks when certain topics are broached I want to kiss that hurt
I wanted to be seen I wanted to catch your attention and make sure you knew I noticed
unlike the lesser of my kind I don’t use deception I find it distasteful my pride won’t allow it I will deliver the truth to you wrapped in silk breathed into your ear in dulcet whispers when we are alone in the dark and let you find your own way into the light of hell
‘The girl and the dragon’ by JJcanvass
there must be pain
let it go
the stare rendering by Fullmetal-fox
self awareness a tortured existence being the thing you did not choose to be some say I’m a monster or the devil they lack understanding I create something beautiful permanent exhilarating my lovers are a canvass and those that love me do so forever it defines their eternity
the stare when I see you want you I turn my eyes upon you hold yours with mine you’ll feel as if my gaze penetrates your very center your very thoughts are not safe there’s a melting sensation It’s not a rude leer more of a subtle whisper in the quiet exchange you know I see you
the loss of love isn’t heartbreak for our kind the loss of appliance of control of supply  is only a wound to our ego pain is not something  that can be attributed to those who lack a certain empathy or know love in the traditional sense
get out stay out
the prettiest of subterfuges nestled in the delicacateness of obfuscation
the craving the elation the madness the consumption the adoration the dread the hope the fear the calm the turmoil the deceit the hatred  the love we are such complicated creatures
she was my pretty little hell and I made sure she knew from whence the fires burned
a weaponized form of love
I do what I please rules were made for others yet I know the rules very well and use them against you when it suits me my charm staves off trouble when it comes I have a certain gravitas to my countenance and am always the most intelligent person in the room the most dangerous
"I don’t make love I fuck, hard"
I require kindness my perfect lover is one who feels everything and is in love with wildflowers and the sea one who sees the good in people and desires to change that which they do not understand I cannot be changed  this is my nature I need her pain I need to devour her fear
these thoughts they represent my monstrous side they are the emolument for an exquisite lust for life for pleasure they are the engine that drives your undoing the architect that plans your destruction  for in order to love me there must be pain
you’ll find me irresistible my charm my attentions the way I compliment the small details about you you’ll find me ruggedly handsome people will want to know us we will radiate together drawing people in  like a beacon in the dark for the lesser souls who want to be who we are
I will love you more than anyone has ever done before I will elevate you exalt you lavish you with adoration I will permeate your thoughts your dreams I will ruin you for other men this I promise
her sensational eyes once glowed with the burning embers of love infatuation adoration cultivated from the moment my gaze stoked a desire within her for me only me I have owned her since the first time I peered into her depths I will always own her even when she’s forgotten
when sleep evades and an active mind seeks an empath is in danger
it’s never a game for me it’s a survival strategy
she survived me I’m getting old
if you are an empath you are wise to not make your presence known to me for I will seek you out seduce you deliciously and feast on your love your flesh your mind your kindness I will find your core and gorge on its energy and you will give me all of it willingly eagerly
to trace the small of your belly again rough hands and contours  fingers slipping between silk into the warmth of desire wet with anticipation
good morning lover how I miss coffee with you in the dappled sunlight  in the garden butterflies and daffodils the love behind your brown eyes the warmth of your smile the love in your heart
you will love me even as I consume you as I savor your tender love devouring your everything as you become less you and more compromise to please me when I eventually disappear you’ll see me everywhere behind the words of strangers  you’ll always love me because I am deep inside
what is love to me?
a perverse pleasure watching your feeble resistance what must be cycling through your mind? you don’t trust yourself  your mask is a ragged little thing
get far away stay far away
her moans were worth everything
I’ll feed off of your contempt I’ll dine off of your hatred I’ll wipe spittle from my face and suck its richness clean from my fingertips  the only thing that hurts is indifference but that is beyond your reach isn’t it love I know you well your masks are ragged little things
being self aware is not a cure but it lessens the effects of the malady and yet I still destroy
take forever to mean I will always be in your thoughts as you recycle the memory of my attentiveness  over and over in your mind comparing me to others who seek your love  as you crave the meticulous attentive manner of my touch when I darkened your door this is how I love you
you find me irresistible I walked easily through your open gates strolled through your garden plucked your blooms at will I have no need to tear down your walls  I’m already inside of your bones I’ve infected your darkest dreams and I will own you forever
I’ve lost count  of my despicable deeds the countless injuries and the emotional maiming I’ve collected in tiny glass boxes and placed on display I remember each one each a victim  of a cold calculating lover  whom you find irresistible as you sacrifice yourself for me
respect is an aphrodisiac
the perception of time the power of memory for her it was an eternity for me it was just yesterday
"you would be in error if you assumed I was a demon, I’m a devil. There’s a grande difference."
my power lies in convincing you that you have all the power that you are in control and that will be your undoing
I judge her  but she is only reacting to my ill treatment of her I always fail to see my role in the turmoil I’m always the victim in my mind and she and she is never good  enough and no matter what she does to please me she never will be she can never crest that hill
dine with me forever
gorge yourself upon my largesse my attentive gaze my illusion
she was my dirty little secret a playtoy that grew beyond her role she manifested herself into my core she turned the tables our kind can never win against her kind she got the upper hand and destroyed me completely and I am the worse for it damaged I had to forget her
our bodies exposed against each other  the shared warmth the insatiable desire she pushes hard against my unyielding form begging me to finish her I am the embodiment of discipline  I deny her satisfaction until my choosing I feed on her frustration as I push harder  into her
she shared my appreciation for art and music her mind was alluring despite our age difference she was a classic beauty I remember painstakingly removing her hair pins meticulously unfastening her clasps and buckles the reaction of her skin against my touch my lips my tongue
I fought my true nature to reach across the table and take her like I knew she wanted me to do but I maintained my discipline I sensed her frustration which I would later use against her she fell hard against me when we met again and she never returned to her former self again
"everything about her radiated beauty I was glacial yet she emanated a serene warmth that I found compelling the light, reassuring touch of her delicate fingers the way she held her wine glass the way her eyes avoided my gaze  I stood mesmerized in front of her within her grace"
I love you more than anything but I say when you come back and that time is never
darken my eyes  let your shadow wash over me again let me fuck you back into the abyss
the worst monsters are adept at playing the victim and convincing others and themselves they are innocent
I know you love me I don’t want to destroy you I want you to stay far away get out  stay out
my rage my cruelty your jealously your betrayal our love
I’m here to help
when not here I’m charming have a beautiful smile a contagious laugh  we’ll laugh together I’ll draw you in before you realize you have fallen it will be too late you will be hooked I will be the very air  you breathe you won’t be able to live without me I’ve got you forever
empty and alien love is a means to an end control is the fuel and she gives it willingly and I am always hungry
charming attractive magnetic insatiable I sell the dream of forever while you pay for it with the present and it will cost you dearly
her betrayals were amusing it was her feeble attempt  of trying to maintain control when she knew it all was lost the moment she met me
I’m the monster you’ve been warned
my condition cannot be changed all I can do is be self aware and push you away where I can
there are no masks here
you’ll do anything for me you live to make me happy but I am insatiable and cruel and the more I take the less you become and I always take as your dreams die as you try to fit me into your future which never seems to materialize
I am the end of the night I am what you have been seeking your entire life I am a dream come true  I am what makes you whole I am the kiss that keeps you warm the hands that keep you safe I am your obsession I am the air in which you must breathe You deserve me You deserve love
I am what you can never leave
I am what you must possess
I am the end of all your dreams
I must destroy what I love
her love is a well a bottomless pit to the abyss it consumes everything it is never satiated and won’t easily let you leave from its brink
I sense the yearning the late night regret sleepily reaching for what is not there missing the everything he can never be as I wander free incorporeal among the trees
she felt my danger penetrating deep inside her she gave me all of her to do with as I please I was vigorous in her undoing and I didn’t leave much for the dogs
she was a mirror her light was blinding
to touch her lips again with my fingertips to taste the rain from her forehead to smell her hair  to feel her presence her warmth
her spine was a wall she lay beside me tombstone still in the moonlight I wasn’t the only one in the garden and the train seemed to know everything
I have no use for moths
calling to you from the grave
the sea and the cliff below and that raging storm blowing in
I’m convinced I loved her bones in another life but we are strangers in this one
monstrous  but self aware
wistful little wisps glowing in the darkness luring taunting coveting
I hear the ghosts whispering each wearing the mask she wore their teeth chattering  professing love for me  and demanding my return from my torpor
I had no choice  in loving her I chose her freedom over my vanity
absence does not quell love
I’m a horrific monster I’ve eaten most of her up but I can release what remains and cherish the memory of her love as she grows with another to me this is heaven
she lies broken at my feet I own her dreams and she can never feel whole again without my mending hands
She writes the most magnificent letters in her dreams and I hear them sing through her words.
grey ashen and dark
"a fog has risen like the one that never left my heart when we parted, the spectre of memory etched into my bones"
the madness lingers
Mistakes are costly and only the passing of time can strip away the stringent truth of pain. I should have held her hand more.
"Our kind is no match for their kind, but we love them so. They seduce, we hunt. We gorge ourselves on their love. Our love can never be enough, their emptiness cannot be filled. In the end we must let them go and dream of their distant happiness for that is how we must love them."
unbroken gates looming in the mist a path leads to the eyrie on the crest through an overgrown garden in the fog I wander these dark halls once again brooding the cold of command the shadows present still shades of what once was haunted the forest endings beginnings time
