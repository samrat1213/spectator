Continents of trash of which you've laid your stake
On a mountain of garbage, from your hands it was made
There stands the monolith of inhumanity
An indestructible testimony of a technological society

You alone are your disposal
A lifetime of stains wasting away slowly down the drain

No mercy, no reprisal
No second chance

From junk we have emerged
Slaves willing to serve
Our own damning demands from our own damning hands
De-evolved man

At dawn we rise to an apocalyptic paradise
Where we take our fill
Where life is killed
Where death lays his bones
Where we hang the rope
Where we take our toll
Where we dug our hole

Encroaching byproducts of which disasters are made
On a mountain of garbage, springs a fountain of carnage
There we emerge from the monolith of inhumanity
An indestructible testimony to a doomed society

You alone are your disposal
A lifetime of stains wasting away slowly down the drain

No mercy, no reprisal
No second chance

From junk we have emerged
Slaves willing to serve
Our own damning demands from our own damning hands
De-evolved man
