Like a virus of the mind
My rage will spread
My obsession with murder
Roils in my head

Killing victims with my hands
I cannot control
These extreme compulsions
Burn in my soul

Foaming at the mouth I leap
Onto my prey
Target of my violence
Will die today

Feel the victim's cracking bones
He screams in pain
Only slaughter brings me peace
I have gone insane

Rabid

Inflammation of the brain
Fury overwhelms
There is something wrong with me
I am not well

Victim's head
Thumbs in his eyes
Blood is squirting from the sockets
Pours down the sides

Smash his teeth with my fist
Tear off his nose
Laughing at his shattered face
Rage only grows
With my fingers gouge his throat
Rip slabs of flesh
I continue the assault
But he is clearly dead

Rabid

Can't restrain my need to kill them drives me mad
I'm insane I want to spill blood with my hands

Schizophrenic mania
Paranoid anxiety
Violent ferocity
Criminal insanity

I am obsessed with butchery I am mad
A trail of corpses so much blood on my hands
