Demon Seed LyricsFear the reaper, twisted lies
Fear the reaper you will die
Demon Seed evil feeds
Demon Seed virgin bleeds
We crush jehova's church
Where we hang the priest
Burn the cross blasphemy
Burn the cross jehova bleeds
Demon Seed evil feeds
Demon Seed jehova bleeds
We crush jehova's church
Where we hang the priest
Fear the reaper, twisted lies
Fear the reaper you will die
Demon Seed evil feeds
Demon Seed virgin bleeds
We crush jehova's church
Where we hang the priestEmbed
