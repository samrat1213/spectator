Welcome 2 Detroit Lyrics
Welcome to motherfuckin' Detroit, goddamn it
Wonder Boy, shit
Yeah, yeah, Tricky
Let's show 'em some love!
Welcome to Detroit!

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show us some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good, man, they all say Tricky

Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla "Goon Sqwad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Goon Sqwad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Runyon Ave!" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky?
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk
Fuck that, Blood Blood, I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick Trick, quick, come pick me up
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk ‘cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
‘Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie, come get me
Wonder Boys, what up though, I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah, I see you
All my Detroit people, where you at?
Man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit, motherfuckers, till we die
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show us some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good, man, they all say Tricky

Homie, it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to fifty-four and so I laced the track
This lil' beat that you hear him bangin'? He produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad and gangsta
Been bangin' the underground since ninety-five with bankers
Elected to be the villain and certified as a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous evil deeds of the D? Yeah, that was me
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Those accusations of violence, you know you done heard of that
Just a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
Wonder Boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good, man, they all say Tricky

And yo Em, you ever need one of these weapons, come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie, I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been woopin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see, they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep frontin'
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it being my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so that the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed the winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder boy, Shady
It's goin' down, baby
Ayo Em, I got yo' back, my nigga
Damn right I said "my nigga"
That's my nigga
Tricky
I pull this mothafucka' out right here
Mothafuckas' don't wanna talk out no more
Niggas come out with them nines and shit
When I come back this mothafucka'
And crack them bitch one good time
Niggas don't wanna talk no more, neutral
Hell nah, every time, please believe it
The mothafucka' said it right there
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Welcome to Detroit
Come back soon
Sorry we missed you
