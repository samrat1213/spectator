Swallow these pills and resign, you're living in your fucking reflection.
How can you live in this place so obscene, surrounded by humanity.

Humans shouldn't fucking breathe, they steal my oxygen, humans shouldn't fucking breathe, they steal my oxygen.

Why do they fucking breathe?
Why do they fucking breathe?

This world has been raped by drugs, a place fueled by ignorance, this world is on it's final legs, humans destroy everything.

Why do they breathe, why do they fucking breathe? Why do they breathe, why do they fucking breathe?

I'm disgraced by the shit circling around, like waves of despair they pull each other down.

Humans shouldn't fucking breathe, humans shouldn't fucking breathe.

Why do they fucking breed, why do they fucking breed?

I've circum to despising them all, I'm frothing on my non existence, and I won't be pulled under by shit.

No I will not live amongst you fucking cunts, people are like parasites, worms, infested with disease.

I'm feeding on fuck after fuck. Night after night of incessant displays.

Fuck this place.
