I don't respect your superstition
Parade of ignorance
Crush the innocent
With their skinny, flailing wrists reaching up to the sky
Searching for light
When there is nothing to see you wonder why

Suffer
It means nothing to me
Suffer
You still see what you want to see

A ruthless cleansing has already begun
And it's time to move on
The competition in doubting your ignorance has grown so old on me
With their skinny flailing wrists reaching up to the sky
Searching for the light
When there is nothing to see you wonder why

You wonder why 
So reach higher and higher
And we'll continue to crush
Your brightest lights are out now

Suffer
It means nothing to me
Suffer
You still see what you want to see
