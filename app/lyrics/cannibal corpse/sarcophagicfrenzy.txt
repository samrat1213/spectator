Here they come
No chance of stopping them now
Trudging forward
On a quest - for human flesh
Panic is a catalyst
They crave limbs - to rip and twist
Now soon to be within - their grasp

Run - the chase begins
Terror - they're closing in
Must attempt to refrain from defeat
Done - fallen to the ground
Clawing - disturbing sounds
Can't escape the gnashing of their teeth

Tearing off the outer skin to invade the inside
Sanguinary mastication now the pain is increased
Slashing of the arteries, completely defiled
Bleeding out and soon to rot - carrion feast

They cannot stop the craving for more blood!!! 

Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse

<i>[Solo: Barrett]</i>

Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse

Onward - to feed
Never will the cycle end
Only bones are left behind
Cannot stop this craving for more blood!!!
