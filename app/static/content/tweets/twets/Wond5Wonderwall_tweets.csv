stars and the trees that worship them
to live under the glass sea watching the raindrops fall
the demolition of hearts
your lascivious nature rising as I kneel for a taste
unholy thoughts and night terrors
words are deeply intrinsic feeding the mind and uprooting the soul
I dangle these soft words before your dark star like a prayer
"Much Madness is divinest Sense - To a discerning Eye - Much Sense -  The starkest Madness  ’Tis the Majority In this, as all, prevail - Assent - and you are sane - Demur - you’re straightway Dangerous - And handled with a Chain -  -Emily Dickinson-"
I am a shallow grave of impatience waiting to be filled with the bones of the past
doomed to love all the things that contradict my soul
"we blend into the colors of night as dusk claims me as his own, I am quickly submersed by the scents of honeysuckle and jasmine warming scents of twilight as I become yours within the fields of carnal delights and primal ecstasy"
"you are my mirror reflection; darkness against the light, altered imperfections"
when the most beautiful words never get said but are written on the epitaph of the heart
come dip your quill  into my inkwell
"an orgy of lilac and rose petals mixed with the wild scent of moss, leaves and rain"
wildflowers slick and glistening with dew in the sun's light their buds perky and taut with excitement as the bees and the butterflies suckle and play in a garden of dreamy lust their own private wonderland
"pull me out of the depths of the simple minutiae of words, rescue me from the doldrums that permeate my soul, crush me with the sentient quality of your verse and strip  me down with the language of love"
This.
Cathedral
"she was young, fresh and ripe for the picking; a  blushing bride for her immortal prince, so sweet and ready to be devoured"
altered states and fractured minds
supernatural possession and other rare anomalies
a morbid fear of sleeping and waking up dead
in a world of demigods I choose to worship the martyr
nightmares are just beautiful delusions
my mind is a maze imprisoning my soul that my heart can no longer escape
midnight hysterias and dreams of psychosis
you are the  sunlight  that plays  beneath my skirt; undress me  with your eyes and watch  the petals fall  from my  wildflower lips
tongues tangled fiercely in a whimsy of sinful bliss
crimson kisses staining her collarbone to the tips of her rosy breasts
"words like liquid pearls  of desire that drip  seductively from your lips,  oh how I ache  for their nectar, for the feeding  of my soul"
we are the broken designed to come together as one
"and with the stones they threw at her, she built an empire, vast and unyielding, a force to be reckoned with; a place of savage beauty fit for a queen"
darkened peaks straining against white linen
a slow unraveling
a fallen angel with the smile of a serpent
Rogue Thoughts 🌹
you are just a figment of my imagination; a cross between insanity and a dream
sacraments of the soul
devour me as if I'd be the last meal you would ever partake
anoint me with your lust  for words  make me wet  with anticipation for the waters  of your truth finger my depths with your eternal phrases then press me  into the books of your darkest temptations
mold me like wax in the flames of your desire
hell has no holds on me and I do not fear the earth  covering over what's  left of my muted bones
misanthropic algorithms
"when the day permeates the night, I walk around numb and in a haze; a lost ghost restless to return to a deep sleep hibernating in the woods of a long winter that bring me dreams of cathartic release and a peace that is no longer fulfilled by the light"
A gift for you...
a riot of black roses to mourn the beauty in your midnight eyes
as languid pools  surfaced and  reflected in shades of  moonlight underneath  forbidden stars  his words  were a gentle  reprieve  quenching  my thirst  in a dry land and I am thirsty
"this deep burning within a fever rising for love  a silent smoldering with sparks flying, a fearless tapestry woven in it's complexity telling stories of a life full of fire and final release"
a tumultuous affair with words spoken in the tongues of the poets
No Remorse The Omega Code
"music and words~ a rare marriage of the  minds that is not always a gentle unfolding;  there are oceans and tides;  silent storms of truth  and ecstasy;  lunar moments of light and the talk of stars,  darkness and fear"

Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.  - Pablo Picasso-

you are sweet pandemonium and the essence of my continual frustration such unwavering countenance deserves a reward
"nestled in a bed of briarwood her mind was a gossomer thread frail and weak, weaving tales of darkness and dreaming of never waking up to see the light of another day as the nightmares loomed close by to keep her warm"
The masonry of the human body Sculpted by touch and memory God--like manifestations imbrue Sentient souls so sublime and yet Masterfully reproduced awaiting Exploration and fervent virility Impulses synaptic both sensual And flushed ~a quiet masterpiece

enter these alabaster columns and burn down our desolation
we are just creatures of the night born for primal release
"his deception was warm like fleece; covering her nakedness in rich tones, channeling her thoughts to the unwavering abyss, as she longed for a deep sleep in his arms"
her depth was her prowess dominating his spirit with images of their unholy alliance and at its peak he would get lost in the act of showing her his desire for orgasmic pleasure and as she began stroking his mind with words he came violently exploding at her art of oral expertise
the unbearable weight of his hands on my throat as he takes what belongs to him
on a path to destruction you weave a spell of words designed to capture me and I am your willing vice destined to hear your call I answer with the revelation of knowing that you will either bless me or curse me for this is ultimately my calling
Apeture
to dream in technicolor; a slide show  of peripheral kaleidoscopes

Wise Enough Joker
you've become the bones and marrow of my conception
"time is a virtue for we've become trapped within its hourglass of sands desiring to pick up pieces of a past life in a recollection which no longer exists except in our minds; vast and unwavering we travel onward, the heat of existence bearing down we pause for a breath, clinging"
basking before the sunless sky she is both radiant and forlorn  her body cast under a woodland spell  as the seasons begin to flux and change  the colors drip ceremoniously  for she sleeps within a pool of her own transformation
This.
lost in a thicket of words and a minefield of verse
let's go on an adventure and fuck among the trees
"woo her with words thickened with cypress trees and choking vines, let the nectars of your phrases run down her chin as she greedily licks the ink of their restless adoration from your lips burn her with a tireless devotion as you fill her with the ravages of your unrequited love"
Delusions of Grandeur
"her fruits were sweet and fertile for tasting; its succor fresh and dripping with sin and as she knelt over the alter exposing her  bruised hips, his talons pierced the flesh, taking her by force in a brutal fray of lustful reprise as her moans echoed the halls of the damned"
born under the guise of summer  she is a strange beauty hair adorned with the season  and a heart blooming with desire  a caged bird masquerading  as winsome and wisdom  plucked from the garden of love
the softest fuck exists between flowers

paint me in the colors of storm and sea
I have learned to embrace my own darkness and it knows how to make love to the light

Secret Covenant
"writhing in sweat beneath the moon's light they worship their pagan gods with divine vigor; suckling the teats of the witches, drunk on their sweetness rich with the milk of carnal delights, as they feasted upon the flesh of the virgins"

overpowering my mind manipulating my soul
Daybreak
Victory Two Steps From Hell
scar tissue is the braille of memory
the exquisite cathartic release when we were all once caterpillars awaiting our chance to become butterflies
screaming chasms of chaos
seismic shifts and other mental breakdowns within the collective quantum of souls
her angelic footprints ignite the flames of hell
she was an adoration of red roses and a swoon of petals thick with bleeding hearts
The Score Born for This
each chord a chorus a continual strum across the lapels of his heart thrumming hopeless to unrequited beats leaving his heart in her wake a dark eulogy commences a ceremonial sonata sinuous yet perilous in it's design a righteous revelation of chaos and pleasure
she had magic in her bones and her soul was fucking beautiful
she was  the aftermath; the stunning result  from something that was designed  to destroy her.  she was a  true survivor the purest form of greater things yet to come.
Moon Child
he had a way with the stars; charming them from the heavens   while drawing them into his beautiful night

Solar Firestorm
longing for the velvet of your words to soothe my unquiet mind
"we are born  both animal and  yet ephemeral; a season of words seductively woven and winnowing  betwixt the willow and the vine. hiding amongst  the shadows,   we wait desperately to devour or to be devoured, all in the hopes of becoming the most divine  of interventions."

"and as the walls of her mentality have cracked and fallen into the depths of delusional states, she dreams endlessly walking straight into the abyss of the supernatural existing within this realm of darkness without fear for she holds hands with it fleeing into the night"
dysfunctional catastrophic ends
the utter devastation in her eyes
a deep and perpetual sleep
moongazing the wasteland
shifting the sands of time
shattered from the heart up
primal hearts and primitive dreams
opening the scrolls of heretic gods
supernovas and apocalyptic moons
This.
walking among the shadows I am never alone
the constant violation of self preservation
we coexist only as relics diffused within this realm called chaos
the commingling of heaven and hell
chained to the abyss
"I am rooted, but I flow... -Virginia Woolf-"
"she never asked for this love the kind that wrapped her up in a silk chrysalis of assurance with the comfort of knowing that she truly belonged protected from the fires of this world and as she struggled with this he was always there, afraid she would sprout wings and fly away"
lost to the catacombs; a silent death amongst the living as the waves washed over her easing her desperation for she welcomed the brevity of life like a slow heartbeat it's pulse her predator and she it's beautiful prey
the celestial reign of sovereign gods watching our downfall
fuck your stigma; I have absolute zero tolerance for those who do not have any level of intellectual reasoning to understand that we all suffer at some point in life from some form of depression or mental illness.
This.
taunted by the vestiges of memory and loss
delve into these walls and break my resolve; feel the soft undulating heat of flesh beneath you that satisfies your eager conquest to dominate and hunger for what is next. I need to experience all of your insatiable desires and the eternal wreckage to be yours.
the carnal beauty of your divine sex
the fundamentals of fire and fury
there's no need for remorse for peace comes only when you are dead
a heart full of edible scars
dreams of torment and regret
her brokenness was built on mountains only to shower you with the rubble

I cherish these moments of pleasure and remorse; they dangle before me like marionettes teasing my psyche and stroking my libido
"when reality becomes next level madness, we live in a false world becoming characters in a play designed by the hands of the immortal ones; we drop like stones one by one into the abysmal lake of fire and sacrifice dying with the revelation that we are powerful beyond measure"
"and when he looked dangerously into my eyes I felt the longing, the burning and saw the flames raging within his own eyes as he held my soul captive for his primitive desires cloaked in veils of wonder and innocence for I was to be his Queen doomed to the hells of Hades"

the way his serpentine tongue danced wickedly upon her budding flower
"and as she poured the green voluminous liquid into the glass she lit a cigarette, the smoke rising like ether, a broken halo swirling her head and as she took a sip the hallucinations began to take over slowing down her synapses creating a platform for her muse and creativity"

creating ripple effects in the time continuum was her super power

children of the cosmos
a playlist on soft vinyl and coffee
holograms and dreamscapes
lost in the forest touching your trees
an allegory of truths and virtuous lies
infinite wisdom exits where there is no humanity
a cacophony of birds and the scent of wormwood
setting fire to the pages that are you
her soul; a sweet perfume
fuck me in your flower bed
her purity inspired his dark fantasies
a fleshly sacrifice to urban gods
a weaving of dead flowers and thorns
burning temptations between the folds of your demise
fallen angels with broken wings
torn pages from sacred books
remnants of desire and the fomenting of lust
a delicate trestle of broken hearts
Besotted
her mouth soft and blooming like a red red rose
eyes like a forest fire
autumn and her desire to burn and give life
we are stars wrapped in darkness
waiting for you to break my fall
"petals floated upon the water serenely caressing the waves never leaving the shore, each one a reminder of her pain and loss as she drowned in an aphyxiation of a love that was foreign to her; a beautiful shade of dark now covers her fragile blooming heart like a faithless prayer"
the melancholy of the forest leaves
Twisted Wonderland.
she was his sanctuary and he was her dark religion
he kissed her rosary as he grasped the beads tightly around her neck as he entered her upon the alter of the old abandoned church the only place he could truly worship her sinful flesh as she prayed to be filled to the brim with absolution and mercy
i ache to undress your words and make love to your poetry
your dark beauty  has become my obssession as i quietly bestow this night with the fragrance of you
utopian lives existing in dystopian worlds
darning the moon into your sunset eyes
she was a healer with dirty hands and a heart of clay whispering haunting prayers and chanting mantras into the  darkness of the deep waters seeking healing for herself
break me in the most beautiful ways and watch the flowers grow

When you're straight but high as fuck and think: yeah I'd hit that
the smell of old books and abandoned libraries is my kink
and as I wait for you in the dark I already sense your presence overshadowing me longing to penetrate my light
the deep euphoric muse of something catastrophic
even books get lonely for the flowers they bruise
fuck your inhibitions; I want to be your most unbridled fixation
there is so much clarity when one is losing their mind; everything you do makes you invincible
when madness becomes a work of art and a next level high
and the fall was dark and deep full of magic and riddles rich with the possibility of insanity for only the crazy ones have learned to survive well by swimming in the depths of despair despite the cruelties of life permeating the walls of an already broken mind
This.
dark memories fractured her heart in a million ways that even the night could not escape it
she was a garden of thorns in a field of roses
"she was a wolf in sheep's clothing a little nymph playing of the woods her howling resonating along the forest floor for the trees worshipped the moon here surrounded by creeping ivy and the heavy scent of moss, warm jasmine and petrichor"
the way his eyes held her gaze with her heart in his hand
she was an angel that played well with his demons
Dark Beauty
he offered her his hand in a dance of intimacy; their fingers dancing in foreplay and a ritual of love.
"and as the shadows softly cupped her breasts and caressed the velvet of her womanhood, she was a beautiful reminder that light can exist wrapped within the moon's teasing gaze despite the darkest night."
"she often cried in silence; her silent heart weeping with tears that appeared as stained glass where others could never see and even though the sun would always rise up to greet her, the moon had a way of gaining her trust, a confidante within the hour of shadows."
her scars were like braille telling the story of the battles she's won
she was an ocean existing in a drop of rain; a world where others met to discuss the water while drowning in the shallows
she was a rose trapped beneath the embankments of his soul blooming chaotically as her essence permeated the night air like an apparition in heat
the memory of him haunted my heart like an old cemetery overgrown with moonlight and fireflies
deflower me
you are the forest fire that sets the ruins of my soul aflame
kiss me. I wanna taste the war on your lips.
to fall sleep is the closest thing to death so dying in your arms would be the closest thing to love
Fallen Angel
flowers bloom the prettiest through the cracks of your heart
touch me in the places where wildflowers grow
lost in the forest
her mind was a storm and a riddle of muse always ready to come undone
I am a word voyeur and love to fuck with people's minds
when he fucks me to see just how deep the rabbit hole goes
corruption feeds my temptation;  it seeks to devour what's left of my heart and I am left to wonder if I am even worth saving
I am drawn to your darkness but my demons are darker and hold on to me much tighter when making love
rescue me from this abyss; from the darkest epochs of the universe so that I can love the fucking stars out of you
on my hands and knees dirty and praying to be filled with your  wilderness
I covet your heart as my own for there is no greater worship than to share our love for self destruction
she never feared the dark for it was the light that cast it's spell upon her vulnerable heart illuminating her chaos
she never needed a savior she needed a warrior to take her to heaven and to fight for her like hell
