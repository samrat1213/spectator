One time, the ICP with this shit
For you and your boys to say "fuck yeah" to
Yo, G, kick some of that shit about the wizard and all that
Drop a psycho beat and go on and rap, bald-headed fuck

Aw shit, homeboy, you should of seen me
I was flipped at the party drinking a fifth of MD
Straight passed-out on his mother's bed
With seven cans of brew going through my head
Dreaming, I was sipping on Faygo
With my dope posse, hear comes a tornado
Huh, I can't run no where
Cause the whole damn house was spinning through the air (damn!)
And don't laugh just yet
And it bland my motherfucking eyes bet
And here comes a three and a half foot pimp
With a blue zoo suit and a mack daddy limp
Yo, I gotta grip on my weapon
Cuz this midget motherfucker and his boys are stepping
"Oh my, look at the witch
You crushed and killed that wicked old bitch"
And they saying that I'm doomed
Cuz I killed some ho that rides on a broom
Fuck this, I'm going back to where I stay
And I walking down the yellow brick alleyway

<i>[Interlude (contains samples from "Wizard of Oz" and "Ghetto Zone")]</i>

Well, go on motherfucker!

Now I'm roaming just like basshead
Everybody know just where the alley led
And don't say you don't know
Which way to go, yo, there go the scarecrow
I ain't playing this bullshit no more
So I whip out the nickel plated double-four
Best tell my ass how to get back
Or I'll blow the straw out your fucking head
You wanna see the wizard?
Fuck yeah, I do
Get me off this pole and I'll come with you
You know the wiz
Yeah, its the road for him
Then he gave me on a 'gene
Now I gotta bullet for him
So me and the crow was walking on bricks
Spitting and cussing and holding our dicks
Thinking, damn, this ain't how the movie goes
I ain't seen one motherfucking rainbow
Ain't a fresh pair of kicks in the land
Just what you thought, there go the tin man
How to get to the wizard?
What the fuck
I ain't saying shit until you oil me up
I don't see any motherfucking oil, bro
Oil me up with a forty of Red Bull
Huh, just like the book said
Tin Man was stumbling like a crackhead
Old-ass rusted out metal
But we was on our way to see the wizard of the ghetto

"Somewhere over the rainbow"
(Shut the) fuck up, bitch
<i>[GUNSHOTS]</i>
Damn, this ain't Kansas, ho
This is the southwest motherfucking ghetto zone, bitch
So pick your skank ass up
And you and Toto get the fuck on

Yeah, we've come a long way
Drop the motherfuckers all the way to Del Ray
And I'm a wonder land story book tourist
Gripping that .44 we coming up to the forest
Anything could be out there
Lions, tigers, maybe a bear
Hoods and hoodlums and thieves, oh my 
I'm a kick somebody in they fuckin' eye
Don't fuck with me at a time like this
I'll send out a bullet guaranteed won't miss
So I just move and the hooks are flying
You've come and buck with the fucking lion
I want rings, chains, any kind of gold
Or what?
Or I'm a let this nine unfold
Man, fuck this, come back to Del Ray
There you can rob motherfuckers any day
Crackheads, hoes, whatever you can name
Catch all the rich ones coming out the ball game (yeah)
So finally we was at the castle
And with the guards, we got no hastle
They all just got the fuck out our way
I guess even in Oz they know of Violent J

<i>[Interlude]</i>

Yo, where's the motherfucking wizard stay
Who wants to know? Violent-psychopath-J
I wanna word with him at gun point
Cuz there's no place like Detroit

Welcome to the wizards kingdom
The Wizard of the Ghetto as its said
Welcome to the wizards kingdom
Sorry, motherfucker, this is where you'll stay
Scarecrow, you ain't shit to me
And the lion ain't shit but a snack for three
Tin Man, don't take me for a sucker
I'll chew your ass up and spit bullets out, motherfucker

We let it rain,
Seventy-nine slugs to his fucking brain
Then I stepped back cool and calm
Cuz the Tin Man was dropping cluster bombs
Everybody know about car jacking
So me and the fellas went home macking
Jumped in a smooth-ass ride
Drop top Geo says "Wiz" on the side
Gripped it back to the hood where we came from
And that shit was fun
Next thing I knew I was back at the party
Got up and was finning to tell everybody
But I just let it pass
Cuz I know they'll laugh at my drunk ass
