Incineration from within while the mind decays, body taken over by 
microscopic fiend, control belongs to me, I am your master, I am your 
god, this earth bows to me, 
the desire to kill and control, another planet mine, total conquest, 
empire built upon oppressing domination, this is the only way, an age 
of torment must begin, all are human and all are same and all must pay, 
grotesque visions of future, too powerful to cease control, with 
loathsome force I strike you down, there can be no rebellion, 
none will survive these ravaging times with infestation imminent, 
mechanical drills from within puncturing the feeble shrieking 
humans, frontal cortex bursts spilling the contents of the mind, 
spreading the programmed infestation, automated pestilence, the human 
minds erode away as all become unthinking, my final abhorrent dream 
realized, to create a mindless human army 7 billion strong, 
void of all thought, empty minds worship me, no cognition, they do as 
I say 
Incineration from within while the mind decays, body taken over by 
microscopic fiend, control belongs to me, I am your master, I am your 
god, this earth bows to me
