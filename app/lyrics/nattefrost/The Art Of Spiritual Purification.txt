The Art Of Spiritual Purification LyricsGutted by the claws of holy
Approached by Jesus Christ
Sworn to an Oath of Evil
Forever in his (Satanic) Powers
Deny the light of bliss
You, Nemesis of God
Vultures of the holy carcass
Together we unite for this bestial feast
See through the eyes of Blasphemy
Invert the sacred cross
Burn the house of hypocrisy
With the flames of Hellish Devilry
A gate made of Skulls
Thousand Christian Skulls
Shaped by the fires of Hell !!
Under his Imperial Throne - Satan !!!!
Fire, Blood, Honour, Death....
The coldest soul, the blackest heart
Servant of Satan, Soldier of Hell
Fire, Blood, Honour, Death - Death !!!!!
Enlightened by the sights of Evil
Reaching for his horns
Praise the name of Satan
Raising Hell - Hell !!!!!
Deny the night of bliss
You, Nemesis of God
Vultures of the holy carcass
Together we unite for this bestial feast
("A dark Satanic Hellride for the enemies of God")Embed
