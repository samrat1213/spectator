Systematic in our ways of attack
Deviant by nature this is our habitat
Once you've entered there's no chance of escape
Next thing you know cold steel in your face
Your predetermined fate is in our hands
Deliverance of pain upon the stroke of our knives
Predatory impulses controlling our minds
You make a sound we'll end your fucking life

Gripping you right by the throat no chance to run - Horror unfolds
Ripping apart the souls of the ones we hunt - The slashers code
Extremely rapacious - Insatiable bloodlust
We'll kill anyone who comes at us

Jagged are the knives we wield
You know you're gonna lose this fight
Your hands a useless shield
Blood is gonna spray tonight
Provided by our steel
Accept the violence

Gripping you right by the throat no chance to run
Ripping apart the souls of the ones we hunt

Jagged are the knives we wield
You know you're gonna lose this fight
Your hands a useless shield
Blood is gonna spray tonight
Provided by our steel
Accept the violence
