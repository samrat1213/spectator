Hatework LyricsHatework
Bringer of doom
Hatework
What I have in store
What has the devil got to do with it
I'm brewing my toil
So the brimstone comes this way
Nightwork
My life's work
Nightwork
World in flames
This calls for fire
This is a call for ruin
We will be departed
Leave the rot so lonely
Hatework
Bringer of doom
Hatework
And the turmoil comes
Hatework
My work
Hatework
And the earth's left burning
I call death
Death is answering meEmbed
