Destroyers in nature
It's just the fabric of us, our mistakes -- feeble-minded
Moderate -- to severe - idiocy
The "most intelligent" creatures on the planet
An advanced civilization, which says nothing at all...
Humans
Like US.
We, the people
We, the morons
Apparently non-educable idiots

We are horrible people

This is a fire
This is the gasoline
Insects attract to the flame
And turn to pitch all the same...

Our presence here -- threatening
Habitats de-evolve -- a mutant parody
Our hands are hammers -- the earthen anvil
All life in between -- disinterred and destroyed

You looked into the eyes of the beast
You extended your hand -- in trust
It so graciously accepted the fate
There's no honor in betrayal
O the savages, the ravagers of the pleading, standing there bleeding
Tears of the innocent - turned into mammalian dissidents

We the people -- we the terrible

The war has been waged
Us vs. them vs. life vs. cage
Inherently exiled from a life on an earth abundant with prosperity
O the hearts of men, their blood so thin with original sin
Tears of the innocent - turned into mammalian dissidents

Our presence here -- threatening
Habitats de-evolve -- a mutant parody
Our hands are hammers -- the earthen anvil
All life in between -- disinterred and destroyed

Destroyers in nature
It's just the fabric of us, our mistakes -- feeble-minded

Moderate -- to severe - idiocy
The "most intelligent" creatures on the planet
An advanced civilization, which says nothing at all...
Humans
Like US.
We, the people
We, the morons
No single inferior race
We're all apparently idiots

We, the people, are horrible
