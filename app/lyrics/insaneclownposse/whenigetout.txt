"Comaley, get up. Let's go." 
"What?" 
"Well, it's your lucky day today, pal. You're free." 
"Uh, what do you mean?" 
"Yup, that's right you been pardoned. So come on get your shit 
Let's go." 
"What are you talking about, I don't understand?" 
"Yup, governor's pardoned you. Now come on, let's get the fuck 
out of here." 
"Uh, uh, I'm free. Are you serious!?" 
"Fuck no, you got for more years, stupid ass. Hahahaha. Every 
fuckin day, you fall for it. Fuckin stupid ass." 

Wicked clown! 

When I get out, I'm going home to southwest 
Going straight to my freaks and get undressed 
And I'm a hit it like an insane chicken hawk 
Hoochie, won't be able to walk 

When I get out, I'm a run around town naked 
Cuz my freedom feels good, I can't fake it 
I let my nuts flop to the hip-hop 
I wanna chop chop punk cop flip flop 

When I get out, I'm going to my mother's house 
She gonna cook a steak and serve it with brussel sprouts 
But I don't care, she can cook a cinder block 
And I'm a chew it on up to the last rock 

When I get out, I'm putting on my new shoes 
But I don't see anybody sportin kangaroos 
And them wizaby shorts are history 
But so what, I'm a sport mine like a G 

Wicked clowns! Check it out y'all 
Wicked clowns! We gettin out y'all 
Wicked clowns! Check it out y'all 
Wicked clowns! We gettin out 

When I get out, I'm going to the festivals 
Cussing, rude, and scratching my testicles 
Like we did before we got locked down 
I'm coming back around, the wicked clown 

When I get out, I'm a throw a party 
And guess who shows up, nobody! 
I just sit alone and play solitaire 
I don't care, at least I won't be here 

When I get out, I'm coming back to Del Ray 
So I can breathe the smog but that's okay 
Cuz I'd much rather whif that shit 
Then my cellmate Rico's funky armpits 

When I get out, I'm heading straight to the store 
For a big long cold thing of Faygo 
And I'm a drink it down to the very end 
After that, I eat the bottle that it came in 

Wicked clowns! Check it out y'all 
Wicked clowns! We gettin out y'all 
Wicked clowns! Check it out y'all 
Wicked clowns! We gettin out 

"Yeah, let me call this broad up, tell her I'm getting out. 
This is my baby, ya know what I'm saying." 
"What's up, baby, man, it's me." 
"Wait a minute." 
"J?" 
"Who the hell is this? WHO THE HELL IS THIS?!" 

When I get out, I'm shooting someone in the head 
Somebody been sleeping in my bed 
I never thought my sweetheart would sell me out 
Now I gotta walk up and blow her mouth out 

Wicked clown 
Wicked wicked clown 

When I get out, I'm back to the good life 
So don't sweat me, Officer Barney Fife 
In the pen, I seen your cop friend butt son 
Seen daddy like to use his butt some 

When I get out, it's all about the underground 
I'll crawl back into the pipes and never be found 
So when you brush your teeth 
You might see my eyeball looking at you through the sink 

Wicked clowns! Check it out y'all 
Wicked clowns! We gettin out y'all 
Wicked clowns! Check it out y'all 
Wicked clowns! We gettin out 

I'm getting out, I'm getting out! 

Guess who's coming to your big town 
Jugglin jugglers jugglin jugglers (kiss the clown)
