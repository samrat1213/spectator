The stars know the language of silence.
The darkness and the stars.
Little things almost lifeless.
I deserve it! ‚ù§
"I count the days, hours, minutes, seconds without you."
And speaking of saudade...  #ThrowbackThursday
When I grow up I want to be like you.

Liquid love.
I smell the rain coming from far away.
"I woke up slowly, hugged the pillow like someone hugging memories."
Mood.
"Against laziness, coffee."
Level of laziness.      Wash my hair for me.
I can't contain my smile when I see you.
( Goodnight )
"Perhaps some questions are just questions, they will never be answered."
I'm going home...  I never come home.
Please and thank you.

Love is not a thing to hide.
LoFi.
Life was made to live.
And in the end the night is always empty.
Until the moon hides.
I like the sky and I like to think that it is the place that I will live one day.
Waiting for the first star in the sky.
Existential laziness.
Hi friday!üç∏
A Collor.
The conversations I only had with you.
Se eu n√£o te amasse tanto assim Talvez perdesse os sonhos Dentro de mim üé∂
My curiosity has its peculiarities.
"Dramatic rain, I like the rays."
My sin is to love you.
Hostage of translation.
The negation of the senses.
The moon.
Swallowing wishes.
"Sometimes pain is necessary, today's leg training will not let me forget that."
"Every time my heart became restless, every time it seemed to come out of my chest, that my hands were shaking, so I knew he would never go back to what he was."
"I look at the sky, I think of you."
Get all the words out of me.
"Heart tested at different levels, it resists."
"When someone calls you ""love"", when you have no other name for that person.  ‚ù§"
All for your smile.
Sometimes i wonder if it hurts you like it hurts me.
It's sad to be just a stranger to someone who knows you well.
You'd take all my sorrow away.
Hi Sun.

Where do you run when it hurts beyond your strength?
Maybe all I need is an apocalyptic day.
A playlist made to cry.
Then you came along and made me laugh...
ü•∞üòç
A coffee to start.
A little sweat and tear will not kill anyone.    Me to myself.
""" I am at peace and happy for you, with my heart grateful to God for all that He is doing and will do in your life. """

Awakening all the senses slowly.
"Speaking of songs and our old stories, father and brother making me laugh and sing.  #myreferences"
A tattoo about the secrets of the Moon and the Sea.
Bom dia ‚òÄÔ∏è
The moon whispered secrets that only the sea knew.
God knows how it hurts.
A tear called saudade.

The fine line between sincerity and cruelty.
"The soul smiles when it finds the way, and the past will soon be dust."
Easy and without resistance.
I just wanted to erase all your words that are still in me.
"I can't sleep, torture."
You've always been important to me.
"Intuition, whispers of angels."
Walk in the dark and still know where my feet are.
"There is time to plant, there is time to harvest, an exercise in patience and faith."
Little rainbow birds.
And I wanted to go home.
Time to wake up.
"Real feelings do not disappear like magic, it takes time, it takes pain, it is unlearning to love, it is having to forget and remember unintentionally, it is waking up with the scare of absence.  Slow but obviously necessary process."
It is what it is.
In a few days and she won't be the same.
For every word a tear.
Whistling ...
I want to stay in bed and dream again.
"Your hands in my hands in a dream, again."
Morning rituals.
"Eu achei que era o caf√© que me mantinha acordada, n√£o era."
"I miss our random conversations, which said nothing and at the same time said so much."

Coffee time.
My body is a temple of senses waiting for your touch.
"Dancing under the sun, the sweet ardor of loving."
Hello Sun.
I begged.
Find me among the shadows of the garden.
All ways to escape.
If the soul smiles saying Sim it is not a sin.
"If you don't use imaginary drumsticks while driving listening to this song, you're doing it wrong."
Feelings that do not remain silent.
Daydreams and cold coffee.
I love every memory of loving you.
"The limit of my heart, just testing."
"Eyes closed, a prayer on the lips."
Side symptoms.
Cold hands speak more than words.
Nothing on me will be erased.
Mesmo quando tudo pede Um pouco mais de calma At√© quando o corpo pede Um pouco mais de alma A vida n√£o para.
Colorful stained glass without sun.
I've always missed you.
"Ainda que eu falasse as l√≠nguas dos homens e dos anjos, e n√£o tivesse amor, seria como o metal que soa ou como o sino que tine.  1 Cor√≠ntios 13:1"
I wonder when I will actually live.
Time to time.
An imaginary sunset.
I was just going to say that I love you.
Goodnight.
And then everything looks colorless.
"When I love more than words can translate, I love with the silence of prayer."
A whole day of rain and slow steps.
I believe in angels...
