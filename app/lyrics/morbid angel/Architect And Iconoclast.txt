Architect and Iconoclast LyricsWith swipe of hand release disease
Exonerate their thoughts of gods
At odds with what they see
With slam of fist to flesh of earth
Discharge your breath of
Molten poison, scorch their lungs
I am all prophecies fulfilled
Yet you refuse too see this
You mock my name, have you forgotten?
I am the truths that were lost, taught
As myths and buried in earth
The soil won't hide the warning signs
My art, to bring demise
My skill, it is necessity
My will, exists through time
It's my rite, to rid this world of life
My presence means demise
I relinquish kings of power
My course to disassemble life
To embellish while you cower
I am proof that all denied, was scripted
For all to know this
Thus all who closed their eyes
Will pray now to have witnessed this
With abandon, they have tarnished
In ignorance they devour
Consumed by the lust of owning all
Their slavery, their bliss
They are repulsed by the gifts we have given
They cannot hold them in their hands
These fools have felt unsettled
Shall stay and watch it as it burns
I am the architect
It is my design to betroth this earth
You called my name
Have you forgotten?
I am the builder of all loss
I am the keeper at all cost
The soil, the air, are my creations
And I shall watch them burn
I am the architect
I am the un existence
You know my name!
You have not forgotten!
I am creator of this world
I am the keeper of the soil
The soil won't hide
The warning signs
I am all prophecies fulfilled
Yet you refuse to see this
You mock my name
I have not forgotten!
I am the truths that were lost
Taught as myths and buried in earth
The soil, the air, are my creationsEmbed
