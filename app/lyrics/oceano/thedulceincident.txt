The penetration of barren land
Through rock and soil
An objective must be fulfilled

Construction under the surface (surface)
With an undisclosed purpose

(Digging down)
Digging down as signs of pressure build
The threshold weakens and begins to fail
A nauseating stench omits from the bowels of the earth
As gaseous fumes erupt

Beneath the structure; implodes
An ancient underworld exposed
But something dwells at these depths

Sensing a presence inside this dismal confines
Beyond the darkness and dust
Elusive figures arise revealing the face of humanoid life forms
A kind colonized and hidden below
A massive horde, they approach

Shots fire in panic
Shots fire in panic
A massacre ensues

Unfazed by gunfire a sacred power is exhumed
Every target subjected to amputations and gaping burn wounds
Casualties outweigh the rescued
A conflict buried with time and each body in its tomb
