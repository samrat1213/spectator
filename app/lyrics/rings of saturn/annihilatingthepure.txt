Decapitate 
Feast on your flesh 
Now feel my blade, you are no longer whole, ripped apart you are no 
longer whole 
You took your life for granted, now I'll take it away, mutilate 
Tearing away at will, I separate skin from bone 
But I will not end this because you've fucked me over one too many 
times 
Spilling your blood at my leisure fuck you, pissing over what is left 
of your corpse 
I lacerate your flesh, fuck 
bodily fluids flow freely as I rip cut and tear, repetition of 
killing, genocide of the human race, my final mutation has come, you 
face the darkness, annihilating the pure to dominate again 
take back this ancient planet, this land belongs to me 
Your earth, a desolate shadow of it's former state 
Fallen human filth I will show no mercy 
planet fucked 
A hole in space, embryonic waste
