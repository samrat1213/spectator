Praise the Strength LyricsRemnants, From the ash arise the allegiance
Martyr's unforgotten lives, immortal
Heretics, gods of the Dawning time... Vindictive
Praise this source of strength
Seize this time and heed
Embrace the strength and heed
The fallen behind me
Tyrants, stand before the task, Impeding
Mortals, In the wake of Gods, Beneath Kings
Tyranny, Fall away in shards, Demise
Leaches, Clinging to their shite, Die Blindly
Praise this Source of Strength
Seize this time and Heed
Embrace the Strength and Heed
The Fallen behind me
A way forsaking, Waste, Unhuman
Infected reason, infected being
A new time Dawning, Our time Beginning
The Reign of Leaches, it now ends...
Praise the Strength and Praise the Being
Sing these Words and Dance to Victory
Praise the Force that None can Conquer
Embrace the Strength, the Sacred Power
Praise the Strength and the Dawn Of Reckoning
See the Wrath Fall on those who Oppose This
Be One in Voice and Chant the Mantra
Feel the Force and Know Gods beyond Man
Praise the Strength, and Praise the Dawning
Embrace the Wake that Flows behind this
Grasp the Light of the New Reign Rising
Stand with Kings, Fight Undying...
Praise the Strength, And Praise the being
Sing these Words and Dance to Victory
Praise the Force that None can Conquer
Embrace the Strength
Remnants, From the ash arise the allegiance
Martyr's unforgotten lives, immortal
Tyrants, stand before the task, Impeding
Mortals, In the wake of Gods, Beneath Kings
Praise this Source of Strength
Seize this time and Heed
Embrace the Strength and Heed
The Fallen behind meEmbed
