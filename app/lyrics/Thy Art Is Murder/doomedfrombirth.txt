Doomed from birth
Bred weak to harbour disease
Their minds all drowned forced to believe
Tormented by their endless despair
Brainwashed a race forever unaware
Doomed from birth

Dis-evolved failures
Genetically obsolete
From the mouths of leaders poisonous words excrete
False hope between pages of fallacy
Controlled by their fear and blind belief

The silence of their death
Their only true virtue

Alone you stand
In life as in death
Forgotten beyond the grave
Alone you fall
In life as in death
There is nothing beyond this life
Suppress the truth of vile decay
Held together with icons of false idols in disarray

Dis-evolved failures
Genetically obsolete
From the mouths of leaders poisonous words excrete
False hope between pages of fallacy
Controlled by their fear and blind belief

Tear apart the scriptures
That enslave your world
End the cycle of misery
A history of lies unfurled

Alone you stand
In life as in death
Forgotten beyond the grave
Alone you fall
In life as in death
There is nothing beyond this life

Forgotten beyond the grave
Alone you fall
In life as in death
There is nothing

There is nothing
