Tank treads crushing over piles of broken bones
Siege engine revving and coming to atone
Poisonous black smoke billows from it's eyes
Unholy war machine can't be compromised
Fueled by the corpses feted fleshed
Never turning back, forward to the death
Its only mission is killing everything
It's the shovel-headed kill machine

Here to sarifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Kneel and die before the
Shovel-headed kill machine

So inhuman you don't speak it's name
It's artillery sets the world aflame
Mechanical demon rolling 'cross the sand
Blood-stained thing scorching black the holy land
Skin made of iron heart, made of steel
Lubricated by the blood beneath it's wheels
Reclaiming the world for its king
It's the shovel-headed kill machine

Here to sacrifice
Infernal hate device
Satan's go between
Knee and die before the
Shovel-headed kill machine
Shovel-headed kill machine
