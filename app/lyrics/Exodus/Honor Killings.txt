Culture of honor, culture of shame
Imprisoned by the burqa
Her innocence to blame

Sharia law and the almighty Allah
Rule with the whip in hand
Divine decree alliance against women
Throughout the holy land

[Bridge:]
Buried alive, burned, mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated
Beg for mercy with no avail
Muslim teachings must prevail

[Chorus:]
Judge and jury
With zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

Father slays daughter, a husband his wife
A mother is killed by her son
Cut from the womb, bastard infant is strangled
A page from the holy Quran
Honor killers, moral vigilantes
Wipe away the stain of shame
To protect the family honor
And restore the family name

[Bridge:]
Buried alive, burned, mutilated
Dragged through the streets
Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated
Beg for mercy with no avail
Muslim teachings must prevail

[Chorus]
Judge and jury
With zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation

(Heed, obey) Get on your knees and pray
(Heed, obey) Five times a day
(Heed, obey) Get on your knees and pray
(Heed, obey) Five times a day

We put thee on the path, so follow it
And follow not the whims of those who know not
(Heed, obey) Get on your knees and pray
(Heed, obey) A tortured body on display

Segregation discrimination
Female genital mutilation
Subordination banned from education
Actions and sayings of the first three generations

Forced into marriage against her own will
Dowry and bride price to seal the deal
Left to rot in solitude
Suicide the only substitute

Buried alive burned mutilated
Dragged through the streets, decapitated
Beaten tortured ostracized
Accused of being westernized

[Chorus]
Judge and jury
With zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nation
Judge and jury
With zero degree of moral culpability
Death by lapidation
The law of Islam nationEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
