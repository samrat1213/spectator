Back in 'Nam he killed a man
A shovel was used to cut his head off
Now forever changed lust to decapitate
Chop at the neck to keep the skull intact

Going insane
Come back deranged

He buries his victims
Only the heads exposed
The screams don't bother him
But he likes to make them stop

Eyes wide open
As they see the shovel
Coming at them slowly
Blood spurts through the air
Head detaches from the body
The eyes can still see
But the brain starts to die rapidly

Back in 'Nam he killed a man
Many more would die
Shovels used to cut their heads off
Now forever changed lust to decapitate
Chop at the neck to keep the skull intact

Going insane
Come back deranged

The open neck holes fester
Ravaged by the vultures
Bodies for the insects
And the skulls are for the collection
Brains and eyes are eaten
Gnaw the skin though rotten
Only bones will remain
But the skulls are for the collection

Killings confirmed by the hundreds
Were carried out after the war in due time
Killings confirmed by the thousands
Were carried out after the war with his mind

Heads shoveled off
Heads shoveled off
Heads shoveled off
Heads shoveled off
