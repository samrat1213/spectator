Primitive Death LyricsPills, poison, semen, snot
Blood, vomit, fire, snuffer - SATAN - Torture!!!!!!!!
Primitive death
My self destruction, my self abuse
I bleed for satan, I live in sin!!
Primitive death!!!!!!
Alcohol, drugs, abuse, disease
Chaos, cunt, goat, worship!!
Primitive death!!!!! 
Razors and steak knives, I want to kill!!!
I hate all humans, I need to kill!!!!!
Life is disgusting, hating all life...
Once again I mock God's name
And remind you all of Hell
Killing everything, killing myself
Life is bliss when playing God
Revenge - death - Satan - Triumph!!
Pills, poison, semen, snot
Blood, vomit, fire, snuffer - SATAN - Torture!!!!!!!!
Primitive death!!!!!!!!
My self destruction, my self abuse
I bleed for satan, I live in sin!!
Alcohol, drugs, abuse, disease (Mushroom)
Chaos, cunt, goat, worship!!
Primitive death!!
Razors and steak knives, I want to kill!!!
I hate all humans, I need to kill!!!!!
