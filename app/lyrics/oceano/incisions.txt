Plagued with morbid visions of pain to inflict upon you,
I'm resurrected to hate.
Holding true to the nature of a killer,
Tasting weakness, exposing blood, digging deeper into your neck.
Exposing blood and digging deeper!
Manifested in me,
Forcing veins to cold,
Embracing malicious thoughts,
Contemplated murdering her,
Your hate's manifested in me!
Empoweing the advantage of lacking sympathy,
Shown through further exposing my wounds.
Let's start carving incisions where it counts.
First, you must be strangled, trampled upon,
Fuck compassion I'm coming straight for your throat!
Filled with morbid visions of pain to inflict upon you,
I'm resurrected to hate!
Spewing wasted words,
Will they remain so plentiful once life flows away?
I've lost sense of humanity
Now there can only be violence, violence, violence!

Manifested in me.
Your hate's manifested in me.
