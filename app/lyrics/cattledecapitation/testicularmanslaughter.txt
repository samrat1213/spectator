Perpetual multiplier
Procreating bastard
Ever had your gonads smashed by a ball-peen hammer?
Ever been forced into a vasectomy by and axe-wielding homovore?
Do you know the word pain?
You will when the mallet falls
Again and again and again and again:
I've a shotgun aimed at your testicles
To shred your testes and sever adjacent vesicles
Cold vengeance on a rapist
Immediate testicular shape-shift
Your manhood disintegrates and the stream starts to flood
A shimmering mix of spermatozoa and blood

Another human off the face of the earth!
A new vagina to replace it's absence of girth
It rubs the feces on it's skin
Or else it gets the hammer again:

Torture
Through blunt castration
Slaughter
Repeated testicular emaciation

For your gross misconduct
The tables are rightfully turned
The urethra now a bile duct
The frayed ends of karma are burned
A gaping gash of reproduction
Seminal waste of testosterone that ceases to function
Asexual freak . No longer of the male persuasion
Your miserable heap of disfigurementation
Brings thousands of victims vengeance and elation

Sulfur and buckshot , decimating your crotch
