Rebel Lands Lyrics
War
Kills on the land
Blood
Saturates

This hallowed ground
To which my fathers fell
Rebel souls
Buried deep beneath
This hallowed ground
Land of my ancestry
Drink the blood
Rebel lands rise again

War-death lingering
Blood rivers flow
In sacrifice

Unholy war
Implored from below
No peace as
Rebel lands rise
Quaking below my feet
Mortals shall suffer defeat
Forgotten evils below
Rejoice as the blood flowsEmbed
