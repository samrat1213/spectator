My kind of bitch ain't like your bitch 
Cuz my bitch don't bitch at all 
My bitch don't blink, she don't even think 
About money or fuckin mall 

My kind of bitch don't fix her hair 
She don't care about what she wears 
Cuz she's much too busy pulling the worms 
Out her butt, she ain't bathed in years 

My kind of bitch, I'll never forget 
We forced met on a Oujia board 
Miss Crabber Damned, she would chew on snakes 
And swallow a ninja sword 

I said, "hey bitch, how do you do? 
Some fucks call me Violent J" 
She picked her nose and flicked it at me 
Smiled and was on her way, my kind of bitch 

My kind of bitch 
My kind of bitch don't fix her hair 
She don't care about what she wears 
My kind of bitch don't fix her hair 
She don't care about what she wears 
Fuck that! 

My kind of bitch has a hole in her neck 
And has to talk like this "I love you" 
She can drink through it, ya get used to it 
It whistle every time we kiss 

My kind of bitch gots one good tittie 
The other one's skinny and red 
She can make the one jiggle 
The other one don't do shit but just sit their dead 

My kind of bitch has a wooden eye 
With a nail sticking half way out 
It once caught a fire and we all had to spit 
In her face just to put it out 

My kind of bitch is a little loopy 
And her ass might droop a bit 
But I scoop that loop and fold the flop 
And I fuck that pile of shit, my kind of bitch 

My kind of bitch 
My kind of bitch gots one good tittie 
The other one's skinny and red 
My kind of bitch gots one good tittie 

"Hello? Um, my name is J. I'm from Detroit. I'm looking for a girl, 
who's, um, dead. Um, a girl who can possibly forfill some of my 
fetishes. Which include, um, dipping your titties in Faygo and 
slapping my face with them. Um, jumping from the dresser and landing 
on my balls. Uh..." 

My kind of bitch waits till I sleep 
Then run and fuck my friends 
And everytime I break her legs 
Then give my homie's ends (haha what's up, man!) 

She shot me once and stabbed my neck 
And even broke my nose 
But I lick her from her crooked neck 
Down to her stringy toes, my kind of bitch 

My kind of bitch 
My kind of bitch waits till I sleep 
Then run and fuck my friend 
My kind of bitch waits till I sleep then... 

"Hello? Uh, my name is Shaggs, and I'm lookin for a girl with a 
big big fat fuckin ass. And titties. And a big fat fuckin ass. 
And, uh, I want my dick sucked, and I want my balls scratched. 
And I want her to scratch my ass and twist my balls at the same 
time, that's a must. And I'm looking for a girl who can stretch 
titties and stuff em in her ass." 

Fuck yeah, motherfucker 
I'm looking for a bitch 
I'm looking for a girl to fit my needs (my kind of bitch) 

We can have picnics under the moon 
In the graveyard 
We can have picnics under my house (my kind of bitch) 

I'm looking for a girl to die with 
If you're already dead, that's cool 
You can sit around and wait for me to die (my kind of bitch) 

I'm looking for a girl to squeeze me 
I'm looking for a girl to squeeze my balls 
Let me squeeze your neck 

"This is Lisa. I've been a bad, bad girl."
