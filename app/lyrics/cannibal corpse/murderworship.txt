Homage to our God, the act of killing bears us
Closer to His grace, beyond the void of darkness
Every drop of blood, a chance to deify us
Bring us to our lord our killings transcending
Convictions of violence pure, unrelenting

Devotion drips from my jagged blade
My righteous hate fuels unyielding rage
Sacramental slaughter all for faith
In the homicidal doctrine he creates

Decapitated heads, adorn the holy altar
Kneeling at its base, we stare in veneration
Every single death, brought us closer to Him
Take us to our Lord our bloodlust evolving,
Enshrining the bodies, evil emerging

Hate rips through flesh and bone
The dogma states that it must be done
We adhere to the holy text
More must die if we are to advance

Pray to our God
With blood we praise His epic acts of hate and homicidal glory, legendary murders
Trust in our Lord
Leads us to kill in the same way that He did, sever all the heads in sacrificial splendor
He is close now
Soon He will be among us leading, violence, ruin, divinity, homicide

Kneeling in the blood, we see our Master watching
Look behind His eyes, a soul so ruthless, perfect
Transfixed by His gaze, His congregation waiting
We summoned Him here by doing His bidding
Now He will slay us, circle completed

Arterial spray paints the temple red
Our Master's advent brought us death
Rapturous screaming fills these hallowed halls
Blood soaked paradise awaits us all
