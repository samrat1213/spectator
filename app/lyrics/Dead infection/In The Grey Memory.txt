Rotten past in our minds, open the door of destiny
Magic step to unknown truth is a secret of ugliness
Rotten, grey memory brings the hideous recollection

When your present becomes past horror will come back
Our grey memory is possessed by rancid times
Rotten, grey memory brings the hideous recollection

Do you see your juicy blood, which flows down on youe past?
Do you see your family, which was deprived of guts and limbs?

Look into the past, terrible view
Ripped souls by chains of hate
Pale corpses rape your girlfriend
Her virginal womb tears off

No one can hear your screams
You remember love, you're all in taers

You see dead friends and you begin to cry
You see dead world and you begin to vomit
You see dead life and you begin to scream
You see dead home and you begin to suffer

In the grey memory
Past destroys your presentEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
