God of the Forsaken LyricsI've seen visions awakening
Drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
And I have rejoiced in them
I've heard voices calling names
I have reveled in their beckoning
For the voices that summon me
Have grown immense
My senses keen with desire and pain
Senses heightened by my need to see
To feed the hunger that I feel inside
Awake my soul to ecstasy
My father the forsaken
The king of blasphemy
They cower at your name
They live in ignorance
They hide behind a doctrine
That has taught them only lies
Now let them see
Thy world, immaculate
I've seen visions awakening
Drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
And I have rejoiced in them
I've heard voices calling my name
I have waited for their beckoning
For the voices that summon me
Bring the gift of blissEmbed
