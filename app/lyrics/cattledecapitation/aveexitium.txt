And then it came to pass
we cracked the hourglass
left paradise behind
out of sight out of mind

We never stood a chance
against this sick romance
we have with our demise
we have with all of life

With mouths open wide
our footprint steps inside
and when there's nowhere to hide
death comes with the tide....
