The sound of the breaking bones
Smell of fresh, warm flesh
You catch your victim
Feast of the slaughter

His empty eyesockets excrete remains of brain
Like a soulless butcher you destroy element of life
Like a professional surgeon you cut tissue of this life

It's masterpiece, detailed operation
Eviscerated victims you caught feel nothing
