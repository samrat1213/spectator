Hey hey, T-Swizzle T-Swizzle
And T-Pizzle T-Pizzle

I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug

I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

I had a dream last night

I had high-top Nikes
I had

Diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic

By the time I woke I was singing

I'm on a boat

'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper

Shorty I'm a make ya

Straight to the top, yo

Shorty I'm a take ya

You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star

Hey, it's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster

You don't wanna fight me

Straight to the top

In my extra small white tee

T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

What, what, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, what, don't test me
Hey, hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything
I didn't even sâ€”
(What?)
I said, "Yo."
(Yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear
(She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!
