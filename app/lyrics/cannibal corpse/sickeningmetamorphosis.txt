Change has begun
After the shape
Freakish events
Led to this change
Convert the man
From the norm

Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis

Twisting flesh
Ghastly face
Pain distress
Mind displace
Twisted flesh transforming appearance of the
Ghastly face of the one that it chose
Pain distress of contortions and straining
Mind displaced as the spirit arose
Hideous one
Adapting fast
New skin grows out
Old skin peels off
Extra limbs sprout
Mutilation

Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis

Shifting bones
Gnarled limbs
Gruesome change
Features grim
Shifting bonestrans forming the framework and the
Gnarled limbs are beginning to grow
Gruesome change to repellent appearance
Features grim in complete overthrow
Tentacles extending from the face
Eyes are growing on his hands and back
Spikes and fangs cover his body
Skeleton re-shapes, bones pop and crack

<i>[Solo - O'Brien]</i>

A Monstrous thing he has become
Murderous compulsions flood his mind
Reconstruction reaches completion
He's no longer part of mankind

Sickening metamorphosis

Pain distress

Twisted flesh transforming appearance of the
Ghastly face of the one that it chose
Pain distress of contortions and straining
