[Verse 1]
Your gathered here tonight
To heed our metal. cry
Obeying all. our wills
All others you defy
A wall of sonic sound
With amps turned up to ten
Our legions are advancing
To battle once again

[Chorus]
Fists are in the air. banging everywhere
Thrashing to the sound faces melting down
It's time to fight for metal tonight
Bangers take your stand and obey
Our metal command

[Verse 2]
We go from town to town
And leave a trail of death
And if you don't surrender
You'll breathe your final breath
There will be no survivors
No prisoners of war
Join our ranks or perish
We'll slice you to the core
[Chorus]
Fists are in the air. trashing everywhere
Banging to the sound faces melting down
It's time to fight for metal tonight
Bangers take your stand and obey
Our metal command

[Verse 3]
Our legions show no mercy
The final hour nears
Sonic blast deafening
It's ripping through your ears
There is no retribution
For those who do not dare
There's only execution
Your dead without a prayer

[Chorus]
Fists are in the air. banging everywhere
Thrashing to the sound faces melting down
It's time to fight for metal tonight
Bangers take your stand and obey
Metal commandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
