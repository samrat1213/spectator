Sanctum 666 LyricsWarm Blood, Fire Hate
This is Fucking doom !!!!
Total violence, Death and pain
Moribund gloom
A deadly disease, you cut to deep
You can not stand this life
Take forth the knife, stab yourself
This is the time to die !!!!
The Blood is running down your neck
You stab your throat again !!!!!
Eternal sinner, a life in Hell
Living in pain.....
Christian Blood, Christian Hate
Your transparent lack of faith
Sadistic torment, ejaculation
Bleeding like a Pig !!
Razor blade suicide, in winter night
No glimpse of light, in this state of Hell
A rusty blade, plunge the skin
Satisfaction, he entered Hell....
...and he's leaving this world behind
I see the horns of Satan
Bleeding for him, bleeding for Hell
Sanctum 666
I see the horns of Satan
Bleeding for him, bleeding for Hell
Warm Blood, Fire Hate
This is Fucking doom !!!!
Total violence, Death and pain
Moribund gloom
A deadly disease, you cut to deep
You can not stand this life
Take forth the knife, stab yourself
This is the time to die !!!!
The Blood is running down your neck
You stab your throat again !!!!!
I see the horns of Satan
Bleeding for him, bleeding for Hell
I see the horns of Satan
Bleeding for him, bleeding for Hell
I see the horns of Satan
Bleeding for him, bleeding for Hell
