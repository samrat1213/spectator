Nevermore LyricsBorn to be master of the world
Fear my ever-pounding words
I desecrate, desecrate
False idols heed my way
I'm graced with understanding
My gifts are awe demanding
Collecting all the souls once lead astray
My will uncompromising
False Gods are realizing
The bitter end of their lies now fades away
Nevermore
Nevermore, my bastions oh so foul
We scream for more
Nevermore, nevermore!
Long slumbering powers awaken
There will be no mistaking
I beacon all my rouges to taste the might
Crush all the subjugates
Dark will so concentrated
I'm scattering all the pieces of their twisted fucking world
Never again to see the light of day
Nevermore
Nevermore, my bastions oh so foul
We scream for more
Nevermore, nevermore!
It's time to prey we'll seize the day
I wear the scars from the path this way
My mind is something beyond the real
Re-sculpt the throne
Where my world will kneel
I'm the master of the world
None defy my pounding words
I desecrate, desecrate
False idols blown away
I'm graced with understanding
My gifts are awe demanding
Collecting all the souls once lead astray
My will uncompromising
False Gods are realizing
The bitter end of their lies now fades away
Nevermore
Nevermore
Take the reigns with all my will and
Scream for more
Nevermore evermore!Embed
