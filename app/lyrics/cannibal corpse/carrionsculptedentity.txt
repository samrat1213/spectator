Carnage formed rebirth
A sickened lust of hatred
Damned to eternal plight
Obscene art alive through death
Crafted gore
Masterful slaughtering
Splatter soaked
Sinister demon incarnate
Maggots feast
Horrible putrid thing
One more piece
Scraped from bone born of decadence
Created from decay
Cold inncards used for torture
Prey sought by a twisted beast
Pray to hell no one survives
Black blood horror
Normalcy won't return
Guts of the dead
Severed hearts pulsate stagnant pus
Carves dying flesh
Brutal filth reeks of rot
Layered disgust
Undead pawn made to decimate

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Carrion sculpted entity
Rancid soul
Lives again immortal
Stench repulsive
Half eaten vultures picked apart
Molded scum
Archaic implements
Insanity
Covets pain vile anomaly
Carnage formed rebirth
A sickened lust of hatred
Damned to eternal plight
Obscene art alive through death
Living in this state uncontrolled
Vengeful mutant evil creature
Unrelenting thirst for blood
Dying by the way nightmares told
Murder murder murder murderer
Black blood horror guts of the dead
Art that's living never dying
Unrelenting thirst for blood
Carrion sculpted entity
