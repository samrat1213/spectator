I am disgusted,
at the sight of your breed.

I am the ocean,
stained of your existence.

I am leviathan.
The great demolisher,
the reincarnate,
conducting from beneath.

I shall submit your futile species
through infinite tortures of the deep,
Abandoning you, emaciated, amongst darkness.

It pleases me to witness your macerated corpse endure torment at these depths.

Until this moment did you not expect any repercussion?
You're just as guilty as all the rest.

There is no god to pray to for deliverance,
at these depths he does not exist.

So believe in me.
Believe in me.
