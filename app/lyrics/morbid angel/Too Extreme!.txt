Too Extreme! LyricsPanic
Panic
Panic
Panic
This is your one warning
This is your one warning
This is your one warning
Pounding, pounding, you feel it
Burning, burning this lava
Scorching weakened hearts be troubled
They scream we're too extreme
We come to spread our insane
This doctrine chaos chaos
Demanding nothing less but to
Make you scream we're too extreme
Tu coraz칩n latiendo
Te sientes el dolor
Deseo la locura
Tu gritas extreme!
Welcome to your new religion
We come collecting souls
You come to sing our praises
Together selfless
We are your new religion
No religion
Extreme!
Extreme!
De sud America
A puertas de oro athens
A la quema inframundo
Conmigo, extreme
Visi칩n sufrir치
Orejas derretir치
Bese su nueva creencia
Es nombre Extreme
We are your new religion
No religion
We are your new religion
No religion
You come to us in torment
And we make your bodies heave
Our sounds invoke your demon
Together too Extreme!
Extreme!
We are your new religion
No religion
We are your new religion
No religion
We are your new religion
No religion
We are your new religion
No religion
No religion
No religion
No religion
No religion
We are your new religion
No religion
We are your new religion
