Children to the cages
Institutional enslavement
Monitor resistance
Smother all existence

Animalistic mentality
Desperate to escape this mental penitentiary
A nihilistic society
Voyeurs into death embedded into circuitry

Disconnect the lines
There are devils in the wires
A dark passage for the empire
Refined technology
Reporting from the towers
There is no privilege
You are property of the higher power

Sleep with the beasts at our feet
They taste your sorrow, they feed on broken dreams
Sleep with the beasts at our feet
They see you, they hear you, they swallow everything

Do as you're told, fall in line
Know your place, stay with your kind
Do as you're told, you're under control
You're under control, you're under control

Children to the cages
Institutional enslavement
Monitor resistance
Smother all existence

Animalistic mentality
Desperate to escape this mental penitentiary
A nihilistic society
Voyeurs into death burning through humanity

Torchbearers
Sadistic lust for pain
Turn embers into flame
Void of remorse
For the ashes
Scattered in the wake

Chained to the floor like rabid dogs
A rage intensifies, a call to crucify
The lords of lesser men corrupted nemesis
Exterminate with extreme prejudice

Exterminate with extreme prejudice

Sleep with the beasts at our feet
They taste your sorrow, they feed on broken dreams
Sleep with the beasts at our feet
They see you, they hear you, they swallow everything

Do as you're told, fall in line
Know your place, stay with your kind
Do as you're told, you're under control
You're under control, you're under control

Children to the cages
Institutional enslavement
Monitor resistance
Smother all existence

Exterminate with extreme prejudice
Exterminate with extreme prejudice
