Rise up and revolt
Overthrow the government
Level all the temples
Destroy the monuments

Return to anarchy
Defy the Christian law
Prepare for mutiny
Prepare for coup d'etat

So begins our final riot act
Now that you're in, there'll be no turning back
Smash everything, wreck it all with pride
The power of our revolution won't ever be denied

Reduce the halls of power
To ruin and to ash
An end to Christianity
An end to holy mass

The dawn of an iron age
Return to pagan law
Lex Talionis
We rule by fang and claw

So begins our final riot act
Now that you're in, there'll be no turning back
Smash everything, wreck it all with pride
The power of our revolution won't ever be deniedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
