Ah
Torched to a pimple
Peeling skin and tissue
Inflammable rectal gases
Scaling your sinews, ah

Charbroiled to blackened char
Smoked, sauteed and black
Blistering, flaking tissue
Unsalvageable by skin graft
Fused into a mess
Dribbling cartilage and fumes
Your body shriveling
Your fingers beginning to prune

Burnt to a cinder (Your body charred)
Incinerated carbon, molten as tar
Smoldering ashes (Scorched entrails)
Carbonated dust, cremated remains

Burnt to a crisp
Your fat's on fire
Devouring you whole
Like a cadaver-stoked pyre

Charred to the bone
Your flesh is burnt
Tissues molten, bodily gases inert
Blazing eruption, evaporating marrow, spontaneous combustion

Burnt to a crisp
Your hair is singed
Devouring your scalp
Receding your fringe

Dripping flesh and fat
Spreads like an irritating rash
Your fingers melting
As you vainly scratch

Dripping flesh
It spreads like a rash
Your fingers melting
As you vainly scratch

Crisp
