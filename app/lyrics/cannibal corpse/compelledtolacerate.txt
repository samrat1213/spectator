Vicious thoughts will overpower
His virulent mind explodes
Unable to suppress the madness
He can't contain this inner pain
Compelled to

Lacerate
Rendering for release
Set free souls through holes in their skin
Murdered, or have they been saved

Bleeding corpse his work of art
Human flesh a canvas
Craftsman of macabre creations
He can't control it makes him whole
Compelled to

Lacerate
Rendering for release
Slicing through victims and then he stands back
To admire what he has done
Mutilate
Ruptured figures sprawl
Slaughtered in a rage now left to be found
A gristly gift of art

<i>[Solo: Jack]</i>

Mangle them ripping death lacerate them

Stunning victims with a club abducted with
Stealth taken to his home
Ropes and chains restrain his living subject of art
He stabs
Grating with a jagged edge his prey screams in pain
Writhing under his knife
Driven to improve his victims through gruesome
Design, he cannot stop
Compelled to

Lacerate rendering for release
Mutilate now it's time to slice

<i>[Solo: Jack]</i>

Mangle them ripping death lacerate them

Lacerate from release
Slicing through victims and the he stands back
To admire what he has done
Mutilate
Ruptured figures Sprawl
Slaughtered in a rage now left to be found
A grisly gift of art

<i>[Solo: Jack]</i>
