Every new life is a tragedy in waiting
A fresh beginning for hopelessness
A new chance to infiltrate, build, then desroy

We all lose everything now
We all have no other way out

Bizarre, this undying love for this species
Oppressing the elements we're made of

The soil is rotten
The oceans forgotten
The glaciers now molten
In our tracks we are frozen

Be still our bleeding hearts
Death is part of life
Embrace time's eraser
Ditch the ignorant philanthropy
The scale has tipped and not in our favor

Approaching 8 billion and counting
Sadly, we require disease, mass murder and blind genocide

Every new death is a step towards preservation
Eradication in training
An inch towards progress for the future of life

We all lose everything now
We all have no other way out

Be still our bleeding hearts
Death is part of life
Ditch the ignorant philanthropy
The scale has tipped and not in our favor

Approaching 8 billion and counting
Sadly, we require disease, mass fatalities and extinguishing
This battle already lost to ourselves by the billions

Human life is simply not sustainable
