It crushes me to know she's ignored
Throw up, hang up, this one, is for no one
Show me how, it is, inside
Show who, I am, this time

To give, to let you
Either way, this blood will rot
To be, just be,
The blood is draining, through my eyes

To be whit someone's lover, my bad
You know it, I threw up, my little
My trash, my lover
Show me how, it is, inside
Show who, I am, this time

Too good, to let you
Either way, this blood will rot
To be, just be
The blood is draining, through my eyes

Fear, Fear, nah...
They'll shoot me with, this not right
Fear, fear
This earth and world is not enough. Fear

To be, just be

To care, do you care?
To be, just, be
The blood is draining, through my eyes

Never be it, never, be
Never be, never be, never
Never be
