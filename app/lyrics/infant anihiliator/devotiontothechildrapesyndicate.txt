Bride of Christ, you are now bride to the priest. Time to surrender
your chastity. Bear me a child of lechery. Prostrate and tremble in
fear. You will now pay for your sins. Pray and hope that God will hear
as I am fucking you. Embryonic development: The New slaves begin to
shape, swelling the wombs of the nuns. Illegitimate, yet with lies
they are rationalized. Procreation of a generation that’s doomed. When
they’re brought into this world they serve the purpose of the church.
Rape the bastard children then return them to the earth. Born, then
classed, then sent to the Nursery of rape. Newborn bodies bring glory
to the church. A fruitful harvest means a happy hierarchy; they fuck
the children, then leave disposal up to me. Within the crypt lies a
rancid lime stone pit; a putrid haven for bloated, murdered children.
As I pour the chemical catalyst to speed decay, the cries of the
living ones cease. Now their melted skin lay draped on their scattered
bones. The maggots fester, consuming bodies faster, and what remains
is ground into the food for the new generation. Bride of Christ, you
are now bride to the priest. Time to surrender your chastity. Bear me
a child of lechery. Prostrate and tremble in fear.
