Festering morbid decay
Saturates the air again
Stenches of a different pleasure
Boiling blood hole deepens
Filled with remains, once pitiful lives
Slaughtered day by day
Die without a face
Destroyed without a trace

Vanished when unfit for life
Betrayal not uncommon
Severed for the sacrifice
Appease the inner demon
Filled with remains, once pitiful lives
Boiling blood hole deepens
Die without a face
Destroyed without a trace

Given away
Life is taken away

Coordinate the mutilations
Simplify the deviance
Rectify the situation
Bodies chopped with diligence
Discarded humans melting fast
Enveloped in putrid vapor
Slaughtered day by day
Destroyed without a trace

Given away
Life is taken away
Morbid decay
In vain they have suffered and died

Gathered for the execution, brutal murders one by one begin
They will die, they will die, they will die, they will die
Dissected for incineration, chosen for annihilation
They will die, they will die, they will die, they will die

Never to be seen or heard
Now just a memory gone for all eternity
Cast into non-existence

Given away
Life is taken away

Festering morbid decay
Saturates the air again
Stenches of a different pleasure
Boiling blood hole deepens
Filled with remains, once pitiful lives
Slaughtered day by day
Die without a face
Destroyed without a trace

Gathered for the execution
Brutal murders one by one begin
Dissected for incineration
Chosen for annihilation

Never to be seen or heard
Now just a memory gone for all eternity
Burnt into non-existence

Given away
Life is taken away
Morbid decay
In vain they have suffered and died
