Putrid mess lays in the woods
Removed of organs and meat
13 mounds of bony flesh
Hollowed out expect for maggots
That dwell
Deep inside the skulls
Of victims that they cleaned
How did this horror unfold

No trace of evidence was left behind
At this scene of gore
Will the truth ever be told

Only time will tell

Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies
Will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
With their untold stories

Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed

13 more corpses are found
13 miles exactly south
26 more to the north
2 stacks of 13 humans
13 miles apart from one another
In a line
Why did this horror unfold

2 more
1 to the west
1 to the east make 6 in total
Will the truth ever be told

Only if I tell

Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies
Will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
With their untold stories

Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed

Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies
Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies
