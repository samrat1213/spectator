Interior skull, home of Brain hero who's part of you
Mental justice defending you, listening to you
Fighting with thousands of stronger and bigger brains
He's a legend amongst your cerebral friends
And now you put your head in your hands
Day after day you just keep dreaming of your mental hero
You'd like to go with him to the park for a walk
But he can't hear you 'cause he's sleeping now
Your brain hero is a dream drifting on a stream
But your pain is real, your world is dissolved
There was no greater love than what you felt
Farewell to Brain hero and don't cry
And now you put your head in your hands
Day after day you just keep dreaming of your mental hero
You'd like to go with him to the park for a walk
But he can't hear you 'cause he's sleeping nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
