I saw their cities turn to dust
Beneath the blackened sky and suffocate the barren land below
Sparing none he casts a shadow across the earth
To deliver their demise

The ruin of humankind
Self created by their infected minds

Purging the water with filth and disease
Endless chaos crushing mountains of stone and trees
Horrific beings destroy and enslave
Thrones of insanity thrive as life decays

The symbol of failure
The cross of mans deceit

As the poison bleeds from the machines
The rivers will run dry as they consume endlessly

Let them starve
The vultures they circle
Where they lay
The worms they feed
Let them starve
The vultures they circle
Shallow graves house the defective breed

I saw their cities turn to dust
Beneath the blackened sky and suffocate the
Barren land below
Sparing none he casts a shadow across the earth
To deliver their demise

In the darkness of their grave
The failures of man will always remain

Bringer of plagues
Come forth from the flames where they dwell
And let all who have hardened their hearts with hate
Kneel before the king of hell
