Let's take our fucking lives back.
Life living through an hourglass,
The sand is falling and there's not much left.
It's like living in a photograph, witness the rubble from the past.
And how it's so full of memories,
Now don't you wish you could turn that fucker over?
I want my life back, every grain of sand, I'll take it back!

Fuck living through an hourglass window,
Fuck living trapped in a photograph, entombed by fragile glass,
Let's smash this fucking shit!

It's my life and it's falling fast, no time for memories.
I say fuck the past!

Life living through an hourglass,
