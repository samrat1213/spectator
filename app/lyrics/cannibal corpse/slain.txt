The outlander walked into town, covered in gore
He knew he could not wait much longer, he needed more
Death
Pain
Terror
Blood...

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always show for all time

Wasting no time he began defiling whores
He would be the last man they felt, a carnivore
Tear
Rape
Ravage
Maim

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one knows
Their bloodstains will always show for all time

Firing, loaded rifle, never ending killing spree
Slashing with machete, body parts are the debris
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
One more town, slowly going down
This is the coming of endless torment

<i>[Solo - Jack Owen]</i>

Unburied victims lie, blood soaking into the sand
Remains of the slain, a dead body wasteland
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
One man left, sheriff bereft, faces the stranger with intent

<i>[Solo - Pat O'Brien]</i>

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always show for all...
Time
Expired
Big iron
Both die

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always show for all...
Slain
