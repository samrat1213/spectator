A rising, bleak dawn
A permanent sunset
On the human condition
A boot perpetually treads

Illumination snuffed
Fowards on time will march
Holding as a mirror
Condemning to repeat the past

Endtime
The realms of a setting sun
Twilight
A new age has begun
Decline
Decension to a new dark age
Blank time
An old world not quite so brave

Right on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Back on the edge,

We stand...on the edge of darkness

A fading dusk
Empty, blanketing shade
A dying sun
Only blackness radiates

An aeon ends
A millenium overturned
Time lies in embers
As barren horizons burn

End time
The realms of a setting sun
Twilight
A new age has begun
Decline
Decension to a new dark age
Blank time
An old world not quite so brave

Right on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Back on the edge,

We stand...on the edge of darkness

Endtime
The realms of a setting sun
Twilight
A new age has begun
Decline
Decension to a new dark age
Blank time
An old world not quite so brave

Right on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Back on the edge...

Right on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Back on the edge...
