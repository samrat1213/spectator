Get off my nerves or what's left of them
It shouldn't bother me so why does it?
I'm letting this happen, I'm letting this happen
Just haunt me gently so I can do no harm

I sit well in this cavernous place
Laughter is music to me
Chase me further, chase me further
Rat race lost with all memory gone

Somebody
Somebody
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me down
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me down

Somebody
Somebody
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me down
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me up
Hold me down

Shocking people
People, shocking people
Hold me up
