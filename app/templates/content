no, no fucking poetics, not for this, not for us. this is about fire and unleashed decadence; turning purgatory into an ocean of sweat, and the pounding of our bodies into oblivion.


 chilling celestial choirs will sing out of joy when this earth is finally eradicated. billions of souls cast into heavenly oblivion. the end of futile mortal torment.


 the personification of oblivion.

 hail the obsidian flame within and the eternal eclipsed sun.


 away from this fucking world of infinite hate and insignificance.



 <p>Ominous and fierce antinatalistic cult, spreading an invisible fog of dreadful disillusionment out into the oblivious World. </p>
    <p>The ignorance of man, destroying every life that it can touch. Down to the most oblivious innocent insect to another life of a human, Will we ever see that all life is equal in this nightmare of cosmic madness we call existence? </p><p>

 a world full of life is a world full of anguish-filled madness. you will never find relief. you will never find enlightenment from another. nothing will show you absolute truth. nothing will give you peace. nothingness is your only savior.
