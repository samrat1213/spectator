Sharpen the pick
To pierce the skull through the ear
Stab at an angle
Cranial transfixion, hearing and vision terminated by the penetration
Skewered from ear to eye
Launching the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left blind
Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real
Struggle with death
In shock you grasp at the air
Senses deprived
Cerebral cessation, mental division created by the penetration
Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left blind
Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real
Boring through the brain, eye impaled upon the point
Steel spears crisscross your grey matter
Puncturing the eardrum and the blood begins to ooze
Red blooms grace the dying head
Auditory nerve is severed
Labyrinth destroyed
You are rendered deaf and blind
Seconds before death
On a spit
Your head will burn
Charring flesh
Brain tissue congeals
Crack the skull
Open wide
Scoop it out
I consume your mind

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Eating the brain
To gain the knowledge of death
You are inside
Psychic absorption, hearing and vision
Are now mine through this appropriation
Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left blind
Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real.
