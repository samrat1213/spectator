Like a human flesh-eating bacteria,
Growing bigger and bigger by the fucking day.
Multiplying faster and faster,
Like a spore spreading fungus in every way.
Welcome to this bitch named earth.
Mother to us all, our growth the creating.
And just look what we've created for her.
Filth, disease, rape, we've ruined everything!

And now our once pretty sky
Is now blackened by machines' breath.
And now it's tearing up my eyes, the darkness took the light.

Look what we've created for our carbon-based community.
Run by man-made machinery, this is insanity!
But still man-made machines' hearts beating,
Still breathing, and blackening the sky.
The darkness took the light, ehh!

Look what we've created, this is our own man-made misery.
This is insanity, filth, disease, rape, we've ruined everything!
Filth, disease, rape, we've ruined everything 

And now our once pretty sky
Is now blackened by machines' breath.
And now it's tearing up my eyes, the darkness took the light.

We are all her human cancer
And these are the gifts we've brought her.
Filth, disease, rape, we've ruined everything
