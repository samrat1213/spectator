Festering scabs, papillae and pores
Hardened carbuncles, spots and cold sores...

Pick at the scab - septic blood starts to weep
Rip at my face - ruptured growths start to seep

Blackhead and boils, pustular cysts
Chapped commodones, perspiring zits...

Pierce the blane - infected tissue starts to bleed
Diseased and plagued - tumours chew and feed...

...On ulcerated flesh...
...On facial mess...
...On blooming sores...
...On blistering warts...

Squeeze out the blood, the pus I extract
A rancid cocktail, steaming and black
Infested skin, bubbles and bursts
Hackne vulgaris, spluttering pus...

...The swarming mass...
...With acid I attack...
...With razors I hack...
...Bubos, bulging and black...

Squeeze out the blood, the pus I extract
A rancid cocktail, steaming and black
Bursting canker, clustered bullae
Pimples and bones eat me alive...

Gnawing, curdling, swarming flesh
Bubbling, seething, disgusting mess
Smarting, abrased purple and raw
Pustular, vulgar pimples and sores...

The juice is squeezed
Sebum bleeds
Lick the pox
Weals and warts...

- Festering face
- Decrepit and plagued...
