Your rotten gore is still pulsating
All core of body is polluted
All your glands are vomiting with pus
All your insides are still pulsating
Stomach, rectum, kidneys and liver
All your organs are damned
Pulsating gore still attacks
Your insides, innocent flesh
Your flesh is full of beautiful life
Inside tissue excretes enzymes
Veins and arteries are vomiting with blood
Giving way for pulsating gore
Stomach, rectum, kidneys and liver
All your organs are damned
Pulsating gore still attacks
Your insides, innocent flesh
Rotten flesh, dying body, gift to decay
Pulsating gore inside of you, no chance to life
Take grind scalp, kill yourself, don't suffer
Skewer eyes, cut your veins, don't take pains
You are dead, your flesh is dead
All your insides are carbonized
Your disease
Rancid gore
You get effusion, maggots eat your brain
Swollen urethra excretes aromaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
