Powerless, homeless, dead again
Terrible dreams, differed world in his mind
Cemetary of his cells is falling again
Diabolic return to life in deadly form

Putrid mould from a dead land
Sticky plasm without remorse
Death for alive, life for dead
It's not such a man as times ago

Piece by piece again and again
Soggy shambles People! Pray!

Dead again-go to hell, leave in peace
Dead again-look at people, devastation
Dead again-unatural, human pain
Dead again-hellish view, the guts are breakingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
