Why can't I breathe
Still I see
Dead on the table
Try to move, I'm not able to

They said I have died
I still felt alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these
Eyes

Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead

Knives cutting into me
Scalpels rip me
Screaming into deaf ears
Now they stop and see my
tears

Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead

I can't stop the visions
Stop the premonitions

My soul can't escape
The boundary of my flesh
My heart does not beat
My spirit does not rest

<i>[Solo - Jack]</i>

<i>[Solo - Rob]</i>

<i>[Solo - Jack]</i>

<i>[Solo - Rob]</i>

They said I have died
I still felt alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these
Eyes
