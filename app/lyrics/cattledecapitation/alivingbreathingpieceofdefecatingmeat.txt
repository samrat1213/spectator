Death on two legs and onward!

The gestation has now mutated into what looks like a human
It displays intellect and understands reproduction

We should have stopped it before it got this far

That writhing reject, that web-footed bastard child
That spawn of animated lard, that curdled wad of embarrassment
Dripping mucus and leaving a trail...

Released upon the populace this "thing" shall breed, emit its seed
a monstrous mold of cells resembling jellied meat assembly

A living, breathing piece of defecating meat
Two-legged massacre expressing glands in heat
Draining the bleed

Putrid will be its offspring
Filtered through genetic anomaly

A throbbing, misshapen slug of a "human being"
Mucus crusts on your pink skin, shined by sebaceous sebum
Fucking ugly and disgusting
The missing link between feces and humanity

"When I try to speak through my spurthole
I simply choke on the mucus" like...
"When I try to examine my asshole in the mirror
for polyps or whatever you call it, I erupt"

We are living, we are breathing, we are pieces of defecating meat.

A living, breathing piece of defecating meat
Descending on the earth contaminated seeds
Ripe with disease
