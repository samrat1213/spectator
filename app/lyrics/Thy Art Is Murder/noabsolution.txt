Cast out from the pits of hell, no fire of redemption
Circle of pain, you know that fear is the poison inside you

Arteries lead their way from the machine
It's toxic fumes drown the youth, it chained them up to television screens
Quiet streets, hollow hearts, empty eyes
Cruel fate wasting away, try to salvage the guilt

Pave your highways with gold, build your palaces and empires with the lives that you stole
Crush their homes under foot into the mud, and float away alone in a sea of their blood

There's no remorse
No absolution

No remorse
No absolution

See them starve, let them drown, watch them die
See them starve, let them drown, watch them die

The pressure binds your skin to fate, echo the throes of destruction
Eclipsing hope, the crooked truth, all you'll have left is the nothing you made

Oh! Holy one, come down from your mountain, witness the torture and torment
Broken bodies burdened with terror, weakened from the tremors

Cast out from the pits of hell, no fire of redemption
Circle of pain, you know that fear is the poison inside you

Under the safety of darkness, return to the cliffs, watch the embers extinguish
Rip out your hellish heart
Beg for forgiveness

Close your eyes and let the silence engulf you
Rip out your hellish heart
Beg for forgiveness

Close your eyes and let the silence engulf you
Rip out your hellish heart
Beg for forgiveness

Circle of pain, you know that fear is the poison inside you

There's no remorse
There's no remorse
No absolution
