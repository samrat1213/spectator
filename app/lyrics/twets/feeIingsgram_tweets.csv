My anxiety makes me think everyone secretly dislikes me.
It’s time for you to be happy again.
I honestly want something good to happen to me. I really need that rn.
No longer apologizing for wanting more. I’m growing. You either stay or you go.
Keep that person who chooses to stay beside you despite of seeing flaws.
Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary.
"One day you'll love me as I love you. One day you'll think of me as I think of you. One day you'll cry for me as I cry for you. One day you'll want me, but when that day comes, I'm already over you."

"I go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace."
Nobody can piss you off like the person you love. I swear they hit a different type of nerve.
You’ve been so hurt no wonder why trusting someone again feels heavy.

I want someone who will stay with me no matter how hard i am to be with.
I’m just thankful for the people that never left me.
"Let it hurt, then let it go."
"Being someone's first love is great, but being someone's last love is beyond perfect."
"If you love someone, be brave enough to tell them, otherwise, be brave enough to watch them be loved by someone else."
"Your age doesn't define your maturity, your grades don't define your intelligence, and rumors don't define who you are."
Never waste your feelings on people who don't value them.
"Sometimes it is your fault.. Sometimes you don't listen well enough, you're selfish, you're rude and aren't always right. Sometimes you fucked it up and that's okay. It happens, learn from it, apologize and keep moving. Just because you fucked up doesn't mean you're a bad person."
"Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you."
"It sucks when the only person who can make you feel better, is also the reason you always cry."
Don't confuse my personality with my attitude. My personality is who I am. My attitude depends on who you are.
Please don't come closer unless you plan to stay.
It’s not a joke when anxiety attacks.
Want your attention but don't wanna bother you.
Don't cry because they left. Just smile because they gave you a chance to find someone better.
"Dear life, i just wanna be happy."
Tweets are actually hints.
Bad communication ends a lot of good things.

Kinda hope you are thinking about me.
I’m stuck between keep trying and why bother.
I miss being a little kid with no worries.

Don't stress over shit you can't change.
i lose interest when i see myself trying harder than you.
"honestly, i really feel stupid for holding onto things that keep on hurting me."
Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer makes you happy.

I overthink myself into bad moods.
i just need someone to understand me.
"if you break someone's heart and they still talk to you with the same excitement and respect. believe me, they really love you"
My relationship will always be private but I’ll never keep my partner a secret. there’s a difference between privacy and secrecy.
don't lie to me to protect my feelings.
a best friend is someone who makes you laugh even when you think you’ll never smile again.
don’t say “sorry” and then do it all over again.
You’re not selfish for wanting the same energy and love you give.
I’m glad I met you. Now do me a favour and stay.
I am tired of being told I am loved and cared about but never made to feel that way.
Stay away from people who act like a victim in a problem they created.

I hope future me is happy.

It’s different without you.
Everything happens for a reason.

"Maybe the word ""forever"" is meant for memories not people."
It’s hurting me but nvm.
"In reality, no one cares, they're just curious."
"There's no need to rush. If something is meant to be, it will happen. In the right time, with the right person, for the best reason."
I want your attention but I won't ask for it.
You will never be happy if you continue to hold on to the things that make you sad.
how to be happy?   1. pray 2. stop holding grudges 3. let go 4. forgive 5. see the good side of your struggles
"I hate that moment when you hear something that kills you inside, but you have to act like you’re fine."
losing respect for someone is always such a weird thing because you don’t hate the person. you just don’t feel the need to ever speak to them again or even think about them in the same way. you’re just done.
music hits different when you’re sad.

Emotionally: i'm done  Mentally: i'm drained  Spiritually: I feel dead  Physically: I smile.
"Oh right, my fault again."
"If it hurts, you care."
I have no motivation for anything.
It takes a lot for me to trust someone.
"Stop getting attached to people so fast, because attachments lead to expectations and expectations can lead to disappointments."
Don't judge my choices if you don't understand my reasons.
Loyalty still matters even on bad terms.

Never compare me to someone else thanks.
I want to escape reality.
Girls usually fall in love with funny boys.
I thought I was doing better.

You ever notice someone slowly losing interest in you and you’re just like:                          “Oh”

I am not the same person I once was.
I need a long long long deep conversation with someone who understands.
People change. Memories don't.
Stay single until you’re appreciated.
Trust the timing in your life.

Never joke around about someone's insecurities. You'll never know what they really feel.
every goodbye teaches u something.
"If you’re reading this, here’s a reminder that you’re worth it and you deserve to be happy."
one song makes you remember a lot.
"If we date, I don't need your passwords or your phone, I just want the truth if I ask about something."
I don’t want to break my heart again.
the best relationships usually begin unexpectedly.
I’m not sad but im full of feelings i don’t like.
True friends don't talk shit about you.
"Believe with your eyes, not with your ears."
"Don’t chase, don’t beg, if they want you they’ll make time for you."
never regret anything that made you smile.
Be strong and smile at life even though it hurts sometimes.
wish i could tell you what’s really on my mind.
sometimes i miss how good everything was.
"Blasting music, and ignoring the world."
nothing is better than talking to someone you’re comfortable with.
Sometimes I am the most moody person ever.
i meet someone                 ⬈                              ⬊  they leave                        we talk                      ⬉                                ⬋                                   i get attached
my worst quality?  someone could hurt me so damn much and yet i’d still be there for them at the end.
"I pretend to ignore you, but I really just miss you."
"Stay private, enjoy life."
"If nobody got me, I got me."
i only get jealous because i’m afraid someone is going to make you happier than i do.
"If it’s real, it’ll never be over."
"⠀  Work hard, stay humble, dream big.  ⠀"
"Whatever makes you mad, leave it. Whatever makes you smile, keep it."
Be grateful for the good times and keep the faith during the bad times. Stay positive when life gives you every reason to be negative.
"Sometimes you just have to accept that some people can only be in your heart, not in your life."
Distance sometimes lets you know who's worth keeping and who's worth letting go.
Not everyone you love will stay. Not everyone you trust will be loyal.
I will never stop loving you.
my favorite memory was meeting you.
i choose you over everyone.
i need forever with you
"please, be my permanent happiness."
Never apologize for leaving a situation to make yourself happier. your health matters and your happiness is important.
"Someday, when things are okay, you’ll look back and feel proud that you did not give up."
Date someone mature enough to say “let’s fix this” instead of just acting childish and ignoring you.
i never faked my love to someone.
Don’t judge yourself by your past. You don’t belong there anymore.
Love should heal you and not hurt you.
kinda want a big long hug.
they care when it's too late.
"so young, so damaged."
choose me or lose me. i'm not a backup plan and definitely not a second choice.
"sleepy eyes, heavy heart with busy mind."
i’m a very private person. you don’t ask  i don’t tell.
Imagine someone tweeting about you.
don’t use someone to forget someone.
"Through ups and downs, you have me."
i wanna sit on a rooftop with someone  and talk about all my feelings with them.
it costs $0.00 to be loyal.   it costs $0.00 to be consistent.  it costs $0.00 to be honest.
Sleep is the perfect escape from everything.
RIP to my mental health.
"be a good person, but don’t waste  time to prove it."
"i know im a hard person. im sensitive, im moody, i need constant reassurance and i tend to overthink. but please don’t think that that’s all i am. i can be calm, i can be strong, and i can be loving. if you catch me on a day where im being hard, don’t think that’s all i am."
when someone asks you to listen  to a song. it’s because the lyrics  mean everything they’re trying to say
"if i cry in front of you, believe me, i have reached my limit."
"if you stay,  stay forever.   if you go,  do it today.   if you change,  change for the better.   if you talk,  make sure you mean what you say."
what’s on my mind?  you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you.
"you fall in love with the little things about someone, like the sound of their laugh or the way their smile forms."
and we didn’t talk after that happened.
The more I think about you the more I miss you.
Friends can make everything better.
"sometimes, you end up losing yourself trying to hold onto someone who never cared about losing you."
I wanted to feel loved without feeling like I was begging for it.
I used to be much happier.
"Sometimes you have to walk away from people, not because you don't care, but because they don't."
Just smile the pain away.
I wanna be someone’s first choice.
Life can be so exhausting sometimes.
"I will be fine, soon."
"I still like you, I'm just tired of trying."
I’m the type of person that will sit in the bathroom and cry but then walk out like nothing ever happened.
"When you find someone who accepts you the way you are, that's home."
"Don’t tell me you love me, show me."
Sometimes you have to vibe alone to really understand some things.
Never let a soul on this earth make you feel like you aren’t enough.
Loving someone takes more than just love.
"Don’t leave a girl you need, for a girl you want."
Age don’t make you grown. Your mindset and the way you move does.
Prioritize your happiness.
Keep watering yourself until you feel like you again.
Save me from my thoughts.
𝐖𝐀𝐘𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐁𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐄 𝐏𝐄𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐇𝐀𝐏𝐏𝐈𝐄𝐑  𝟏. Mind your own business. 𝟐. Focus on the goodthlngs in life.  𝟑. Complain Less.  𝟒. Less argument.  𝟓. Surround yourself with positive and inspiring people. 𝟔. Smile more.
Be kind without expecting anything in return.
"I never cheat, because I know how it hurts to be cheated."
"Relax, take a deep breath. Everything will be fine."
we cannot grow without pain.
Going through a lot but still smiling.
"People always leave, I am used to it."
"Be smart enough to hold on, be brave enough to let go."
"Self-love, the best gift you could ever give to yourself."
Learn to love without expectation.
"Things will be better soon, hopefully."
"Don’t change yourself just to make someone love you, be yourself and let the right one fall for you."
I love twitter because there’s always someone who knows how to express what I feel better than me.
You are loved. Stop harming yourself.
"God, Goals, Growing &amp; Glowing."
An overthinking person needs an understanding person.
A girl's pain.   You will never ever understand that.
A “sorry” is useless when “trust” is broken.
Be with someone who is also comfortable with your silence.
i’m a pro at pretending to be ok
I know my worth I’m just dumb sometimes.
so much shit i wanna say but i stay quiet.
sometimes your mind can be your worst enemy.
tired of wasting my effort on people who don’t deserve it.
"i may not see you everyday, but i love you everyday."
“i’m such a “no it’s okay” and suffer in silence type of person.”
"Ed Sheeran was right, loving can hurt sometimes."
"Nobody cares unless you are beautiful, rich, popular or dead."
"I’m a very forgiving person so If I stop talking to you, you really went too far."
"Stay strong, even when things begin to fall apart, stay strong."
i pray my friends get through the battles that they don't tell me about.
"Psychology says, It's not the song makes you emotional it's the people and things that's come to your mind when you hear it."
private life always wins. keep it secret till you win.
you deserve to be happy and loved correctly
every beautiful thing reminds me of you
Never leave a friend sad.
i look at u and my heart melts
"Respect me, and I'll respect you."
Sweetness turned into coldness.
"I love you, that means I’m not just here for the pretty parts and the happy days. I’m here for the rough and the bad days. I’m here no matter what."
eye contact with same feelings &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I care about everything.
I saw you in my dreams. It felt so real.
"""I'll never leave you."""
"you’ll always have me, i promise."
my clingy side is only for my fav person.
"i prayed for you, your happiness."
us &lt;3
It will always be you.
I don't want to share you with anyone.
I hope you know I'll always care.
After everything I still love u.
"Dear mind, please stop thinking so much at night, I need to sleep."
"When I love, I love hard."
"To everyone going through struggles or pain right now, keep your head up, and keep smiling, God heals all."
Don’t force people to choose you.
i really want cute pics with u :(
"if i talk to my mom about you , you really mean a lot to me"
Don't let your emotions make your decisions.
Tweeting your feelings is better than saying it to other people.
Deleting your toxic paragraph to text back “ok” is a different kind of self control.
"It’s ok. I mean it’s not ok, but it’s ok."
i like private but not a secret
"One person, so many feelings."
"One day, you’ll be at the place you always wanted to be."
Insecurity mentally destroys you.
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
one mistake broke everything.
I hope you heal from things you don’t talk about.
people be acting like they know everything abt u lmao
two things i will never forget.   1. how a person treated me.  2. what a person said to me.
tbh telling someone how you feel is honestly the hardest thing ever
eye contact with same feelings
"if you don't know the whole story, shut up."
the fight between your heart &amp; your mind ain’t no joke
Not totally healed but at least feeling better.
Make sure the person you’re choosing over everybody is choosing you too.
"That feeling when you're not necessarily sad, but you just feel really empty."
i hate getting flashbacks from things  i don’t want to remember anymore.
i gave wrong people the right pieces of me.
self-care.  self-love.  self-trust.
so hard to trust people nowadays.
"removing myself from situations where i don’t feel loved, appreciated, or respected."
they’ll never understand
i always cry in silence.
bestfriend love is a different type of love.
Deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
"if no one will choose you, learn to choose yourself."
i want to cry but i have things to do.
Dear old days: I miss you.
"If they’re okay with losing you, stop fighting."
Let‘s talk about how hard it is to open up to someone about being sad for no reason. how hard is it to explain to your friends and family that you have a heavy feeling in your chest for no reason.
"If you can only read my mind, you’ll definitely understand everything I feel."
how i wish there was a restart button
I always think too much but say too little.
sending warm hugs to those who feel sad and empty.
one of the hardest decisions you’ll  ever face in life is choosing wether to walk away or try even harder.
"maybe i don’t cry, but it hurts.  maybe i won’t say, but i feel.  maybe i don’t show, but i care."
disappointed but not surprised.
a smile hides a thousand tears and a broken heart.
"Losing someone who doesn’t appreciate you is a gain, not a loss."
Hate is heavy. Let it go.
Sometimes being alone is the upgrade.
Stop expecting loyalty from people who can’t give you honesty.
"If they come back to you, don’t forget how they left."
Be thankful for the real ones in your life.
mood: to be with you rn
Happiness makes people prettier. It’s a noticeable glow.
Life’s better when nobody knows anything about you.
missing your bestfriend is a different type of sadness
Always tell someone how you feel because opportunities are lost in the blink of an eye but regret can last for a lifetime.
"People come and go, but life is simply about seeing who cares enough to stay."
"I don't hate you, I'm just dissapointed you turned into everything you said you'd never be."
Shoutout to everyone trying right now. Trying to do the right thing. Trying to hold on. Trying to let go. Trying to love themselves. Trying to find happiness. Trying to stay strong. We’re in this together.
Everything happens for a reason.
"Please love me from your heart, not according to your mood and need."
Take me to the place where only happiness exist.
You’ll succeed. Even if it takes time. You’ll make it.
Self-love is the biggest flex.
I hope your heart finds peace.
Sometimes I really wanna be heartless too but that’s not who I am.
"Never make a decision when you are angry, never make a promise when you are happy."
"Be a good person in real life, not just on social media."
"""I saw your tweet, you okay?"" I really appreciate this kind of person."
"I be like ""idc"" then start overthinking."
Find someone who shares the same vibes as yours.
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.
"I don’t want perfect, I want worth it."
"I notice everything, sometimes I just act like I don’t."
Sorry for being a typical boring person to talk.
I hate giving up on people but I hate forcing shit even more.
You only deserve someone who is sure about you.
Life is teaching me a lot right now.
Unexpected friendship is the best.
Too many people are trying to find the right person instead of being the right person.
Being kissed while you're asleep is one of the most purest forms of love.
You know someone means a lot to you when their mood affects yours.
"if you're meant to be with someone, it will work out. whether it's next month or in five years, what's meant to be will always be."
If you’re reading this I hope something good happens to you today.
you make me smile without trying
"i love you still, i always will."
Willing to take risks with you.
"i love clingy, only when its from u"
I automatically smile when you message me.
Not everyone around you is your friend.
If you lost me you will never find me.
Use your brain to protect your heart from pain.
Some memories hurt.
I get tired of me too.
Scared of losing you.
"Between them all, I chose you."
"I’m shy at first, but if you get to know me I’m the most annoying person you’ve ever met."
The last person you think about before you fall asleep is the one who truly owns your heart.
I didn't plan falling in love with you it just happened.
"dear music, thanks"
"if i could turn my sadness into cash, damn i'm rich."
Just wanna be happy in life tbh.
All I want is to rest now.
I’m deadly tired.
I need someone who appreciates my efforts.
Letting you go is not easy.
My silence spoke a thousand words but you never heard them.
There’s so much I wanna say but if I talk about it I’ll start crying.
"You can't change how people feel about you, so don't try. Just live your life and be happy."
Acceptance is hard.
I went through my darkest times alone so I'm sorry if I act like I don't need anyone.
I can’t wait for the day that proves all of this was worth it.
don't: - cheat - please everyone - settle for less - cry over someone  know: - your worth - that you matter - that you're loved - how to pray - how to say thank you  its: - okay to make mistakes - okay to fall down - not bad to cry when tired - good to smile - time to move on
There are a lot of unsaid thoughts in my head right now.
never wanna feel that pain again
"I wanna build a relationship with someone who cares about ""why"" I've been quiet all day. Not someone who gets mad cause I'm ""acting different”."
"I think the hardest decision, is when you need to choose between what is right and what makes you happy."
"When you're with the right person, you don’t have to work so hard to be happy. It just happens."
Once you find your person there’s nobody else you want.
Two types of me: 1) wanna talk to you 2) don't wanna bother you
The best apology is changed behavior.
Forget the mistake. Remember the lesson.
Real feelings don’t change fast.
Unexpected messages from someone you missed or care about are the best type of messages.
"Someday, I’ll be someone’s first priority. Maybe."
Overthinking is the biggest cause of our unhappiness. Keep yourself occupied. Keep your mind off things that dont help you. Think positive.
"Be strong, s e l f."
Always choose to be happy.
Keep Smiling. Keep shining.
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
"To those having a hard time right now realize, it’s only temporary."
You’re lucky if you found a person who never gets tired of your mood swings.
Hearing “im so proud of you” when you feel like you aren’t doing enough really does lift a lot of weight off of you.
Remember: “Your mental health is important.”
Sometimes the worst place you can be is in your own head.
"I trusted you, you lied."
"When you’re tempted to quit, remember your “why” you started."
"Depression isn’t always sadness, it can also be emptiness, anger, tiredness or loneliness, sometimes a cry for help isn’t so visible."
"I want to refresh my mind, clear all my problems and just have fun with life."
i can turn from a softie to cold as fuck
"Respect the people who find time in their schedule to see you, and love the people who never look at their schedule when you need them."
I am the type of person who will stay committed as long as you do the same.
"If you’ve been broken and still have the courage to be gentle to others, you deserve love deeper than the ocean itself."
"I’m so exhausted. I feel like I’m repeating the same day over and over, the same routine, same feelings, same meaningless drama. I’m so sick of it, I just want to feel alive and be happy but I’m constantly drained and everything feels so pointless. I just feel dead."
A tear is made of 1% water and 99% feelings.
"Rest when you’re tired, never quit."
"When I'm alone, I think too much."
I appreciate those who ask if I’m okay.
Find someone who knows how to love you when you are sad.
Be patient. God wants you to have the best.
i give silent treatment when im sad
Self comfort is not easy.
You glow different when your soul is happy.
Loyalty is rare.
"Dear Life, Why we fall inlove with people we can't have?"
Save your heart for someone who cares.
old messages really hit when you know that the bond is never coming back.
People who start conversations are my favorite kind of people.
nothing hurts more than being ignored.
"“you’ve changed” - no, i am learning and growing"
i automatically say idk when i’m too lazy to think
i wish i can turn back time and fix what's needed to fix.
“you deserve better“ nah why can’t you be better?
do    not          come    back           to        me           when      you           realize        no           one cared           like                    i                      did
a smiling face doesn't always mean a happy heart.
Life is full of shit. You'll just have to deal with it.
"We don’t need to talk every day to be friends. If you need me, I got you."
Stuck between “I need to save money” and “you only live once”
I owe myself an apology for all the shit i let slide.
Your trauma is not your fault but healing is your responsibility.
"Have you ever just stopped and realized that if you hadn't met a certain person in your life, your life would be completely different"
Friendship isn't about who you have known the longest. It's about who came and never left your side.
it’s attractive when you get the same effort you give.
"never get too comfortable, people change all the time."
A partner with the same vibe as yours &gt;&gt;&gt;
"Keep healing, it looks good on you."
"It's about who stays, not who promised."
"If they don’t respect your feelings, they don’t deserve to be in your life."
"I may regret the way we ended, but I will never regret what we had."
"Trust what you feel, not what you hear."
i will never give up on u ily
I will always choose you.
missing my fav person every night.
Real love never ends.
"If you're mine, you're mine. I'm not sharing you with anyone else."
I hate seeing anyone getting close to you.
"Yes, I'm jealous but I keep it inside."
"I’m ugly, I know."
Be my baby and my bestfriend.
"Hey u, yeah you, I love u."
"Depression is when you don’t really care about anything. Anxiety is when you care too much, and over think everything. Having both is hell."
Even the kindest hearts get tired too.
silent crying hurts the most
"If not me, I pray u find the right one."
"My life, my choices, my mistakes, my lessons. Not your business."
Learning to stay calm when you feel disrespected is a different type of growth.
realizing i don’t care anymore is the best feeling
"You can replace me, but you can't replace the memories."
sometimes silence is better than arguing.
"I love being Alone, I hate feeling Alone.......It's a difference"
Be good to people for no reason.
"4 important life lessons:  1. If they want to leave, let them. 2. In loss and failure there’s opportunity for growth. 3. Keep less friends that add more value, than a lot of friends that add little value. 4. Let go of anything and anyone that pulls you back from your greatness."
Every night I think about all the mistakes I’ve made and how much I regret making those decisions because my life could have been different.
Finding both love and friendship in one person is the best thing that can happen.
Maturity is when you keep your mouth shut when you want to say something mean to someone. Only people at peace with themselves can do this.
"I’m not your free time or second choice, prioritize me or leave me alone."
behind my smile is a story you'll never understand.
Nothing hurts more than trying your absolute best and still not being good enough.
I stay up late every night then regret it in the morning and the next day I do it all over again.
Keep it private. People love to ruin things.
Old songs still have the most beautiful lyrics.
i’m sorry i wasn’t good enough but i tried to be.
I always motivate someone but I can’t motivate myself.
Falling in love is not a choice. To stay in love is.
"i want you, i need you, i miss you."
maturity is when a person hurts you and you try to understand their situation and don’t hurt them back.
if u defend my name when im not around I truly appreciate u
Not everyone’s “I love you” is sincere.
the most comforting sound is your voice.
my day be so fine then BOOM  i start overthinking
Be with someone who’s in the mood for you everyday.
Can we just skip the sad parts?????
Don’t hurt the person God sent to heal you.
The right person will make you fall in love with yourself too.
Bad chapters can still create good stories.
your reply is my happiness
I need a break from everything.
"You learn, you change, you grow."
"Pray. Things will get better, not now but soon."
long walks with the right person
Pay attention to who’s happy for you when you’re happy.
Sometimes it feels better not to talk.
"Make sure your circle has quality, not quantity."
Time always reveals what you mean to someone.
"If I date you, I won’t control you. Do what you want. Your actions will tell me how much you respect the relationship."
Stay patient and trust your journey.
Hearing “i miss you” or “i want to see you again” from your favorite person puts you in the best mood.
How to save your heart:  1. should:  • never expect  • never demand  • never assume  2. know:  • your limits  • where you stand  • your role  3. don't:  • get affected  • get jealous  • get paranoid  4. just:   • go with the flow and be happy  • stay positive
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile.
"when someone has seen the worst parts of u &amp; still decides to stay, that's when you know they’re worth keeping. not everyone is willing to stick with u when times get tough. appreciate those who remain by your side, they’re the ones who deserve u at ur absolute best."
Being toxic is not cute. Grow up and learn how to love properly.
I don’t hate you. I just lost my respect for you.
I barely got friends but I got the right ones.
Anything you love requires patience.
Only those who love you can hear you when you’re quiet.
Trust your first instinct.
Be a private person. Live peacefully.
sometimes hug is all we need.
Genuine people are rare.
Always choose the love that will help you grow.
It’s time to choose yourself first.
"Sometimes you have to make a decision that will hurt your heart, but heal your soul."
You deserve to be loved the way you love.
Never give up on prayer. God sometimes answer in unexpected ways.
"dear bestfriend, thank you for being my unpaid therapist."
How can I forget you if you've given me so much to remember?
i wish i was someone’s fav
"if you don't mean it, don't fucking say it"
i get jealous very fast
you are enough.   you are good enough.   you are smart enough.   you are strong enough.   you are beautiful enough.   you are kind enough.   you are brave enough.   you are enough and you will always be.
Don’t overthink. Just let it go!
"Fall in love with someone who wants you, who waits for you. who understands you even in the madness; someone who helps you, and guides you, someone who is your support, your hope. fall in love with someone who talks with you after a fight."
It’s so attractive when someone shows they care.
sometimes you just gotta play your music louder than your thoughts.
She's broken because she trusted you.
Don’t ever judge anyone on how they handle a pain you’ve never felt.
"not suicidal, but wanna disappear for awhile"
"people ask me, why is it so hard to trust people?  i ask, why is it so hard to keep a promise?"
To achieve anything in life you have to believe that you can.
"sleep late, wake up late, regret, repeat."
It's never too late to do better.
You are worth more than your mistakes.
No regrets in life just lessons learned.
I hate when people assume shit. Just ask me &amp; I'll tell you.
sometimes home is a person.
all good things take time.
"Another day to live, another day to be grateful."
trust me i'm lucky to have you.
I love you so much no matter what.
forehead kisses is only for a special someone
find someone who believes in you when you don’t.
Can I run away from life?
I don't want temporary shit.
"Yes, I'm smiling, but deep down I'm crying."
Need so much hug from you.
im sad without you
"I just want someone to look at me and say, “she’s worth everything.”"
"i don't deserve someone better, i deserve a better you."
quick replies make me happy
I want to be with you all the time.
music is lowkey therapy.
"my twitter, my tweets, my life, my rants, my feelings."
"when it hurts, just sleep."
i grew up without sharing my problems to my parents.
i want to delete my entire existence
i wish i can run to you and hold you
"once you break my trust, it's hard to get it back."
call me for no reason i love hearing your voice
"not friends or enemies, just strangers with memories."
"still a ""HAHAHAHAHA"" person though i'm hurting that much."
"my attitude gets bad when i'm tired or sad, sorry."
i want to talk to you more
"your message is not just a message, it's my happiness."
"deleting pictures is so difficult for me, i can't even let go of a random screenshot."
"i say ""idk"" to everything when im not in the mood to talk."
Find someone who understands your silence.
Not proud of my actions recently but I'm really trying to be better.
Be careful who you open up to. Only a few actually care.
Silence is a girl’s loudest cry...
i look at ur pics when i miss u
Distance gives us a reason to love even harder.
Boys never realize how much one little thing can hurt a girl..
"I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what the reason was."
I still fall for you every single day.
All good things are worth waiting for and worth fighting for.
songs explain what i can’t explain
"""relax i'm yours""  what i really wanna hear when my stupid ass be overthinking"
I distance myself for a reason.
"I am not everyone's favorite, but cheers to those who appreciate me."
Hardest part was having to pretend it doesn't hurt at all.
"People come and go, but life is simply about seeing who cares enough to stay."
I was quiet but not blind.
can’t wait for the day when somebody tells me i’m the best thing that’s ever happened to them and they mean it.
The lyrics hit different when you can relate.
You can’t please everybody.
"Relationships are so scary to me... No matter how good things are going or how in love you are, your significant other could always just lose feelings for you and be gone just like that."
"i care, but i’m done trying"
always grateful for everything.
I pray I get the future I’ve always talked about having.
Don’t beg anyone to stay.

i need someone who never changes
"we may not talk, but i still care"
it’s all about that one person you think about whenever music plays.
REMEMBER:  You can’t force people to appreciate you. You can’t force people to be loyal to you. You can’t force people to treat you right. You can’t force people to be honest with you. You definitely can’t force people to love you.
Do it for your damn self.

"When two people really care about each other, they will always look for a way to make it work, no matter how hard it is."
Single doesn't always mean lonely and relationship doesn't always mean happy.
I keep a lot to myself because it's hard to find people who understand.
we all hurt ourselves through expectations
"If you really care about someone, you work shit out. You won’t just leave."
I wish I could block my thoughts and feelings.
"If she mentions it more than once, it bothers her, just remember that."
"If you’re ever stuck between me and another person, don’t pick me. I’m good."
I changed myself for myself.
i'm not showy but i care about u a lot
"be patient with yourself, you are growing stronger everyday."
Sometimes we expect more from others because we'd be willing to do that much for them.
Positivity is a choice.

Your voice melts my heart.
You're the best part of my life.

"Sometimes the girl that has been there for everyone else, needs someone to be there for her."
Being a sleepy girl with a busy life is so hard.
Be weird. Be positive. Be open minded. Be happy.
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone how much they mean to you.
A healthy relationship doesn’t drag you down. It inspires you to be better.
i’m fucking trying my best

There will never be another you.

sometimes it’s better to say nothing
"as long as u r trying, i’m staying"

Not everyone deserves to know the real you.
I just wanna travel the world.

I distance myself from people for a reason.
"People come and go in your life, but the right ones will always stay."
"Girls don’t stalk, they investigate."
you won’t have to convince or beg the right person to be in your life. they’ll appreciate &amp; value you on their own. they’ll love you for you &amp; what you bring to the table. don’t settle for someone who makes you feel like you aren’t enough. don’t become someone you’re not for love
Be loyal behind my back.
"stay busy, they don't deserve you."
"I know you’ve been doubting your progress, regretting your choices, putting yourself down. Please Remember that you are doing just fine. Remind yourself right now that no matter what it looks like, you are doing the best you can. Always encourage, support and believe in yourself."
I am okay &amp; not okay at the same time.
being alone really makes you realize a lot of shit.
true friends are always there for you
you are the only one my heart wants
i really hope this shit ends soon
music is a life saver.
don’t lose people who are rare to find
I don’t think people understand how stressfull it is to explain what’s going on in your head when you don’t even understand it yourself.

"Good relationships don’t just happen. They take time, patience, and two people who truly want to be together."
So many people from your past know a version of you that no longer exists.
I’ve been in such a “I don’t even care” mood lately.
"unfollow, block, unfriend anyone who disturbs your inner peace. protect your mental health at all cost."
i just need someone to stay and never leave.
"someone who wants you, will make you feel wanted"
Everyone deserves someone that can make their heart forget that it was ever broken.

Be with someone who feels like home.
"With you, it's different."
"people get tired of me and then leave, but they don't know that i am tired also but i stayed."
an immature person will never appreciate a heart like yours
It sucks to be understanding but never understood.
start your day with a smile
I wish I hugged you tighter the last time I saw you.
you have no idea how much i love you.
having clingy but mature partner is perfect.
You are the risk I will always be willing to take.
can i just deactivate myself
I want a peace of mind and a happy heart.
Let’s switch places so you’ll feel what I felt. Maybe then you’ll understand.
"I disappear sometimes, that’s my thing."
I hope you find someone who doesn’t make you sad at night and doesn’t make you second guess their love for you.
You deserve someone who isn’t confused about the feelings they have for you.
I hate being stuck between “keep trying” and “why bother”
"Sometimes people need their space. They’re not cutting you off, they just need time to breathe and take care of themselves. They need some space to work on themselves. That has nothing to do with you."
"lights off, good music &amp; chill."
never use a person to forget another.
Tweeting your emotions is better than telling it to someone or anyone who doesn't even care.
Everyone deserve a person that can make their heart forget the trauma in the past.
i wish someone misses me too
You’re not selfish for wanting the same love and energy you give.
Sleeping is nice. You get to forget about everything for awhile.

Everything you do comes back to you.
"stop looking for reasons to be unhappy, look for more reasons to be happy."
You can't control everything. Sometimes you just need to relax and have faith things will work out. Let go a little and let life happen.
things will get better. things will get better. things will get better.
Maybe one day I’ll be enough for someone.
i’m so lost as a person
"I may have lost someone who didn't love me, but you lost someone who truly loved you."
"Pain changes people. It makes them overthink, trust less, feel worthless &amp; shut people out."
Be the reason someone believes in the goodness of people.
Mood: Tired of getting my hopes up for things that will never happen.
u had my whole heart u really did
"It’s ok to not be ok all the time. Without the bad times, you won’t appreciate the good times."
normalize being nice for no reason.
i have a “why am i like this” moment at least five times a day.
"you are enough, always remember that."
we all have our own version of loneliness
"Please, value yourself more."
"i'm not a materialistic person, a simple hug can make me smile"
"Some people change so suddenly;  they might make you feel so important today, but can also make you feel worthless tomorrow."
anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks
You know you're mature when you don't force people to stay in your life anymore.
I remember when we used to talk everyday; I miss that.
One day you will realize how much I care.
Fact: People leave when they find someone better.
"I choose to love you silently, for in silence, there will be no rejection."

"i love music, especially ur voice"
you deserve someone who will do everything to keep u
No one knows how much I cried that day.
I wish I could tell someone everything.
"never get too comfortable, people change all the time"
"From now on, I must focus on fixing myself. That’s a promise."
"life's too short to tolerate shit that don't make you happy, so do what makes you happy."
Positive mind =  positive life.
I deserve someone who actually cares.
"I'm fine, I just miss talking with you."
You will heal when you are ready to.
One of the most difficult task in life is removing someone from your heart.
i’m such a “no it’s okay” and suffer in silence type of person.
Unfortunately I'm the type of person you can screw over 1 million times and I would still be there for you if you needed me.
my mama did not raise a fool. maybe a psycho but not a fool.
imagine having someone that understands your mind.
I waited for you and now i have you.
Be careful what you tolerate. You’re teaching people how to treat you...
keep your whole life lowkey and let people assume incorrectly
Me + Bed = Best couple ever
Be strong and move on. It's your time to be happy again.
"if you don’t want me, tell me. i hate wasted time &amp; energy"
so thankful that my parents raised me well.
i miss being excited about something.
i'm trying my best. that is enough.

I am changing. I am growing. I am becoming better.
self love is important.
Sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself.
don’t make me feel special and leave like i never mattered
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay."
7 billion smiles and yours is my favorite
"be nice but learn to say ""no"""
I get sad. I get insecure. I get jealous. I get lonely. I overreact. I make mistakes.  But I promise I will always give you my best.
The right people understand you differently.
i prayed for you.
"damn, i'm so in love with you."
my heart wants you.
i wanna be hugged till i fall asleep
Notice everything but be quiet.
need that “i only want you “ energy
you are not afraid of new love. you are afraid of old pain.
Please be real. Don't play with someone's heart just to make yourself happy.
"You don’t need a lot of friends, just the right ones."
Risking is better than regretting.
if airplane tickets were free you'd never see me again.
Keep it private until you know it’s permanent.
"with or without conversation, trust me i'm still into you."
talk to God before you sleep
Twitter is a place to confess your feelings.
"dear heart, please keep me strong"
outside: okay inside: empty
you know what hurts? when people just become memories.
"People will always notice the change in your attitude towards them, but they will never notice it's their behavior that made your change."
Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own.
Some endings don't have proper goodbyes.
Find a person who feels proud for having you.
i deserve to be happy &amp; that’s all i want for myself.
can I airplane mode my life?
I'm disappointed but not surprised.
"Be patient, have faith, the best is yet to come."
i wish i can hug u whenever i miss you
"it's okay if your heart feels heavy, your emotions and feelings are always valid. take a deep breath, I promise your heart will feel lighter eventually. it will take time, but you will feel better. you're here. you're going to be okay. it's going to be okay."

"Don't force someone to make time for you, if they really want to, they will."
"Dear God,   If I'm wrong, correct me. If I'm lost, guide me. If I'm in pain, heal me.  If I started to give up, give me strength to keep going."
I wanna sleep the whole day.
"Sometimes, we need to accept the fact that things will never be the same again."
Too tired to keep trying.
"""Are you taken?""  Me: Yes, taken for granted."
I want to spend every night with you.
Just in case you have forgotten today:  You matter. You are loved. You are worthy. You are magical.
"Be patient and wait on someone that will love you consistently. Stop wasting your time on people who treat you good one day then act like you don't exist the next day. You deserve someone who always checks on you and make you feel special, loved, and appreciated everyday."
"unsaid feelings, i hate that shit"
No matter how hard; No matter how far; No matter how slow; K E E P   G O I N G!
There's a rainbow after the rain. There's a joy after the pain.
You will always be my favorite notification.
"I'm strong, but not all the time."
"I made someone smile, I made someone laugh but damn, I forgot my own happiness."
Don't make a promise you can't keep.
A person who cares silently is a person who loves truly.
I get jealous when someone's else has your attention.
"I want you, nothing else but you."
the most comforting sound is your voice.
a lot of shit changed me
you're so lucky when you have someone who genuinely wants to talk to you everyday.
One small positive thought can change your whole day.
"i dont want others attention, i want yours."
"Don't cry over the past, it's gone. Don't stress about the future, it hasn't arrived. Live in the present and make it beautiful."
"If you don't do stupid things while you're young, you'll have nothing to smile about when you're old."
The people who truly care will always find a way back into your life.
"If you’re looking for advice right now, the answer is self care."
"its hard to let go of ppl u thought would be there forever. especially if they were a big part of ur life, then u have to replan ur future w/o them. but if they’re meant to be in ur life, you’ll cross paths again. sometimes u go as far as u can with someone &amp; u have to grow apart"
"Every time I trust somebody, they show me why I shouldnt"
I was never a jealous or insecure person until I was shown that I was so easy to throw away for just about anything.
you’re the one i’d do my best to keep
I act like nothing happened when it hurts.
Don't become who hurt you.
i wish you cared the same way i do
"To my favorite person:  I've been thinking of you every second, every minute, every hour, and every day. I always care for you, just be safe."
nothing is more heartbreaking than when you try your hardest and it still isn't enough
Everything's gonna be alright.
My mood changes like 70 times a day
Sometimes you have no choice but to move on.
Choose Support. Choose Respect. Choose Kindness.
only you can give me that feeling.
all I want in life is happiness
eyes talk better than words sometimes
Worry less. Smile more. Be yourself. Be grateful. Be happy.
having me is so boring ikr
you give me feelings i can’t explain
talking to you makes everything better
that shit hurts but i act like idc
Actions speak louder than words. So believe what you see and forget what you heard.
Trying to forget it but the memories are too strong.
"im the loudest and quietest person, it depends on who im with."
"if i care for you, i care until the end."
from “chatting” to “ghosting” real quick
maybe one day i’ll meet someone who looks at me and sees forever.
3 things to keep quiet..   1) Your love life. 2) Your income. 3) Your next move
"someday, someone will love you and you will forget why others couldn't"
old songs hold a special place in my heart.
"if it makes u happy, go for it."
Don’t break my trust.
Im happier around you.
i pray i don’t lose you
One smile can start a friendship. One word can end a fight. One look can save a relationship. And one person can change your life.
i still dream about you
If i told you i love you i meant that.
"i love you, always and forever."
"I can’t replace you, no one is you."
trust me im always here for u
you're always in my prayers.
It's funny how we do stupid things just to make someone happy.
"Loving someone should bring out the best in you, not the worst in you."
"Between sleeping and talking to you, I will always choose a conversation with you. That's how special you are to me."
hug me till i forget all my sadness.
I fall in love with the little details.
soon I'll make my parents proud.
Stay strong. Even when it feels like everything is falling apart.
Sometimes the only person you can count on is yourself.
"we no longer go for looks, we go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace."
make memories with the right people.
Sometimes you have to vibe alone to really understand some things.
Losing toxic people is a win.
eventually everyone leaves.
I changed. A lot.
don’t break someone who trusted you.
Loyalty means everything.
"take care always, i love you."
"i suffered, i learned, i changed."
i need someone to tell me that i'm not as bad as i think i am.
"without music, life would be so boring"
private relationship ft. true feelings
"twitter is my daily diary, tbh."
"when i'm into you, no other person gets the same attention."
"I am both ""fast replier"" and ""never replies"" type of person, it depends on my mood."
Real love won't quit on you.
"I just want peace, no heartaches, no tears, no pain."
Don’t get surprised by how fast people can change.
You can't please everybody.
"I was hurt the whole time, I just didn't say anything"
I'm working on being a better me for me.
"Patience is the key, because when the right time comes, it will be very beautiful and totally worth the wait."
You can be kind and still say no.
My mind really needs a mute button.
Don't waste your time stressing about things you can't change. Relax.
"Trust the vibes you get, energy doesn't lie."
"Stuck between idk, idc &amp; idgaf."
"Learn to wait, there is always time for everything."
accept the situation and move on with smile.
"keep pursuing your goals whether you're alone, broke, tired or scared. keep going"
Never ignore a person who loves you and cares for you. One day you may realize you've lost the moon while counting the stars.
don't ever lie to me to protect my feelings.
No one deserves to be a pastime.
I always end up saying I'm fine even though I'm deeply hurt inside.
"One thing I learned in life.   You can be important to someone, but not all the time."
You hate me?   It's okay. I wasn't born to please everyone.
"I may not mention you on any social media posts, but I always mention you in my prayers and I think it's way sweeter."
I'm a person who hides a thousand feelings.
"I won't call but I care, I won't text but I think of you everytime, I won't meet, but I always miss you, I won't say, but I always love you."
"Bitch please, I don’t care if you don’t like me."
"No matter how much it hurts now, someday you will look back and realize your struggles changed your life for the better."
We aren't afraid of love; we are afraid of not being loved in return.
Feel the pain until it hurts no more.
I need extra love these days.
i'm jealous over what's mine
"life will teach you to never depend on anybody, ever."
Everyone needs someone to ignore the world with.
Be thankful for the real ones in your life.
sometimes letting go is better than holding on.
it sucks when you don’t receive the same energy you give.
You can't feel my pain.
Know your position in someone’s life and act accordingly.
You glow different when your soul is happy.
Life’s better when nobody knows anything about you.
I have so much of you in my heart.
"i’m just focusing on becoming a better version of me, physically, mentally, and emotionally."
Leave if you aren’t getting what you deserve.
I wish i could re-live some moments.
Sometimes distance is the only way to find peace.
Hard times will always reveal true friends.
Don't make someone feel special if you have no intention of staying.
"Learn to be done with people. Not mad, not bothered. Just done."
"Dear self, stop expecting too much."
i miss the life without covid.
I appreciate those who stayed when im at my lowest.
"smile, like nothing happened"
"One day, someone will choose you and keep on choosing you everyday."
i miss the old you. the one that cared about me
I talk too much when I like someone.
finding someone who understands your pain
tired of wasting my effort on people who don’t deserve it
"if i send you ugly selfies, just know that our friendship is real"
"there's no reason to cheat, if you're contented."
I still pray for you and for your happiness.
Never regret the things that once made you happy.
"If I tell you my problems, it means I trust you."
Treat her like you're still trying to win her &amp; that's how you'll never lose her.
having atleast one person who truly believe &amp; appreciates u is a blessing
be kind. be honest.
Shit happens. Things go wrong. Life goes on.
be with someone who says let’s fix this “i can’t lose you”
prayer is the best healer
i love looking at you.
trust me i want you and only you
"i love vowels, specially u"
"No matter how hard the past, you can always begin again."
i’m very soft please take care of me
Hug me tight. I like that.
Being attracted to someone's smile is a real thing.
Nothing kills you like your mind.
I miss the old version of too many people.
imagine meeting someone who has the same mindset and vibe as you
"It’s all inside, no words out."
everything feels better with you.
stop being nice if it breaks you.
Having someone who has your back is one of the greatest blessings ever
"stressful days, sleepless nights"
i just feel like i am not needed.
don’t come closer unless you plan to stay.
"happy or sad, i always listen to music."
"Be patient, have faith, the best is yet to come."
find someone that accepts all sides of you.
i miss you everyday my love
i do stupid things when im jealous
if i trust u please don’t hurt me i barely ever trust anyone.
your hug is all i want when i'm sad
"If you want me, show me. If you have me, fight for me. If you love me, prove it."
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
We become cold to avoid getting hurt.
"yes, tell me about your day and how you're feeling, i care."
"you are enough, more than enough."
"hey you! don’t give up, okay?"
hurt me with the truth but never lie to me
"if i show you my stupid side, know you’re so special."
"i know we can't see each other rn, but i hope we will meet soon so i can hug u"
Everything is fine when your favorite person is around.
"nothing hurts more than being ignored, replace, forgotten, or lied to"
i wanna travel and never come back.
Never reply when you are angry. Never make a promise when you are happy. Never make a decision when you are sad.
"strong mind, fragile heart."
eyes talk better than words
It’s hopeless but i’m still hoping.
you mean a lot to me
wish i could tell you what’s really on my mind.
“one day you’ll realize“
you will never find a heart like mine.
"i don’t even ask for too much, i just need peace and enough sleep"
I honestly need a break from my own thoughts.
i miss when everything was okay.
so many feelings we can’t explain.
Promises without actions are nothing.
"Make a decision, and never look back."
music is so better than people.
"Always love people from your heart, not from your mood or needs."
"Do whatever makes you happy, the days aren’t coming back."
i care a lot until i don’t care at all.
"same person, same pain"
Unplanned moments are the best moments.
You never know what someone is going through. Be kind. Always.
Train your mind to be stronger than your feelings.
be with someone who supports you 100%
"One day, all the pain will make sense."
Never tell people more than they need to know.
"half strong, half broken."
Bestfriends make life so much better.
"smiling has always been easier, than explaining why you are sad."
delete the old version of me from your mind.
i believe in using songs to say things.
my heart is different now
"Sometimes, it is much better to be alone rather than being surrounded by people so close to you but often make you feel worthless."
sometimes you just need to wait and pray.
i miss hugging and kissing you
"once i like someone, i really be ignoring everyone else"
"i’ll always choose u, even at days we don’t understand each other"
forget the pain but keep the lessons you've learned.
"i don’t know what i did to deserve you, but i’m eternally grateful for it."
never expect never assume
peole change and yeah sometimes it hurts
still young no need to rush everything
“i apologize if i ever was the toxic person in someones life.”
wanna lay on your shoulders and forget everything
you'll always be my boo.
one notification from u gives me millions of happiness
no girl deserves to wake up &amp; feel like she’s not enough.
I think it's brave that you continue to love despite of being hurt.
don't give up just because things got hard.
i wish memories left when people did
being understood without having to explain yourself is the best kind of feeling.
remember that the right person will never get tired of you
a simple okay hides thousands of feelings.
You deserve a love you always pray for.
i break my own heart by caring too much.
"I'm a private person so if i open up with you, damn i trust you."
"i’ll always love you, i promise."
My heart is full of you.
"In the end, i hope it’s you."
Never change to be accepted by others. Stay weird and crazy.
"You smile, I fall deeper."
"When we first met, I had no idea you'd become so important to me."
"be a better you, for you."
"one day, u gonna have everything u've prayed for."
high hopes for better days
me??? tired??? stressed??? exhausted??? i wanna cry??? yes
Don’t use people to fill your emptiness.
i’d like to disappear for a while.
Everything I love breaks me a little.
I wish I could get paid to sleep. I would be so rich.
"if u need me, i’m always here"
Sometimes the best response is to say nothing.
Every pain has an end.
I am toxic to myself sometimes.
"How are you? ̶s̶a̶d̶,̶ ̶b̶r̶o̶k̶e̶n̶,̶ ̶d̶e̶f̶e̶a̶t̶e̶d̶,̶ ̶c̶r̶u̶s̶h̶e̶d̶,̶ ̶l̶o̶n̶e̶l̶y̶,̶ ̶f̶a̶l̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶p̶a̶r̶t̶ “I’m fine.”"
i want you to feel what i feel.
“You look happy” is one of the best compliments to get.
"Still, i believe that prayer works."
You glow different when you let that hurt go.
Making mistakes is better than faking perfections.
i hate it when i’m sad and have no one to talk to.
being valued feels so much better.
"breakdown now, fight and survive later."
A better you is coming.
Never waste your feelings on people who don’t value you.
I am so lost inside my own head.
retweet if you miss someone rn.
Stay loyal or stay away from me.
Trust what you feel not what you hear.
Don’t be afraid to start over again.
"Dear Self,  You deserve the best."
Choose what makes your heart happy.
It's okay not to be okay.
getting uglier day by day.
"I may not be a showy-type person, but believe me, I always care."
a lot of shit changed me.
i’m sorry i can’t be perfect.
I miss the person who always makes me smile.
I wanna feel special.
May you meet someone who’ll know how to calm your storms.
Sometimes simple efforts mean so much.
"Fall in love when you’re ready, not when you’re lonely."
May you receive what you've always been praying for.
"Give people as much as they give to you, don’t waste your 100% for their 10%"
always in the mood to sleep
so tired of feeling this feeling
ignore me and I’ll do the same
overthinking is such a silent killer.
Can someone please be proud of me like f*ck I’m trying.
I feel like I no longer have the energy to put effort into anything.
unsaid feelings really hurt.
"yes we don't talk, but i still care."
"the most attractive thing to me is effort.someone who really wants to talk to me,wants to see me,wants to make me a part of their day."
the worst feeling is not knowing if you should wait or give up.
can??? i??? just??? delete??? my??? insecurities???
"once you learn how to control your emotions, you win the game."
"I rarely react, but I always notice."
you're still my happy pill.
we all have broken our rules for someone.
"i’m sorry, i’m not the best person you have wished for."
"""you never talk"" Yeah I'm depressed"
"This is the problem with getting attached to someone. When they leave, you just feel lost."
"sometimes, memories are the reason why forgetting is hard."
be humble enough to apologize when you're wrong.
"Finding someone who thinks you’re interesting enough to talk to you everyday, whether they’re a friend or a lover, is one of the best feelings ever."
i just want u to be fine always
I want something good to happen.
Whenever I get hurt something inside me just shuts off.
"Tell me a lie. ""i am okay"""
"Have you ever tried to share your problem with somone because you can't handle it anymore but instead of sharing them you chose not to, because you think that you might just bother them"
nothing excites me anymore.
"Love is not about how much you say ""I Love You"" But how much you can PROVE that it's true."
"Rule number 1:   If they didn’t invite you,  don’t ask to go."
I hope life will get better soon.
"I thought I was special, until I saw you treating others the same way."
"we are strangers, again"
i crave for peace of mind.
"sun after rain, love after pain."
Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary.
The best revenge is to show them that your life is getting better after they’re gone.
some parts of you just never heal.
Be real with me or just leave me alone.
i’m in a complicated relationship with my own mind.
I hope better days are coming.
I deserve someone who actually cares about me.
Words can't hurt physically but can damage emotionally.
I hope something good happens to you today.
friendship and love in one person
I feel safe with you.
"to my happy pill, thankyou for making me happy. ilysm. ♥️"
Im so lonely without you.
i hide my feelings a lot.
eye contacts that end up with a smile.
11:11 always you
i dont like sharing my fav person
a man with respect and manners is a real definition of handsome.
"lowkey, wanna restart my whole life"
overthinking hits hardest at night.
"i'm strong, but i cry too."
the way i smile when i think about you
"""you've changed"", i'm glad i did."
"To be with you, thats all I want."
My twitter. My tweets. My life.
"dear money, i need you right now"
A break from everything would be nice.
can i just sleep and ignore the world?
Expectations will always disappoint you.
Choose people that choose you. The end.
RIP to those unsaid words left unsaid.
"i be like ""i don't care"" then start crying."
heyyyy you’re worth it dear
"Same lies, different people."
I'm in Spain. The S is silent.
feeling unwanted changes you a lot.
i wanna mute my overthinking.
inhale the good shit exhale the bullshit
"self care is so important, pass it on."
take me back to the good old days
"I said it was fine, but I never said it didn't hurt."
"I just want to be appreciated, is that hard?"
deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
Music gives me a peace of mind.
I was ruined by the fact that I couldn’t do any better.
being a person who feels things deeply is exhausting.
"I still care, I am just done showing it."
"Let's just accept the fact that, no matter how hard you try, if a person is not interested to you, he/she will never love you back."
fake smiling even when hurting is a special skill.
Don't waste your time trying to get people to love you. Spend your time with those who already do.
"I really don’t want to be sad anymore, I'm so tired of it."
"To people who used me and took advantage of my kindness, my middle finger salutes you."
losing my mind but looking like I'm fine.
silent cries are the worst experiences of my life.
Stay positive. Stay fighting. Stay brave. Stay ambitious. Stay focused. Stay strong.
"yes i know i’m always moody and get sad really easily. but if you choose to love me despite all this, i promise, even if i’m broken, i will still give you my whole heart and all the love i have left in me."
"WORST FEELING,  being compared being ignored being rejected being replaced."
my mind never stopped thinking about u
i wish you cared as much as i did
dating someone who can stay kind even during fights is very important.
"This time, I'll prioritize my own happiness."
find someone who hates hurting ur heart
"When I'm sad, please don't ask me what's wrong, just hug me."
"As long as I can, I won't give up, but once I'm done, I'm done."
I hope you can find the right person who will never stop loving you and will keep on reminding you how worthy you are.
i spend 90% of my day overthinking.
"ten years from now, i want to see myself loving the same person i love today and that is you."
i’m bored and hungry and tired and disappointed.
I'll be okay... I just don't know when.
"please stay, even at my bad times."
Keeping myself busy to forget that I am sad.
i love a lowkey vibe. nobody knowing our business but us.
still waiting for that happy day.
I act like I don't care but deep inside i swear it hurts.
Your smile is everything to me.
I only want positive people around me.
My head is a very dark place.
I love you with every piece of my being.
Only God knows how hard it’s been.
you are not afraid of new love. you are afraid of old pain.
i’m proud of how hard you’re trying.
no more expectations from anyone.
you won’t find another me.
you know that feeling of just not knowing what to feel?
"as long as i can handle my sadness, i won't tell it to anyone."
real ones stays in bad times
I love spending time with you.
"i miss you, be safe everyday."
I’ll never forget the day we met.
You are so important to me.
Always thinkin bout you.
some conversations stay in my heart forever.
faith in God changes everything.
losing someone special changes you a lot.
i always hide what hurts me the most.
"You're the reason why I smile, and sometimes you're the reason why I cry."
i hate when people act like they don’t see my message.
being too happy is somehow scary.
"Full of mistakes, that’s who I am."
everything will be fine one day.
"when life gets hard, push harder."
I miss our old days filled with happiness.
some people will never appreciate what you do for them.
Maybe you're the right person but we're not in the right time.
being alone teaches you a lot.
Never lose hope. Good things will come. Soon.
I love you
"i found someone, i never want to lose. ♥️"
Not everyone deserves what you give.
wanna sit on a rooftop at 2am and talk about life..
i wish u could see the stupid smile i get whenever u message me
“that’s my girl” yes. yes i am. say it again.
I hate how i overthink every single night.
I need more hours with u.
"Crying is how your heart speaks,when your lips can't explain the pain you feel."
I have so much to say but no way to say it.
Find someone who will be happy to have you.
"mixed feelings, messy thoughts."
Missing my old life.
"Dear heart, get well soon."
I will love u silently.
"I am strong but, not all the time."
I see my future in you.
I get jealous even from stupid things.
i fall in love every time you smile.
I really hope tomorrow treats us well.
"If you love someone, pray for them. Pray for their peace. Pray for their growth. Pray for their success. Pray for their happiness."
Don't love too soon. Don't trust too fast. Don't quit too early. Don't expect too high. Don't talk too much.
i’m not the same person anymore.
someone out there feels better because you exist.
ignoring me is the way you lose me.
i hate how oversensitive i am
Tired eyes and a tired mind.
How many times can the same thing break your heart?
"i can’t make you understand what’s happening inside me, i can barely even explain it to myself."
"Sometimes God doesn't give you what you want, not because you don't deserve it, but because you deserve more. trust the process."
"If someone makes you think twice if they love you or not, leave."
"I don't lose people, people lose me."
All you need is someone to hold you when you’re too tired to hold yourself together.
I stress too much about things i have no control over.
forget who forgets you
talking to you makes me happy
"i don't care anymore, because at one point i cared too much."
Nobody wants to be treated like an option.
Save your heart for someone who deserves it.
Never be someone’s sometimes.
Real is rare.
"Find someone who isn’t afraid to admit that they miss you, who knows you aren’t perfect but treats you as if you are, who’s biggest fear is losing you, who says “I love you” and means it with all of their heart, someone who believes leaving and giving up isn’t an option."
wish i can mute my mind and feelings.
sorry i assume i was important.
Give your heart to a person who will make you a priority.
"If it's meant to be, it will be."
"When you can’t find the sunshine, be the sunshine."
"one day, the sadness will end."
Everything is temporary.
i need to rest my mind from everything.
she's a queen with or without you.
God hears your prayer. Keep praying and have faith.
A listener needs a listener too.
End things before they end you.
"quiet, but not blind."
Don’t break yourself to fix someone else.
Nobody knows the whole story.
"Sometimes, you hide your feelings from yourself too."
"I’m always waiting for something to happen, to change everything."
I miss you and i hate this and it hurts and i love you.
Being kind makes you prettier.
"if it keeps you happy, keep it private."
"Admit it, sometimes you say your true feelings through jokes."
"When someone truly cares about you, they make an effort not an excuse."
wanna say a lot of things but nevermind.
"i don't give up on people, they push me away."
one unexpected message can heal alot.
Sleeping is the best part of the day.
You can still love someone and let them go.
"idk how to flirt, so i'll just keep joking until you fall inlove with me hehe."
You just need to learn how to face everything alone.
i hate endings. i hate goodbyes. i hate change. but that is life. it must go on.
"stay please, i need you"
silence is better than explaining.
My mind needs to stop overthinking every damn thing.
Everything is becoming so confusing lately.
i need extra love and care these days.
I miss talking to you for hours.
"I don’t want anything, i just wanna feel ok."
"Be you, not who people want you to be."
"if you're not appreciated, leave."
"I don't talk a lot, but i know so much."
I deserve to be happy.
i just want more of you and less of the world.
sometimes you don't get answers and you have to find a way to make peace with that.
"if you can't be kind, be quiet."
don't expect a lot from anyone.
you're still young take your time.
what’s mine is mine go find your own.
"""sorry"" doesn't fix a broken heart."
right ones will always stay.
"i need more sleep, money, happiness."
nothing is better than talking to someone you're comfortable with.
stay strong for yourself
God knows how hard i try.
i love people who make me feel special.
I L O V E Y O U
only person i want is u
You’ll end up really disappointed if you think people will do for you as you do for them.
“what makes you happy?” sleep
"it's you, it's always you.."
happy memories can make you sad as well.
so many what if's
i wanna be someone's first choice ♡
"sleepless nights, endless thoughts."
I told you what hurt me most and you did it perfectly.
Always respect other peoples feelings.
My heart only belongs to you.
i literally love everything about you.
"you will always be my favorite, always."
"Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret."
"Sometimes there is no next time, no time outs, no second chances. Sometimes it's just now or never."
I wish all my nights were spent on the beach looking at the stars.
True friends remain no matter what.
"It's okay to disappear, take your time, to hurt, to feel, to heal. Especially when these dark nights occur, because my dear, you are the sun, you’ll rise again."
Keep going. Everything you need will come to you at the perfect time.
I seriously don't wanna deal with people anymore.
"All I ask is 3 things: Don't lie to me, Don't waste my time &amp; don't have me looking stupid."
Life’s short. Spend it with people who make you laugh and feel loved.
I am exhausted from trying to be stronger than I feel.
Can I sleep with a clear mind and heart for once? Just once?
Note to self: Stop expecting.
Everything feels so heavy on my heart.
so many feelings but no words.
Sometimes you just need to hear how much you mean to someone.
"i love your voice, your smiles and specially you."
7 things you should never apologize:  1: Being yourself. 2: Following your dreams. 3: Taking time with your self. 4: Ending toxic relationships. 5: Living in your truth. 6: You should never apologize for your imperfections. 7: Saying no when you need to.
there’s a part of me that isn’t the same anymore.
sharing music is a love language.
Sometimes someone’s voice can take all your worries away.
the only notification i want is yours.
Imagine being loved the way you love.
how can i mute my thoughts
"i'm physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically out of energy."
The eyes show what the heart hides.
I'm here for you and I'll always be.
"It’s okay to change your mind about things, to feel uncomfortable about things you once felt ok about, to guiltlessly cut toxic people out of your life and to forgive yourself when you make mistakes. Your decisions are valid, even if they don’t seem fair or make sense to others."
don't take my kindness for weakness.
"Never expect things to happen, it's better to feel surprised than to feel disappointed."
Bad days are part of the process. Please don’t give up.
i always hide most of what i really feel.
Don't confuse my personality with my attitude. My personality is who I am. My attitude depends on who you are.
A friend who understands your tears is much more valuable than a lot of friends who only know your smile.
"Sometimes you need to take a break from everyone and spend time alone, to experience, appreciate and love yourself."
I can't explain it.. I just feel it.
"Deep talks are my favorite. If you can connect with me on a level not everyone can, you’re in."
Making mistakes is better than faking perfections.
The best feeling in the world is knowing you actually mean something to someone.
Remove negative people from your life.
Your happiness is your responsibility.
"It’s extremely important to learn how to be ok on your own. You have to learn how to pick yourself back up when you fall, provide for yourself, wipe your tears away &amp; make yourself happy. Having people there for you is truly great but you can’t depend on them to always be there."
"What hurts you, changes you."
I need to be saved from my own thoughts.
Self love isn’t selfish.
I’m just sick of everything.
i prefer to be alone than to be in pain.
you deserve the love you keep trying to give everyone else
You can miss something without wanting it back.
Not everyone you lose is a loss.
find someone who knows how to love you when you’re sad.
it’s funny how i give advice to some people when i can’t even fix myself.
Everything is fine when a real best friend is around.
May you get loved the way you want.
Be proud of yourself for how hard you're trying.
"i’m too sensitive, in fact just one word can ruin my mood."
Self love is the best love.
we all deserve someone who never stops trying.
True friends never leave you during hard times.
ignoring toxic people is self care.
I don’t talk when i’m not in mood.
I'm so sorry if I failed to make you happy.
"No expectations, no disappointments."
we always tweet things we can't say.
i wish i hugged you longer
Literally music makes everything better.
i care about your feelings more than mine.
no one can fix my mood except you.
you're someone i'd never wanna lose.
i’m full of unsaid feelings.
I wanna go somewhere far away.
"Darling, always put yourself first."
my favorite memory was meeting you.
I really need anything good to happen.
wish my life had a reset button
i need to clear my mind.
Don't leave me okay? I love you.
Be kind. Your kindness could change somebody’s life.
"if you don’t take risks, nothing will change."
i really            don’t                     care                             about                                         what                              people                     think              of     me
"I will never get tired of loving you, because you proved to me that you're worth fighting for."
We plan but God decides.
you’re my home
"i care for you, always."
Overthinking will kill your happiness.
you will find peace with the right one.
"sometimes, you just need to accept the fact that people come and go"
I'm still silently waiting...
i'm really tired of all the shitty things that happen to me.
we broke rules because we wanted to be happy.
your smile is literally the cutest thing i have ever seen in my life
i want to spend all my time with you.
I never faked my love to someone.
"consistency, i love that shit."
wishing for a better days full of happiness.
"Find someone who makes you feel beautiful. Not only for the way you look but for the way you think, the way you feel, the way you love."
i need one of those long silent hugs.
my whole life is just “oh ok”
One bad chapter doesn’t mean that your story is over.
we're strangers with plenty of memories.
I'm missing the old me sometimes.
"if you need me, i’d always be here."
Look for someone who knows you’re not perfect but treats you as if you are.
Forgive yourself each night and start every morning with a plan to do better. Don't carry around any burden or pain. Let it all go.
keep the people who make you feel like home.
"if i cried in front of you, believe me, i reached my limit."
"Give me loyalty, I'll give you everything."
"Before I give up on anybody, I try &amp; I try &amp; I try."
Love me the way I am or leave me alone.
i hate sharing my favorite person.
"You cannot go back in time and fix your mistakes, but you can learn from them and forgive yourself for not knowing better."
"We didn’t need words, we just looked at each other and smiled."
"You hurt me, and i said sorry."
I am the most moody person ever.
true friends are family
quiet can be so loud sometimes
somewhere between sad and tired
A private life is a happy life A private life is a happy life A private life is a happy life A private life is a happy life
The perfect relationship is two people who never give up on each other.
"Don't say ""sorry"" and then do it all over again."
What is yours will find you.
I stopped waiting for everything to happen but deep inside i still pray for them all.
lately i feel like i dont really belong anywhere.
Nobody knows what's going inside.
Fake people everywhere.
i love sleep more than most people.
take care of your soul.
i hate overthinking and over feeling
i seriously can't stop missing you
"You don’t know pain until you’re crying to God, begging him to heal you."
I really love staring at you.
Never beg to be loved.
I wish i wasn't sensitive and didn't get upset easily.
if i share music with you just know that you really mean a lot to me.
my thoughts makes me so tired.
"Fall in love with the person who enjoys your madness, not an idiot who forces you to be normal."
I just really don’t like talking about how i feel.
"i just care too much, that’s how i am."
"If you matter to someone, you'll know."
"I wish I can tell you everything, I wish it can be easy for me to let it all out."
I’m trying my best to stop being sad.
i hope you never get tired of me.
you want me? make me feel that.
You glow different when you’re genuinely happy.
"Take care of your heart, it defines you."
Don’t fall in love just because someone pays a little bit of attention to you.
Do something good. It’ll come back to you in unexpected ways.
making me laugh is the key to my heart.
i love people with beautiful hearts.
i need you more than you think
Nothing feels better than a surprise text from a person you miss.
too afraid to trust again
i wish i could see you everyday.
Remember who stayed when you aren’t in your normal mood.
find someone who loves you at your worst.
i wish i can repeat that moment.
"keep your feelings, no one cares anymore."
"i don't hate you, i hate what you did to me."
11:11 Happy future me
you left but your memories didn't.
"One day, it’ll all make sense."
i really hate myself for being weak
I miss having a life without stress.
i stay quiet but i have so much on my mind.
thankful for the real ones in my life.
one day you'll realize how much i cared.
ignoring me makes me lose interest.
"I never give up on the people that i love, but if i do, know that you really messed up."
my eyes will never get bored of seeing you.
"You won't find me complaining when I'm sad.I'll just disappear. &amp; I'll appear again when am all good. I hate sympathy, I hate acting weak."
"I never forget a person who used to be a part of my life, never."
Be careful how your words could hurt people.
learn how to survive alone.
hearing your voice is my therapy
"i hope u know that even when things aren't going right, i will always think ur the most amazing thing that's ever came into my life."
the more i annoy you the more i love you.
"i will always be proud of you, my love."
"if you’re happy, i’m happy"
Don’t say it if you don’t mean it.
How amazing it is to find someone who wants to hear about all the things that go on in your head
I regret every time I let someone know me too much.
It takes time to build something real.
"Whatever you do , Don’t loose yourself."
I keep reminding myself of how temporary everyone is.
Expect nothing and you will never be disappointed.
Still healing from things I don't speak about.
"If someone really loves you, they will never hurt you."
i’m so sensitive i swear everything breaks my heart.
"No matter how angry you get, you always end up forgiving the people you love."
"Everything will fall into place, be patient."
"Memories are wonderful to make, but sometimes painful to remember."
One day can change everything.
"i'm trying, i tried, and i'm tired."
You have to go through the worst to get to the best.
Time heals almost everything. Give time time.
I’d give you the whole world if I could.
It's nice to have someone in your life who can make you smile even when they're not around.
"With you, hours turn into minutes."
Take the risk or lose the chance.
I hate texting. Come live with me.
I wish i could escape and leave everything behind.
"When I'm around you, I just feel happy for no reason."
Distance is always needed to see things clearly.
scared of losing myself again.
"When I was a kid, I hated going to bed. Now I cherish EVERY hour of sleep."
"It's so beautiful how we find people who can make us feel so happy, even at the times when we don't believe in happiness at all."
I wanna go to the beach just to listen to the waves.
"No matter how strong a person is, they'll always have a breaking point."
"i feel bad when someone opened something to me especially their problems and i can't even make them feel better. i'm so sorry, i promise i'm trying my best just to help u."
"maybe i don't show, but i'm broken."
can i sleep until everything ends?
I made my choice according to your actions.
No energy left in me to chase anything or anyone.
"You have to be patient with ppl who have experienced bad relationships/friends, &amp; ppl who suffer from a bad childhood. It can be hard for them to open up, love, &amp; trust. help them heal. teach them that their past doesn’t define them. Love &amp; show them how to find peace &amp; happiness"
my intentions were always pure so i didn’t lose you. you lost me.
always tell people how important they are to you.
Physically and mentally exhausted.
I just want to feel important to someone.
"You can't change how people feel about you, so don't try. Just live your life and be happy."
"Sometimes it feels like you wanna bury yourself in your own pain, you don’t feel like sharing it with anybody and you find yourself pushing everyone away."
Don’t let your happiness depend on something you may lose.
"Nothing stays the same, nothing."
"I don't need chocolate's or flowers, I needed the most is you."
having a friend with the same level of dirty mind is such a blessing.
i remember how much i used to be happy.
"i need a hug, a new playlist and someone who really cares about me."
saying goodbye to someone you wouldn't want to let go hurts the most.
"i wanna see u fullfil ur dreams, i will be ur no.1 supporter even ppl doubted u"
"The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes, and weaknesses, and still thinks you're completely amazing."
I still act like it doesn’t hurt.
Sometimes you fall in love with the most unexpected person at the most unexpected time.
Not every “sorry” deserves an “it’s okay” in the end.
Do not put effort into people who don’t give it back.
"I hate those moments right before you go to sleep, when you are forced to think about all the things you tried so hard to forget."
"One day, you’ll be someone’s best thing."
Say it before you run of time. Say it before it’s too late.
it's always the little things that hold you deeply.
Don't make time for people who don't make time for you.
I like people I can have comfortable silences with.

Take your time to recharge and come back stronger.
i love it when you make me feel special
if you're sad i can be sad with you.
I didn’t change. I just see things differently now.
I am not a second option. Either you lose me or you choose me.
i am okay and not okay at the same time.
"If you push me away, I’m not coming back."
"Sad eyes, fake smile."
you killed me with your words. i killed you with my silence.
"Some people suddenly change. One day, you’re so important to them. The next day, they act like they don’t know you."

Sometimes the simple things are the most beautiful.
I hate when I can't put what I'm thinking into words.

Maybe it’s true that people care when it’s too late.

They don’t deserve you. Stay busy!
"As long as you keep trying, there is still hope."
"You’ve been in situations where you thought you’d never make it out, but you did. You’ve lived through it. You’ve learned from it. You’ve survived. So whatever it is that you’re currently going through right now, you’ll get through that too. Keep believing and keep going."

Don't love too soon. Don't trust too fast. Don't quit too early. Don't expect too high. Don't talk too much.
"Dear best friend, I don’t know how to thank you but I hope you know that I’m so happy that you’re part of my life."
The best conversations always happen late at night.
"No matter how much you care, some people won't appreciate it. No matter how much you love, some people won't realize it."
"sleepy eyes, busy mind."
"Be careful who you share your secrets with, only a few care, the rest are just curious."
Some things will never be the same.
"be real with me, no games, no lies."
Seeing you smile makes me smile.
You deserve to put yourself first.

You have to learn how to vibe alone.

i’m so tired of getting depressed for no reason.
"I want to refresh my mind, delete all my problems, undo all my mistakes, and save all the happy moments."
Unexpected messages or calls is the best.

Sometimes you just need to hear how important you are to someone.

When i first saw you i never expected that you would mean the world to me..
You're the first person I want to talk to when I wake up and the last person I wish to see before I fall asleep.
I get sad. I get insecure. I get jealous. I get lonely. I overreact. I make mistakes.  But I promise I will always give you my best.

You never give up on someone you truly love.
twitter is a home for sad people.
I miss sleeping without worries on my mind.
I just want to sit by the sea with someone and talk all night.
"Suddenly, it feels like you have nothing to say at all."
"I give too much, that's the problem."
we all deserve someone who never stops trying.
"Forget the mistake, remember the lesson."
You can fall in love with eyes too.
Stop chasing after people &amp; being the only one trying to fix everything. It's mentally &amp; physically exhausting. You have to find peace with whoever comes &amp; goes from your life. Don't be the only one putting in effort Bc you will end up losing yourself trying to save everyone else

Even when someone does the smallest thing for me I never forget it. I appreciate everything.
"I may be hard to deal with, but at least i'm always here whenever you need me no matter where we stand. It's just the way i am."
Hold on to whatever keeps you happy.
"The more I grow up, the more I realize how unimportant it is to tell people how I really feel and that it’s always better to keep it to myself."
I love hearing old songs I used to love. They're like memories you can always go back to.
I don’t want bad days no more.
Believe in yourself. Always.
I want to find myself again.
i just want to be stress free.
⠀  Stop overthinking. Relax and let it go.  ⠀

"I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes i wish i knew what that reason was."
I don't need a perfect relationship. I just need someone who won't give up on me.

Missing someone + No texts or calls = worst feeling EVER.
Just don't lie to me. Ever.

I'm not close to many people anymore.

"I want someone to fall inlove with my attitude and vibes, not looks"
I’ll always listen when you need to talk.
Love stays - people go.
I love hearing “I saw this and thought of you”
I think i'll miss you forever.
Sometimes you have to show people how cold your heart can get.
i wish i could go back to somedays.
i wasn’t myself for years and yet nobody noticed.
when life is shit turn to music
"Overthinking is a painful reminder that you care too much, even when you shouldn’t."

"Every relationship has ups and downs, you should never expect perfection from somebody."
Always remember that you’re important and you exist for a reason.
I hate how sometimes I can’t find the right words to describe what’s going on in my mind.

Everything is so boring lately.

I need someone to take me away.

Best friend breakups are worse than relationship breakups.
My mind is full of you.
I wanna lose my memory and start a new life somewhere else.
A break from the whole world is needed af.
"distance yourself when it starts to get hard, it’s ok to take care of yourself."
allow yourself to lose the wrong people.
The older I get the more I don’t wanna be around anybody.
call me without a reason
Making someone laugh after they've just finished crying is one of the most beautiful things to ever exist.
Home is where your heart is.
you know i love you.
You are special to me.
I wish I could uninstall problems.
"I love photos, because they never change, even if the people in it change."
i saw your flaws and loved you more.

In music we found our souls.
Eye contact can say a lot.
"When I dream, I dream of you. Maybe one day, dreams will come true. Because, I really love you."
It broke my heart but opened my eyes.
"Even if I hate you, Your secrets are still secrets."
life is too short to waste a single second with anyone who doesn’t value you.
take me back to the time where social media didn't exist.
i owe myself a lot of apologies.
Sometimes my tweets are messages for you.
Million voices in my head.
You’re someone’s dream person.
You'll be able to move on. Give yourself time.
I'm not perfect but I promise you that I'll love you with all my heart.
You really don’t know what people have been through. Be kind.
Deep talks are my favorite.
Being heartless is better than being heartbroken.
"She is a dreamer, she is pure."
"You don't need to pretend that everything is okay, you don't need to act like you are receiving all the care and love you need, you just need to let them know you are tired and you are leaving for good."
No one will love you as much as i do I swear.
98% of people in my life are fake
i hate it when promises turns into a sorry
not everything can be fixed with one sorry.
having a conversation with you is the best.
"God, give me the strength to hold on. To keep going. Guide me."

I love people who keeps changing my mood
Unplanned moments are always better than planned ones.
I need something to cheer me up.
Sometimes you also have to unfollow people in real life.
"I appreciate effort. No matter how small, big, or irrelevant it is, I appreciate effort."
"I don't hate you, i hate what you did."
One day you’ll be everything to the right someone.
I care but I’m done trying.
Sometimes it’s okay to put yourself first.
We don’t meet people by accident. They’re meant to cross our path for a reason.
Sometimes a simple “I miss you” changes everything.
Private life always wins.
I’m honestly tired of being tired all the time.
It's nice to have someone to share your downs before your ups.
"Don't find love, let love find you. That's why they call it falling in love. You don't force yourself to fall, you just fall."
My feelings for you will never change.
What hurts you today makes you stronger tomorrow.

explanations are exhausting.
overthinking while missing someone.
Sometimes your heart needs more time to accept what your mind already knows.

why can’t life just be easy?
you won't understand because you're not me.

I am jealous of everybody who is with you when I'm not with you.
i     want        to meet            myself                  from                     someone                          else's                               point                                    of view
"We overthink, overlove, overfeel and overstress."
at my worst. literally.
Pain will really change you.
I love direct eye contact
Do you ever feel like no one really knows you?
Sometimes you just can’t tell someone how you feel. You never really find the right words to make them understand.
"we met for a reason, either you're a blessing or a lesson."
"i don't do revenge, but i can ignore your entire existence."
"I want to be with you, it is as simple, and as complicated as that."
"i'm too private, if i open up to you, you are special."
You have my heart. You always did.
just wanna disappear with the love of my life
I never want to lose you.
"The ""i"" before ""miss you"" and ""love you"" is important."
IM SO GLAD I FUCKING MET YOU
“you’re my girl” yes. yes i am. say it again.
I appreciate people who care about me.
it's okay to miss people but don't forget why they aren't in your life anymore.
you know nothing about the battles i fight alone.
Let me listen to your problems at 3am and fall in love with you even more.
I notice everything; I wish I didn’t.
Your first heartbreak changes you forever.
You would be surprised of how heartless I can become.
"Don't be afraid to tell them how you really feel, you've got nothing to lose."
i’ve been lost lately.
"you're lucky, if you have someone who can understand your mood just by reading your messages while texting."
i love being mentioned or tagged on stuff like damn you really think about me?
"it’s okay, tomorrow is better."
"And someday, she’ll find the one she deserves."
"i get too attached easily, and that's my problem."
i need a person who can hear my voice even if i’m silent.
"not friends or enemies, just strangers with memories."
"Don’t care about people too much, they’ll break you."
Have you ever cried because you're just you?
"I feel you, i always feel you."
Good conversations with the right people are priceless.
you’re still my fav. notification.
Maybe I was wrong again.
"Once you start loving someone, it's hard to stop."
I feel sorry for myself.
"Forgiving someone is easy, but being able to trust them again is a totally different story."
Maybe we feel empty because we leave pieces of ourselves in everything we used to love.
i wish i could see you every time i miss you.
songs bring back memories.
Never give up on something you really want.
Unexpected messages can do alot.
"Never change who you are just because you're afraid of losing them. If they really love you, your imperfections won't matter."
"If you could read my mind, you'd be in tears."
"Right person, wrong time. I hate that."
Don't ignore me for days and then start talking to me again like nothing happened.
It's not about having the perfect relationship. It's about finding someone who matches you and will go through everything without giving up.
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes.
Accept people as they are.
"Long distance relationships are hard but they’re also incredible. If two people can love, respect, trust, and understand each other from a distance, nothing can break them apart."
I want to delete all my feelings.
Having someone who can handle all your moods is such a blessing
"Don't wish for it, work for it."
That awkward moment when you have to stare at a text for five minutes to figure out how to reply.
"Mentally, the worst feeling is feeling unwanted by the one person you want the most."
"Just when you think you know people, they disappoint you in ways you never thought they could."
the best feeling comes when you realize you're perfectly happy without the people you thought you needed the most.
"There's always that one person that can make you smile, even when you're at your lowest."
"You were born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection."
"What comes easy won’t last long, and what lasts long won’t come easy."
Don’t be afraid of losing someone who doesn’t feel lucky to have you.
tired of saying it's okay.
Still tryin to heal from things I don’t speak about.
"Always remember that everything that happens, good or bad, helps you grow. Even if it’s hard to see that right now."
Memories never die.
Find someone who knows you’re not perfect but treats you as if you are.
Smiling instead of explaining why you’re sad is much easier.
Never take someone’s feelings as a joke.
the silence said it all.
Don’t be afraid to fail. Be afraid not to try.
"Dear someone, you have this incredible way of making my heart happy."
me: *sleeps for 4 hours* tired me: *sleeps for 8 hours* tired me: *sleeps for a week* tired me: *sleeps for a month* tired me: *sleeps for a year* still tired
I hate overthinking but I just can’t stop.
People who hide their feelings usually care the most.
"High expectations lead to disappointments, always."
"If you lost someone but found yourself, you won."
"please don’t leave, i’m already comfortable with you"
"Be happy. Be who you wanna be. If others doesn't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasing everybody."
Thinking about you makes me smile.
"can’t wait to graduate, disappear and start a new life."
Jealousy = I actually care about you.
Just wanna be a better person.
People change. Love hurts. Friends leave. Things go wrong. But just remember that life goes on.
Everything is nothing without you.
I act I'm fine but I'm dead inside.
unexpected things are needed right now.
"You’re beautiful, don’t let life change your beauty."
"don't be sad, all this shit will pass."
you deserve to be with someone who looks at you every single day like they've won the lottery and have the whole world in front of them.
Sometimes music speaks what you feel inside.
"Dear bed, you’re my true love."
I like conversations where I don't have to think about what to say.
I miss how everything was.
One day I'll leave and I'll never look back.
"yes, i tweet about you."
"the little details can make you fall in love, and can also break your heart."
I wanna travel the world with the love of my life.
"you can hide it from the world, but God knows whats inside your heart."
"Never ignore a person who loves and cares for you, cause one day you may realize that you've lost the moon while counting the stars."
"Dear best friends, please stay in my life forever."
⠀  ⠀⠀⠀                 PRAY ⠀⠀      Everything will be okay  ⠀
Never losing myself again for anyone.
Moving on doesn't mean you forget about things. It just means you have to accept what happened and continue living.
I want a life with you.
I will never be tired of loving you.
"Absolutely, my heart only wants you."
"not attracted by looks, i'm attracted to mindsets."
"Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching."
Unexpected text messages are always nice. The fact that the person took a little bit of their time to make you smile.
May you fall in love with someone who never gets tired of saving you from your own chaos.
Late night talks with friends can be some of the best therapy.
"of course i changed, i realized that i deserve so much better."
a person who smells good is a big turn on
"losing respect for someone is always such a weird thing because you don’t hate the person you just don’t feel the need to ever speak to them again or even think about them, you’re just done."
we tweet for our unsaid thoughts.
"I don't care about losing people who don't wanna be in my life anymore, I've lost people who meant the world to me and I'm doing just fine."
"my phone is always in my hand so if you think i'm ignoring you, i am."
"I love you, but I hate you. I miss you, but I'm better off without you. I want you out of my life, but I never want to let you go."
Don't let little things destroy your happiness.
A relationship is about two things: 1. Appreciating similarities  2. Respecting differences
"One day, you'll just be a memory to some people. Do your best to be a good one."
"I didn’t lose a friend, I just realized I never had one."
Being attracted to someone’s way of thinking is a whole different level of attraction.
i’d rather be alone than force myself in a circle that i don’t belong.
Sometimes you have to die a little to be alive.
i am really really really tired.
Life’s so much better when nobody knows what you’re up to.
I either talk too much or i don't talk at all.
"no matter what happens, some memories can never be replaced"
"stop looking for reasons to be unhappy, look for more reasons to be happy."
"I felt so much, that I started to feel nothing."
"look at my eyes, i’m full of you."
i hate it when im so excited for something but ended up not happening.
"if they care, they'll find time for you."
"Sometimes I push you away, because i need you to pull me closer."
I’ve met a lot of people but nobody feels like you.
i’ll say i’m fine but i’m not.
"I miss you. No, let me correct that, I miss the old you. I miss the old you that cared about me and the old you that would treat me so well."
I'm a strong person. But do you know what makes me cry? It's when I gave my best but I still feel useless.
need a message full of true feelings.
"You know my name, not my story. You've heard what I've done, not what I've been through."
I wish you loved me too.
"Just because I'm not talking, doesn't mean I'm in a bad mood. Sometimes I just like to be quiet."
It's okay to not be okay sometimes.
It's so hard to forget someone that you shared so many memories with.
Fighting your feelings is the most difficult battle ever.
"Love doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be true."
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right.
"If you're lucky enough to get a second chance at something, don't waste it."
I hate missing someone and not being able to do anything about it.
"chatting without ""HAHAHAHAHA"" makes me feel like i'm in a serious meeting."
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
I want you to be happy. But I want to be the reason.
"Fight for me, and I promise you I will do the same."
"Nothing hurts more than being ignored, replaced, or lied to."
Never be afraid to say what you feel.
"I can't control my feelings, but I hate how my feelings can control me."
my eyes talk instead of me.
"Maybe I won't say, but I feel. Maybe I don't show, but I care."
Treat me right and I'll treat you better.
I'll be fine. I just don't know when.
"Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually."
Bad relationships change good people.
You’ll be happy again. You will understand your heart better when you heal. You will be okay.
i have so many moods
It hurts to let go but sometimes it hurts more to hold on.
"Stop overthinking about something. If it feels right, go with the flow. If it feels wrong, don’t think about it too hard and just walk away."
thinking of you never ends.
Note to self: Stop trying so hard for people who don’t care.
when they start praying for you that’s another type of love.
too much in my mind but nothing to say.
The best is yet to come. Just be patient.
"Even if i had a million reasons to leave you, i would still look for one to stay."
"Sometimes there is no next time, no timeouts, and no second chance. Sometimes it’s now or never."
"Once I stop caring you’re not getting it back. I’ll be cold as ice, I promise."
"not everybody will understand your silence, remember that."
Missing someone makes it harder to fall asleep at night.
nothing feels heavier than unsaid words.
Bad days build better days.
"The best feeling is when I look at you, and you're already looking at me."
i'm not very good at telling people how i feel
"Some people can be so quiet about their pain, that you forget that they’re hurting. That’s why it’s important to always be kind."
You know what’s attractive? Effort.
music is my escape from life.
"I want you on your bad days and good days. I want you whole, flawed and imperfect."
"I like being alone but i want someone to be alone with, if that makes sense."
I still love you but you don't care anymore.
"No matter how strong of a person you are, there's always someone who can make you weak."
much of love for one person.
how do we skip the sad parts
my daily routine is very simple. i wake up &amp; i suffer.
"I pretend to look around, but I’m actually looking for you."
I hate when my fav person is sad.
Don’t become the person who hurt you.
The worst part of being strong is that no one asks if you’re okay.
"I’m an over thinker so if you don’t give me an answer, I’ll think of one."
In need of someone who is prepared for: - Long talks - My dreams - Random texts - My crazy side - My mood swings
"when i love, i love stupid hard."
i still talk to God about you.
I love your voice and your laugh a lot.
i love you since the day i found you.
"if you stay, i'll keep you."
"If it makes you happy, do it."
Real feelings don't change fast.
i wanna delete a lot of people.
Life goes on. Move forward. Be better. Do better.
i do believe one day i’ll live the life i want.
"Everything I was afraid of happening, happened."
I hope everything becomes better
Happiness is a choice. Choose it.
"The more you hide your feelings, the more they show. The more you deny your feelings, the more they grow."
Food will never break your heart.
One lie can ruin a thousand truths.
eyes don’t know how to hide love
"i didn't change, i just realized."
"Sometimes quiet people have a lot to say, but they don’t open up to just anyone."
I want to sleep until i feel better.
I want someone who will love me without any conditions.
Healing is a lonely process.
God never lets you down.
i miss how happy we were together
"i’m me, i'm sorry i can’t be them."
imagine how a single message can change a whole mood.
i tweet a lot when im hurt
"Sometimes, all I want to do is be with you."
I'd risk everything just to make you happy.
"Don't text me because you're bored, text me because I'm the person you want to talk to."
Enjoy yourself. Heal yourself. Trust yourself. Respect yourself. Believe yourself. Love yourself.  Be yourself.
Even the kindest hearts get tired too.
"Every night her thoughts weighed heavily on her soul, but every morning she would get up to fight another day. Every night she survived."
i'm tired of acting like i'm not hurting
"you’re not mine, but i still get jealous."
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
some people's mindsets are absolute trash.
idk but fast replies makes me feel important.
it's better to be lowkey and private. it's peaceful.
You are my favorite stranger.
You think you know people but then they surprise you.
I am tired but I never quit.
Every song has a memory.
"Be with those who stayed, not who promised."
never forget how much i tried to keep you.
"I'm not perfect. I'll annoy you, make fun of you, say stupid things, but you'll never find someone who loves you as much as I do."
Maybe you're the right person but we're not in the right time.
I'm trying. I'm trying really hard. But I can't pretend it doesn't hurt because it really does.
"I don't need someone perfect. I need someone who loves me, respects me, cares for me and understands me."
"behind my smile, there's you."
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile.
"honestly i think about you a lot. all the time actually. in the morning, at night, in the middle of my day. It's you. it's just always you."
"you gotta love her on her bad days when she is moody and irritated, just as much as you love her when everything is going well."
i need a break from all this bullshit.
my biggest mistake is thinking that people care for me as much as i do for them.
"A smile can mean a thousand words, but it can also hide a thousand problems."
We don't meet people by accident. They are meant to cross our path for a reason.
"You can fake a smile, but you can't fake your feelings."
Don't promise if you'll break them in the end.
"I'm actually really nice, until you annoy me."
"Relationships are worth fighting for, but you can't be the only one fighting."
I love when people remember the small things you thought they'd forget... that makes them even more special.
Yea I'm strong but I got limits too.
My only goal in life right now is to be genuinely happy.
"You may love the wrong person, cry for the wrong reason. But one thing is sure, mistakes help us find the right person."
Smile. It looks good on you.
feeling lonely kills me
"If you love someone tell them, because hearts are often broken by words left unspoken."
"Talking to you, laughing with you, being with you, changes my whole mood."
"It's funny how we feel so much but we don't say a word, we're screaming inside but we can't be heard."
Good music taste is attractive.
"I’m bad with words, I hope you’re good in reading eyes."
i need more of you and less of this world.
perhaps we’ll meet again when we’re better for each other.
I didn’t realize growing up meant dying inside.
"it takes years to learn the difference between who to let go and who to be patient with. the same way it takes years to know what you deserve and what you don’t. so hang in there, growth and experience come with time."
"Fuck second chances, people never change."
i need you on my bad days too.
i appreciate people who try.
sad but doing my best.
"i'm hurt too, but i'm always silent."
"Sometimes you never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory, that you wish you could experience again."
"I'm not perfect, I make mistakes, I hurt people, but when I say sorry, I actually mean it."
You're forever in my heart.
i just keep it all inside.
"Don't hurt anyone. It only takes few seconds to hurt people you love, and it can take years to heal."
"When you are angry, be silent."
"I’m here for you. Through whatever, whenever."
all i ask for is peace of mind.
sorry if i'm not enough
i love you but i can’t say that.
sometimes silence is better.
I pray we all marry someone that doesn't leave when it gets tough.
"i had choices, but i chose you."
"I don't trust easily, so when I tell you I trust you, please don't make me regret it."
i miss waking up being excited about something.
"You meet thousands of people and none of them really effect you, then you meet that one person, and your life is changed forever."
Distance sometimes lets you know who's worth keeping and who's worth letting go.
"Don't choose the better person, choose the person who makes you a better you."
i love you to the moon and back.
"I fell in love with your personality, your looks are just a bonus."
I just wanna watch the night sky with someone and have deep conversations.
a lot of unspoken thoughts.
"imaginations, be real please."
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
i smile whenever i get a message from you.
eye contact and heartbeats.
"When you really care about someone, their happiness matters more than yours."
"People can say anything about you, but only you know the truth."
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep.
Don't let your past steal your present.
No more toxic issues please.
No one feels what you feel in exactly the same way. These are your feelings and yours alone. Feel what you feel. Nothing is more yours than that.
sometimes you just want to feel wanted.
"Yes, you will be successful soon. Claim it."
Never give up on prayer. God sometimes answer in unexpected ways.
i wish i can turn back time and fix what's needed to fix.
"when a girl is silent, she's either overthinking, tired of waiting, falling apart or crying inside."
self-love is the new relationship goal.
maybe i just expect too much
i saw your worst and i still love you.
You deserve a relationship that enables you to sleep peacefully at night.
"i'm not feeling okay, but it's fine"
People who check up on you because they care are the best kind of people.
"Sometimes you have to distance yourself from people. If they care, they will notice. If they don't, you will know where you stand."
i will never be the same as before.
Silence gives answers.
"Appreciate what you have right now, because you don't always get a second chance."
"I hate waiting. But if waiting means being able to be with you, I'll wait for as long as forever to be with you."
I will be by your side till the end.
i have four moods:  oversleeping  overthinking  overeating  overspending
"I care so much about your happiness. Because when you're happy, I'm happy too."
i need someone to hug me everyday.
Stop waiting for things to get better and do something to make it better.
"You are, and always have been, my dream."
i hate feeling like i’m being ignored
"If it’s still in your mind, it is still in your heart."
"being called ""baby"" makes my heart melt"
"I hate those days, that remind me of everything I want to forget."
keeping everything as a secret is better
I will forgive you but the way I look at you will never be same as it used to be.
every minute i have a different feeling
there’s so much i want to say to you
you really don't know pain till you sat and begged God to heal your heart.
i hate that i distance when i'm sad
my biggest fear is losing my loved ones
i overthink because i notice everything.
to feel unwanted is the worse thing
one song hits with millions of memories.
Finding myself while losing everyone.
"Some people are like clouds - when they go away, the day gets brighter."
i care so much more than you think.
You have no idea how beautiful you are in my eyes.
thoughts feel heavier these days.
"Just because we haven't been talking, that doesn't mean I haven't been thinking about you all the time."
it hurts my feelings when i’m talking to someone and i can feel them not caring about anything I’m saying.
no one can help you unless you help yourself.
"If you believe in it, then fight for it."
You're always on my mind.
My only relationship goal is to be with someone who motivates me to become a better person and show me the potential I don't see in myself.
Thank you for being the reason I smile.
"You’re my best friend, my human diary, you mean the world to me."
"True love never dies, because true love waits forever."
Give yourself a break sometimes.
"too often, the only escape is sleep."
"Spend more time with people you love, and do more things that you love."
Remember that I believe in you.
Silence says a lot more than you think.
"i'm sorry for the pain, that i caused"
my heart is full of unsaid words
"I hope you find someone who make you feel wanted every time, all the time."
Missing my favorite person
Never let your anger get the best of you.
"Nobody is ever too busy. If they care, they would make time."
The best way to live your life is to not care about what other people think.
"⠀  “If you are reading this, God still has a plan &amp; purpose for your life.”  ⠀"
"Since you've been around, I smile a lot more than I used to."
i am both happy and sad.
"behind every favourite song, there is an untold story."
Sometimes you just need to be selfish to take care of yourself.
The pain eats you until you feel nothing anymore.
I’m keeping so much inside.
"She says she doesn't care, but her eyes tell a different story."
"just be honest with me, or stay away from me. it's not that difficult."
i feel so dead these days.
I want to be the person you're scared to lose.
We can't force people to appreciate us.
A girl's twitter is full of hints.
"one day, i’ll marry you."
You make me smile every single day.
"I don't fall in love with faces, I fall in love with personalities."
"Be patient with yourself, you are growing stronger everyday."
"Real feelings don't just ""go away."""
When you find both love and friendship in one person.
eyes for you &amp; only you.
"i never faked my ""i miss you"" to someone."
God keep me strong.
late night calls? i miss that shit
everything about you is special to me.
Be teachable. You're not always right.
be with someone who always makes you feel better.
"please don't expect me to always be kind and loving, there are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand."
strong people cry at night
I automatically distance myself when I feel unwanted.
"Anxiety, music and chill."
sleeping is so hard when your mind is full of thoughts.
"that ""grow together"" type of love"
"dear me, i'll make you proud one day"
"You deserve to feel at peace always, and feel endless genuine love and heal from things that weigh heavy on your heart."
Self love ft. self care.
me to everything lately: “whatever”
"sometimes, i'm tired of being nice"
"I want to be as good as I was before, but i just can't."
distance sucks i need you here with me
i badly want to restart my life.
"I wish i had a delete button in my life to delete some people, some memories and some feelings."
"Yes, I'm thinking about you right now."
I love people who appreciates my weird personalities.
"I’m tired, I’m stressed, I’m sad, but I’m fine."
you are my favorite place.
Nobody ever really knows how much anyone else is hurting. You could be standing next to someone who is completely broken and not even know it. That’s why we should ALWAYS try to be kind.
I only want positive energy around me.
wish i could erase some memories
leaving without an explanation hurts
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
i want you to stay and never go away
"i still miss u, i still want u, i still love u"
you stole my heart since that day.
when you open twitter to look for motivation but everyone is just as tired as you.
Learn to trust. Learn to love. Learn to forgive. Learn to listen. Learn to dream. Learn to dare. Learn to wonder. Learn to write. Learn to inspire. Learn to change. Learn to stand tall. Learn to teach. Learn to be loyal. Learn to laugh.  Successful people love learning.
I'll never forget the first time I saw you.
ｙｏｕ　 ｓａｙ　 ｙｏｕ＇ｒｅ　 ｎｏｔ　 ｐｅｒｆｅｃｔ　 ｂｕｔ　 ｔｏ　  ｍｅ　 ｙｏｕ　 ａｒｅ
"if you don't appreciate me, i'm gone"
im too young to be this stressed
You can fall in love with eyes too.
i’m so bad at starting conversations
"you can’t satisfy everyone in your life, and that’s okay. you’re just one person and you’re doing your best."
I never wanna feel heartbreak ever again.
"all my life i've been so understanding with everyone, but when it's my turn to be understood, no one seems to try."
i still remember our first chat.
I see you in all my favorite songs.
we young but we are stressing like we 50.
"I promise, I will love you at your worst and hold you at your weakest."
I just need your time and attention.
Overthinking can kill you slowly.
"I trusted you, you lied."
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.
We use filter because we ain't attractive.
"Friends can break your heart, too."
"Don't regret the mistakes you did in the past. Instead, let it serve as a reminder of the things you should never do gain and the types of people that you should avoid in order to have a better future."
"The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes and weaknesses, but still thinks you're completely amazing."
I'm just tired. Can we just escape?
"One mistake, millions of regrets."
I smile because I need to be strong.
"I know a lot, I just keep silent."
i wish i was with you rn tbh
"Be strong enough to let go of something that's hurting you and no longer makes you happy. If the tears outweigh the smiles, then it's a sign to finally move on. You deserve to be happy, not miserable."
Crying helps you ease the pain.
my soul needs a hug
"Find someone who makes you smile, because it only takes a smile to make a day better."
i feel incomplete without you.
music changes my mood.
God please give me strength.
after everything i still love you
"if i repeated what you did, you'd be mad too"
"if you love someone, never leave them."
always pray and never give up
i wish i could delete toxic people in my life.
i had a lot to say but i choose to be quiet
i need someone to hug me everyday.
"To my friends, that genuinely care about me. Thank you, I love you."
give me attention before i lose interest
Self improvement is my biggest priority.
my feelings for you will never change.
i made a mistake and i'm sorry for that.
i wish i was important to you.
can i rewind back to where i was happy?
"do me a favor, stay in my life."
hope my story gets a happy ending cause i been through some shit i never deserved
being financially stable and genuinely happy is an ultimate goal
"a ""can we talk"" can fix a lot."
Hi. You are worth it :)
Never let a person get comfortable disrespecting you.
real ones stays in bad times.
seeing my friends happy makes me happy
Stop checking for a person who doesn't check for you. Stop investing your heart into someone who mistreats you. You're better than that.
You're the happiness I never realized that I needed.
There's a right time for everything.
Be mature enough to accept rejection and failures.
"Heal, learn and grow."
Love isn't supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be worth it.
"Stop explaining yourself to other people. You owe no one any explanation of what you do. Your life is yours, not theirs."
Be strong but not rude.  Be kind but not weak.  Be humble but not timid.  Be proud but not arrogant.
I say sorry a lot. Mostly because I feel like everything is my fault.
You can't force people to treat you right.
Never forget who helped you when everyone else was making excuses.
i stop trying to communicate when i feel unwanted
strong people cry at night
i just want u to be in my future.
I’m a very emotional sensitive strong solid person.
"i’m always at war with who i am and who i want to be, between the things that catch my attention and the things i want to focus on and it’s very exhausting."
i overthink too much and that shit hurt
pretty eyes. pretty heart. pretty soul
"i’m tired, i need money."
night drives with good music
a lot of feelings but nothing to say
I miss my normal life.
Choose people who choose you.
I can’t even explain how much I love you.
I want you mine and only mine.
"keep me in your heart, always."
i never lie when it comes to feelings.
"i have said too much, shared too much, cared too much, and now i want my energy back. i no longer want to get close to anyone."
"I just wanna say, appreciate what you have while you have it."
What's yours will find you.
"Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days."
i get attached to everything i can’t have
it’s sad to see a good person change
"for me, there’s you and nobody else"
"You have no choice but to keep moving forward despite how tired you feel. Giving up is not an option, you have dreams to fulfill."
it hurts but whatever
Maybe it’s true that people will care when it’s too late.
you make me feel like everything's gonna be okay.
the people you love are so lucky to be loved by you.
i'm still broken. just learning to ignore the pain.
"I feel really happy when I see you, because when I look at you and see your smile, it also makes me have a smile."
"Sometimes, tears are a sign of unspoken happiness and smile is a sign of silenced pain."
"No matter how smart you are, your heart always makes you dumb."
I just want someone who'll understand me even when no words are spoken.
You have no idea just how much I want to be with you all the time.
not everyone will understand you and that's okay
Hearing someone you love laugh is easily one of the best things on earth.
"Be kind to unkind people, someday they might learn.."
we're too young to be unhappy.
Sorry for being cold when I'm sad.
Beautiful personality is greater than a beautiful face.
"don't give up because of one chapter didn't turned out well, keep on going, your life doesn't end there."
I hope I get an unexpected text from you.
"Don't make a promise, because promises can also break my heart."
music saves me from overthinking and pain like no one did.
"We're like strangers now, but our memories are still in me."
in the mood for disappearing for a while
I hate how sensitive I am. I literally break my own heart.
Letting go is another way to say I love you.
"Being hugged when you are crying, makes you cry even more."
I overthink everything until I get myself in a bad mood.
I can be the coldest person if I want but I'm afraid to lose people I'm afraid of being lonely.
Genuine people are rare.
Real love is not easy.
"this time, love yourself more."
"tired eyes, broken hearts"
you glow different when you stop caring what people think about you.
unexpected blessings are the best.
can i just deactivate myself
always trust the process.
you can't force people to love you.
"don't trust my smile, i'm sad."
"i just kept myself quiet, so no one will get hurt because of my anger."
"Dear pain, You changed me a lot."
overthinking takes you to a place that doesn't exist.
Don't let someone treat you bad just because you love them.
if i cried over u i really love u
Mind your own twitter.
Please God heal those people who are in pain.
DON'T BEG FOR THE LOVE
I can fake like i'm fine.
missing so many things
i'm too young to overthink.
only one person can change my mood in just seconds
toxic people love playing the victim
Even at your worse you'll still have me.
You’ll find peace when you stop caring.
"if i told you to leave me, hold me more"
you deserve someone who is afraid to lose you like you are afraid to lose them.
i love talking to you for hours
i really missed your voice.
"no matter what, im here"
never attack someone with personal stuff they trusted you with.
I found my happiness in you.
i still remember how our first conversation started
"to my fav person, i love you and take care everyday"
having insecurities sucks
i hate when a good song is attached to a bad memory
Never fall for sweet words. Fall for sweet actions.
mature conversations ft. the right person
I hope the universe is kinder to you today.
"""Pisanthrophobia"" is the fear of trusting people due to bad past experiences."
stuck between i don't want to feel that type of hurt again but i want to feel that type of love again.
need a vacation from my head.
"and suddenly, i lost my smile again"
"the eyes, they never lie."
imagine having someone that actually gets excited to talk to you.
All I want right now is a healthy sleeping routine.
"twitter isn't just an app, it's a diary"
sorry but i’m not interested in someone who wants everyone.
Sometimes I need to be alone with my music.
I need a long long long long hug.
if i show u my soft side my heart is yours
being a cold person makes life easier.
"I’m not your free time or your second choice, prioritize me or leave me alone."
I want to fall asleep and wake up in a different life.
sadness hits at night
Sometimes you gotta learn to be quiet even when you got a lot to say....
Healthy friendships are what I always wish for.
I tell everyone to be strong knowing that i'm the weakest one.
my eyes want to see you the most
overthinking kills relationships
bring me to the place where pain doesn't exist.
i wanna vibe with you all day &amp; night.
"i miss ur smile, ur face, ur hugs. i miss u."
i never wanna see you with another
"sometimes, prayer is all you need"
Feelings don't lie.
It's nice to be with someone who knows your value.
People with mixed music taste have the right personality for anything.
"i think it’s attractive when someone texts you after hanging out just to say they had fun with you, idk little things like that mean alot to me."
i'm distant because i'm too tired to explain.
Some feelings never changes.
keep it private. people love to ruin things.
I didn't expect to get this attached to you.
A person who seems jealous or clingy is actually someone who cares the most.
The hardest decision in life is deciding whether to “walk away” or “try harder”
I love those random memories that make me smile no matter what is going on in my life right now.
a heart full of love only for you.
Move on. Someone better is waiting for you.
"I'm not heartless, I'm just tired of getting hurt."
You deserve someone who thinks you're too important to lose.
stop being always available for people who just there for you when it's convenient for them.
"Cry as hard as you want to, but just make sure that once you stop crying, you never cry for the same reason again."
"I hate getting so sad to the point where my body completely shuts down, and all I can do is just lay there and think about all my problems."
I know you're tired but keep going.
"When you really love someone, stupid conversations make sense."
"i don't hate, i ignore people."
Don't trust easily. You'll get hurt.
Sometimes music is all you need to make you feel better.
I'm trying to be strong but I'm tired.
Please be real. Don't play with someone's heart just to make yourself happy.
always learn how to be strong alone.
i hope u miss me sometimes
Take a rest but don’t quit.
Don't push someone away and expect them to still be there when you're ready.
"Forgive, let go and heal."
i just want a long hug till i feel better
Drowning on my own thoughts.
"Don't beg for attention, if they want to talk to you they will."
my stupid heart is missing u
Comparing yourself to others is a battle that you can never win.
sending love &amp; healing to anyone fighting a silent battle.
"I wanna be happy, that's all."
"tell me all your rants, i will listen"
high school memories are the best
"saying ""im tired"" when you're actually sad."
my bed knows all my pain.
i seriously miss seeing you
i'll never be that me again
i hope future me is happy
"i always choose to understand, even it hurts"
"My ""haha"" and ""HAHAHA"" are so fucking different."
One day this will end.
can't survive without music
it's okay. i wouldn't choose me either
"remove toxic people in your life, just chill."
"Life is so short, do what makes you happy."
"It's all about time, time heals."
Silence is the girl's loudest cry.
"Dear Happiness, why is it so hard to attain you?"
Real friends get treated like family.
I wish I can live inside my dreams.
Too many songs still remind me of you.
Maybe it's better to keep it inside.
"when you find someone who accepts you the way you are, that's home."
I hope your heart finds peace.
A true relationship is when you can tell each other anything and everything.
Secretly in love with someone I can't have.
it’s sad how our parents think they know us but they really don’t.
I need a 'delete memories' button.
music heals me everytime
saying nvm instead of explaining.
Respect who respects you.
put your energy in the right people
"not single, not taken, just waiting for something real."
I changed myself for myself.
"Being called “my loveee” ""my babyyy"" is so fucking cute ugh my heart😩"
Tweets are hints.
"To my happy pill, keep safe."
Have you ever looked at someone and hope they stay in your life forever?
Everything will be okay.
It’s hard to heal the past when it brought you so much pain.
"Stay private, keep them guessing."
I wish I could cheer myself up like I do to others.
"I never cheat, because I know how it hurts to be cheated."
I realized that I lost myself trying to please someone.
"I know you're not okαy, you're just pretending."
"You learn, you change, you grow."
crying from jealousy is a painful feeling
you're my favorite part of the day.
i want a life full of memories with you
Be my baby and my best friend.
Give yourself love too.
Never go back to someone who already broke you.
"To all the sad people out there, we’re gonna be happy again — soon."
it is difficult to explain so i stay quiet
im sensitive please be gentle with me
best friends hug is always different
show me how much i mean to you
tired of being the one who keeps trying
I take care of small details so much seriously.
May you receive good news on something that you've been patiently waiting on.
Willing to take risks with you.
Just trying to be a better version of myself.
Stop making me special if you'll leave me after.
i deserve to be happy and fine
"dear old me, you’ve changed a lot"
i suffered. i learned. i changed.
sometimes it’s better to just keep it to yourself.
"choose a good heart and matured mind, not a good face."
it’s hard for me to express what i feel
the best people come unexpectedly
be humble enough to apologize when you're wrong.
dont love me according to ur moods
imagine not having anxiety? that shit sounds peaceful as hell
I want to be that someone who makes your bad days better.
I can't remember how many times I said I was fine just because I didn't want to bother someone with my issues.
my silence means i'm tired of everything
i procrastinate    →            i regret                                      procrastinating         ↑                                      ↓  i procrastinate   ←     i get stressed bc    stressfully                i procrastinated
sometimes it’s okay to disconnect.
life makes me tired everyday
damn i miss my fav person so much
"people get tired of me and then leave, but they don't know that i am tired also but i stayed."
i hope you heal from the things that no one ever apologized for.
i want more time with you
You're going to make it. Trust me.
Being appreciated is such a nice feeling.
"i'm tired, but i’m still trying my best"
Meeting you was a blessing.
Forgiveness is the final form of love.
Losing your appetite because you're sad is actually the worst feeling.
"Pain is temporary. Don't quit, keep fighting."
I'm sorry I'm a very moody person.
i need the longest warmest tightest hug.
I miss our long conversations.
You're the happiness I never realized that I needed.
Good conversations with the right people are priceless.
Music can change my mood so easily.
"maturity is a mindset, not age."
The hardest part isn't letting go. It's starting over.
Sometimes we don't need advice. We just need somebody to listen.
Crying over stupid shit is my talent.
Prove yourself to yourself and not for others.
I sleep to avoid my problems.
True love and loyal friends are two of the hardest things to find.
"I like it when you smile, it's cute."
Anxiety is the most silent yet painful experience. it makes no sense and you sit there alone drowning in your own thoughts without knowing the real reason behind all the pain that you feel. sometimes you can’t even feel a thing and it sucks because you tell everyone it’s fine.
"Appreciate everything, regret nothing."
"Sometimes, memories are the reason why forgetting is hard."
Let's get drunk and tell each other how we really feel.
No one knows what you feel inside.
Loyal people are rare these days.
"read my mind, it’s full of you."
seeing you happy is all i want.
"Thankful for the people who came into my life, and stayed."
"When I'm sad, please don't ask me what's wrong. Just hug me."
True friends are everything.
"Lord, please guide us always."
No expectations. No disappointments.
Train yourself to take nothing personally.
"for me, there’s you and nobody else"
"waking up with a peace of mind, that's all I want."
"soon, you will receive what you prayed for."
being appreciated by someone is priceless.
i tried my best to fix things
music is my bestfriend when no one understands me.
i pray that everything gets back to normal.
"If you break someone's heart and they still talk to you with the same excitement and respect. believe me, they really love you."
I'm sorry I changed. Life forced me to grow.
"Happy times come and go, but the memories stay forever."
"You are enough, a thousand times enough."
Learn to love without expectation.
"I'm happy I met you, I'm sorry you met me."
Unexpected friendship from unexpected person.
"Sometimes, all you can do is laugh to keep yourself from crying."
She was drowning but nobody saw her struggle.
"i still like you, i just got tired of trying."
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay."
sucks when your effort is ignored
Losing fake and toxic people is a win.
miss being a little kid with no worries
"you are mine, I swear you are."
"You will always have a place in my heart, no matter what."
Craving for your love and attention.
"When you accept somebody, you accept their past too. Don't hold it against them later."
"Please, don't give up."
"You can't trust anyone, anymore."
i need someone like me in my life
best revenge is to improve yourself.
"Not sad, but not happy."
i appreciate people that ask about me
life is breaking me again.
Do you ever pray until you cry because you’re just tired and u need strength
But if you never try you will never know.
I'm gonna smile when it hurts.
"I respect those that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is."
"People will push you to your limits and when you finally explode and fight back, suddenly you're the bad person."
I wish I can fully smile with no pain inside.
I hate it when crying is the only way to feel better.
Will you remember me in ten years?
"""nah, i'll do it tomorrow"" is my everyday mood."
"My heart is breaking, my mind full of unsaid thoughts."
"When someone gives you their trust, please do your best to take care of it. It takes a lot of courage for them to do that because you don't know how hard it is to trust people nowadays especially when you have so many cheaters and liars scattered around."
give yourself a chance to be happy again
all i want is mental peace
waiting for the day when I can finally say I'm genuinely happy.
yeah u cute but can u handle my overthinking
"don’t get too comfortable, they never stay."
i want more time with you
sleep is the best way to escape feelings
"sometimes, i'm tired of being nice"
"normalize being private, your life ain’t for everybody"
u ever killed your own vibe from thinking too much
im too young to be rushing things but I'm too old to be wasting time
i'm fighting battles in my head everyday that nobody knows about
ǝʌol noʎ ǝuo ǝɥʇ ǝq ɐuuɐʍ ʇsnɾ I
"hey,  you're too young to be stressed about love. chase your dream, not people."
God's plan is always perfect.
"i like being alone, it's more peaceful."
"too shy to say, but i hope you stay."
learn how to survive alone.
"sometimes, I am the problem."
trust me i want you and only you.
"cry in private, smile in public."
do u ever miss your own energy. like damn what happened to me
"not happy, not sad. just okay"
"if i send you ugly pics, you’re special."
"i'm not weak, i just cry when i'm hurt."
having a rant buddy is wholesome
"date to marry, that’s it."
i keep a lot of shit to myself because I know nobody would care.
open up and they’ll say you’re too emotional.
"there are two types of pain, one that hurts you, and the other that changes you."
i have the worst attitude when im mad
you need you.  —be there for yourself
Great things take time don't give up.
may our parents live to see us succeed
they ignore u now but need you later
i carry too much inside
"be clingy with me, i love that."
"take care always, my favorite person."
"Sometimes, being quiet is the best weapon that I have."
True friends don't count favors.
Stay positive in life.
So hard to trust people nowadays.
your happiness is my happiness too
expectations break hearts
call me for no reason i love hearing your voice
silence is the best response.
acceptance is the new closure
imagine having someone that understands your mind.
"please, be my permanent happiness."
i hate how soft hearted i am.
"we may not talk, but I still care."
i love people who make me feel special
"stay lowkey, disappear and glow up."
you're the best part of my everyday.
it’s so attractive when someone shows they care.
"from ""🙂"" to ""😕"" real quick"
dear self: sorry for this unhealthy sleeping routine
miss being a little kid with no worries.
"when words fail, eyes speak"
efforts are better than promises.
"Dear Heart, - I'm sorry for causing you too much pain."
It hurt but you learned.
"having me is so boring, sorry."
You can't stay mad at someone who makes you smile.
It's crazy how fast everything can change.
fall in love with someone who will never stop choosing you
Just sleep. It solves everything.
I always feel this feeling that I can’t explain.
"I'm not afraid to love, I'm afraid of not being loved back."
Loyalty is a rare trait nowadays.
"Don't change yourself just to make someone love you, be yourself and let the right one fall for you."
Stop pretending it doesn't hurt. Sometimes it's better to release the pain to feel better.
Overthinking can ruin something before it even begins.
real ones will always be there for you
"When you put God first, you’ll never be last."
i promise you i care more than i show
"i can’t replace you, no one is you."
only my close friends know the real me
i’m really bad at expressing my feelings
can we go back the time we are happy
i just want a day without overthinking.
I prefer to be alone than to be with people I can’t vibe with.
i pray to God to never lose you.
i’m 99.9% sleepy all day
"when maturity hits you, silence is better than arguing"
mood: i wanna move to another city and start a new life
You are worthy of love.
motivate yourself to become better everyday
"everytime my phone vibrates, i hope it's you"
Don't judge a situation you've never been in.
"sorry, i ain't perfect."
"Happy people listen to the music, sad people listen to the lyrics."
Loyalty is not about who will stay with you it's about who won't quit on you.
No girl deserves to be an option.
better to hide my feelings
i like goodmorning and goodnight texts. i like phone calls. i like knowing that someone cares and that they’re trying. i like feeling wanted.
you’re everything my heart wants.
my mood can change for no reason
i ignored everyone for you.
"i'm not a materialistic person, a simple hug can make me smile."
stay strong for yourself
"deleting pictures is so difficult for me, i can't even let go of a random screenshot."
i need unexpected happy message
"And someday, she’ll find the one she deserves."
my jealousy means i actually care about you.
"my toxic trait is that i never speak up, i just get mad and distance myself until i'm not mad anymore"
Never comfort me with a lie.
self-comfort has never been easy.
"i found you, that's enough."
"spend time with yourself, fix yourself &amp; most importantly love yourself."
do you always sleep just to avoid how you feel?
my mind is so tired
"just stay, and be my last"
"Love people from your heart, not from your mood or needs."
Don’t beg anyone for their time or attention.
wish I had no expectations.
i hate endings. i hate goodbyes. i hate change. but that is life. it must go on.
"i will always be proud of you, my love."
Thank u for coming into my life. I'm so glad the universe let us met.
Interested in one person only.
i never faked my love and care to someone
my clingy side is only for my favorite person.
"I didn't choose you, my heart did."
"If you're mine, you're only mine.. I don't share."
"I'm not the person I used to be, I admit, a lot of shit got to me."
I need an escape from reality.
Apologizes don't fix broken hearts.
"I don't beg for love, I pray for love."
I wish I could rewind time.
"I admit, when I'm in a bad mood, EVERYTHING annoys me."
It's better when things happen unexpectedly..
"Technically, I'm single.. But my heart is taken by someone I can't call my own."
"Music always helps, no matter what you're going through."
"Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person."
Pretending to be okay is never easy.
"Talking to you, laughing with you, being with you, changes my whole mood."
You'll never realize it until it's gone.
I'm not okay but I smile.
"In 10 years, I wonder who is still going to be by my side."
can???? we???? just???? remove???? the???? sad???? parts????
i miss laughing with my friends until i can't breathe
you lost the moon while chasing the stars.
i wanna be someone’s biggest flex.
"i prefer to stay lowkey, leave people clueless, and let them assume what they want."
i get jealous with nonsense reason
"it's not just tweets, they're also hints"
i hate the fact that my insecurities are bigger than my confidence
mine or not i’ll always be there for u
your future needs you. your past doesn't.
maybe one day someone will come into my life and actually mean what they say.
Music speak when words can't express your feelings.
I hate when you can't talk because you're about to cry.
you’re the only person i wanna see
i miss being at school complaining about being at school
"share everything with me, i care"
sometimes i think about u and smile
I will achieve my dreams soon.
missing someone's smile
people lie. they always do.
there’s a lot in my heart but i can’t say
endless love for that one person
i hate pretending like it doesn’t hurt
i want someone i can talk to all day
Imagine being enough for someone.
I'm sad but I smile. That's my life.
Never been good enough.
i wanna disappear for a while
please don't abuse my trust
i just wanna stay busy so I don’t have time to think.
i don’t even know what’s wrong with me anymore
"i just want to be better, do better and feel better"
"tired, but i have goals."
"I'm not tired of loving, I'm just tired of crying, trying and waiting."
i've been thinking about you all day
Accept what cannot be changed.
Missing someone is one of the worst feeling in the world.
I can respect a bad decision but I can’t respect a liar.
Don’t ever turn your back on the person who made sure you were okay when nobody else did.
"Feelings can be controlled, but tears never lie.."
Being alone is peaceful.
Sometimes I'm just tired of trying.
I'm not mad. I'm hurt. There's a difference.
"soon, you will receive what you prayed for."
good things are coming.✨ good things are coming.✨ good things are coming.✨
"""are u ok"" no, i need to get rich"
Worst battle: Heart vs Mind
sometimes things don’t go the way we want.
don't ever compare me to someone else.
"reminder: just because you failed, doesn’t mean you’re a failure."
life is teaching me a lot right now.
what’s yours will find you.
you are amazing. remember that.
how to sleep with peace of mind?
note to self: I’m going to make you so proud.
"your time is coming, stay patient."
Be with someone who brings out the best in you.
"people always leave, i am used to it"
"Even the happiest people, cry."
Sometimes we express our feelings through songs.
Trying to be better everyday.
"if i care for you, i care until the end"
Just do whatever makes you happy.
"Be patient, good things take time."
"Stop looking back on your mistakes. What's done is done, Learn from them and move on."
A friendship without bullying is boring.
you deserve people who uplift and validate you.
"Forgive others. Not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace."
Memories are forever.
"People change, feelings fade."
Don't be afraid of losing someone who doesn't feel lucky to have you.
Good times + Crazy friends = Amazing memories.
Don't give up. The beginning is always the hardest.
REJECTION is the reason why people deny their true feelings.
Be weird. Be YOU!
Listen before you talk. Understand before you judge.
People get jealous when they care.
Hurting someone with the truth is better than making them happy with a lie.
Faking smile is so easy but faking feelings is not.
Always respect other people's feelings.
"i am a hardworking lazy person, yes we do exist."
Be careful who you trust.
I’m proud of me because I’ve survived the days I thought I couldn’t.
"i’ve seen many eyes, but i fell for yours"
words can't fix what actions broke
i can reply within 5 seconds after being ignored by 24 hours
if travelling was free you’d never see me again
"one day, you'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore"
"break my trust, never getting it back"
It's hard to see people change. Especially when you miss the way they treated you before.
i want u to know that i'll always care
"be careful with your words, once they are said, they can be only fogiven, not forgotten."
"don’t be afraid to take risks, either you win or you learn."
"a year ago, she was different"
i just wanna feel important
"i'm good, but i have limits"
"revenge is not my thing, i ignore"
no regrets in life just lessons learned
aint attractive but i can make u smile
i hate being lied too that shit hurts
educated or not you don't have the right to disrespect other people
once u lie to me i'm always gonna think you're lying about everything you say.
Some people come into your life just to teach you how to let go.
Just focus on the good things in life.
i badly want someone who can understand me for being me
i really miss the after school bonding with friends
everyone has a story they never told
stay with me no matter how hard i am
having someone who listens to you is a blessing
i miss the feeling of being truly okay
"i hate myself from being sensitive, soft hearted and easily to cry"
Keep everything that makes you happy :)
Never forget who was with you from the start.
"i'm mature and immature, i can do both depending on the mood"
"If I change, it's for myself."
sometimes you just have to breathe and tell yourself it’s okay.
"strong outside, dead inside"
“what if” thoughts are killing me
I just feel pain. A lot of pain.
Someday someone will be afraid to lose you.
Know your worth.
"I'm not perfect. I'm just a person, made by God. I have flaws."
"You make me sad, but I still want you."
TWITTER is literally a great excuse to talk to yourself without looking stupid.
sometimes simple things can make me cry.
Never make permanent decisions on temporary feelings.
Sometimes you fall in love with the most unexpected person at the most unexpected time.
old songs still have the most beautiful lines.
"if i disappointed u, i apologize"
can i delete my insecurities pls
"Fall in love with vibes, nevermind the age."
Pretending to be happy when you're in pain is just an example of how strong you are as a person.
i wanna meet someone like me
I will not make the same mistake by trusting someone so easily again.
i want to sleep forever
When a promise turns into a sorry.
i crave for peace of mind.
Being sad without knowing what is the reason is a different kind of feeling.
your smile changes my whole mood
you are the reason of my happiness
you’re my favorite person to talk to
I saw all your flaws and loved you more.
I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really wanna be cuddled right now.
Accept that not all things will end the way we wanted.
you're the only person i wanna see
It's so frustrating when you can't even understand yourself.
music knows my deepest feelings
Never stop praying for the person you love.
People who understand your silence are important.
"Don't force anything, if it's meant to be it'll find you."
i miss you more than you'll ever know.
my attitude depends on yours
I want a relationship that turns into a blessing not a lesson.
"Pray, God answers."
The best relationships start off as friendships.
"Respect people's feelings. Even if it does not mean anything to you, it could mean everything to them."
A person who accept everything about you is the same person who deserve everything in you.
i'm changing myself everyday so don't compare me to the past version of me
we always tweet things we can't say.
i'm a human too. i can feel pain
i prefer maturity over looks
"lose your pride, not your girl"
"ignore me as long as you want, i'm fine"
I miss your sweet smile.
You can't start the next chapter if you keep re-reading the last one.
Been too exhausted to deal with life lately.
I prefer respect rather than fame.
"day by day, i feel more empty"
"If they don't fight for you, they're not right for you."
Pray everytime. Not just when you're in need.
I got addicted to you so easily.
I want someone who will love me without any conditions.
Be happy and smile.
"i badly need a ""delete feeling"" button"
"once i don’t care, i don’t care"
hearing your voice makes my heart smile
comforting other person while having an own problem
everything happens for a reason everything happens for a reason everything happens for a reason
"I love sleep. You forget about pain, problems, stress, everything for a while."
never take advantage of someone who has a soft spot for you.
Sometimes I can't tell what I feel.
"I wish, I was enough for you to stay."
"sad part is, you can't even fix yourself"
Just want to spend some time with you.
"Same lies, different people."
"self, you can do it."
I choose you forever in my life.
I'm lucky to have you in my life.
"Fall inlove with someone who protects your heart, not plays with it."
I like those people you can joke around with and then have a deep conversation with.
"Being in a relationship is not about kissing, dates, taking pictures or showing off. It's about being with the person who makes you happy."
"Just remember, I cared when no one else did."
Listening to music is the best medicine for a bad day.
No words can describe my feelings inside.
"We deserve someone who may get tired but still, wont give up on us."
Things will get better.
bestfriend love is a different type of love.
Still healing from things i don't speak about.
"If you miss me, you can call me."
sometimes i push people away to test if they will stay.
"In the end, promises are just words."
i wish I can cheer up myself the way I cheer up others
"Trust me, I tried my best."
i hate how my mood shifts from happy to sad easily
you will always be important to me.
music heals but lyrics kills
Appreciate the people who never give up on you.
i want to hug you and sleep
I don't know what to feel anymore.
"Thousand words was hidden as I said ""I'm fine""."
"Please be aware, I am trying my hardest to push through the pain, the exhaustion and fatigue, the brain fog, the insomnia, the fear, the guilt, the judgement, the relentlessness of it all. All the time."
waiting is better than forcing things to happen.
"If twitter was school, I'd have perfect attendance. :D"
"Brain, I need you to focus."
i hate it when my anger turns into tears.
i smile to make people believe that I'm strong.
Heal yourself first. The rest will come.
"Don't expect too much, you might get hurt."
"""you look tired"" bro i want to stop existing"
"The older you get, the less people you trust."
If you can love the wrong person that much. Imagine how much you can love the right one.
"one day, i'm gonna have everything i prayed for. i really believe it."
"Details always mean a lot, always."
I need a hug and six months of sleep
"i want someone to look at me and say ""damn that's mine"" and just be proud to have me"
You're still my happy pill.
I love you for who you are.
"don't trust words, trust actions."
make memories with the right people
You know you're mature when you don't force people to stay in your life anymore.
sometimes it’s better to just keep it to yourself.
"I never faked my ""I miss you"" to someone."
Someday someone will stay.
"As we grow older, we realize it is best to be lowkey and private."
"if she's important to you, show her."
i can't force you to appreciate me but you sure gonna feel it when i'm gone.
You're not selfish for wanting to be treated well.
i'm nice until you break my trust.
"I fall in love with personalities and vibes, not looks and money."
I don't know what to talk about but I wanna talk to you.
the worst distance between two people is misunderstanding
I regret opening up to some people.
right eyes will see your worth
Dream it. Believe it. Achieve it.
"I pretend like i don't care, but you're stuck in my head."
i'll be the one that stays till the end.
"Whatever comes, let it come. What stays, let it stay. What goes, let it go."
an overthinker notices everything.
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
I'm too soft and I hate it.
Choose the one who can accept your imperfections.
"Anyone can give you material things but giving attention, loyalty, effort, and honesty is priceless."
Kinda sad but it's okay.
"not everybody will understand your silence, remember that."
"Sleeping is considered the most effective cure to forget about pain, problems, stress and everything for a while."
Be mature enough to accept rejections and failures.
True love never fades.
"Once you fall for someone's personality, everything about them becomes beautiful."
All you can do is wait. There is a right time for everything.
Crying is the best way to release emotions.
"Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn."
I care about you. A lot actually.
Missing you is becoming a habit.
That moment when the lyrics of the song matches your mood.
Some friends aren't really friends... They're family.
"the eyes will tell, what mouth can't."
hugging a pillow and imagining it's the person you love
"Actions speak louder than words. We can apologize over and over, but if our actions don't change, the words become meaningless."
"i was too busy saving others from their sadness, not knowing that i forgot to save myself"
Everyone wants the truth but nobody wants to be honest.
never forget who was with you when you had nothing
better to wait than force things to happen
"I want you to want me, but I know that it cannot be."
i'm full of emotions i never show
"if you feel tired and drained, take a little break, but don't give up."
nothing is more heartbreaking than when you try your hardest and it still isn't enough
Be thankful for what you have.
Take time to pray.
Mistakes are proof that you're trying.
Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections.
One mistake and everyone judges you.
"Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay, it's not the end."
"Sometimes the person you want most, is the person you're best without."
"Don't ever be afraid to show who you really are, because as long as you are happy with yourself no one else's opinion matters."
"Don't be too hard to yourself, yourself needs you."
"she's healing day by day, she's me."
i’m at the “we’ll see” stage in my life. with everything and everyone. we will see.
"Never trust anyone too much, because when they break it, it also hurts so much."
i hate this heavy heart feeling
"I want to be loved, not to be used."
i prefer loneliness over fake company.
I'm not afraid to try again. I am just afraid of getting hurt for the same reason.
your hug is all i want when i'm sad
"i know i'm not good. but hey, i'm trying my best."
nobody knows how many times I've cried myself silently.
i wish i could also be someone's favorite.
i feel empty but i'm fine
"tbh i noticed everything, i was just silent."
psychology says: you don't really need someone to complete you you only need someone to accept you completely
it’s okay to disappear until you feel like you again
you killed me with your words i killed you with my silence
"don't abuse soft hearted persons, because too much pain will turn them in to cold one"
back hugs and forehead kisses are the best.
i am here if you need me
"Reminder: Be gentle with yourself. I mean, whenever you make mistakes, take a deep breath and allow yourself to be a mess. It can be really hard but years of being hard on yourself is done. Give yourself the love it needs and see where it takes you."
"Sometimes I wish to become a robot; no emotions, no pain."
"The saddest goodbye is when you still want to hold on, but you need to let go."
sleeping after crying hits so different
"Breakups are ok. Starting over is ok. Moving on is ok. Saying no is ok. Being alone is ok. What is not ok is staying somewhere where u are not happy, valued, or unappreciated, that's not ok."
"I'm thinking too much and it also makes me sad, and it sucks."
"I want to delete social media everyday, but social media makes me laugh when I need it."
so you hate me? lol same
"I miss you, but I know you don't care."
i keep it inside cause it’s hard to tell.
Old songs and chill.
I'm attracted to the person that I have no chance to be with.
so many what ifs on my mind.
having a trust issue is not easy.
"If I ever tell you about my past, it’s never because I want you to feel sorry for me but so you can understand why I am who I am"
I’m not about that “no feelings” shit. Fuck that. I feel deeply. I have a heart. I’m human. Things affect me dude.
You can't control everything. Sometimes you just need to relax and have faith things will work out. Let go a little and let life happen.
"i don't do revenge, i delete people."
Treat people how you want to be treated.
"When you’re happy, you enjoy the music. But when you’re sad, you understand the lyrics."
"The more you care, the more you have to lose."
Don't chase. Get chosen.
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone how much they mean to you.
be kind. be honest.
"i miss u, i miss us, i miss everything with u"
"The beautiful thing about life is that you can always change, grow, and better yourself. You aren't defined by your past. You aren't your mistakes."
i’ll always want the best for u even if we don’t speak anymore
Someday you will realize my worth.
It’s hard to find people who understand.
We aren't afraid of love; we are afraid of not being loved in return.
whatever I was before I am not those things anymore.
let the pain teach you how to be strong
Stay lowkey. Not everyone needs to know everything about you.

Don't make a promise you can't keep.
A person who cares silently is a person who loves truly.
"If I had millions of choices, I'd still choose you."
"Let's just accept the fact that, no matter how hard you try, if a person is not interested to you, he/she will never love you back."
"I may not be a showy-type person, but believe me, I always care."
"This time, I'll prioritize my own happiness."
You deserve a love you always pray for.
wondering if you miss me like i miss you
"You smile, I fall deeper."
i wanna be kissed &amp; hugged by you.
"I'm not rich. I'm not smart. I'm not appealing. But, I have a good and loving heart."
Never ignore a person who loves you and cares for you. One day you may realize you've lost the moon while counting the stars.
"Be patient, have faith, the best is yet to come."
"No matter what terms we on, If I said I’ll be there for you I will."
"I’m happy, hurting, and healing at the same time. Don’t ask me how."
"Please, if you’re not interested in someone anymore, tell them. Don’t let them find out the hard way. They deserve to know that you no longer love them. They deserve to find someone who does. They deserve loyalty. They deserve a fair chance at love too. Don’t lead them around."

"i'm tired, but im still trying my best"
"I appreciate effort. No matter how small, big or irrelevant it is, I appreciate effort."

You’re too good for someone who isn't sure about you.

Apologize when you’re wrong. Stop looking for quotes that support your stupidity.

enough crying. You deserve better.
Real love is not easy.
sometimes you have to stay busy so you don’t have time to feel.
sometimes we say “bye” to hear “stay”
It’s okay to lose people but never lose yourself.
"when i'm into you, no other person gets the same attention."
i love people who appreciates my weird personalities.
"I just want peace, no heartaches, no tears, no pain."
You deserve someone who thinks you’re too important to lose.

Sometimes you have to remind yourself that you can’t be replaced.
You can be confident and still have anxiety.
Stop forcing friendships and relationships.
Some people just aren’t ready for that real type of love.
Fake people don't last.
A loyal heart is enough.
Stop forgiving people that keep hurting you.
Train your mind to be stronger than your emotions.
"Loving someone who doesn't love you back is like hugging a cactus. The tighter you hold on, the more it hurts."
Make sure your self-respect is stronger than your feelings.
Lack of communication will destroy a relationship.
Make sure the people in your circle are good for your mental health.
Maturity is attractive.
Don’t break yourself just to fit into someone’s life.

"I'm a strong person, but do you know what makes me cry? Its when I gave my best but I still feel useless."
i wish i was better.
TIP: Don’t read old conversation.
It sucks when I have to act like it wasn’t a big deal when it was actually breaking my fucking heart.
Not in a relationship but there’s a person in my heart that I really want to be mine.
Did you heal or did you force yourself to forget?
How they treat you is how they feel about you. Period.
Imagine how many people dislike you because they didn’t hear your side of the story.

I wish the person I love today will be my future someday.
better to be lowkey and private.
I fucking love when someone figures out the small things that you like by paying such close attention to you instead of you having to tell them.

you stole my heart since day one.
appreciate what you have right now because you don't always get a second chance.

"I never fake my tears. So when it falls, I'm really hurt."

"Don't rush things, trust God."
I love seeing you happy.

Sometimes your worst enemy is your own memory. Let that shit go.
Learn to heal your own sadness.
"To an overthinker, you can't sleep because a lot of thoughts are going through your head. You are scared of the future. You are scared of losing someone. You are afraid to fail and feel that you are not enough. Go with the flow and trust the process. You are enough."
Do you know what hurts? My back.

"We never ""lose"" friends, we just learn who our real ones are."
I want someone who doesn't get tired replying to my boring messages.
⠀  Don't compare me to anyone.  ⠀
"I matured because of pain, not age."
Unexpected message from someone you miss is the best.
"I fall in love with personality and mindset, not looks and money."
"If I tell you about my family, I really trust you."
"If you both want it, it will work."
“I trust you” is a lot deeper than “I love you”
I still pray for you and for your happiness.
"I have a special place in my heart for people who ask me how I’m feeling and randomly check up on me, keep those people close to you."
"The world is gonna judge you no matter what you do, so love your life the way you want to."

It's okay to break down and cry.
"I think a lot, but I don't say much."
I need someone who needs me and doesn't let go.
Everything changed when I met you.
"It’s okay, to show your emotions."
A road trip. A vacation. Any type of getaway is definitely a need right now.
I didn’t deserve that. You knew it too.
Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary.
Keep that person who chooses to stay beside you despite of seeing flaws.
No longer apologizing for wanting more. I’m growing. You either stay or you go.
It’s time for you to be happy again.
I honestly want something good to happen to me. I really need that rn.
My anxiety makes me think everyone secretly dislikes me.
feeling unwanted changes you a lot
"missing you right now,but I can't do anything about it"
"if you lost me, i’m so sorry for ur loss."
i hope i never lose what i love the most
"temporary people, permanent memories"
i choose your happiness before mine
"Yes, I've changed. Pain does that to people."
"The eyes, they never lie."
Ghosting toxic people is self care.
Small circle. High value.
Kind hearts go through a lot.
"Dear Self,   It’s okay to do what is best for you."
Finding someone who understands you is rare.
The true mark of maturity is when somebody hurts you and you try to understand their situation instead of trying to hurt them back.
Don't expect. You'll be hurt.
We all have stories we'll never tell.
Smile at people who hate you.
The best relationship is when you can act like lovers and best friends.
I got trust issues because people got lying issues.
It is never too late to make things right.
Take a moment to realize how blessed you are.
i’ll always have you in my prayers.
Healing day by day.
Have you ever tried to make someone suffer by not texting them and you suffer more?

"i don’t want perfect, i want honest and faithful."
"to be honest, you're the only one i've ever spent this much time and effort on."
thinking of you... again
i should have hugged you harder the last time I saw you
you don't know how much you mean to me
May you soon meet the reason why God did not allow you to settle.
⠀ Stop overthinking. Relax and let it go. ⠀
i can't imagine living a happy life without you being a part of it
when we first met I honestly had no idea you would be so important to me
"i know people are temporary but please just this once, be permanent."
"choose a good attitude, not a good face."
My pillows know all the pain.
Let’s switch places so you’ll feel what I felt. Maybe then you’ll understand.
is your heart okay?
"I read somewhere,   “You keep forgiving someone until you unlove them.”   and I felt that."
"i’m such a “no no, it’s okay” person."
Isn't it scary knowing that any time could be the last time you talk to someone? Always keep that in mind.
A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.
One day you will meet someone who will make all the waiting seem worth it.
"whatever happens, i love you."
"Never get too attached to anyone unless they also feel the same towards you, because one sided expectations can mentally destroy you"
If I sleep early it means I’m sad.
The biggest comeback is making yourself happy again.
"I love you, stay safe wherever you are."
"Be in my place, then you’ll understand."
All I wanna do is talk to you.
Please take care of yourself.
So if I don’t text first we won’t talk?
"lack of communication ruins everything because instead of knowing how the other person is feeling, we just assume."
"""Im proud of you"" just hits different."
I’m so soft when it comes to you.
Life is too short to waste your time thinking about someone who doesn't treat you right.
Stay away from people who act like a victim in a problem they created.
Never wanna feel that pain again.
You’re not selfish for wanting the same energy and love you give.
don’t say “sorry” and then do it all over again.
"i'm trying, i'm really trying."
it’s so stupid how the tiniest thing can break my heart &amp; ruin my mood i literally didn’t ask to be this sensitive.
a best friend is someone who makes you laugh even when you think you’ll never smile again.
don't lie to me to protect my feelings.
"if you break someone's heart and they still talk to you with the same excitement and respect. believe me, they really love you"
i just need someone to understand me.
missing someone who doesn't miss me.
smallest lie can break the biggest trust.
"honestly, i really feel stupid for holding onto things that keep on hurting me."
i lose interest when i see myself trying harder than you.
"Sorry that I have trust issues, but when you give someone everything and they treat it like it’s nothing, something inside of you really breaks."
I miss being a little kid with no worries.
I’m stuck between keep trying and why bother.
Kinda hope you are thinking about me.
"The less you care, the happier you are."
I'm full of words that I can’t say.
Don’t kill your own vibe by overthinking.
Know your position in someone’s life and act accordingly.
Sometimes you have to make a decision that will hurt your heart but will heal your soul.
Not everyone you love will love you back.
You’re too rare to lose.
Sometimes you have to disconnect to reconnect.
Bad communication ends a lot of good things.
Tweets are actually hints.
"Dear life, i just wanna be happy."
Want your attention but don't wanna bother you.
It’s not a joke when anxiety attacks.
Don’t let someone treat you bad just because you love them.
Please don't come closer unless you plan to stay.
"Let it hurt, then let it go."
I’m just thankful for the people that never left me.
I want someone who will stay with me no matter how hard i am to be with.
Not everyone can vibe with you.
It is such a great feeling when someone just genuinely wants to talk to you and wants to know how your life is going.
"I used to protect my name in every situation, but now i just want to protect my peace. Fuck what people think."
Isn’t it sad?? that you're a keeper but never been kept.
"In 10 years from now, I want to see myself loving the same person I love today."
Music knows my deepest feelings.
"I'm not heartless, I'm just tired of getting hurt."
that moment when you start feeling okay for once but then you overthink everything and suddenly a wave of sadness hits you like a truck.
God knows how many times I prayed for you.
I’m matured enough to understand that i have some toxic traits too.
"Note to self: if they want to, they will."
"Take a risk. If the outcome isn't what you expected, at least you can say you tried."
i sleep to avoid my problems.
Positive mind. Positive vibe.  Positive life.
I can lose everything but not you.
"Don’t cry, no one cares."
i’m a pro at pretending to be okay.
I stopped explaining myself when I realized other people only understand from their level of perception.
"Don't lie to make me feel better, don't take my hand if you're going to let it go, don't make me fall if you're not going to catch me."
"Sometimes it's better to push someone away. Not because you stopped loving them, but because you have to shield yourself from the pain."
overthinkers deserve to date good communicators.
"Before you ""assume"" try this method  called ""ask"""
"Sometimes you need to take a break from everyone and spend time alone, take a break, appreciate, and love yourself."
"Walk away from people who put you down. Walk away from fights that will never be resolved. Walk away from trying to please people who will never see your worth. The more you walk away from things that poison your soul, the healthier you will be."
Stop checking for a person who doesn't check for you. Stop investing your heart into someone who mistreats you. You're better than that.
I overthink myself into bad moods.
My relationship will always be private but I’ll never keep my partner a secret. there’s a difference between privacy and secrecy.
8 things to quit:  1. trying to please everyone 2. fearing change 3. living in the past 4. overthinking 5. being afraid to be different 6. sacrificing your happiness for others 7. thinking you're not good enough 8. thinking you have no purpose
Sometimes I just feel like hugging myself and apologizing to myself for all the mistakes I’ve made in this life.
Having a supportive partner can literally change your life.
"Date in private, love in private, be happy in private."
"Once you have true feelings for someone, it will always be there. You may not like them anymore, but you still care."
Nobody has a perfect life. Everybody has their own problems. Some people just know how to deal with it in a better way.
"Dear self,   Sorry for putting pressure on you.  Sorry for doubting you sometimes.  Sorry for being so hard on you lately.  Sorry for worrying so much about what the future holds.   This time around, i will focus on you and will love everything about you."
Stop chasing after people &amp; being the only one trying to fix everything. It's mentally &amp; physically exhausting. You have to find peace with whoever comes &amp; goes from your life. Don't be the only one putting in effort Bc you will end up losing yourself trying to save everyone else
"⠀  Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy.  ⠀"
"Be careful who you trust, the devil was once an angel."
"Don't trust too much, don't love too much, don't care too much because that 'too much' will hurt you so much!!"
"Sometimes, the advice you give to other people is the advice you need to follow."
You’ve been so hurt no wonder why trusting someone again feels heavy.
Give yourself time to heal. Don’t expect the next person to be a band-aid for what the last person did. Read that again.
"I go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace."
Nobody can piss you off like the person you love. I swear they hit a different type of nerve.
"Sometimes people need their space. They’re not cutting you off, they just need time to breathe and take care of themselves. They need some space to work on themselves. That has nothing to do with you."
"Loyalty is rare. If you find it, keep it."
"keep me, im clingy and will love u only"
I want you. I want us. I want it all. With you. Only you.
Not everyone you love will stay. Not everyone you trust will be loyal.
Night calls with you is all I need.
Distance sometimes lets you know who's worth keeping and who's worth letting go.
"If it’s real, it’ll never be over."
Some days I’m healing. Some days I break again.
"Don’t abuse soft hearted persons, because too much pain will turn them into a cold one."
i only get jealous because i’m afraid someone is going to make you happier than i do.
"If nobody got me, I got me."
music hits different when you’re sad.
"Stay private, enjoy life."
"I pretend to ignore you, but I really just miss you."
my worst quality?  someone could hurt me so damn much and yet i’d still be there for them at the end.
i meet someone                 ⬈                              ⬊  they leave                        we talk                      ⬉                                ⬋                                   i get attached
"dear anxiety, let’s break up and not see each other ever again."
my favorite memory was meeting you.
nothing is better than talking to someone you’re comfortable with.
sometimes i miss how good everything was.
wish i could tell you what’s really on my mind.
never regret anything that made you smile.
"Don’t chase, don’t beg, if they want you they’ll make time for you."
"What hurts you today, makes you stronger tomorrow."
I’m not sad but im full of feelings i don’t like.
i just wanna sit in front of the ocean &amp; listen to the waves.
the best relationships usually begin unexpectedly.
I don’t want to break my heart again.
"If we date, I don't need your passwords or your phone, I just want the truth if I ask about something."
one song makes you remember a lot.
every goodbye teaches u something.
Never joke around about someone's insecurities. You'll never know what they really feel.
"You've been through a lot, you're such a strong person. Remember that."
I pray future me is successful.
Learn to say “no” without feeling guilty.
"If you’re special to me, don’t ruin it."
just because i didn’t react doesn’t  mean i didn’t notice.
"you can never be ""Just friends” with  someone you’ve fallen in love with."
Trust the timing in your life.
Never tell people more than they need to know.
Stay single until you’re appreciated.
People change. Memories don't.
I need a long long long deep conversation with someone who understands.
I will never stop loving you.
I am not the same person I once was.
I just wanna feel important to someone
You ever notice someone slowly losing interest in you and you’re just like:                          “Oh”
"Forget about the past, people change."
Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory.
Show effort and I’ll show interest.
It’s different without you.
"The truth is, we can't force someone to love us back."
I hate when I cry about one thing then I end up crying about everything that's messed up in my life.
Growing up is scary.
I want nothing more than to see you
I either have no emotions or too many.
Imagine someone listening to a song and thinking of you.
Emotionally: i'm done  Mentally: i'm drained  Spiritually: I feel dead  Physically: I smile.
I thought I was doing better.
Girls usually fall in love with funny boys.
I want to escape reality.
"Don't change for anyone. People will love you for who you are, or you don't need them in your life."
Never compare me to someone else thanks.
"Ever since I met you, no one else has been worth thinking about."
Loyalty still matters even on bad terms.
Don't judge my choices if you don't understand my reasons.
"Stop getting attached to people so fast, because attachments lead to expectations and expectations can lead to disappointments."
It takes a lot for me to trust someone.
I have no motivation for anything.
"If it hurts, you care."
"Oh right, my fault again."
"Blasting music, and ignoring the world."
I want your attention but I won't ask for it.
Being strangers again is not easy.
"In relationships, the little things really do matter."
"Do you ever write a really long message and about halfway through you're like ""you know what, they don't even care"" and end up deleting it"
"If you’re reading this, here’s a reminder that you’re worth it and you deserve to be happy."
losing respect for someone is always such a weird thing because you don’t hate the person. you just don’t feel the need to ever speak to them again or even think about them in the same way. you’re just done.
how to be happy?   1. pray 2. stop holding grudges 3. let go 4. forgive 5. see the good side of your struggles
Be strong because you'll never know who you are inspiring.
"A pretty face gets old, a nice body will change, but a good heart will always be good."
"There's no need to rush. If something is meant to be, it will happen. In the right time, with the right person, for the best reason."
"In reality, no one cares, they're just curious."
"Date someone who handles conflict with maturity. Someone who lets you know when he is annoyed with you instead of bottling up inside. Someone who treats you with respect, even when he is struggling not to scream at you. Someone who is willing to make compromises, because of love."
Everything happens for a reason.
"Take care of the people you love, but take even better care of the people that love you."
"Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you."
"Sometimes it is your fault.. Sometimes you don't listen well enough, you're selfish, you're rude and aren't always right. Sometimes you fucked it up and that's okay. It happens, learn from it, apologize and keep moving. Just because you fucked up doesn't mean you're a bad person."
Never waste your feelings on people who don't value them.
"Your age doesn't define your maturity, your grades don't define your intelligence, and rumors don't define who you are."
Don't stress over shit you can't change.
⠀  Choose people who choose you.  ⠀
I hope future me is happy.
"If you love someone, be brave enough to tell them, otherwise, be brave enough to watch them be loved by someone else."
"Being someone's first love is great, but being someone's last love is beyond perfect."
Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer makes you happy.
"sleepy eyes, heavy heart with busy mind."
private life always wins. keep it secret till you win.
"Psychology says, It's not the song makes you emotional it's the people and things that's come to your mind when you hear it."
i pray my friends get through the battles that they don't tell me about.
"Stay strong, even when things begin to fall apart, stay strong."
I wanted to feel loved without feeling like I was begging for it.
"I’m a very forgiving person so If I stop talking to you, you really went too far."
"Nobody cares unless you are beautiful, rich, popular or dead."
"Ed Sheeran was right, loving can hurt sometimes."
“i’m such a “no it’s okay” and suffer in silence type of person.”
"i may not see you everyday, but i love you everyday"
tired of wasting my effort on people who don’t deserve it.
sometimes your mind can be your worst enemy.
"if i cry in front of you, believe me, i have reached my limit."
so much shit i wanna say but i stay quiet.
I know my worth I’m just dumb sometimes.
Be with someone who is also comfortable with your silence.
A “sorry” is useless when “trust” is broken.
An overthinking person needs an understanding person.
Imagine someone tweeting about you.
"God, Goals, Growing &amp; Glowing."
I love twitter because there’s always someone who knows how to express what I feel better than me.
"Don’t change yourself just to make someone love you, be yourself and let the right one fall for you."
"Things will be better soon, hopefully."
Learn to love without expectation.
"Self-love, the best gift you could ever give to yourself."
we cannot grow without pain.
Going through a lot but still smiling.
RIP to my mental health.
"I never cheat, because I know how it hurts to be cheated."
Be kind without expecting anything in return.
𝐖𝐀𝐘𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐁𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐄 𝐏𝐄𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐇𝐀𝐏𝐏𝐈𝐄𝐑  𝟏. Mind your own business. 𝟐. Focus on the goodthlngs in life.  𝟑. Complain Less.  𝟒. Less argument.  𝟓. Surround yourself with positive and inspiring people. 𝟔. Smile more.
"Through ups and downs, you have me."
Age don’t make you grown. Your mindset and the way you move does.
"Don’t tell me you love me, show me."
"Don’t leave a girl you need, for a girl you want."
Sometimes you have to vibe alone to really understand some things.
"When you find someone who accepts you the way you are, that's home."
I’m the type of person that will sit in the bathroom and cry but then walk out like nothing ever happened.
"I still like you, I'm just tired of trying."
I wanna be someone’s first choice.
"I will be fine, soon."
Just smile the pain away.
I used to be much happier.
"sometimes, you end up losing yourself trying to hold onto someone who never cared about losing you."
"please, be my permanent happiness."
kinda want a big long hug.
i choose you over everyone.
Friends can make everything better.
what’s on my mind?  you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you.
and we didn’t talk after that happened.
"if you stay,  stay forever.   if you go,  do it today.   if you change,  change for the better.   if you talk,  make sure you mean what you say."
"you fall in love with the little things about someone, like the sound of their laugh or the way their smile forms."
when someone asks you to listen  to a song. it’s because the lyrics  mean everything they’re trying to say
"i know im a hard person. im sensitive, im moody, i need constant reassurance and i tend to overthink. but please don’t think that that’s all i am. i can be calm, i can be strong, and i can be loving. if you catch me on a day where im being hard, don’t think that’s all i am."
"be a good person, but don’t waste  time to prove it."
Sleep is the perfect escape from everything.
it costs $0.00 to be loyal.   it costs $0.00 to be consistent.  it costs $0.00 to be honest.
i wanna sit on a rooftop with someone  and talk about all my feelings with them.
don’t use someone to forget someone.
i’m a very private person. you don’t ask  i don’t tell.
choose me or lose me. i'm not a backup plan and definitely not a second choice.
"so young, so damaged."
i never faked my love to someone.
Save me from my thoughts.
they care when it's too late.
"I love you, that means I’m not just here for the pretty parts and the happy days. I’m here for the rough and the bad days. I’m here no matter what."
Love should heal you and not hurt you.
Don’t judge yourself by your past. You don’t belong there anymore.
A girl's pain.   You will never ever understand that.
Date someone mature enough to say “let’s fix this” instead of just acting childish and ignoring you.
You don’t realize how attached you are to someone until you go without talking to them for a bit.
"Someday, when things are okay, you’ll look back and feel proud that you did not give up."
"Believe with your eyes, not with your ears."
True friends don't talk shit about you.
I salute those people who smile despite all of their problems.
Unexpected text from you is the best feeling ever.
Life can be so exhausting sometimes.
"People always leave, I am used to it."
"Relax, take a deep breath. Everything will be fine."
"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."
"Psychology says, friendship is not about who you spend the most time with, it’s about who you have the best time with."
I always prefer being lowkey and private.
behind every strong person there’s a mess you can’t see.
Too many people are trying to find the right person instead of being the right person
Insecurity mentally destroys you.
"It’s ok. I mean it’s not ok, but it’s ok."
Dear old days: I miss you.
You know someone means a lot to you when their mood affects yours.
"if you're meant to be with someone, it will work out. whether it's next month or in five years, what's meant to be will always be."
3 things you should never break: 1) Trust 2) Promises 3) Hearts
Being kissed while you're asleep is one of the most purest forms of love.
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Unexpected friendship is the best.
Life is teaching me a lot right now.
Sorry for being a typical boring person to talk.
"I don’t want perfect, I want worth it."
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.
Find someone who shares the same vibes as yours
"I be like ""idc"" then start overthinking."
"""I saw your tweet, you okay?"" I really appreciate this kind of person."
"Be a good person in real life, not just on social media."
Sometimes I really wanna be heartless too but that’s not who I am.
I hope your heart finds peace
You’ll succeed. Even if it takes time. You’ll make it.
Take me to the place where only happiness exist.
"Please love me from your heart, not according to your mood and need."
Everything happens for a reason.
Shoutout to everyone trying right now. Trying to do the right thing. Trying to hold on. Trying to let go. Trying to love themselves. Trying to find happiness. Trying to stay strong. We’re in this together.
Always tell someone how you feel because opportunities are lost in the blink of an eye but regret can last for a lifetime.
missing your bestfriend is a different type of sadness
Life’s better when nobody knows anything about you.
Happiness makes people prettier. It’s a noticeable glow.
i really want cute pics with u :(
Be thankful for the real ones in your life.
Healing is becoming the best version of yourself.
"If they come back to you, don’t forget how they left."
Love is not a reason to tolerate disrespect.
Stop expecting loyalty from people who can’t give you honesty.
Sometimes being alone is the upgrade.
Hate is heavy. Let it go.
"Losing someone who doesn’t appreciate you is a gain, not a loss."
a smile hides a thousand tears and a broken heart
"if i ever tell you about my past, it’s never  because i want you to feel sorry for me, but so you can understand why i am  who i am."
disappointed but not surprised.
"maybe i don’t cry, but it hurts.  maybe i won’t say, but i feel.  maybe i don’t show, but i care."
"sometimes, you end up losing yourself trying to hold onto someone who never cared about losing you."
one of the hardest decisions you’ll  ever face in life is choosing wether to walk away or try even harder.
sending warm hugs to those who feel sad and empty.
I always think too much but say too little.
Don’t be afraid to fail. Be afraid not to try.
"Prayer changes more than things, it changes YOU."
how i wish there was a restart button
"If you can only read my mind, you’ll definitely understand everything I feel."
Let‘s talk about how hard it is to open up to someone about being sad for no reason. how hard is it to explain to your friends and family that you have a heavy feeling in your chest for no reason.
"If they’re okay with losing you, stop fighting."
one mistake broke everything.
i want to cry but i have things to do.
they’ll never understand
"if no one will choose you, learn to choose yourself"
bestfriend love is a different type of love.
focus on growth . not perfection.
Deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
"If you feel tired and drained, take a little break, but don’t give up."
i always cry in silence.
appreciate what you have before it turns into what you had.
mood: to be with you rn
"i prayed for you, your happiness."
"removing myself from situations where i don’t feel loved, appreciated, or respected."
so hard to trust people nowadays.
self-care.  self-love.  self-trust.
i gave wrong people the right pieces of me.
i hate getting flashbacks from things  i don’t want to remember anymore.
"That feeling when you're not necessarily sad, but you just feel really empty."
Make sure the person you’re choosing over everybody is choosing you too.
Not totally healed but at least feeling better.
the fight between your heart &amp; your mind ain’t no joke
"if you don't know the whole story, shut up."
eye contact with same feelings
tbh telling someone how you feel is honestly the hardest thing ever
Tweeting your feelings is better than saying it to other people.
people be acting like they know everything abt u lmao
"One day, you’ll be at the place you always wanted to be."
I hope you heal from things you don’t talk about.
Stay humble. Stay focused. Stay blessed.
"Psychology says that over thinking is just a painful reminder that you care entirely too much, even when you shouldn't."
"One person, so many feelings."
"I don't hate you, I'm just dissapointed you turned into everything you said you'd never be."
i like private but not a secret
Deleting your toxic paragraph to text back “ok” is a different kind of self control.
"To everyone going through struggles or pain right now, keep your head up, and keep smiling, God heals all."
Don't let your emotions make your decisions.
"Seek respect, not attention. It lasts longer."
"You can lose yourself trying to please everyone, but you can also lose everyone trying to find yourself."
"Don't let yourself be controlled by three things: people, money, or past experiences."
"if i talk to my mom about you , you really mean a lot to me"
you make me smile without trying
Don’t force people to choose you.
"you’ll always have me, i promise."
my clingy side is only for my fav person.
"If they don’t respect your feelings, they don’t deserve to be in your life."
"I’m shy at first, but if you get to know me I’m the most annoying person you’ve ever met."
"Trust what you feel, not what you hear."
"It's about who stays, not who promised."
A partner with the same vibe as yours &gt;&gt;&gt;
it’s attractive when you get the same effort you give
I didn't plan falling in love with you it just happened
There’s so much I wanna say but if I talk about it I’ll start crying.
never wanna feel that pain again
Your trauma is not your fault but healing is your responsibility.
I owe myself an apology for all the shit i let slide
Stuck between “I need to save money” and “you only live once”
"When I'm alone, I think too much."
"We don’t need to talk every day to be friends. If you need me, I got you."
Life is full of shit. You'll just have to deal with it.
do    not          come    back           to        me           when      you           realize        no           one cared           like                    i                      did
i wish i can turn back time and fix what's needed to fix.
i automatically say idk when i’m too lazy to think
"“you’ve changed” - no, i am learning and growing"
nothing hurts more than being ignored.
old messages really hit when you know that the bond is never coming back.
Save your heart for someone who cares.
Sometimes people pretend you’re a bad person so they don’t feel guilty for how they treated you.
Loyalty is rare.
You glow different when your soul is happy.
Self comfort is not easy.
Find someone who knows how to love you when you are sad.
Cheers to all the pain we choose to hide.
I appreciate those who ask if I’m okay.
A tear is made of 1% water and 99% feelings.
"I’m so exhausted. I feel like I’m repeating the same day over and over, the same routine, same feelings, same meaningless drama. I’m so sick of it, I just want to feel alive and be happy but I’m constantly drained and everything feels so pointless. I just feel dead."
i can turn from a softie to cold as fuck
"I want to refresh my mind, clear all my problems and just have fun with life."
"Be good to the people who are there for you, they deserve it."
"Depression isn’t always sadness, it can also be emptiness, anger, tiredness or loneliness, sometimes a cry for help isn’t so visible."
Willing to take risks with you.
"I trusted you, you lied."
Remember: “Your mental health is important.”
Hearing “im so proud of you” when you feel like you aren’t doing enough really does lift a lot of weight off of you.
You’re lucky if you found a person who never gets tired of your mood swings.
There are a lot of unsaid thoughts in my head right now.
"To those having a hard time right now realize, it’s only temporary."
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
"Be strong, s e l f."
"Someday, I’ll be someone’s first priority. Maybe."
Unexpected messages from someone you missed or care about are the best type of messages.
Real feelings don’t change fast.
The best apology is changed behavior.
Two types of me: 1) wanna talk to you 2) don't wanna bother you
Once you find your person there’s nobody else you want.
"I don‘t care if we haven't spoken in a while if you text me because you need advice or simply a friend to talk to, I'll be here."
"When you're with the right person, you don’t have to work so hard to be happy. It just happens."
"if i could turn my sadness into cash, damn i'm rich."
"I think the hardest decision, is when you need to choose between what is right and what makes you happy."
"I wanna build a relationship with someone who cares about ""why"" I've been quiet all day. Not someone who gets mad cause I'm ""acting different”."
"dear music, thanks"
Just because it’s hard doesn’t mean it’s impossible. You can do it.
don't: - cheat - please everyone - settle for less - cry over someone  know: - your worth - that you matter - that you're loved - how to pray - how to say thank you  its: - okay to make mistakes - okay to fall down - not bad to cry when tired - good to smile - time to move on
i give silent treatment when im sad
"Dear Life, Why we fall inlove with people we can't have?"
Someone out there feels better because you exist. Remember that.
I went through my darkest times alone so I'm sorry if I act like I don't need anyone
i will never give up on u ily
behind my smile is a story you'll never understand.
Acceptance is hard.
"i love you still, i always will."
I hate when people assume shit. Just ask me &amp; I'll tell you.
Don’t ever judge anyone on how they handle a pain you’ve never felt.
She's broken because she trusted you.
"Fall in love with someone who wants you, who waits for you. who understands you even in the madness; someone who helps you, and guides you, someone who is your support, your hope. fall in love with someone who talks with you after a fight."
you are enough.   you are good enough.   you are smart enough.   you are strong enough.   you are beautiful enough.   you are kind enough.   you are brave enough.   you are enough and you will always be.
i wish i was someone’s fav
i get jealous very fast
sometimes home is a person.
“you deserve better“ nah why can’t you be better?
Genuine people are rare.
Be a private person. Live peacefully.
Praying for a clear mind &amp; a happy heart.
Being toxic is not cute. Grow up and learn how to love properly.
"when someone has seen the worst parts of u &amp; still decides to stay, that's when you know they’re worth keeping. not everyone is willing to stick with u when times get tough. appreciate those who remain by your side, they’re the ones who deserve u at ur absolute best."
How to save your heart:  1. should:  • never expect  • never demand  • never assume  2. know:  • your limits  • where you stand  • your role  3. don't:  • get affected  • get jealous  • get paranoid  4. just:   • go with the flow and be happy  • stay positive
"Keep healing, it looks good on you."
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile.
Hearing “i miss you” or “i want to see you again” from your favorite person puts you in the best mood.
"If I date you, I won’t control you. Do what you want. Your actions will tell me how much you respect the relationship."
You deserve to be loved the way you love.
Time always reveals what you mean to someone.
"Make sure your circle has quality, not quantity."
Sometimes it feels better not to talk.
Be my baby and my bestfriend.
Choose someone who always choose you even at your worst.
I need a break from everything.
your reply is my happiness
The right person will make you fall in love with yourself too.
Don’t hurt the person God sent to heal you.
Feelings can be controlled but tears never lie.
the most comforting sound is your voice.
if u defend my name when im not around I truly appreciate u
maturity is when a person hurts you and you try to understand their situation and don’t hurt them back.
"i want you, i need you, i miss you."
Falling in love is not a choice. To stay in love is.
sometimes you just gotta play your music louder than your thoughts.
"Blocking, unfollowing, muting and cleansing your social media is self care."
Can we just skip the sad parts?????
I always motivate someone but I can’t motivate myself.
Not everyone you love deserves your heart.
i’m sorry i wasn’t good enough but i tried to be.
Let go and let God.
Old songs still have the most beautiful lyrics
Even the kindest hearts get tired too.
sometimes hug is all we need.
Keep it private. People love to ruin things.
Nothing hurts more than trying your absolute best and still not being good enough.
"I’m not your free time or second choice, prioritize me or leave me alone."
Things to quit right now:  - Overthinking  - Putting yourself down - Fearing change - Trying to please everyone
Finding both love and friendship in one person is the best thing that can happen.
silent crying hurts the most
Be good to people for no reason.
"My life, my choices, my mistakes, my lessons. Not your business."
Don't sacrifice your time for people who wouldn't do the same for you.
sometimes silence is better than arguing.
you woke up. you’re healthy. be thankful
find someone who believes in you when you don’t.
Learning to stay calm when you feel disrespected is a different type of growth.
realizing i don’t care anymore is the best feeling
you will always be special to me
"when it hurts, just sleep."
quick replies make me happy
i'm not showy but i care about u a lot
I changed myself for myself.
"If you’re ever stuck between me and another person, don’t pick me. I’m good."
"If she mentions it more than once, it bothers her, just remember that."
"If you really care about someone, you work shit out. You won’t just leave."
You will find love again.
I’m not asking for too much. Just want to be understood and appreciated.
we all hurt ourselves through expectations
"When two people really care about each other, they will always look for a way to make it work, no matter how hard it is."
God knows how much i prayed for you.
that random stranger you met online and now a big part of your life.
your mental health is a priority  your happiness is a priority  your self-care is a priority  your existence is a priority
"“u changed” you hurt me, remember."
i dont think people understand how stressful it is to explain whats going on inside ur head when you dont even understand it urself
A girl’s twitter is full of hints...
REMEMBER:  You can’t force people to appreciate you. You can’t force people to be loyal to you. You can’t force people to treat you right. You can’t force people to be honest with you. You definitely can’t force people to love you.
maturity and mindset are most attractive than looks.
"we may not talk, but i still care"
music is lowkey therapy.
"What hurts you, changes you."
"imagine, you're not good-looking, but someone saves your photo."
You are the story that i never want to end.
I love listening to lies when I know the truth.
"No one is too busy, it's only a matter of priorities"
"i care, but i’m done trying"
I was quiet but not blind.
"Relationships are so scary to me... No matter how good things are going or how in love you are, your significant other could always just lose feelings for you and be gone just like that."
can’t wait for the day when somebody tells me i’m the best thing that’s ever happened to them and they mean it.
i grew up without sharing my problems to my parents.
Hardest part was having to pretend it doesn't hurt at all.
I distance myself for a reason.
songs explain what i can’t explain
i look at ur pics when i miss u
I still fall for you every single day.
"I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what the reason was."
Boys never realize how much one little thing can hurt a girl..
Distance gives us a reason to love even harder.
Not proud of my actions recently but I'm really trying to be better.
trust me i'm lucky to have you.
"deleting pictures is so difficult for me, i can't even let go of a random screenshot."
"your message is not just a message, it's my happiness."
"still a ""HAHAHAHAHA"" person though i'm hurting that much."
overthinking is no joke. that shit eats you up on the inside.
"my attitude gets bad when i'm tired or sad, sorry."
call me for no reason i love hearing your voice
i want to delete my entire existence
"my twitter, my tweets, my life, my rants, my feelings."
I want to be with you all the time.
I love you so much no matter what.
"""relax i'm yours""  what i really wanna hear when my stupid ass be overthinking"
i wish i can run to you and hold you
i want to talk to you more
i feel better when i'm with you.
forehead kisses is only for a special someone
im sad without you
Don't sacrifice your time for people who wouldn't do the same for you.
"I just want someone to look at me and say, “she’s worth everything.”"
Everyone deserves someone that can make their heart forget that it was ever broken.
"sorry, i'm too sensitive."
i’m jealous of people who get to see u everyday
"i know im not a perfect person, but im doing my best to be better."
all good things take time.
"someone who wants you, will make you feel wanted"
i just need someone to stay and never leave.
"unfollow, block, unfriend anyone who disturbs your inner peace. protect your mental health at all cost."
Please don’t forget me and all the things we did.
"Good relationships don’t just happen. They take time, patience, and two people who truly want to be together."
"not single, not taken, just waiting for something real"
You will always be my special person
".                o  n  e     d  a  y,             i  'm      g  o  n  n  a           t  e  l  l     m  y  s e  l  f              i     m  a  d  e    i  t  ."
i really hope this shit ends soon
you are the only one my heart wants
being alone really makes you realize a lot of shit.
I am okay &amp; not okay at the same time.
"I know you’ve been doubting your progress, regretting your choices, putting yourself down. Please Remember that you are doing just fine. Remind yourself right now that no matter what it looks like, you are doing the best you can. Always encourage, support and believe in yourself."
"yes, i tweet about you."
find your happy place and stay there.
"having someone who truly appreciates your attention, your opinions, your attempts to make them happy, &amp; just your presence overall &gt;&gt;"
I just wanna travel the world.
It’s nice when someone remembers small details about you.
Not everyone deserves to know the real you.
been lost in my own world lately
"With you, it's different."
"i hate being compared, seriously."
"as long as u r trying, i’m staying"
sometimes it’s better to say nothing
keeping myself busy to feel okay
"if i had one wish, you’d stay forever"
Learn how to comfort yourself because no one will do it for you.
Making someone else happy is one of the best feelings.
me everyday: i am very very very very very very very very very very very  very very very very very very very very very very very very tired
it’s okay to let some friendships die.
"I changed? No, I grew up."
i’m fucking trying my best
trust your instinct. you are not crazy.
"When you’re happy, you enjoy the music. But when you’re sad, you understand the lyrics."
I miss your hugs badly.
“Aww you remembered“ of course i did I’m in love with you.
c r a v i n g   y o u
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone how much they mean to you.
jealousy can break a whole mood.
Friends can break your heart too...
Everyone has a story. There’s a reason why they’re the way they are. Think about that before you judge them.
I’ll choose honest over perfect every single time.
Be with someone who feels like home
"I’m sad, I need cash."
music is a life saver.
It's crazy how you can crave someone like a drug.
your happiness is my happiness.
Distance doesn’t separate people... silence does.
sorry i have toxic traits but i’m trying
i get jealous because i’m easy to replace
I don’t think people understand how stressfull it is to explain what’s going on in your head when you don’t even understand it yourself.
you glow different when someone treats you right
i pray it's you and me in the end.
"still, you. only you."
"Forgiving someone is easy, but being able to trust them again is a totally different story."
"Once you feel like you're avoided by someone, never disturb them again."
"Calling me cute is nice, calling me hot is great, but calling me yours is all I want."
"be nice but learn to say ""no"""
don’t make me feel special and leave like i never mattered
i’m so lost as a person
"lights off, good music &amp; chill."
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay"
"sorry, i'm such a cry baby."
i'm trying my best. that is enough.
"if you don’t want me, tell me. i hate wasted time &amp; energy"
Me + Bed = Best couple ever
imagine having someone that understands your mind.
Unfortunately I'm the type of person you can screw over 1 million times and I would still be there for you if you needed me.
"take care always, my favorite person."
"never get too comfortable, people change all the time"
i’m such a “no it’s okay” and suffer in silence type of person.
I wish I could tell someone everything.
you deserve someone who will do everything to keep u
"i love music, especially ur voice"
I don’t react but I notice everything.
being silent is the best option not to hurt others.
Salt and sugar look the same; be careful who you trust.
I always been afraid of losing people I love. Sometimes I wonder if there is anyone out there afraid to lose me.
"I like being alone, it's peaceful."
"With or without label, I will always care for you."
You are the risk I will always be willing to take.
music understands me when nobody else can.
"I'm fine, I just miss talking with you."
"I choose to love you silently, for in silence, there will be no rejection."
"My eyes met many eyes, but only got lost in yours"
7 billion smiles and yours is my favorite
I remember when we used to talk everyday; I miss that.
"Some people change so suddenly;  they might make you feel so important today, but can also make you feel worthless tomorrow."
"i'm not a materialistic person, a simple hug can make me smile"
"Please, value yourself more."
"sometimes,  you just have to stay silent, because no words can explain  what’s going  on in your mind"
i have a “why am i like this” moment at least five times a day.
normalize being nice for no reason.
never use a person to forget another.
u had my whole heart u really did
"Pain changes people. It makes them overthink, trust less, feel worthless &amp; shut people out."
"I may have lost someone who didn't love me, but you lost someone who truly loved you."
anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks   anxiety sucks
Maybe one day I’ll be enough for someone
No one knows how much I cried that day.
things will get better. things will get better. things will get better.
You can't control everything. Sometimes you just need to relax and have faith things will work out. Let go a little and let life happen.
You’re not selfish for wanting the same love and energy you give
Everyone deserve a person that can make their heart forget the trauma in the past.
I hate being stuck between “keep trying” and “why bother”
can i just deactivate myself
You deserve someone who isn’t confused about the feelings they have for you.
"I disappear sometimes, that’s my thing."
"You suffered enough, it’s time to let go of what’s hurting you."
i wish someone misses me too
"Even if I’m mad, I still love you. Remember that."
It sucks to be understanding but never understood
having clingy but mature partner is perfect.
you have no idea how much i love you.
i pray i don’t lose you
old songs hold a special place in my heart.
"if i care for you, i care until the end."
talk to God before u sleep.
"dear heart, please keep me strong"
eyes talk better than words sometimes
i wanna be hugged till i fall asleep
all I want in life is happiness
only you can give me that feeling.
Everything's gonna be alright.
nothing is more heartbreaking than when you try your hardest and it still isn't enough
i wish you cared the same way i do
tired of being the one who keeps trying
I act like nothing happened when it hurts
"Every time I trust somebody, they show me why I shouldnt"
"if it makes u happy, go for it."
"with or without conversation, trust me i'm still into you."
"i dont want others attention, i want yours."
"it's okay if your heart feels heavy, your emotions and feelings are always valid. take a deep breath, I promise your heart will feel lighter eventually. it will take time, but you will feel better. you're here. you're going to be okay. it's going to be okay."
you're so lucky when you have someone who genuinely wants to talk to you everyday.
a lot of shit changed me
the most comforting sound is your voice.
"I want you, nothing else but you."
I get jealous when someone's else has your attention.
"behind every tweet, there's a secret message for someone."
Don't make a promise you can't keep.
"I miss being with you,  I miss our talks, I miss laughing with you, I miss you"
"I'm strong, but not all the time."
"Whatever happens, life goes on."
You will always be my favorite notification.
"Be patient and wait on someone that will love you consistently. Stop wasting your time on people who treat you good one day then act like you don't exist the next day. You deserve someone who always checks on you and make you feel special, loved, and appreciated everyday."
"Sometimes, we need to accept the fact that things will never be the same again."
"To my favorite person:  I've been thinking of you every second, every minute, every hour, and every day. I always care for you, just be safe."
"No matter how strong you are, there's always a person who can make you weak."
My mood changes like 70 times a day
"One day someone will love you the way you wanted to be loved, and you don't have to fight for it."
"Just like seasons, people change."
can I airplane mode my life?
"damn, i'm so in love with you."
i deserve to be happy &amp; that’s all i want for myself.
Find a person who feels proud for having you.
Sleeping is nice. You get to forget about everything for awhile.
Some endings don't have proper goodbyes.
"People will always notice the change in your attitude towards them, but they will never notice it's their behavior that made your change."
sometimes it’s better to say nothing
if airplane tickets were free you'd never see me again.
Twitter is a place to confess your feelings.
Risking is better than regretting.
"You don’t need a lot of friends, just the right ones."
Please be real. Don't play with someone's heart just to make yourself happy.
you are not afraid of new love. you are afraid of old pain.
that shit hurts but i act like idc
need that “i only want you “ energy
having me is so boring ikr
Notice everything but be quiet.
I get sad. I get insecure. I get jealous. I get lonely. I overreact. I make mistakes.  But I promise I will always give you my best.
The right people understand you differently.
i’m very soft please take care of me
you know what hurts? when people just become memories.
my heart wants you.
"i love vowels, specially u"
Shit happens. Things go wrong. Life goes on.
be with someone who says let’s fix this  “i can’t lose you”
I still pray for you and for your happiness
Never regret the things that once made you happy
i miss the old you. the one that cared about me
having atleast one person who truly believe &amp; appreciates u is a blessing
"Everybody wants to be in a relationship for years but everybody is not ready for the the bad days, the crying, arguments, communication going wrong. Relationships aren’t fairytales &amp; it’s not easy. If you love each other, you have to stay solid through it all and make it work."
I talk too much when I like someone.
"One day, someone will choose you and keep on choosing you everyday."
I appreciate those who stayed when im at my lowest.
"i suffered, i learned, i changed."
"Learn to be done with people. Not mad, not bothered. Just done."
"i’m just focusing on becoming a better version of me, physically, mentally, and emotionally."
I fall in love with the little details.
I have so much of you in my heart.
it sucks when you don’t receive the same energy you give.
"One thing I learned in life.   You can be important to someone, but not all the time."
"I won't call but I care, I won't text but I think of you everytime, I won't meet, but I always miss you, I won't say, but I always love you."
I'm a person who hides a thousand feelings.
"twitter is my daily diary, tbh."
"I may not mention you on any social media posts, but I always mention you in my prayers and I think it's way sweeter."
I always end up saying I'm fine even though I'm deeply hurt inside.
don't ever lie to me to protect my feelings.
accept the situation and move on with smile.
"Learn to wait, there is always time for everything."
My mind really needs a mute button.
"Stuck between idk, idc &amp; idgaf."
I'm working on being a better me for me.
Don’t get surprised by how fast people can change
hug me till i forget all my sadness.
"take care always, i love you."
Real love won't quit on you.
"I just want peace, no heartaches, no tears, no pain."
"I am both ""fast replier"" and ""never replies"" type of person, it depends on my mood."
"when i'm into you, no other person gets the same attention."
private relationship ft. true feelings
"without music, life would be so boring"
trust me im always here for u
i need someone to tell me that i'm not as bad as i think i am.
Loyalty means everything.
don’t break someone who trusted you.
I changed. A lot.
eventually everyone leaves.
Losing toxic people is a win.
Sometimes you have to vibe alone to really understand some things.
make memories with the right people.
"we no longer go for looks, we go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace."
Sometimes the only person you can count on is yourself.
Stay strong. Even when it feels like everything is falling apart.
soon I'll make my parents proud.
"Dear self, stop expecting too much."
It's funny how we do stupid things just to make someone happy.
you're always in my prayers.
One smile can start a friendship. One word can end a fight. One look can save a relationship. And one person can change your life.
"hey you! don’t give up, okay?"
i miss you everyday my love
i still dream about you
i break my own heart by caring too much.
"I can’t replace you, no one is you."
"i love you, always and forever."
"I'm inlove with the moon, sunset, sunrise, music, galaxies, clouds, and skies."
"I'm a private person so if i open up with you, damn i trust you."
"When we first met, I had no idea you'd become so important to me."
Never change to be accepted by others. Stay weird and crazy.
no girl deserves to wake up &amp; feel like she’s not enough.
i do stupid things when im jealous
wanna lay on your shoulders and forget everything
"i’ll always choose u, even at days we don’t understand each other"
"stressful days, sleepless nights"
"once i like someone, i really be ignoring everyone else"
i miss hugging and kissing you
my heart is different now
Bestfriends make life so much better.
i believe in using songs to say things.
trust me i want you and only you
"Always love people from your heart, not from your mood or needs."
"half strong, half broken."
be with someone who supports you 100%
"yes, tell me about your day and how you're feeling, i care."
i care a lot until i don’t care at all.
music is so better than people.
so many feelings we can’t explain.
i miss when everything was okay.
“one day you’ll realize“
i love looking at you.
wish i could tell you what’s really on my mind.
you mean a lot to me
It’s hopeless but i’m still hoping
Just wanna stay busy so I don’t have time to feel.
eyes talk better than words
"strong mind, fragile heart."
sometimes you just need to wait and pray.
Never reply when you are angry.  Never make a promise when you are happy.  Never make a decision when you are sad.
i wanna travel and never come back.
Everything is fine when your favorite person is around.
"Always be strong enough to let go, and be smart enough to wait for what you deserve."
"if i show you my stupid side, know you’re so special."
hurt me with the truth but never lie to me
"i know we can't see each other rn, but i hope we will meet soon so i can hug u"
We become cold to avoid getting hurt.
"you are enough, more than enough."
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
find someone that accepts all sides of you.
"If you want me, show me. If you have me, fight for me. If you love me, prove it."
your hug is all i want when i'm sad
you look better when you’re smiling.
if i trust u please don’t hurt me i barely ever trust anyone.
Don’t lose what you can’t replace.
Healing yourself is the greatest comeback.
"Be patient, have faith, the best is yet to come."
everything feels better with you.
“i apologize if i ever was the toxic person in someones life.”
"happy or sad, i always listen to music."
"It’s all inside, no words out."
don’t come closer unless you plan to stay.
stop being nice if it breaks you.
Having someone who has your back is one of the greatest blessings ever
I miss the old version of too many people.
Nothing kills you like your mind.
imagine meeting someone who has the same mindset and vibe as you
Being attracted to someone's smile is a real thing.
eye contacts that end up with a smile.
I hope better days are coming.
i hide my feelings a lot.
being valued feels so much better.
Whenever I get hurt something inside me just shuts off.
some parts of you just never heal.
"Have you ever tried to share your problem with somone because you can't handle it anymore but instead of sharing them you chose not to, because you think that you might just bother them"
"Love is not about how much you say ""I Love You"" But how much you can PROVE that it's true."
I am so lost inside my own head.
"I thought I was special, until I saw you treating others the same way."
Be real with me or just leave me alone.
i crave for peace of mind.
"we are strangers, again"
nothing excites me anymore.
"This is the problem with getting attached to someone. When they leave, you just feel lost."
My heart is full of you.
i’d like to disappear for a while.
"i’m sorry, i’m not the best person you have wished for."
we all have broken our rules for someone.
you're still my happy pill.
can??? i??? just??? delete??? my??? insecurities???
the worst feeling is not knowing if you should wait or give up.
"yes we don't talk, but i still care."
I am toxic to myself sometimes.
ignore me and I’ll do the same
so tired of feeling this feeling
unsaid feelings really hurt.
May you receive what you've always been praying for.
"Fall in love when you’re ready, not when you’re lonely."
"Finding someone who thinks you’re interesting enough to talk to you everyday, whether they’re a friend or a lover, is one of the best feelings ever."
Sometimes simple efforts mean so much.
May you meet someone who’ll know how to calm your storms.
I miss the person who always makes me smile.
"I may not be a showy-type person, but believe me, I always care."
i’m sorry i can’t be perfect.
a lot of shit changed me.
"Dear Self,  You deserve the best."
Trust what you feel not what you hear.
Stay loyal or stay away from me.
"i’ll always love you, i promise."
getting uglier day by day.
"if u need me, i’m always here"
Never waste your feelings on people who don’t value you.
need a long break from everything
i just feel like i am not needed.
A better you is coming.
"Still, i believe that prayer works."
feeling unwanted changes you a lot.
i want you to feel what i feel.
"Tell me a lie.  ""i am okay"""
"be a better you, for you."
"i found someone, i never want to lose"
everything will be fine one day.
being alone teaches you a lot.
"I just want to be appreciated, is that hard?"
i wanna mute my overthinking.
i hate when people act like they don’t see my message.
being too happy is somehow scary.
wanna sit on a rooftop at 2am and talk about life..
You are so important to me.
i’m proud of how hard you’re trying.
I’ll never forget the day we met.
My twitter. My tweets. My life.
real ones stays in bad times
"as long as i can handle my sadness, i won't tell it to anyone."
you won’t find another me.
Only God knows how hard it’s been.
I feel safe with you.
Always thinkin bout you.
"Find someone who is proud to have you, scared to lose you, fights for you, appreciates you, respects you, cares for you, and loves you unconditionally."
Your smile is everything to me.
I act like I don't care but deep inside i swear it hurts.
i love a lowkey vibe. nobody knowing our business but us.
"Full of mistakes, that’s who I am."
Keeping myself busy to forget that I am sad.
"please stay, even at my bad times."
"i'm strong, but i cry too."
"ten years from now, i want to see myself loving the same person i love today and that is you."
i spend 90% of my day overthinking.
"As long as I can, I won't give up, but once I'm done, I'm done."
"This time, I'll prioritize my own happiness."
dating someone who can stay kind even during fights is very important.
i wish you cared as much as i did
my mind never stopped thinking about u
I'll be okay... I just don't know when.
"WORST FEELING,  being compared being ignored being rejected being replaced."
Always respect other peoples feelings.
"dear money, i need you right now"
seeing you happy is all i want.
Stay positive. Stay fighting. Stay brave. Stay ambitious. Stay focused. Stay strong.
"I really don’t want to be sad anymore, I'm so tired of it."
"I still care, I am just done showing it."
being a person who feels things deeply is exhausting.
Music gives me a peace of mind.
"i miss you, be safe everyday."
inhale the good shit exhale the bullshit
i dont like sharing my fav person
no more expectations from anyone.
deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
"If it's meant to be, it will be."
"i be like ""i don't care"" then start crying."
"Same lies, different people."
Expectations will always disappoint you.
"you will always be my favorite, always."
friendship and love in one person
"To be with you, thats all I want."
A break from everything would be nice.
"""you've changed"", i'm glad i did."
I deserve someone who actually cares about me.
RIP to those unsaid words left unsaid.
take me back to the good old days
the way i smile when i think about you
a man with respect and manners is a real definition of handsome.
"lowkey, wanna restart my whole life"
Choose people that choose you. The end.
"to my happy pill, thankyou for making me happy. ilysm."
I hate how i overthink every single night.
You’ll end up really disappointed if you think people will do for you as you do for them.
nothing is better than talking to someone you're comfortable with.
God knows how hard i try.
right ones will always stay.
i literally love everything about you.
don't expect a lot from anyone.
All you need is someone to hold you when you’re too tired to hold yourself together.
"if you're not appreciated, leave."
"I don’t want anything, i just wanna feel ok."
i need extra love and care these days.
I miss talking to you for hours.
silence is better than explaining.
"stay please, i need you"
one unexpected message can heal alot.
"i don't give up on people, they push me away."
wanna say a lot of things but nevermind.
"When someone truly cares about you, they make an effort not an excuse."
"Admit it, sometimes you say your true feelings through jokes."
"Be you, not who people want you to be."
"if it keeps you happy, keep it private."
Tired eyes and a tired mind.
"Sometimes, you hide your feelings from yourself too."
Nobody knows the whole story.
"quiet, but not blind."
End things before they end you.
A listener needs a listener too.
God hears your prayer. Keep praying and have faith.
i need to rest my mind from everything.
"one day, the sadness will end."
"Find someone who isn’t afraid to admit that they miss you, who knows you aren’t perfect but treats you as if you are, who’s biggest fear is losing you, who says “I love you” and means it with all of their heart, someone who believes leaving and giving up isn’t an option."
"If it's meant to be, it will be."
sorry i assume i was important.
Real is rare.
Sleeping is the best part of the day.
Nobody wants to be treated like an option.
talking to you makes me happy
"once you start loving someone, it's hard to stop."
forget who forgets you
My mind needs to stop overthinking every damn thing.
"i can’t make you understand what’s happening inside me, i can barely even explain it to myself."
someone out there feels better because you exist.
i hate how oversensitive i am
ignoring me is the way you lose me.
I deserve to be happy.
i’m not the same person anymore.
Expecting too much is one way of hurting yourself.
Imagine being loved the way you love.
i fall in love every time you smile.
I never faked my love to someone.
I L O V E Y O U
"If you love someone, pray for them. Pray for their peace. Pray for their growth. Pray for their success. Pray for their happiness."
Don't love too soon. Don't trust too fast. Don't quit too early. Don't expect too high. Don't talk too much.
"Don't change yourself just to make someone love you, be yourself and let the right one fall for you."
how can i mute my thoughts
"if you don’t take risks, nothing will change."
unexpected messages can do a lot
Don't leave me okay? I love you.
wish my life had a reset button
my favorite memory was meeting you.
I wanna go somewhere far away
you're someone i'd never wanna lose.
no one can fix my mood except you.
"mixed feelings, messy thoughts."
i wish i hugged you longer
i care about your feelings more than mine.
we always tweet things we can't say.
I'm so sorry if I failed to make you happy.
Be proud of yourself for how hard you're trying.
ignoring toxic people is self care.
"i’m too sensitive, in fact just one word can ruin my mood."
it’s funny how i give advice to some people when i can’t even fix myself.
I wish all my nights were spent on the beach looking at the stars.
find someone who knows how to love you when you’re sad.
I’m just sick of everything.
I need to be saved from my own thoughts.
"don't worry about me, i can turn my problems into a joke."
"What hurts you, changes you."
"It’s extremely important to learn how to be ok on your own. You have to learn how to pick yourself back up when you fall, provide for yourself, wipe your tears away &amp; make yourself happy. Having people there for you is truly great but you can’t depend on them to always be there."
Everything feels so heavy on my heart.
"i need more sleep, money, happiness."
I can't explain it.. I just feel it.
Overthinking will kill your happiness.
Don't confuse my personality with my attitude. My personality is who I am. My attitude depends on who you are.
I don’t talk when i’m not in mood.
Note to self: Stop expecting.
I'm here for you and I'll always be.
"i'm physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically out of energy."
the only notification i want is yours.
Sometimes someone’s voice can take all your worries away.
i’m full of unsaid feelings.
"i love your voice, your smiles and specially you."
sharing music is a love language.
I seriously don't wanna deal with people anymore.
there’s a part of me that isn’t the same anymore.
7 things you should never apologize:  1: Being yourself. 2: Following your dreams. 3: Taking time with your self. 4: Ending toxic relationships. 5: Living in your truth. 6: You should never apologize for your imperfections. 7: Saying no when you need to.
Sometimes you just need to hear how much you mean to someone.
Life’s short. Spend it with people who make you laugh and feel loved.
"All I ask is 3 things: Don't lie to me, Don't waste my time &amp; don't have me looking stupid."
"i care for you, always."
"Everyone makes mistakes, nobody is perfect. Live it, learn from it, move on."
"Sometimes there is no next time, no time outs, no second chances. Sometimes it's just now or never."
"Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret."
learn how to survive alone.
Be careful how your words could hurt people.
"You won't find me complaining when I'm sad.I'll just disappear. &amp; I'll appear again when am all good. I hate sympathy, I hate acting weak."
my eyes will never get bored of seeing you.
"i will always be proud of you, my love."
ignoring me makes me lose interest.
one day you'll realize how much i cared.
"if you’re happy, i’m happy"

i stay quiet but i have so much on my mind.
I miss having a life without stress.
Remember who stayed when you aren’t in your normal mood.
somewhere between sad and tired
i wish i could see you everyday.
too afraid to trust again
you want me? make me feel that.
Nothing feels better than a surprise text from a person you miss.
my whole life is just “oh ok”
i hope you never get tired of me.
the more i annoy you the more i love you.
losing your appetite because you’re sad is the worst.
my thoughts makes me so tired.
I wish i wasn't sensitive and didn't get upset easily.
I really love staring at you.
i seriously can't stop missing you
Nobody knows what's going inside.
lately i feel like i dont really belong anywhere.
i need one of those long silent hugs.
The perfect relationship is two people who never give up on each other.
A private life is a happy life A private life is a happy life A private life is a happy life A private life is a happy life
can i just sleep and ignore the world?
true friends are family
I am the most moody person ever.
"You hurt me, and i said sorry."
"You cannot go back in time and fix your mistakes, but you can learn from them and forgive yourself for not knowing better."
"Before I give up on anybody, I try &amp; I try &amp; I try."
"Give me loyalty, I'll give you everything."
"if i cried in front of you, believe me, i reached my limit."
It feels great when someone appreciates even the little things that you do.
Look for someone who knows you’re not perfect but treats you as if you are.
i hate sharing my favorite person.
I'm missing the old me sometimes.
One bad chapter doesn’t mean that your story is over.
You have a place in my heart no one could ever have.
"if you need me, i’d always be here."
wishing for a better days full of happiness.
"i like conversations where i don't have to think about what to say, where it just comes naturally."
I see you in all my favorite songs.
"If someone doesn’t value you, they deserve to lose you."
I’m always the one who loves more.
"i'm trying, i tried, and i'm tired."
You’re my first and last thought of my everyday.
"As long as you keep trying, there is still hope."
I hate when I can't put what I'm thinking into words.
I am not a second option. Either you lose me or you choose me.
I didn’t change. I just see things differently now.
"My past is my past, I've made mistakes but I have learned from them too."
"One day, you’ll be someone’s best thing."
pretending to be okay was never easy.
Not every “sorry” deserves an “it’s okay” in the end.
"When you love someone, sometimes their happiness matters more than yours."
"i wanna see u fullfil ur dreams, i will be ur no.1 supporter even ppl doubted u"
saying goodbye to someone you wouldn't want to let go hurts the most.
"i need a hug, a new playlist and someone who really cares about me."
having a friend with the same level of dirty mind is such a blessing.
my intentions were always pure so i didn’t lose you. you lost me.
"You have to be patient with ppl who have experienced bad relationships/friends, &amp; ppl who suffer from a bad childhood. It can be hard for them to open up, love, &amp; trust. help them heal. teach them that their past doesn’t define them. Love &amp; show them how to find peace &amp; happiness"
"once I'm inlove,I'm all committed."
I made my choice according to your actions.
Never chase anyone. A person who appreciates you will walk with you.
trust me i will stay with u
"I want you permanently, not temporarily."
"i feel bad when someone opened something to me especially their problems and i can't even make them feel better. i'm so sorry, i promise i'm trying my best just to help u."
"When I was a kid, I hated going to bed. Now I cherish EVERY hour of sleep."
"When I'm around you, I just feel happy for no reason."
Physically and mentally exhausted.
"With you, hours turn into minutes."
Take the risk or lose the chance.
Time heals almost everything. Give time time.
"Memories are wonderful to make, but sometimes painful to remember."
"Everything will fall into place, be patient."
"No matter how angry you get, you always end up forgiving the people you love."
I just want to feel important to someone.
i’m so sensitive i swear everything breaks my heart.
"sometimes all you can do is lie in bed, and hope  to fall asleep before your mind starts eating you alive."
"You’ve been in situations where you thought you’d never make it out, but you did. You’ve lived through it. You’ve learned from it. You’ve survived. So whatever it is that you’re currently going through right now, you’ll get through that too. Keep believing and keep going."
"Never expect things to happen, it's better to feel surprised than to feel disappointed."
Don’t say it if you don’t mean it.
i want to hug you and never lose you
scared of losing myself again.
Still healing from things I don't speak about.
Expect nothing and you will never be disappointed.
Good music. long rides.
I keep reminding myself of how temporary everyone is.
I regret every time I let someone know me too much.
I wanna go to the beach just to listen to the waves.
How amazing it is to find someone who wants to hear about all the things that go on in your head
"i care, i always care that's why i always get hurt"
"Sad eyes, fake smile."
you killed me with your words. i killed you with my silence.
i love  it  when  you  make  me  feel  special
i am okay and not okay at the same time.
i am still here and will always be here.
i love you for a thousand reasons.
When i first saw you i never expected that you would mean the world to me..
Stay single until you meet the person who loves the deeper side of you.
emotionally damaged but physically fine
Find someone who will love you at your worst and be with you at your weakest.
i’m so tired of getting depressed for no reason.
i love staring at you.
"⠀    you're not perfect,    but, you deserve to be happy   always remember that  ⠀"
Sometimes silence is the best way to let someone know they did something wrong.
"You’re amazing, remember that."
You’ll always have a place in my heart no one could ever have.
Don’t lie to someone who believes you.
unsaid things are killing me
"i tried, you didn’t, i’m done."
sometimes we all need hugs
"A peaceful, private life."
“i can make time” - a love language
Don’t play with someone’s feelings.
"I want you today, tomorrow and forever."
Unexpected friendships are the best ones.
Don’t let someone treat you bad just because you love them.
choose kindness even when others have not been kind to you.
m u s i c   m a k e s   i t   a l l   o k
hiding your pain is another pain.
Sometimes you just need to hear how important you are to someone.
"Someone is going to love you, simply because you’re worthy."
"I want to refresh my mind, delete all my problems, undo all my mistakes, and save all the happy moments."
I'm shy at first but I do the stupidest random things when I get comfortable with someone.
"Friendship isn't about who you've known the longest. It's about who walked into your life, said ""I'm here for you"" and proved it."
Unexpected messages or calls is the best.
Explaining your feelings to someone is never easy.
Be happy. You deserve it.
maybe i lied when i said i was okay.
Don't compare me to anyone.
"I'm sensitive, I over think every little thing, and I care way too much."
I have 3 sides:   1. The quiet side   2. The fun and crazy side   3. The side you never want to see
"Everyone leaves, learn how to survive alone."
"Whatever you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy."
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
perfect date? me you and the moon.
"When I'm alone, I think and think and think."
i'll always wish the best for you and i'll always hope you're happy.
"sleepy eyes, busy mind."
"Hey, don’t be so hard on yourself."
"i wish, i was someone's favorite person."
I need something to get me back interested in life again.
Phone calls are way better than texting.
Are you still waiting for something that you already know that it is impossible to happen?
You have to learn how to vibe alone.
Don’t fight for someone who’s fine with losing you.
"Sometimes I wish I could read your mind. But then, I wonder if I could handle the truth."
I forgive people but that doesn’t mean I trust them.
You deserve to put yourself first.
Seeing you smile makes me smile.
I love people I can be weird with.
"Never say things you don't mean, just because you're angry."
"be real with me, no games, no lies."
Some things will never be the same.
"Be careful who you share your secrets with, only a few care, the rest are just curious."
Don't love too soon. Don't trust too fast. Don't quit too early. Don't expect too high. Don't talk too much.
You met them for a reason.
"No matter how much you care, some people won't appreciate it. No matter how much you love, some people won't realize it."
"Dear best friend, I don’t know how to thank you but I hope you know that I’m so happy that you’re part of my life."
yesterday: tired  today: tired  tomorrow: tired  next week: tired  next month: tired  next year: tired  next life: tired
"I love photos, because they never change, even if the people in it change."
I wish I could uninstall problems.
Making someone laugh after they've just finished crying is one of the most beautiful things to ever exist.
I want someone to fight for me. Just for once.
call me without a reason
"distance yourself when it starts to get hard, it’s ok to take care of yourself."
My mind is full of you.
Best friend breakups are worse than relationship breakups.
You’ll be okay. Storms don’t last forever.
"If you have something worth fighting for, continue fighting for it."
I think i'll miss you forever.
"Once we lose interest, everything changes."
"Never expect, never assume, never ask, and never demand. Just let it be. Because if its meant to be, it will be."
losing fake friends is a win
Having someone who can handle all your moods is such a blessing.
I wanna lose my memory and start a new life somewhere else.
people talk like they know you.
"Distance doesn't separate people, silence does."
when life is shit turn to music
i saw your flaws and loved you more.
Missing someone + No texts or calls = worst feeling EVER.
I love hearing “I saw this and thought of you”
I’ll always listen when you need to talk.
"I want someone to fall inlove with my attitude and vibes, not looks"
𝐍𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐚𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞.
Just don't lie to me. Ever.
"If I choose you over sleep, you must be very special."
"Once you feel unappreciated, leave."
I don't need a perfect relationship. I just need someone who won't give up on me.
"I'll always love you, no matter what happens between us."
"I don't know what my future holds, but I do hope you're there."
"give me a hug, i'm tired and drained"
we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok we'll be ok
Choose yourself this time. It’s time for you to go back to your old happy self.
i just want to be stress free.
i'm okay but i didn't say i'm happy.
I want to find myself again.
I don’t want bad days no more.
"Overthinking is a painful reminder that you care too much, even when you shouldn’t."
"The more I grow up, the more I realize how unimportant it is to tell people how I really feel and that it’s always better to keep it to myself."
"I may be hard to deal with, but at least i'm always here whenever you need me no matter where we stand. It's just the way i am."
"when memories hit you, it hurts."
Even when someone does the smallest thing for me I never forget it. I appreciate everything.
Stop chasing after people &amp; being the only one trying to fix everything. It's mentally &amp; physically exhausting. You have to find peace with whoever comes &amp; goes from your life. Don't be the only one putting in effort Bc you will end up losing yourself trying to save everyone else
You can fall in love with eyes too.
"Everything will get worse before it gets better, but when it does get better, remember who put you down and who helped you up."
"Forget the mistake, remember the lesson."
hide your sadness. no one cares.
overthinking breaks your own heart.
we all deserve someone who never stops trying.
"I give too much, that's the problem."
You never give up on someone you truly love.
"Choose the person who can give effort just to see you, talk to you, text you and text you back. Not the person who just remember you when they have no choice."
i should be studying rn but here i am in twitter.
my moods  1. tired 2. super tired 3. ultra tired
"Sometimes when you stop looking for love, love finds you."
I want to talk about so many things but I've no energy.
"The more you try to skip a thought, the more you think about it."
"I don't trust people easily. If I tell you that I trust you, please don't make me regret it."
"Don't talk, act. Don't say, show. Don't promise, prove."
"Even on my bad days, I hope yours are still good."
Life goal: Travel the world.
I miss sleeping without worries on my mind.
"No matter how much the truth hurts, it's always better than being lied to."
Be careful who you trust.
"Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching."
"People can say anything about you, but only you know the truth."
Nobody said life was easy. Just keep going.
i wish you could hear the way i talk about you
Deep talks are my favorite.
i pray my story got a happy ending.
I hate how sometimes I can’t find the right words to describe what’s going on in my mind.
I need someone who will never give up on me.
Don't lose what you can't replace.
you know i love you.
"i'm too private, if i open up to you, you are special."
"I want to be with you, it is as simple, and as complicated as that."
"i don't do revenge, but i can ignore your entire existence."
Sometimes my tweets are messages for you.
"we met for a reason, either you're a blessing or a lesson."
wanna hug you the tightest and never let you go
Sometimes you just can’t tell someone how you feel. You never really find the right words to make them understand.
Do you ever feel like no one really knows you?
twitter is a home for sad people.
at my worst. literally.
Pain will really change you.
"We overthink, overlove, overfeel and overstress."
I am jealous of everybody who is with you when I'm not with you.
I’m losing interest in everything except my bed.
you won't understand because you're not me.
my problem is i feel too much.
making your parents proud is one of the best feelings.
i     want        to meet            myself                  from                     someone                          else's                               point                                    of view
"I don’t usually sleep enough, but when I do, it’s still not enough."
I need a fresh start with everything.
Sometimes your heart needs more time to accept what your mind already knows.
explanations are exhausting.
i’m not afraid to try again. i’m just afraid of getting hurt for the same reason.
"Be a person who heals, not who hurts."
My feelings for you will never change.
"Don't find love, let love find you. That's why they call it falling in love. You don't force yourself to fall, you just fall."
i think i forgot how to sleep early.
It's nice to have someone to share your downs before your ups.
We don’t meet people by accident. They’re meant to cross our path for a reason.
I care but I’m done trying.
"I don't hate you, i hate what you did."
"I appreciate effort. No matter how small, big, or irrelevant it is, I appreciate effort."
I need something to cheer me up.
Unplanned moments are always better than planned ones.
nothing’s better than an answered prayer.
You’re perfect just the way you are.
"earphones on, volume up, vibe the music, ignore the world."
you don’t have to accept things you are not okay with.
"I’m bad with words, I hope you’re good in reading eyes."
"I hate the feeling when you really don't have any emotion. You feel so empty. You're not happy, you're not sad. You're nothing."
how to remove some of our memories that causes us to be in too much hurt?
"God, give me the strength to hold on. To keep going. Guide me."
Overthinking is the cause of unhappiness.
having a conversation with you is the best.
not everything can be fixed with one sorry.
"im shouting, crying in pain. only in my mind."
i hate it when promises turns into a sorry
98% of people in my life are fake
No one will love you as much as i do I swear.
Deep talks are my favorite.
"Sometimes you have to act like you don’t care, even when you do."
I'm not perfect but I promise you that I'll love you with all my heart.
L               I                  F                   E  Life        isn’t         fucking           easy

You’re someone’s dream person.
You have my heart. You always did.
Million voices in my head.
Every pain teaches someone a lesson and every lesson can change someone.
I’m honestly tired of being tired all the time.
i owe myself a lot of apologies.
"Even if I hate you, Your secrets are still secrets."
What hurts you today makes you stronger tomorrow.
overthinking while missing someone.
Do I care about what you think of me?   N 　   O 　　　 O 　　　　 o 　　　　　o 　　　　　 o 　　　　　o 　　　　 。 　　　 。 　　　. 　　　. 　　　 . 　　　　.
It broke my heart but opened my eyes.
You are special to me.
“that feeling you can’t explain.”
Sometimes you have to accept the truth and stop wasting time on the wrong people.
In music we found our souls.
"I need someone who would actually stay by my side, no matter what mood I'm in."
You will never truly understand something until it actually happens to you.
I hate this feeling of not knowing what you're feeling.
"No one has the right to judge you. They might have heard your stories, but they didn't feel what you were going through."
a whole day with you please

"you can hide it from the world, but God knows whats inside your heart."
I wanna travel the world with the love of my life.
"it’s okay, tomorrow is better."
Never losing myself again for anyone.
My mind needs to stop overthinking every damn thing.
I feel sorry for myself.
I’m so sensitive you could literally text me in a different tone and I’ll get sad.
People change. Love hurts. Friends leave. Things go wrong. But just remember that life goes on.
Just wanna be a better person.
Jealousy = I actually care about you.
Thinking about you makes me smile.
I will never be tired of loving you.
I want a life with you.
I hate overthinking but I just can’t stop.
Never take someone’s feelings as a joke.
Find someone who knows you’re not perfect but treats you as if you are.
Maybe I was wrong again.
"Always remember that everything that happens, good or bad, helps you grow. Even if it’s hard to see that right now."
me: *sleeps for 4 hours* tired me: *sleeps for 8 hours* tired me: *sleeps for a week* tired me: *sleeps for a month* tired me: *sleeps for a year* still tired
"When you finally meet that someone who tries their hardest to be with you regardless of how difficult you are, stay with them. Stay with them because finding someone who is willing to be with you at all cost doesn’t happen every day."

"You were born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection."
"There's always that one person that can make you smile, even when you're at your lowest."
"Mentally, the worst feeling is feeling unwanted by the one person you want the most."
That awkward moment when you have to stare at a text for five minutes to figure out how to reply.
"yes, i tweet about you."
I want to delete all my feelings.
"Long distance relationships are hard but they’re also incredible. If two people can love, respect, trust, and understand each other from a distance, nothing can break them apart."
"If you could read my mind, you'd be in tears."
"Right person, wrong time. I hate that."
Unexpected messages can do alot.
Never give up on something you really want.
songs bring back memories.
i wish i could see you every time i miss you.
"don't be sad, all this shit will pass."
tired of saying it's okay.
"Forgiving someone is easy, but being able to trust them again is a totally different story."
you’re still my fav. notification.
Good conversations with the right people are priceless.
"Don’t care about people too much, they’ll break you."
"not friends or enemies, just strangers with memories."
Peace comes when you pray.
i need a person who can hear my voice even if i’m silent.
"can’t wait to graduate, disappear and start a new life."
"please don’t leave, i’m already comfortable with you"
"i get too attached easily, and that's my problem."
"And someday, she’ll find the one she deserves."
i love being mentioned or tagged on stuff like damn you really think about me?
"you're lucky, if you have someone who can understand your mood just by reading your messages while texting."
i’ve been  lost lately.
Sometimes you have to die a little to be alive.
Your first heartbreak changes you forever.
you know nothing about the battles i fight alone.
Don't try to be perfect. Just try to be better than you were yesterday.
I appreciate people who care about me.
Have you ever cried because you're just you?
sharing songs = sharing feelings
"Dear bed, you’re my true love."
"I’m an over thinker so if you don’t give me an answer, I’ll think of one."
The worst part of being strong is that no one asks if you’re okay.
"when i love, i love stupid hard."
i still talk to God about you.
I hate when my fav person is sad.
"i'm different at social media, at school, at home, and at public. so don't act like you know me well."
much of love for one person.
"No matter how strong of a person you are, there's always someone who can make you weak."
I still love you but you don't care anymore.
"I want you on your bad days and good days. I want you whole, flawed and imperfect."
You know what’s attractive? Effort.
I miss how everything was.
Bad days build better days.
"Once I stop caring you’re not getting it back. I’ll be cold as ice, I promise."
"Even if i had a million reasons to leave you, i would still look for one to stay."
how do we skip the sad parts
when they start praying for you that’s another type of love.
I’m like 4000% tired.
"Stop overthinking about something. If it feels right, go with the flow. If it feels wrong, don’t think about it too hard and just walk away."
"Nothing hurts more than being ignored, replaced, or lied to."
Treat me right and I'll treat you better.
Never be afraid to say what you feel.
"chatting without ""HAHAHAHAHA"" makes me feel like i'm in a serious meeting."
"Love doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be true."
It's okay to not be okay sometimes.
"You know my name, not my story. You've heard what I've done, not what I've been through."
need a message full of true feelings.
I'm a strong person. But do you know what makes me cry? It's when I gave my best but I still feel useless.
nothing feels heavier than unsaid words.
I never want to lose you.
I’ve met a lot of people but nobody feels like you.
"if they care, they'll find time for you."
"I felt so much, that I started to feel nothing."
I either talk too much or i don't talk at all.
i miss my old energy like damn i was so happy before.
I love your voice and your laugh a lot.
music is my escape from life.
i have so many moods
A relationship is about two things: 1. Appreciating similarities  2. Respecting differences
"Never lie to someone who trusts you, and never trust someone who lies to you."
I have no problem texting first as long as you make me feel like you actually wanna talk.
"not everybody will understand your silence, remember that."
"my phone is always in my hand so if you think i'm ignoring you, i am."
"Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually."
"I don't care about losing people who don't wanna be in my life anymore, I've lost people who meant the world to me and I'm doing just fine."
a person who smells good is a big turn on
"not a secret, just not your business."
May you fall in love with someone who never gets tired of saving you from your own chaos.
Unexpected text messages are always nice. The fact that the person took a little bit of their time to make you smile.
"of course i changed, i realized that i deserve so much better."
"Listen to the silence, it speaks."
God will never put you through anything you can't handle.
"Absolutely, my heart only wants you."
"not attracted by looks, i'm attracted to mindsets."
i hate it when im so excited for something but ended up not happening.
we tweet for our unsaid thoughts.
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
i smile whenever i get a message from you.
"imaginations, be real please."
Distance sometimes lets you know who's worth keeping and who's worth letting go.
"I don't trust easily, so when I tell you I trust you, please don't make me regret it."
i love you to the moon and back.
"i had choices, but i chose you."
I just wanna watch the night sky with someone and have deep conversations.
eye contact and heartbeats.
sometimes silence is better.
i tweet a lot when im hurt
i love you but i can’t say that.
"When you are angry, be silent."
You're forever in my heart.
"Fuck second chances, people never change."
I want to sleep until i feel better.
i am really really really tired.
Good music taste is attractive.
I didn’t realize growing up meant dying inside.
"I’m bad with words, I hope you’re good in reading eyes."
My only goal in life right now is to be genuinely happy.
"I'm not perfect, I make mistakes, I hurt people, but when I say sorry, I actually mean it."
"I’m here for you. Through whatever, whenever."
We don't meet people by accident. They are meant to cross our path for a reason.
my biggest mistake is thinking that people care for me as much as i do for them.
i need a break from all this bullshit.
"honestly i think about you a lot. all the time actually. in the morning, at night, in the middle of my day. It's you. it's just always you."
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile.
"I don't need someone perfect. I need someone who loves me, respects me, cares for me and understands me."
I'm trying. I'm trying really hard. But I can't pretend it doesn't hurt because it really does.
never forget how much i tried to keep you.
Every song has a memory.
i love you since the day i found you.
it's better to be lowkey and private. it's peaceful.
idk but fast replies makes me feel important.
some people's mindsets are absolute trash.
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
"you’re not mine, but i still get jealous."
Even the kindest hearts get tired too.
"Don't text me because you're bored, text me because I'm the person you want to talk to."
my daily routine is very simple. i wake up &amp; i suffer.
imagine how a single message can change a whole mood.
i miss how happy we were together
"Sometimes quiet people have a lot to say, but they don’t open up to just anyone."
I want someone who will love me without any conditions.
"i didn't change, i just realized."
One lie can ruin a thousand truths.
"In 10 years, I wonder who is still going to be by my side."
Food will never break your heart.
"Talking to you, laughing with you, being with you, changes my whole mood."
I hope everything becomes better
i do believe one day i’ll live the life i want.
"Everything I was afraid of happening, happened."
i wanna delete a lot of people.
Sometimes you just have to stay silent because no words can explain what’s going on in your heart and mind.
Life goes on. Move forward. Be better. Do better.
Real feelings don't change fast.
"If it makes you happy, do it."
Yea I'm strong but I got limits too.
eyes for you &amp; only you.
I feel so sad and I would deeply like to apologise to myself for being the way I am.
God keep me strong.
I pray we all marry someone that doesn't leave when it gets tough.
A girl's twitter is full of hints.
"just be honest with me, or stay away from me. it's not that difficult."
I want to be the person you're scared to lose.
We can't force people to appreciate us.
"⠀  “If you are reading this, God still has a plan &amp; purpose for your life.”  ⠀"
The pain eats you until you feel nothing anymore.
"Nobody is ever too busy. If they care, they would make time."
Missing my favorite person
i have four moods:  oversleeping  overthinking  overeating  overspending
"True love never dies, because true love waits forever."
Late night talks with friends can be some of the best therapy.
Thank you for being the reason I smile.
My only relationship goal is to be with someone who motivates me to become a better person and show me the potential I don't see in myself.
I hate the nights where I can't sleep because I'm overthinking way too much.
"Life is weird. First you wanna grow up, then you wanna be a kid again."
You're always on my mind.
it hurts my feelings when i’m talking to someone and i can feel them not caring about anything I’m saying.
thoughts feel heavier these days.
You have no idea how beautiful you are in my eyes.
i care so much more than you think.
to feel unwanted is the worse thing
"i'm not feeling okay, but it's fine"
i overthink because i notice everything.
you really don't know pain till you sat and begged God to heal your heart.
there’s so much i want to say to you
keeping everything as a secret is better
i hate feeling like i’m being ignored
"If it’s still in your mind, it is still in your heart."
i need someone to hug me everyday.
I will be by your side till the end.
"I hate waiting. But if waiting means being able to be with you, I'll wait for as long as forever to be with you."
i will never be the same as before.
"Sometimes you have to distance yourself from people. If they care, they will notice. If they don't, you will know where you stand."
"i'm sorry for the pain, that i caused"
"i never faked my ""i miss you"" to someone."
People who check up on you because they care are the best kind of people.
i saw your worst and i still love you.
maybe i just expect too much
self-love is the new relationship goal.
"when a girl is silent, she's either overthinking, tired of waiting, falling apart or crying inside."
i wish i can turn back time and fix what's needed to fix.
My toxic trait is I overthink and break my own heart.
Never give up on prayer. God sometimes answer in unexpected ways.
"Yes, you will be successful soon. Claim it."
sometimes you just want to feel wanted.
"I care so much about your happiness. Because when you're happy, I'm happy too."
I’m keeping so much inside.
"I’d choose you. In a hundred lifetimes, in a hundred worlds, in any version of reality, I’d find you and I’d choose you."
"one day, i’ll marry you."
"I don't fall in love with faces, I fall in love with personalities."
"I hate those days, that remind me of everything I want to forget."
i am both happy and sad.
my heart is full of unsaid words
"When you really care about someone, their happiness matters more than yours."
"Since you've been around, I smile a lot more than I used to."
"Yes, I'm thinking about you right now."
"Anxiety, music and chill."
Never let a person get comfortable disrespecting you.
Hi. You are worth it :)
"do me a favor, stay in my life."
hope my story gets a happy ending cause i been through some shit i never deserved
i wish i was important to you.
my feelings for you will never change.
seeing my friends happy makes me happy
always pray and never give up
"a ""can we talk"" can fix a lot."
"if you love someone, never leave them."
"The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all your flaws, mistakes and weaknesses, but still thinks you're completely amazing."
"Friends can break your heart, too."
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.
"I know a lot, I just keep silent."
Overthinking can kill you slowly.
"I promise, I will love you at your worst and hold you at your weakest."
My mind is full of thoughts.
Music sounds better when the song describes how you feel.
you're my favorite secret.
i'm not very good at telling people how i feel
we young but we are stressing like we 50.
i miss waking up being excited about something.
I see you in all my favorite songs.
i still remember our first chat.
real ones stays in bad times.
"all my life i've been so understanding with everyone, but when it's my turn to be understood, no one seems to try."
You can fall in love with eyes too.
ｙｏｕ　 ｓａｙ　 ｙｏｕ＇ｒｅ　 ｎｏｔ　 ｐｅｒｆｅｃｔ　 ｂｕｔ　 ｔｏ　  ｍｅ　 ｙｏｕ　 ａｒｅ
my soul needs a hug
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep.
"Dear crush, please fall in love with me."
i wish i was with you rn tbh
you stole my heart since that day.
the person you need is yourself.
"i still miss u, i still want u, i still love u"
when you open twitter to look for motivation but everyone is just as tired as you.
i want you to stay and never go away
i learned to smile when i felt like crying
leaving without an explanation hurts
I only want positive energy around me.
I love people who appreciates my weird personalities.
Nobody ever really knows how much anyone else is hurting. You could be standing next to someone who is completely broken and not even know it. That’s why we should ALWAYS try to be kind.
"I’m tired, I’m stressed, I’m sad, but I’m fine."
"I wish i had a delete button in my life to delete some people, some memories and some feelings."
i badly want to restart my life.
distance sucks i need you here with me
"sometimes, i'm tired of being nice"
"I want to be as good as I was before, but i just can't."
me to everything lately: “whatever”
i had a lot to say but i choose to be quiet
it's always better when nobody knows anything about you.
"You deserve to feel at peace always, and feel endless genuine love and heal from things that weigh heavy on your heart."
"dear me, i'll make you proud one day"
"that ""grow together"" type of love"
I automatically distance myself when I feel unwanted.
"please don't expect me to always be kind and loving, there are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand."
everything about you is special to me.
"To my friends, that genuinely care about me. Thank you, I love you."
be with someone who always makes you feel better.
"if i repeated what you did, you'd be mad too"
never attack someone with personal stuff they trusted you with.
Be teachable. You're not always right.
"no matter what, im here"
i love talking to you for hours
"if i told you to leave me, hold me more"
Even at your worse you'll still have me.
I found my happiness in you
only one person can change my mood in just seconds
if i cried over u i really love u
Don't let someone treat you bad just because you love them.
you can't force people to love you.
Real love is not easy.
always trust the process.
I hate how sensitive I am. I literally break my own heart.
"to my fav person, i love you and take care everyday"
I hope I get an unexpected text from you.
Sorry for being cold when I'm sad.
late night calls? i miss that shit
Hearing someone you love laugh is easily one of the best things on earth.
"this time, love yourself more."
not everyone will understand you and that's okay
"No matter how smart you are, your heart always makes you dumb."
it hurts but whatever
too much in my mind but nothing to say.
"Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days."
"i have said too much, shared too much, cared too much, and now i want my energy back. i no longer want to get close to anyone."
i never lie when it comes to feelings.
I want you mine and only mine.
i still remember our first conversation
"i’m tired, i need money."
I miss my normal life.
a lot of feelings but nothing to say
i overthink too much and that shit hurt
can i just deactivate myself
I’m a very emotional sensitive strong solid person.
"Dear pain, You changed me a lot."
i just want u to be in my future.
i stop trying to communicate when i feel unwanted
"tired eyes, broken hearts"
I say sorry a lot. Mostly because I feel like everything is my fault.
You can't force people to treat you right.
Take a rest but don’t quit.
Love isn't supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be worth it.
Be mature enough to accept rejection and failures.
"Heal, learn and grow."
Mind your own twitter.
Stop checking for a person who doesn't check for you. Stop investing your heart into someone who mistreats you. You're better than that.
"Accept your past without regret, handle your present with confidence and face your future without fear."
"I act like I don't care, but deep down it's killing me."
I overthink everything until I get myself in a bad mood.
Maybe it's better to keep it inside.
Too many songs still remind me of you.
"Life is so short, do what makes you happy."
it's okay. i wouldn't choose me either
can't survive without music
I'm trying to be strong but I'm tired.
Drowning on my own thoughts.
"i always choose to understand, even it hurts"
i'll never be that me again
I wanna be successful so bad that it stresses me out.
i seriously miss seeing you
high school memories are the best
"tell me all your rants, i will listen"
"Don't beg for attention, if they want to talk to you they will."
"Forgive, let go and heal."
Please be real. Don't play with someone's heart just to make yourself happy.
"When you really love someone, stupid conversations make sense."
"when you find someone who accepts you the way you are, that's home."
You deserve someone who thinks you're too important to lose.
a heart full of love only for you.
The hardest decision in life is deciding whether to “walk away” or “try harder”
A person who seems jealous or clingy is actually someone who cares the most.
keep it private. people  love to ruin things.
It's nice to be with someone who knows your value.
"P R A Y,   W A I T,   &amp;  T R U S T"
i never wanna see you with another
I think one of my favorite feelings is laughing with someone and realizing half way through how much you enjoy them and their existence.
bring me to the place where pain doesn't exist.
my eyes want to see you the most
Sometimes you gotta learn to be quiet even when you got a lot to say....
strong people cry at night
"I’m not your free time or your second choice, prioritize me or leave me alone."
being a cold person makes life easier.
if i show u my soft side my heart is yours
All I want right now is a healthy sleeping routine.
"i miss ur smile, ur face, ur hugs. i miss u."
I need a long long long long hug.
Sometimes I need to be alone with my music.
sleeping is so hard when your mind is full of thoughts.
sorry but i’m not interested in someone who wants everyone.
imagine having someone that actually gets excited to talk to you.
"the eyes, they never lie."
my bed knows all my pain.
need a vacation from my head.
"and suddenly, i lost my smile again"
night drives with good music
"""Pisanthrophobia"" is the fear of trusting people due to bad past experiences."
Never fall for sweet words. Fall for sweet actions.
"My ""haha"" and ""HAHAHA"" are so fucking different."
"twitter isn't just an app, it's a diary"
"I wanna be happy, that's all."
"being called ""baby"" makes my heart melt"
i hope u miss me sometimes
stuck between i don't want to feel that type of hurt again but i want to feel that type of love again.
mature conversations ft. the right person
"saying ""im tired"" when you're actually sad."
having insecurities sucks
"i don't hate, i ignore people."
i hate when a good song is attached to a bad memory
Loyal people are rare these days.
No one knows what you feel inside.
Let's get drunk and tell each other how we really feel.
"I acted like it wasn't a big deal, when really it was breaking my heart."
"I like it when you smile, it's cute."
I sleep to avoid my problems.
Sometimes we don't need advice. We just need somebody to listen.
You're the happiness I never realized that I needed.
Music can change my mood so easily.
life makes me tired everyday
I'm sorry I'm a very moody person.
Meeting you was a blessing.
Being appreciated is such a nice feeling.
i hope you heal from the things that no one ever apologized for.
"people get tired of me and then leave, but they don't know that i am tired also but i stayed."
i just want a long hug till i feel better
my silence means i'm tired of everything
seeing you happy is all i want.
imagine not having anxiety? that shit sounds peaceful as hell
Stop making me special if you'll leave me after.
i deserve to be happy and fine
"choose a good heart and matured mind, not a good face."
"read my mind, it’s full of you."
i suffered. i learned. i changed.
dont love me according to ur moods
"dear old me, you’ve changed a lot"
Just trying to be a better version of myself.
The most precious gift you can give someone is the gift of your time and attention.
"Being called “my loveee” ""my babyyy"" is so fucking cute ugh my heart😩"
Willing to take risks with you.
best friends hug is always different
im sensitive please be gentle with me
it is difficult to explain so i stay quiet
Never go back to someone who already broke you.
Be my baby and my best friend.
i want a life full of memories with you
crying from jealousy is a painful feeling
"You learn, you change, you grow."
Anxiety is the most silent yet painful experience. it makes no sense and you sit there alone drowning in your own thoughts without knowing the real reason behind all the pain that you feel. sometimes you can’t even feel a thing and it sucks because you tell everyone it’s fine.
"I know you're not okαy, you're just pretending."
I realized that I lost myself trying to please someone.
I wish I could cheer myself up like I do to others.
sadness hits at night
"Stay private, keep them guessing."
"To my happy pill, keep safe."
Everything will be okay.
"i go on twitter, talk to myself, then leave."
Have you ever looked at someone and hope they stay in your life forever?
Tweets are hints.
"not single, not taken, just waiting for something real."
damn i miss my fav person so much
i procrastinate    →            i regret                                      procrastinating         ↑                                      ↓  i procrastinate   ←     i get stressed bc    stressfully                i procrastinated
put your energy in the right people
Respect who respects you.
saying nvm instead of explaining.
what i need right now:             G   S        U             S     H                   S                               S                                 s                                  s
music heals me everytime
I hope your heart finds peace.
I need a 'delete memories' button.
Losing your appetite because you're sad is actually the worst feeling.
You will get better. Maybe not today. But someday.
Secretly in love with someone I can't have.
I can't remember how many times I said I was fine just because I didn't want to bother someone with my issues.
A true relationship is when you can tell each other anything and everything.
Crying over stupid shit is my talent.
"i'm tired, but i’m still trying my best"
"maturity is a mindset, not age."
i want more time with you
i need the longest warmest tightest hug.
may our parents live to see us succeed
i have the worst attitude when im mad
i keep a lot of shit to myself because I know nobody would care.
"date to marry, that’s it."
having a rant buddy is wholesome
"i'm not weak, i just cry when i'm hurt."
do u ever miss your own energy. like damn what happened to me
trust me i want you and only you.
"sometimes, I am the problem."
"too shy to say, but i hope you stay."
ǝʌol noʎ ǝuo ǝɥʇ ǝq ɐuuɐʍ ʇsnɾ I
"be clingy with me, i love that."
"cry in private, smile in public."
all i want is mental peace
"When someone gives you their trust, please do your best to take care of it. It takes a lot of courage for them to do that because you don't know how hard it is to trust people nowadays especially when you have so many cheaters and liars scattered around."
"People will push you to your limits and when you finally explode and fight back, suddenly you're the bad person."
"I respect those that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is."
learn how to survive alone.
i appreciate people that ask about me
"Love don't change, the person does."
"Please, don't give up."
Losing fake and toxic people is a win.
sucks when your effort is ignored
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay."
"i still like you, i just got tired of trying."
"I'm happy I met you, I'm sorry you met me."
Unexpected friendship from unexpected person.
"You are enough, a thousand times enough."
I wish I can fully smile with no pain inside.
Kindness makes you the most beautiful person in the world. no matter what you look like.
"If you break someone's heart and they still talk to you with the same excitement and respect. believe me, they really love you."
Do you ever pray until you cry because you’re just tired and u need strength
"take care always, my favorite person."
home is where you can be ugly and no one cares
i tried my best to fix things
music is my bestfriend when no one understands me.
being appreciated by someone is priceless.
sleep is the best way to escape feelings
Find someone who always wants to know how your day was.
"waking up with a peace of mind, that's all I want."
"for me, there’s you and nobody else"
No expectations. No disappointments.
"When I'm sad, please don't ask me what's wrong. Just hug me."
God's plan is always perfect.
"Lord, please guide us always."
Study hard. Make your Parents proud.
"Thankful for the people who came into my life, and stayed."
Nothing will kill you more than your own thoughts.
True friends are everything.
Stop chasing people who don't want you.
"""nah, i'll do it tomorrow"" is my everyday mood."
"you're still young, take your time."
i hate endings. i hate goodbyes. i hate change. but that is life. it must go on.
"Love people from your heart, not from your mood or needs."
Thank u for coming into my life. I'm so glad the universe let us met.
"i will always be proud of you, my love."
"just stay, and be my last"
my mind is so tired
do you always sleep just to avoid how you feel?
"spend time with yourself, fix yourself &amp; most importantly love yourself."
Interested in one person only.
"i found you, that's enough."
self-comfort has never been easy.
Never comfort me with a lie.
i be like “yeah its fine” then suffer in silence
my jealousy means i actually care about you.
"i get too attached easily, and that's my problem."
i never faked my love and care to someone
"i'm not a materialistic person, a simple hug can make me smile."
you’re everything my heart wants.
i like goodmorning and goodnight texts. i like phone calls. i like knowing that someone cares and that they’re trying. i like feeling wanted.
No girl deserves to be an option.
Loyalty is not about who will stay with you it's about who won't quit on you.
"sorry, i ain't perfect."
"my toxic trait is that i never speak up, i just get mad and distance myself until i'm not mad anymore"
"sometimes, memories are the reason why forgetting is hard"
"when maturity hits you, silence is better than arguing"
i pray to God to never lose you.
can we go back the time we are happy
i’m really bad at expressing my feelings
Nobody has ever made me feel the way you do.
my clingy side is only for my favorite person.
"i can’t replace you, no one is you."
i promise you i care more than i show
"When you put God first, you’ll never be last."
real ones will always be there for you
Crying is not the solution but crying makes you feel better.
I always feel this feeling that I can’t explain.
Just sleep. It solves everything.
It's crazy how fast everything can change.
People get hurt  because they put meaning to the things that really means nothing.
You can't stay mad at someone who makes you smile.
"""are u ok"" no, i need to get rich"
"having me is so boring, sorry."
fall in love with someone who will never stop choosing you
"Dear Heart, - I'm sorry for causing you too much pain."
how to sleep with peace of mind?
Overthinking can ruin something before it even begins.
efforts are better than promises.
miss being a little kid with no worries.
dear self: sorry for this unhealthy sleeping routine
"from ""🙂"" to ""😕"" real quick"
it’s so attractive when someone shows they care.
you're the best part of my everyday.
"stay lowkey, disappear and glow up."
i love people who make me feel special
mood: i wanna move to another city and start a new life
"we may not talk, but I still care."
i hate how soft hearted i am.
i just want a day without overthinking.
"please, be my permanent happiness."
imagine having someone that understands your mind.
"everytime my phone vibrates, i hope it's you"
silence is the best response.
call me for no reason i love hearing your voice
i’m 99.9% sleepy all day
better to hide my feelings
i need unexpected happy message
expectations break hearts
your happiness is my happiness too
stay strong for yourself
Stop pretending it doesn't hurt. Sometimes it's better to release the pain to feel better.
So hard to trust people nowadays.
Trying to be better everyday.
Sometimes we express our feelings through songs.
"people always leave, i am used to it"
Things money can't buy:  - Manners - Morals - Respect - Character - Common Sense - Trust - Patience - Class - Integrity - Love
"if i care for you, i care until the end"
"your time is coming, stay patient."
note to self: I’m going to make you so proud.
you are amazing. remember that.
"soon, you will receive what you prayed for."
good things are coming.✨ good things are coming.✨ good things are coming.✨
"for me, there’s you and nobody else"
I can respect a bad decision but I can’t respect a liar.
Don’t ignore the signs you asked God to show you.
Being alone is peaceful.
"i just want to be better, do better and feel better"
life is teaching me a lot right now.
i don’t even know what’s wrong with me anymore
please don't abuse my trust
i want someone i can talk to all day
Imagine being enough for someone.
i still remember how we started talking
i wanna disappear for a while
endless love for that one person
i hate pretending like it doesn’t hurt
there’s a lot in my heart but i can’t say
missing someone's smile
people lie. they always do.
I will achieve my dreams soon.
have?? you?? ever?? looked?? at?? someone?? and?? hope?? they?? stay?? in?? your?? life?? forever??
"share everything with me, i care"
sometimes i think about u and smile
i hate the fact that my insecurities are bigger than my confidence
"it's not just tweets, they're also hints"
i get jealous with nonsense reason
"i prefer to stay lowkey, leave people clueless, and let them assume what they want."
i wanna be someone’s biggest flex.
you lost the moon while chasing the stars.
"fake smiles, broken souls."
i miss laughing with my friends until i can't breathe.
can???? we???? just???? remove???? the???? sad???? parts????
I need a long car ride with good music.
"In 10 years, I wonder who is still going to be by my side."
Music speak when words can't express your feelings.
I'm not mad. I'm hurt. There's a difference.
Missing someone is one of the worst feeling in the world.
"Talking to you, laughing with you, being with you, changes my whole mood."
Pretending to be okay is never easy.
Worst battle: Heart vs Mind
"Music always helps, no matter what you're going through."
"I admit, when I'm in a bad mood, EVERYTHING annoys me."
"Technically, I'm single.. But my heart is taken by someone I can't call my own."
"tired, but i have goals."
"Feelings can be controlled, but tears never lie.."
I wish I could rewind time.
i just wanna stay busy so I don’t have time to think.
i've been thinking about you all day
"I'm not the person I used to be, I admit, a lot of shit got to me."
"If you're mine, you're only mine.. I don't share."
I need an escape from reality.
Sometimes I'm just tired of trying.
"I didn't choose you, my heart did."
you are the reason of my happiness
your smile changes my whole mood
Never been good enough.
Being sad without knowing what is the reason is a different kind of feeling.
i wanna meet someone like me
"Fall in love with vibes, nevermind the age."
can i delete my insecurities pls
"if i disappointed u, i apologize"
Sometimes you fall in love with the most unexpected person at the most unexpected time.
old songs still have the most beautiful lines.
sometimes simple things can make me cry.
"You make me sad, but I still want you."
Someday someone will be afraid to lose you.
"If I change, it's for myself."
sometimes you just have to breathe and tell yourself it’s okay.
I saw all your flaws and loved you more.
i miss the feeling of being truly okay
"i hate myself from being sensitive, soft hearted and easily to cry"
"i'm mature and immature, i can do both depending on the mood"
having someone who listens to you is a blessing
stay with me no matter how hard i am
once u lie to me i'm always gonna think you're lying about everything you say.
i badly want someone who can understand me for being me
I love you for who you are.
you’re my favorite person to talk to
i want u to know that i'll always care
"revenge is not my thing, i ignore"
"i'm good, but i have limits"
"be careful with your words, once they are said, they can be only fogiven, not forgotten."
if travelling was free you’d never see me again
i can reply within 5 seconds after being ignored by 24 hours
"i’ve seen many eyes, but i fell for yours"
"strong outside, dead inside"
TWITTER is literally a great excuse to talk to yourself without looking stupid.
I’m proud of me because I’ve survived the days I thought I couldn’t.
“what if” thoughts are killing me
kinda tired of being okay with things I’m not okay with :(((
"i am a hardworking lazy person, yes we do exist."
Faking smile is so easy but faking feelings is not.
Hurting someone with the truth is better than making them happy with a lie.
A better person is the one who knows how to say sorry.
People get jealous when they care.
REJECTION is the reason why people deny their true feelings.
Don't give up. The beginning is always the hardest.
Good times + Crazy friends = Amazing memories.
"Life doesn't get easier, you just get stronger."
"Remember, being yourself is the only way to find out who truly cares and loves you for you."
Memories are forever.
"People change, feelings fade."
"Forgive others. Not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace."
Stay strong and always be positive.
"Be patient, good things take time."
A friendship without bullying is boring.
I need a hug and six months of sleep
"one day, i'm gonna have everything i prayed for. i really believe it."
"i want someone to look at me  and say ""damn that's mine""  and just be proud to have me"
You're still my happy pill.
"""you look tired"" bro i want to stop existing"
don't ever compare me to someone else.
i hate it when my anger turns into tears.
"Brain, I need you to focus."
waiting is better than forcing things to happen.
Appreciate the people who never give up on you.
i wish I can cheer up myself the way I cheer up others
"don't trust words, trust actions."
i hate how my mood shifts from happy to sad easily
you will always be important to me.
sometimes i push people away to test if they will stay.
Still healing from things i don't speak about.
bestfriend love is a different type of love.
Things will get better.
"We deserve someone who may get tired but still, wont give up on us."
"Being in a relationship is not about kissing, dates, taking pictures or showing off. It's about being with the person who makes you happy."
I like those people you can joke around with and then have a deep conversation with.
"Fall inlove with someone who protects your heart, not plays with it."
I'm lucky to have you in my life.
"self, you can do it."
"sad part is, you can't even fix yourself"
"I wish, I was enough for you to stay."
Sometimes I can't tell what I feel.
Sometimes being alone is safer.
"i badly need a ""delete feeling"" button"
never take advantage of someone who has a soft spot for you.
comforting other person while having an own problem
hearing your voice makes my heart smile
I got addicted to you so easily.
i want to hug you and sleep
"If they don't fight for you, they're not right for you."
Been too exhausted to deal with life lately.
I miss your sweet smile.
"continue to grow, even you are alone"
"day by day, i feel more empty"
"lose your pride, not your girl"
i'm a human too. i can feel pain
we always tweet things we can't say.
i'm changing myself everyday so don't compare me to the past version of me
"Respect people's feelings. Even if it does not mean anything to you, it could mean everything to them."
The best relationships start off as friendships.
I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really wanna be cuddled right now.
Listening to music is the best medicine for a bad day.
"Pray, God answers."
"If you miss me, you can call me."
"Love isn't always happy, sometimes it's painful."
I wanna go back to the days where I can sleep without a heavy heart.
I want a relationship that turns into a blessing not a lesson.
protect your heart at all costs
"I love sleep. You forget about pain, problems, stress, everything for a while."
my attitude depends on yours
i miss you more than you'll ever know.
music heals but lyrics kills
"Don't force anything, if it's meant to be it'll find you."
People who understand your silence are important.
Never stop praying for the person you love.
"I love to be alone, but I hate being lonely."
It's so frustrating when you can't even understand yourself.
Accept that not all things will end the way we wanted.
you're the only person i wanna see
music knows my deepest feelings
"Please be aware, I am trying my hardest to push through the pain, the exhaustion and fatigue, the brain fog, the insomnia, the fear, the guilt, the judgement, the relentlessness of it all. All the time."
I just feel pain. A lot of pain.
be kind. be honest.
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone how much they mean to you.
Don't chase. Get chosen.
Treat people how you want to be treated.
"i don't do revenge, i delete people."
I’m not about that “no feelings” shit. Fuck that. I feel deeply. I have a heart. I’m human. Things affect me dude.
One mistake and everyone judges you.
"If I ever tell you about my past, it’s never because I want you to feel sorry for me but so you can understand why I am who I am"
having a trust issue is not easy.
so many what ifs on my mind.
I'm attracted to the person that I have no chance to be with.
"Breakups are ok. Starting over is ok. Moving on is ok. Saying no is ok. Being alone is ok. What is not ok is staying somewhere where u are not happy, valued, or unappreciated, that's not ok."
"The saddest goodbye is when you still want to hold on, but you need to let go."
i am here if you need me
sleeping is nice until you wake up and realize you're still sad
"I want to be loved, not to be used."
your hug is all i want when i'm sad
"i know i'm not good. but hey, i'm trying my best."
I don't know what to feel anymore.
i wish i could also be someone's favorite.
"don't abuse soft hearted persons, because too much pain will turn them in to cold one"
"she's healing day by day, she's me."
i keep it inside cause it’s hard to tell.
Mistakes are proof that you're trying.
"i know who’s fake and who’s real, i just play along"
better to wait than force things to happen
"the eyes will tell, what mouth can't."
Some friends aren't really friends... They're family.
hugging a pillow and imagining it's the person you love
That moment when the lyrics of the song matches your mood.
I care about you. A lot actually.
"Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn."
Crying is the best way to release emotions.
Be mature enough to accept rejections and failures.
i feel empty but i'm fine
"not everybody will understand your silence, remember that."
so you hate me? lol same
"Me and my wallet feels the same way,  we're both feeling empty"
Kinda sad but it's okay.
I'm too soft and I hate it.
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
i hate this heavy heart feeling
sleeping after crying hits so different
"As we grow older, we realize it is best to be lowkey and private."
an overthinker notices everything.
"Whatever comes, let it come. What stays, let it stay. What goes, let it go."
"I pretend like i don't care, but you're stuck in my head."
i'll be the one that stays till the end.
I don't know what to talk about but I wanna talk to you.
"I fall in love with personalities and vibes, not looks and money."
i'm nice until you break my trust.
"if you feel tired and drained, take a little break, but don't give up."
I'm not afraid to try again. I am just afraid of getting hurt for the same reason.
i can't force you to appreciate me but you sure gonna feel it when i'm gone.
"if she's important to you, show her."
sometimes it’s better to just keep it to yourself.
Someday someone will stay.
Be with someone who is good for your mental health.
"I never faked my ""I miss you"" to someone."
"I want to delete social media everyday, but social media makes me laugh when I need it."
"I tried my best, and now I'm so tired."
sleeping always fixes my mood
make memories with the right people
7 billion smiles and yours is my favorite.
"Sometimes I wish to become a robot; no emotions, no pain."
"Dear self, stop expecting too much."
listening to music &amp; thinking of you.
I care; I always care.   That's my problem.
"When you love someone, choose them everyday."
"I chose to hide my feelings, cause in silence, there's no rejection."
"You're still important to me, with or without conversation."
"yes i made mistake, but i learned."
can we skip the part where it hurts?
*Who hurt you?  : My own expectations
I wanna go somewhere where no one knows my name.
I'm not expecting anything but I'm silently hoping for one thing.
"when I miss you, I re-read our old messages and smile like an idiot."
may our favorite person never turn into stranger.
"correct me when i'm wrong, i'm always willing to learn &amp; grow."
"Love is not about how much you say ""I Love You"" But how much you can PROVE that it's true."
i wish every notification was from you
"always remember, iloveyou everyday"
i forget my sadness when i talk to u
"im sorry, im really sorry for being me"
I want to message you but I’m scared to be ignored again.
i want to sleep forever
i’m so sensitive honestly
i wish i can hug you every single day
"To that friend who has never been tired of listening to my dramas,  Thank you! I owe you a lot."
your heart needs to accept what your mind already knows
Praying for better days.
"Through ups and downs, you have me."
"It still hurts, i just pretend that I am fine."
"You can rest, but don't forget to choose to fight again."
"Don't abuse soft-hearted people, they can't sleep at night overthinking."
my mind is more talkative than my mouth.
Everything will be alright.
"To that person who owns a special place in my heart, please be safe everyday."
sharing songs = sharing feelings
I never faked my care to someone.
slow kisses and long hugs are needed
Why is life testing me so hard lately? I mean I’ll survive but damn give me a break.
Trusting people is too dangerous.
I can't stop staring at your pictures.
Everyone leaves when they find someone better. Don't get too attached.
I don’t know how many times I survived myself without telling anyone.
Accept that you aren’t special to some people and move on.
Thankful for the people I have right now.
I want a lowkey relationship but a long lasting one.
"I may not be the sweetest person, but I care genuinely."
Being understood without having to explain yourself is the best kind of feeling.
Stay lowkey. Not everyone needs to know everything about you.
It costs $0.00 to be loyal.
let the pain teach you how to be strong
i’ll always want the best for u even if we don’t speak anymore
Over thinkers will also over love the hell out of you.
A toxic person will never change.
Life goes on. Move forward. Be better. Do better.
Loving someone shouldn’t drain you.
God’s plan is always the best.
can someone handle all my moods?
"temporary people, permanent memories"
i hate being someone’s second option
i still remember the first day i saw you
"Thinking too much again? Well, same."
"trust me, i’ll be there when there’s no one"
"“communication is the key” but so is a sense of understanding. if i tell you something, and you’re not willing to see where i’m coming from, then what’s the point of telling you anything."
i love my day when it’s full of you
"Before you assume, try asking first."
i'm the best at acting like i am fine
"No matter how long it takes, true love is always worth the wait."
i was toxic to some and a blessing to others. im willing to admit i wasn’t always in the right
"sometimes, it's better to remain silent"
tbh my overthinking kills my own mood
heartbreak changes you
continue to forgive. continue to grow. continue to love.
im not okay but soon i will be
Badly want to escape this world right now.
"It feels like everything is my fault, I'm sorry."
"I miss being with you,  I miss our talks, I miss laughing with you, I miss you."
"Don’t promise, just prove."
"No one knows how hard it is to open up to someone about being sad at random times. How hard it is to explain to your friends that you have a heavy feeling in your chest, but can't tell why."
Dark times teach you a lot.
"Tbh, I’m gonna say I’m fine as long as I can handle it."
Isn’t it weird? we are all alive but we are dead inside.
"I no longer force things. What flows, flows."
"Some people don’t really love you, they just love you because you love them."
"If I’m weird with you, I’m comfortable with you."
"She’s not difficult, she just wants to make sure you are serious before she gives her heart... because when she loves, she loves hard."
Stop fixing people while they’re breaking you.
it’s okay to disappear until you feel like you again.
"expect nothing, appreciate everything."
"Life is short, spend time with people who understands and appreciate you."
"True love is when someone accepts your past, supports your presents, and encourages your future."
nothing feels heavier than unsaid words.
"set yourself free, from pain and negativity."
I get sad. I get insecure. I get jealous. I get lonely. I overreact. I make mistakes. But I promise I will always give you my best.
"I promise, I will love you at your worst and hold you at your weakest."
I wish I could read your mind to know what you really think of me.
Being judged by your own family is the worst kind of pain.
"don't revenge, let them realize."
"Hey, you are worth it."
I'm disappointed but not surprised.
"i wanna hug you and tell you ""I miss you""."
snapchat and ig filters always saves me from being ugly.
have you ever cried because you can't do math
"Clingy but mature partner, I WANT THAT!"
"happiness is a choice, so choose to be happy."
Assurance and consistency is all i want.
"i was hurt, but... nevermind."
find someone who knows how lucky they are to have you.
"People change, feelings change, things change."
"Please don't get tired of me, I'm still in the process of fixing myself."
"Crush, you deserve someone better. I mean, you deserve me."
"if you can make me laugh when im moody, i love you."
i can't explain the way i'm missing you
"Me on twitter, me on instagram and me in real life are completely three different person."
Be you. Let them hate.
Spend time with people who appreciate your energy.
real friends never leave your side.
you’ll find peace when you stop caring.
"Be a better you, for you."
We fall in love by chance. We stay in love by choice.
my eyes are craving to see you.
"I can't promise to fix all your problems, but I can promise you won't face them all alone."
I got betrayed while my heart was pure. I’ll never forget that shit.
I automatically go silent when I know something that hurt my feelings.
I always visit your account secretly.
"I appreciate effort. No matter how small, big or irrelevant it is, I appreciate effort."
The way I care for people makes me wish I had somebody like me in my life.
"I hate when people can’t see the wrong in their actions, but see the wrong in yours."
"Yes, I overthink but not because I want to be sad. I just feel too much, I value things, emotions, people and promises."
You deserve to be loved without having to hide the parts of yourself that you think are unlovable.
I am addicted with your smile.
Distance doesn’t matter if you both understand each other.
wondering if you miss me like i miss you
"If you're cold, you hurt people. If you're sensitive, people hurt you."
i wish some things never changed
"when i’m really done, I leave in silence. I only fight when i care."
"Lord correct me, direct me, &amp; protect me."
"dear twitter, thank you for listening to my rants and dramas when no one else was there for me."
i secretly get jealous when someone talk to my fav person
i really want to hug you but u r so far
i wish you wanted me like i want you
"when I am alone, I overthink. And that's why I hurt myself with my own thoughts."
"no rush, we will get the love that we deserve."
attracted to u because u r different
I talk way too much when I’m comfortable with you.
Maybe one day I’ll be worth it.
"Please, if you’re not interested in someone anymore, tell them. Don’t let them find out the hard way. They deserve to know that you no longer love them. They deserve to find someone who does. They deserve loyalty. They deserve a fair chance at love too. Don’t lead them around."
"No matter what terms we on, If I said I’ll be there for you I will."
Never ignore a person who loves you and cares for you. One day you may realize you've lost the moon while counting the stars.
i wanna be kissed &amp; hugged by you.
You deserve a love you always pray for.
It's okay not to be okay.
"I may not be a showy-type person, but believe me, I always care."
I found someone I never want to lose.
"If I had millions of choices, I'd still choose you."
A person who cares silently is a person who loves truly.
Don't make a promise you can't keep.
"sleepy eyes, busy mind."
"Maybe I don't cry, but it hurts. Maybe I don't say, but I feel. Maybe I don't show, but I care."
"To my favorite person:  I've been thinking of you every second, every minute, every hour, and every day. I always care for you, just be safe."
"I made someone smile, I made someone laugh but damn, I forgot my own happiness."
"I'm strong, but not all the time."
You will always be my favorite notification.
"Sometimes, letting go is the best thing you can do."
Overthinking can ruin something before it even begins.
"With or without label, I will always care for you."
"Hey little fighter, soon life will be brighter."
"Calling me cute is nice, calling me hot is great, but calling me yours is all I want."
"Love the personality, not the looks."
I always been afraid of losing people I love. Sometimes I wonder if there is anyone out there afraid to lose me.
Sending love to all people who feel unloved today.
"Before you pray, believe. Before you talk, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you speak, listen. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live."
"I was hurt the whole time, I just didn't say anything."
Motivate yourself. Don't listen to those people who only see your mistakes.
You are the risk I will always be willing to take.
I am good at pretending
"If I tell you my feelings, will we still be the same?"
"I'm fine, I just miss talking with you."
"My eyes met many eyes, but only got lost in yours."
Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own.
Don't rush something you want to last forever.
"Sometimes, I just don't understand these feelings that I have."
you need to relax and rest.
"People will always notice the change in your attitude towards them, but they will never notice it's their behavior that made your change."
"The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging and you have to act like you don't care at all."
we all just want to feel better
don't give up just because things got hard.
Keep it private until you know it’s permanent.
Imagine how many people dislike you because they didn’t hear your side of the story.
How they treat you is how they feel about you. Period.
You can feel when someone isn’t being real with you. Energy never lies.
Did you heal or did you force yourself to forget?
Not in a relationship but there’s a person in my heart that I really want to be mine.
Stop being ok with shit you really not ok with.
Be private. Not everyone wants what’s best for you.
It sucks when I have to act like it wasn’t a big deal when it was actually breaking my fucking heart.
TIP: Don’t read old conversation.
i wish i was better.
"I'm a strong person, but do you know what makes me cry? Its when I gave my best but I still feel useless."
i hate people abusing my trust.
"i want happiness, not headaches."
people with good heart are always unlucky in a relationship.
too shy to say but i hope you stay.
you deserve someone who is always sure about you.
BEST FEELING: Making other people smile.
"It doesn’t matter how bad the truth hurts, keep it real."
"i'm not sad or happy, i'm just okay"
"Disagreements are fine, disrespect is not."
"Know your worth, even if it gets lonely."
"if you lost me, i’m so sorry for ur loss"
"Sometimes, in order to be happy, you need to accept what is already gone."
no matter what i will still love you
i appreciate honesty more than anything
effort is the most attractive thing ever
distance sucks i need you here with me
"stay strong, God is with u"
Friendship and love in one person.
Sometimes you think that you want to disappear but all you really want is to be found.
"If it’s real, distance doesn’t matter."
Maturity is attractive.
Don’t break yourself just to fit into someone’s life.
Lack of communication will destroy a relationship.
Train your mind to be stronger than your emotions.
A loyal heart is enough.
Date someone who understands your mental health.
You can be confident and still have anxiety.
"i want you, i need you, i miss you."
Relationships are scary.
You are worthy of love.
You can’t please everybody.
Don’t get surprised by how fast people can change.
"Pain will end, maybe not now but soon."
Music hits way different when you got someone in mind.
Surround yourself with peace and positivity.
save me from overthinking please
Real love won't quit on you.
Self be strong. Don't let anyone break you again.
"you're my favorite person and you'll always be, no matter what."
"Let yourself heal, breathe and grow."
"take care always, i love you."
You deserve someone who thinks you’re too important to lose.
"I just want peace, no heartaches, no tears, no pain."
i love people who appreciates my weird personalities
"You are strong, you are just tired."
"when i'm into you, no other person gets the same attention."
It’s okay to lose people but never lose yourself.
my mood changes in 0.5 seconds
crying without sound is more painful than having a wound
"i'm tired, but im still trying my best"
sometimes we say “bye” to hear “stay”
sometimes you have to stay busy so you don’t have time to feel.
unexpected blessings are the best
Real love is not easy.
enough crying. You deserve better.
always trust the process.
Take the risk or lose the chance.
i love you. don’t ever question that.
Unexpected message from someone you miss is the best.
"If I tell you about my family, I really trust you."
"I fall in love with personality and mindset, not looks and money."
"I matured because of pain, not age."
⠀  Don't compare me to anyone.  ⠀
I want someone who doesn't get tired replying to my boring messages.
i prefer to distance myself whenever i'm in a bad mood because I will become the most heartless person you would ever meet.
"If you both want it, it will work."
“I trust you” is a lot deeper than “I love you”
I still pray for you and for your happiness.
breathe.   everything will be ok.
"Don't rush things, trust God."
"Life is weird. First you wanna grow up, then you wanna be a kid again."
i tell everyone to be strong knowing that i'm the weakest one
mixed feelings &amp; unsaid thoughts
"I use laugh, to hide pain."
i need you here by my side
appreciate what you have right now because you don't always get a second chance.
you stole my heart since day one.
"if we vibe, we vibe. that’s my type."
I fucking love when someone figures out the small things that you like by paying such close attention to you instead of you having to tell them.
I wish the person I love today will be my future someday.
better to be lowkey and private.
"cheating is a choice, not an accident."
“You’ve changed” thanks I started choosing myself.
you do stupid things when you're hurt.
"If a girl sends you a song and tells you to listen to it, you better pay attention to the lyrics."
Even our nonsense conversation means a lot to me.
"To an overthinker, you can't sleep because a lot of thoughts are going through your head. You are scared of the future. You are scared of losing someone. You are afraid to fail and feel that you are not enough. Go with the flow and trust the process. You are enough."
"Apology accepted, trust denied."
Some endings don't have proper goodbyes.
"If we date, I’m pushing you to become a better you."
"Damn, i need cash."
"I believe true love meets you in your mess and not your best. When someone sticks around no matter how hard shit gets, they really love you."
Your next relationship will be the one you prayed for.
"Just like seasons, people change."
Do you know what hurts? My back.
"One day someone will love you the way you wanted to be loved, and you don't have to fight for it."
Meeting someone with the same mindset as you is rare.
⠀         L e t   y o u r s e l f   r e s t  ⠀
"If you really have a pure heart, you’re gonna win in the end."
"If they’re okay with losing you, stop fighting."
One conversation can fix a lot.
Things I want:  1. you  2. you
"I admit, I miss you."
Love without loyalty is pointless.
You deserve someone who will be obsessed with you.
"I’m actually tired bro, like from the bottom of my heart. I am tired."
yes to self improvement.
Learn to heal your own sadness.
I keep too much inside.
Nothing hurts more than trying your absolute best and still not being good enough.
Sometimes i don’t even understand myself.
"When life is shit, turn the music up."
"Look at you, you’re tired but you are not giving up. Take a moment to be proud of that."
Sense of humor is a big turn on.
can't wait to see myself happy again
sometimes i wish i wasn't so sensitive
"I never fake my tears. So when it falls, I'm really hurt."
Old songs hit you strongly.
Wanna talk to you so bad.
"Trust me, family problems can kill all of your happiness."
Choose what makes you happy.
"Improving, growing and healing."
sometimes it’s better to say nothing
"Some people pretend they are strong, but they are broken inside."
Never argue with close minded people.
Self reminder: You’re still young and you’re not supposed to have your whole life figured out yet. Don’t stress. Everything will work out.
"Don't be sad. God has a better plan, trust in him always."
Can’t wait for things to go back to normal.
my weakness is that i care too much
"lany was right, “the more u love, the more it hurts”"
"lack of communication ruins everything because instead of knowing how the other person is feeling, we just assume."
twitter: dark mode instagram: dark mode iphone: dark mode life: dark mode
All I wanna do is talk to you.
Please take care of yourself.
"Be in my place, then you’ll understand."
"I love you, stay safe wherever you are."
The biggest comeback is making yourself happy again.
I’m so soft when it comes to you.
A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.
"choose a good attitude, not a good face."
when we first met I honestly had no idea you would be so important to me
Protect your peace.
"to be honest, you're the only one i've ever spent this much time and effort on."
"i love you always, never forget that."
"i don’t want perfect, i want honest and faithful."
"so many plans, so little money."
"when you feel so much, you just cry"
Have you ever tried to make someone suffer by not texting them and you suffer more?
Please be straight up with me even if you think it’ll hurt my feelings I rather know than overthink literally everything.
"You don’t need a lot of friends, just the right ones."
Risking is better than regretting.
"Everybody wants to be in a relationship for years but everybody is not ready for the the bad days, the crying, arguments, communication going wrong. Relationships aren’t fairytales &amp; it’s not easy. If you love each other, you have to stay solid through it all and make it work"
If I sleep early it means I’m sad.
i’ll always have you in my prayers.
"""Im proud of you"" just hits different."
I don’t react but I notice everything.
I got trust issues because people got lying issues.
I saw all your flaws and loved you more.
"i’m such a “no no, it’s okay” person."
i choose your happiness before mine
The best relationship is when you can act like lovers and best friends.
Heavy heart and tired eyes.
We all have stories we'll never tell.
Don't expect. You'll be hurt.
The true mark of maturity is when somebody hurts you and you try to understand their situation instead of trying to hurt them back.
"Before you give up, think about why you held on for so long."
Finding someone who understands you is rare.
Small circle. High value.
Ghosting toxic people is self care.
"The eyes, they never lie."
i hope i never lose what i love the most
"temporary people, permanent memories"
"if you lost me, i’m so sorry for ur loss."
"missing you right now,but I can't do anything about it"
My anxiety makes me think everyone secretly dislikes me.
feeling unwanted changes you a lot
My pillows know all the pain.
I honestly want something good to happen to me. I really need that rn.
No longer apologizing for wanting more. I’m growing. You either stay or you go.
Keep that person who chooses to stay beside you despite of seeing flaws.
I didn’t deserve that. You knew it too.
thinking of you... again
I need someone who needs me and doesn't let go.
In the end all I learned was how to be strong alone.
"I think a lot, but I don't say much."
It's okay to break down and cry.
"I hate arguing, because I know, once I open my mouth, I'll lose control."
Apology without change is just manipulation.
"Now, you're just a stranger with all my secrets."
"If losing me doesn't bother you, then you was never real to begin with."
"I'm clingy, I'm sweet but I can be the coldest when I am hurt."
"i know people are temporary but please just this once, be permanent."
I love seeing you happy.
A road trip. A vacation. Any type of getaway is definitely a need right now.
"Loyalty is rare. If you find it, keep it."
"Sometimes people need their space. They’re not cutting you off, they just need time to breathe and take care of themselves. They need some space to work on themselves. That has nothing to do with you."
"I go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace."
"Dear self,   Sorry for putting pressure on you.  Sorry for doubting you sometimes.  Sorry for being so hard on you lately.  Sorry for worrying so much about what the future holds.   This time around, i will focus on you and will love everything about you."
Stop chasing after people &amp; being the only one trying to fix everything. It's mentally &amp; physically exhausting. You have to find peace with whoever comes &amp; goes from your life. Don't be the only one putting in effort Bc you will end up losing yourself trying to save everyone else
I want you. I want us. I want it all. With you. Only you.
Having a supportive partner can literally change your life.
"if you want me, show me, if you have me, fight for me, if you love me, prove it."
8 things to quit:  1. trying to please everyone 2. fearing change 3. living in the past 4. overthinking 5. being afraid to be different 6. sacrificing your happiness for others 7. thinking you're not good enough 8. thinking you have no purpose
My relationship will always be private but I’ll never keep my partner a secret. there’s a difference between privacy and secrecy.
Stop checking for a person who doesn't check for you. Stop investing your heart into someone who mistreats you. You're better than that.
"whatever happens, i love you."
Night calls with you is all I need.
"keep me, im clingy and will love u only"
"“Can you multitask?”  Yes, actually I am losing my mind and chilling at the same time."
"Before you ""assume"" try this method  called ""ask"""
overthinkers deserve to date good communicators.
⠀  Stop overthinking. Relax and let it go.  ⠀
I stopped explaining myself when I realized other people only understand from their level of perception.
"Date in private, love in private, be happy in private."
I lied because I don’t want you to know how much I’m hurt.
"Note to self: if they want to, they will."
God knows how many times I prayed for you.
I’m matured enough to understand that i have some toxic traits too.
"I'm not heartless, I'm just tired of getting hurt."
"can’t wait to spoil my parents with my own money from my hardworks, one day."
"Lord, please clear my mind from overthinking. I’m tired."
"In 10 years from now, I want to see myself loving the same person I love today."
Isn’t it sad?? that you're a keeper but never been kept.
"I used to protect my name in every situation, but now i just want to protect my peace. Fuck what people think."
It is such a great feeling when someone just genuinely wants to talk to you and wants to know how your life is going.
I want someone who will stay with me no matter how hard i am to be with.
Don’t let someone treat you bad just because you love them.
It’s not a joke when anxiety attacks.
Want your attention but don't wanna bother you.
"Dear life, i just wanna be happy."
Tweets are actually hints.
Sometimes you have to disconnect to reconnect.
You’re too rare to lose.
i sleep to avoid my problems.
I'm full of words that I can’t say.
Kinda hope you are thinking about me.
I’m stuck between keep trying and why bother.
I miss being a little kid with no worries.
i lose interest when i see myself trying harder than you.
smallest lie can break the biggest trust.
that moment when you start feeling okay for once but then you overthink everything and suddenly a wave of sadness hits you like a truck.
missing someone who doesn't miss me.
"As an overthinker, I really need things made clear to me."
i just need someone to understand me.
"if you break someone's heart and they still talk to you with the same excitement and respect. believe me, they really love you"
don't lie to me to protect my feelings.
a best friend is someone who makes you laugh even when you think you’ll never smile again.
i’m a pro at pretending to be okay.
it’s so stupid how the tiniest thing can break my heart &amp; ruin my mood i literally didn’t ask to be this sensitive.
"i'm trying, i'm really trying."
don’t say “sorry” and then do it all over again.
You’re not selfish for wanting the same energy and love you give.
I’m glad I met you. Now do me a favour and stay.
Never wanna feel that pain again.
I am tired of being told I am loved and cared about but never made to feel that way.
I overthink myself into bad moods.
"Being someone's first love is great, but being someone's last love is beyond perfect."
"Your age doesn't define your maturity, your grades don't define your intelligence, and rumors don't define who you are."
⠀  Choose people who choose you.  ⠀
"Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you."
"It sucks when the only person who can make you feel better, is also the reason you always cry."
I hope future me is happy.
It’s hurting me but nvm.
"Date someone who handles conflict with maturity. Someone who lets you know when he is annoyed with you instead of bottling up inside. Someone who treats you with respect, even when he is struggling not to scream at you. Someone who is willing to make compromises, because of love."
"Do you ever write a really long message and about halfway through you're like ""you know what, they don't even care"" and end up deleting it"
"Oh right, my fault again."
Being strangers again is not easy.
I have no motivation for anything.
"Stop getting attached to people so fast, because attachments lead to expectations and expectations can lead to disappointments."
I want your attention but I won't ask for it.
Don't judge my choices if you don't understand my reasons.
"Ever since I met you, no one else has been worth thinking about."
Never compare me to someone else thanks.
I want to escape reality.
I thought I was doing better.
Emotionally: i'm done  Mentally: i'm drained  Spiritually: I feel dead  Physically: I smile.
Growing up is scary.
I hate when I cry about one thing then I end up crying about everything that's messed up in my life.
I really want to talk to you but I feel like I'm disturbing you.
It’s different without you.
I just wanna feel important to someone
I am not the same person I once was.
I will never stop loving you.
I need a long long long deep conversation with someone who understands.
"Can I just disappear, for like a while"
just because i didn’t react doesn’t  mean i didn’t notice.
"If you’re special to me, don’t ruin it."
Learn to say “no” without feeling guilty.
I pray future me is successful.
what’s on my mind?  you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you   you.
"You've been through a lot, you're such a strong person. Remember that."
"If we date, I don't need your passwords or your phone, I just want the truth if I ask about something."
Never joke around about someone's insecurities. You'll never know what they really feel.
one song makes you remember a lot.
I don’t want to break my heart again.
the best relationships usually begin unexpectedly.
i just wanna sit in front of the ocean &amp; listen to the waves.
"Don’t chase, don’t beg, if they want you they’ll make time for you."
never regret anything that made you smile.
wish i could tell you what’s really on my mind.
sometimes i miss how good everything was.
nothing is better than talking to someone you’re comfortable with.
my favorite memory was meeting you.
"dear anxiety, let’s break up and not see each other ever again."
i meet someone                 ⬈                              ⬊  they leave                        we talk                      ⬉                                ⬋                                   i get attached
my worst quality?  someone could hurt me so damn much and yet i’d still be there for them at the end.
"I pretend to ignore you, but I really just miss you."
"Stay private, enjoy life."
music hits different when you’re sad.
"I hate that moment when you hear something that kills you inside, but you have to act like you’re fine."
"If nobody got me, I got me."
i only get jealous because i’m afraid someone is going to make you happier than i do.
"Don’t abuse soft hearted persons, because too much pain will turn them into a cold one."
Some days I’m healing. Some days I break again.
"Sometimes you just have to accept that some people can only be in your heart, not in your life."
I always prefer being lowkey and private.
behind every strong person there’s a mess you can’t see.
"People always leave, I am used to it."
"care too little, you’ll lose them. care too much, you’ll get hurt."
Unexpected text from you is the best feeling ever.
Never apologize for leaving a situation to make yourself happier. your health matters and your happiness is important.
You don’t realize how attached you are to someone until you go without talking to them for a bit.
Date someone mature enough to say “let’s fix this” instead of just acting childish and ignoring you.
Love should heal you and not hurt you.
"I love you, that means I’m not just here for the pretty parts and the happy days. I’m here for the rough and the bad days. I’m here no matter what."
they care when it's too late.
i never faked my love to someone.
"so young, so damaged."
i’m a very private person. you don’t ask  i don’t tell.
don’t use someone to forget someone.
i wanna sit on a rooftop with someone  and talk about all my feelings with them.
"i know im a hard person. im sensitive, im moody, i need constant reassurance and i tend to overthink. but please don’t think that that’s all i am. i can be calm, i can be strong, and i can be loving. if you catch me on a day where im being hard, don’t think that’s all i am."
when someone asks you to listen  to a song. it’s because the lyrics  mean everything they’re trying to say
"if you stay,  stay forever.   if you go,  do it today.   if you change,  change for the better.   if you talk,  make sure you mean what you say."
"you fall in love with the little things about someone, like the sound of their laugh or the way their smile forms."
i choose you over everyone.
kinda want a big long hug.
"please, be my permanent happiness."
I wanna be someone’s first choice
"I will be fine, soon."
"I still like you, I'm just tired of trying."
"When you find someone who accepts you the way you are, that's home."
"Don’t tell me you love me, show me."
"Through ups and downs, you have me."
Be kind without expecting anything in return.
sending warm hugs to those who feel sad and empty.
"I never cheat, because I know how it hurts to be cheated."
RIP to my mental health.
mood: to be with you rn
we cannot grow without pain.
"Things will be better soon, hopefully."
I love twitter because there’s always someone who knows how to express what I feel better than me.
"God, Goals, Growing &amp; Glowing."
"sleepy eyes, heavy heart with busy mind."
Imagine someone tweeting about you.
An overthinking person needs an understanding person.
A “sorry” is useless when “trust” is broken.
I know my worth I’m just dumb sometimes.
"maybe i don’t cry, but it hurts.  maybe i won’t say, but i feel.  maybe i don’t show, but i care."
Sleep is the perfect escape from everything.
so much shit i wanna say but i stay quiet.
"if i cry in front of you, believe me, i have reached my limit."
Save me from my thoughts.
sometimes your mind can be your worst enemy.
"i may not see you everyday, but i love you everyday."
“i’m such a “no it’s okay” and suffer in silence type of person.”
"Nobody cares unless you are beautiful, rich, popular or dead."
"I’m a very forgiving person so If I stop talking to you, you really went too far."
I wanted to feel loved without feeling like I was begging for it.
i pray my friends get through the battles that they don't tell me about.
Learning to stay calm when you feel disrespected is a different type of growth.
private life always wins. keep it secret till you win.
i want to cry but i have things to do.
Don’t force people to choose you.
two things i will never forget.   1. how a person treated me.  2. what a person said to me.
you make me smile without trying
"if i talk to my mom about you , you really mean a lot to me"
Don't let your emotions make your decisions.
Deleting your toxic paragraph to text back “ok” is a different kind of self control.
i like private but not a secret
"One person, so many feelings."
I hope you heal from things you don’t talk about.
the fight between your heart &amp; your mind ain’t no joke
Make sure the person you’re choosing over everybody is choosing you too.
one mistake broke everything.
i hate getting flashbacks from things  i don’t want to remember anymore.
"i prayed for you, your happiness."
"removing myself from situations where i don’t feel loved, appreciated, or respected."
disappointed but not surprised.
missing your bestfriend is a different type of sadness
Everything happens for a reason.
"Please love me from your heart, not according to your mood and need."
"""I saw your tweet, you okay?"" I really appreciate this kind of person."
"I be like ""idc"" then start overthinking."
Tweeting your feelings is better than saying it to other people.
My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.
Sorry for being a typical boring person to talk.
Life is teaching me a lot right now.
Unexpected friendship is the best.
Dear old days: I miss you.
"It’s ok. I mean it’s not ok, but it’s ok."
"if you're meant to be with someone, it will work out. whether it's next month or in five years, what's meant to be will always be."
3 things you should never break: 1) Trust 2) Promises 3) Hearts
You know someone means a lot to you when their mood affects yours.
All I want is to rest now.
"i love clingy, only when its from u"
Insecurity mentally destroys you.
behind my smile is a story you'll never understand.
i will never give up on u ily
I can’t wait for the day that proves all of this was worth it.
i give silent treatment when im sad
don't: - cheat - please everyone - settle for less - cry over someone  know: - your worth - that you matter - that you're loved - how to pray - how to say thank you  its: - okay to make mistakes - okay to fall down - not bad to cry when tired - good to smile - time to move on
"I wanna build a relationship with someone who cares about ""why"" I've been quiet all day. Not someone who gets mad cause I'm ""acting different”."
Once you find your person there’s nobody else you want.
Two types of me: 1) wanna talk to you 2) don't wanna bother you
The best apology is changed behavior.
Real feelings don’t change fast.
"Be strong, s e l f."
"A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is."
There are a lot of unsaid thoughts in my head right now.
You’re lucky if you found a person who never gets tired of your mood swings.
Remember: “Your mental health is important.”
"I trusted you, you lied."
Willing to take risks with you.
"Depression isn’t always sadness, it can also be emptiness, anger, tiredness or loneliness, sometimes a cry for help isn’t so visible."
i can turn from a softie to cold as fuck
A tear is made of 1% water and 99% feelings.
I appreciate those who ask if I’m okay.
Find someone who knows how to love you when you are sad.
Self comfort is not easy.
You glow different when your soul is happy.
Loyalty is rare.
"dear music, thanks"
old messages really hit when you know that the bond is never coming back.
"if i could turn my sadness into cash, damn i'm rich."
People who start conversations are my favorite kind of people.
nothing hurts more than being ignored.
"you’ll always have me, i promise"
There’s so much I wanna say but if I talk about it I’ll start crying.
do    not          come    back           to        me           when      you           realize        no           one cared           like                    i                      did
Life is full of shit. You'll just have to deal with it.
"We don’t need to talk every day to be friends. If you need me, I got you."
"When I'm alone, I think too much."
never wanna feel that pain again
Stuck between “I need to save money” and “you only live once”
I owe myself an apology for all the shit i let slide
Your trauma is not your fault but healing is your responsibility.
Friendship isn't about who you have known the longest. It's about who came and never left your side.
"i love you still, i always will."
I didn't plan falling in love with you it just happened.
it’s attractive when you get the same effort you give.
"never get too comfortable, people change all the time."
A partner with the same vibe as yours &gt;&gt;&gt;
missing my fav person every night.
"It's about who stays, not who promised."
"I’m shy at first, but if you get to know me I’m the most annoying person you’ve ever met."
realizing i don’t care anymore is the best feeling
"You can replace me, but you can't replace the memories."
silent crying hurts the most
"I’m not your free time or second choice, prioritize me or leave me alone."
Even the kindest hearts get tired too.
i’m sorry i wasn’t good enough but i tried to be.
I saw you in my dreams. It felt so real.
maturity is when a person hurts you and you try to understand their situation and don’t hurt them back.
you will always be special to me
the most comforting sound is your voice.
Keep it private. People love to ruin things.
Be my baby and my bestfriend.
long walks with the right person
Old songs still have the most beautiful lyrics.
Hearing “i miss you” or “i want to see you again” from your favorite person puts you in the best mood.
How to save your heart:  1. should:  • never expect  • never demand  • never assume  2. know:  • your limits  • where you stand  • your role  3. don't:  • get affected  • get jealous  • get paranoid  4. just:   • go with the flow and be happy  • stay positive
"when someone has seen the worst parts of u &amp; still decides to stay, that's when you know they’re worth keeping. not everyone is willing to stick with u when times get tough. appreciate those who remain by your side, they’re the ones who deserve u at ur absolute best."
I barely got friends but I got the right ones.
Only those who love you can hear you when you’re quiet.
Praying for a clear mind &amp; a happy heart.
i wish i was someone’s fav
"dear bestfriend, thank you for being my unpaid therapist."
sometimes home is a person.
you are enough.   you are good enough.   you are smart enough.   you are strong enough.   you are beautiful enough.   you are kind enough.   you are brave enough.   you are enough and you will always be.
"Fall in love with someone who wants you, who waits for you. who understands you even in the madness; someone who helps you, and guides you, someone who is your support, your hope. fall in love with someone who talks with you after a fight."
"i want you, i need you, i miss you."
Sometimes the worst place you can be is in your own head.
"people ask me, why is it so hard to trust people?  i ask, why is it so hard to keep a promise?"
i get jealous very fast
Don't sacrifice your time for people who wouldn't do the same for you.
"when it hurts, just sleep."
call me for no reason i love hearing your voice
"your message is not just a message, it's my happiness."
trust me i'm lucky to have you.
I still fall for you every single day.
i look at ur pics when i miss u
i grew up without sharing my problems to my parents.
Find someone who understands your silence.
overthinking is no joke. that shit eats you up on the inside.
can’t wait for the day when somebody tells me i’m the best thing that’s ever happened to them and they mean it.
The lyrics hit different when you can relate.
"dear anxiety, let’s break up and not see each other ever again."
"my attitude gets bad when i'm tired or sad, sorry."
"deleting pictures is so difficult for me, i can't even let go of a random screenshot."
"my twitter, my tweets, my life, my rants, my feelings."
maturity and mindset are most attractive than looks.
that random stranger you met online and now a big part of your life.
forehead kisses is only for a special someone
we all hurt ourselves through expectations
quick replies make me happy
"i wish that someday, someone would thank God for having me."
I don’t think people understand how stressfull it is to explain what’s going on in your head when you don’t even understand it yourself.
i get jealous because i’m easy to replace
"still, you. only you."
Be with someone who feels like home.
trust your instinct. you are not crazy.
i pray it's you and me in the end.
i’m fucking trying my best
"I’m sad, I need cash."
music is a life saver.
"yes, i tweet about you."
I am okay &amp; not okay at the same time
i really hope this shit ends soon
".                o  n  e     d  a  y,             i  'm      g  o  n  n  a           t  e  l  l     m  y  s e  l  f              i     m  a  d  e    i  t  ."
i just need someone to stay and never leave.
can i just deactivate myself
I miss your hugs badly.
"i know im not a perfect person, but im doing my best to be better."
i’m jealous of people who get to see u everyday
i feel better when i'm with you.
"sometimes,  you just have to stay silent, because no words can explain  what’s going  on in your mind"
you have no idea how much i love you.
No one knows how much I cried that day.
i wish someone misses me too
"I may look strong, but believe me I’m tired"
I hate being stuck between “keep trying” and “why bother”
I wish I hugged you tighter the last time I saw you.
"You suffered enough, it’s time to let go of what’s hurting you"
"I disappear sometimes, that’s my thing."
Everyone deserve a person that can make their heart forget the trauma in the past.
things will get better. things will get better. things will get better.
"i'm not a materialistic person, a simple hug can make me smile"
music understands me when nobody else can.
Tweeting your emotions is better than telling it to someone or anyone who doesn't even care.
I saw all your flaws and loved you more.
i’m such a “no it’s okay” and suffer in silence type of person.
I don’t react but I notice everything.
"i love music, especially ur voice"
"take care always, my favorite person."
imagine having someone that understands your mind.
"lights off, good music &amp; chill."
i miss being excited about something.
"sorry, i'm such a cry baby."
i wanna be hugged till i fall asleep
"Sometimes, you gotta pretend everything is okay."
i have a “why am i like this” moment at least five times a day.
i prayed for you.
"Don't abuse soft-hearted people, they can't sleep at night overthinking."
i’m very soft please take care of me
"damn, i'm so in love with you."
The right people understand you differently.
having me is so boring ikr
that shit hurts but i act like idc
"You don’t need a lot of friends, just the right ones."
Risking is better than regretting.
Sleeping is nice. You get to forget about everything for awhile.
my heart wants you.
I'm disappointed but not surprised.
"Don't force someone to make time for you, if they really want to, they will."
"To my favorite person:  I've been thinking of you every second, every minute, every hour, and every day. I always care for you, just be safe."
Twitter is a place to confess your feelings.
You will always be my favorite notification.
"I miss being with you,  I miss our talks, I miss laughing with you, I miss you"
Don't make a promise you can't keep.
if airplane tickets were free you'd never see me again.
the most comforting sound is your voice.
"i dont want others attention, i want yours."
"with or without conversation, trust me i'm still into you."
"if it makes u happy, go for it."
"its hard to let go of ppl u thought would be there forever. especially if they were a big part of ur life, then u have to replan ur future w/o them. but if they’re meant to be in ur life, you’ll cross paths again. sometimes u go as far as u can with someone &amp; u have to grow apart"
i wish i can hug u whenever i miss you
all I want in life is happiness
you give me feelings i can’t explain
"dear heart, please keep me strong"
"im the loudest and quietest person, it depends on who im with."
talk to God before you sleep
"if i care for you, i care until the end."
I want to spend every night with you.
3 things to keep quiet..   1) Your love life. 2) Your income. 3) Your next move
"Dear self, stop expecting too much."
i pray i don’t lose you
old songs hold a special place in my heart.
If i told you i love you i meant that
i break my own heart by caring too much.
"hey you! don’t give up, okay?"
soon I'll make my parents proud.
"we no longer go for looks, we go for maturity, stability, loyalty and peace."
Losing toxic people is a win.
i need someone to tell me that i'm not as bad as i think i am.
private relationship ft. true feelings
"when i'm into you, no other person gets the same attention."
"I am both ""fast replier"" and ""never replies"" type of person, it depends on my mood."
Real love won't quit on you.
"take care always, i love you."
"Stuck between idk, idc &amp; idgaf."
My mind really needs a mute button.
it sucks when you don’t receive the same energy you give.
Never ignore a person who loves you and cares for you. One day you may realize you've lost the moon while counting the stars.
Life’s better when nobody knows anything about you.
"One day, someone will choose you and keep on choosing you everyday."
"I can’t replace you, no one is you."
I still pray for you and for your happiness.
be with someone who says let’s fix this  “i can’t lose you”
"Everybody wants to be in a relationship for years but everybody is not ready for the the bad days, the crying, arguments, communication going wrong. Relationships aren’t fairytales &amp; it’s not easy. If you love each other, you have to stay solid through it all and make it work."
"i love vowels, specially u"
imagine meeting someone who has the same mindset and vibe as you
stop being nice if it breaks you.
Being attracted to someone's smile is a real thing.
find someone that accepts all sides of you.
"yes, tell me about your day and how you're feeling, i care."
"In the end, i hope it’s you."
hurt me with the truth but never lie to me.
teach yourself to fight alone.
Just wanna stay busy so I don’t have time to feel.
Never reply when you are angry.  Never make a promise when you are happy.  Never make a decision when you are sad.
sometimes you just need to wait and pray.
eyes talk better than words
you mean a lot to me
your hug is all i want when i'm sad
I honestly need a break from my own thoughts.
so many feelings we can’t explain.
music is so better than people.
i wanna travel and never come back.
Unplanned moments are the best moments.
be with someone who supports you 100%
Bestfriends make life so much better.
trust me i want you and only you
i believe in using songs to say things.
"once i like someone, i really be ignoring everyone else"
"i’ll always choose u, even at days we don’t understand each other"
"I'm inlove with the moon, sunset, sunrise, music, galaxies, clouds, and skies."
wanna lay on your shoulders and forget everything
i miss you everyday my love
i do stupid things when im jealous
one notification from u gives me millions of happiness
"nothing hurts more than being ignored, replace, forgotten, or lied to"
"Tell me a lie.  ""i am okay"""
Hug me tight. I like that.
always in the mood to sleep
i wish memories left when people did
no girl deserves to wake up &amp; feel like she’s not enough.
being understood without having to explain yourself is the best kind of feeling.
remember that the right person will never get tired of you
"You smile, I fall deeper."
"When we first met, I had no idea you'd become so important to me."
"I'm not rich. I'm not smart. I'm not appealing. But, I have a good and loving heart."
"one day, u gonna have everything u've prayed for."
"be a better you, for you."
Don’t be afraid to start over again.
"Dear Self,  You deserve the best."
Choose what makes your heart happy.
a lot of shit changed me.
can??? i??? just??? delete??? my??? insecurities???
I wanna feel special.
"I may not be a showy-type person, but believe me, I always care."
May you meet someone who’ll know how to calm your storms.
"How are you?  ̶s̶a̶d̶,̶ ̶b̶r̶o̶k̶e̶n̶,̶ ̶d̶e̶f̶e̶a̶t̶e̶d̶,̶ ̶c̶r̶u̶s̶h̶e̶d̶,̶ ̶l̶o̶n̶e̶l̶y̶,̶ ̶f̶a̶l̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶p̶a̶r̶t̶ “I’m fine.”"
Sometimes simple efforts mean so much.
"Fall in love when you’re ready, not when you’re lonely."
i’m sorry i can’t be perfect.
I miss the person who always makes me smile.
"Finding someone who thinks you’re interesting enough to talk to you everyday, whether they’re a friend or a lover, is one of the best feelings ever."
May you receive what you've always been praying for.
"yes we don't talk, but i still care."
"I rarely react, but I always notice."
"once you learn how to control your emotions, you win the game."
"i’m sorry, i’m not the best person you have wished for."
we all have broken our rules for someone.
sometimes silence is better.
"i may not see you everyday, but i love you everyday."
"i’ll always love you, i promise."
i’d like to disappear for a while.
My heart is full of you.
I really hope we never lose each other.
being valued feels so much better.
i hate it when i’m sad and have no one to talk to.
"Have you ever tried to share your problem with somone because you can't handle it anymore but instead of sharing them you chose not to, because you think that you might just bother them"
nothing excites me anymore.
"we are strangers, again"
i crave for peace of mind.
so tired of feeling this feeling
ignore me and I’ll do the same
i act i'm fine but i'm dead inside.
some parts of you just never heal.
I hope better days are coming.
I feel like I no longer have the energy to put effort into anything.
Be real with me or just leave me alone.
"don't worry about me, i can turn my problems into a joke."
Accept the fact that some questions can never be answered.
i wanna go somewhere where no one knows my name.
i hide my feelings a lot.
eye contacts that end up with a smile.
"if u need me, i’m always here"

"I want you today, tomorrow and forever."
overthinking hits hardest at night.
I wanna go to the beach just to listen to the waves.
"lowkey, wanna restart my whole life"
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
m u s i c   m a k e s   i t   a l l   o k
I miss talking to you for hours.
friendship and love in one person
"Be you, not who people want you to be."
You know what’s attractive? Effort.
"If it's meant to be, it will be."
i dont like sharing my fav person
Choose people that choose you. The end.
"to my happy pill, thankyou for making me happy. ilysm. ♥️"
deep conversations with someone who understands you is everything.
seeing you happy is all i want.
"As long as I can, I won't give up, but once I'm done, I'm done."
Keeping myself busy to forget that I am sad.
"please stay, even at my bad times."
"Full of mistakes, that’s who I am."
"Find someone who is proud to have you, scared to lose you, fights for you, appreciates you, respects you, cares for you, and loves you unconditionally."
forehead kisses and tight hugs 🥰
trust me i will stay with u
"if you’re happy, i’m happy"
being alone in the dark while playing music on is kinda like a mood for me.
"be clingy with me, always text me, annoy me, send me your selfies, tell me about your day, i fucking love that shit."
"""are u ok"" no, i need to get rich"
L               I                  F                   E  Life        isn’t         fucking           easy
tired of saying it's okay.
I wanna go back to the days where I can sleep without a heavy heart.
twitter is a home for sad people.
I want a life with you.
"i'm physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically out of energy."
"i love you always, never forget that."
I feel sorry for myself.
"I choose you. Again and again, I will choose only you."
"if they care, they'll find time for you."
Overthinking will kill your happiness.
Unexpected messages or calls is the best.
“that feeling you can’t explain.”
i love you in a way i can’t explain.
I'm shy at first but I do the stupidest random things when I get comfortable with someone.
⠀  ⠀⠀⠀                 PRAY ⠀⠀      Everything will be okay  ⠀
"maturity is a mindset, not age"
i hope tomorrow is a better day
I love you
"i found someone, i never want to lose. ❤️"
"i'm too private, if i open up to you, you are special."
"Yes, I care for you silently."
"it's not just tweets, they're also hints"
"my toxic trait is that i never speak up, i just get mad and distance myself until i'm not mad anymore"
we fight. we fix. we stay.
"with or without conversation, trust me i'm still into you."
disappointment happens when you expect too much.
"still young, still making mistakes, still growing, i’ll be okay."
"you are not responsible for everyone else’s happiness and well-being. you’re doing your best to be a good friend and loved one to those around you, but you can only do so much. you don’t deserve to feel guilty if there’s something you can’t fix. you're doing amazing."
Eye language never lies
"Right now, I want to hug my favorite person."
"suffer in private, glow in public."
i still fall in love with you everyday.
Bad days build better days.
words are useless without actions.
