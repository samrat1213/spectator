Just like every July, Scott with his buddies and his girlfriend camped out in
The forest. They left Willengton for a couple of days and plunged into the
Open. It was on the first night out. Camp-fire sparked into sweltering
Darkness. Scott got some beers from the car. No beer, no fun. Can after can
Alcohol was being drunk in a hurry. It's 2 a.m. No one was able to get the
Tents or even put out the camp fire. After a hard drinking spree they felt
Asleep just anywhere. Everything around changed in the morning.The camp-fire
Made the forest burn. Scott lay next to the fire so his body reduced to ashes
His girlfriend lay half-naked on the stream-side. The fire consumed her
Incompletely leaving no bones. Anyway, she couldn't survive. It was hard to
Describe other bodies as they looked like burned dry twigs. ...party's overEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
