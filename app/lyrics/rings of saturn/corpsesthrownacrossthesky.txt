Impaling anomaly strikes, pierce the vile and depraved, slumped down, 
succumbing to the mechanical beast not of this world 
Machine arms grasp intestines, as the human life comes to an end, 
killed it cannot be, sent to wipe this sphere clean, Implanted seeds 
beckon a new beginning, a new race has come to rule, forces beyond 
your comprehension, you may fight but you will die 
Slowly weakening the insides, paralysis leaves them on their knees, on 
their knees, begging for their lives, on their knees, begging for 
their fucking lives, 
Humans sliced apart, carnage fills the streets, 
dismantling what is left of humankind, beheaded, corpses thrown 
across the sky, discarded, chaos and darkness engulfing earth, bodies 
and loose limbs flowing through the blood red rivers 

Machine arms grasp intestines, as the human life comes to an end, 
killed it cannot be, sent to wipe this sphere clean, Implanted seeds 
beckon a new beginning, a new race has come to rule, forces beyond 
your comprehension, you may fight but you will, die 
pierce the vile and depraved, slumped down, 
succumbing to the mechanical beast not of this
