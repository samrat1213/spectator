Drawn to an act of complete domination
Violent urges of decapitation
Premeditated murder, invidious
Soon she will be vanquished, insidious

Headless
Headless
Headless

Abscission of her head is what I'm craving
I will become her homicidal savior

Headless

Headless

Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain
Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain

Preparing for medieval demise
A make-shift guillotine out of burcher knives
I'll watch her body quiver from the chaos
Peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes

She finally enters my dwelling of sin
It'll be done in a matter of minutes
As I embrace her for one last single time
In horror I realize, death is mine

I feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck
The blood spews incessantly, flooding my face
Convulsions and spasms as life fades away
Ironically, I'm the one with no head

Headless
Headless
