Malevolent
Are the architects who have changed their ways
Glaring down on us, overwhelmed with disgust

They now anticipate the end
Human D.N.A. deemed a tainted creation
We are forewarned
Signs were ignored, now we must submit to extermination

A predestined termination
A chance to redesign their failing offspring
You were forewarned, and now you must meet your end

Aborted, so then they can begin again
Channeling power
Drained from within the earth
To construct superior specimen

But before the end
You're forced to watch this world burn
And transform into a dead planet

Watch this world burn
And transform into a dead planet

This is a dead planet
A wasteland
It's fucking worthless

This is a dead planet
It's fucking worthless
