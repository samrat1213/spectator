No one
No one

The devil lives inside
The doubt outside my heart
There's nothing anyone could do
Worse than what I do to myself

No one is ever going to find out
What I am all about
No one is ever going to find out
What I am

I sit and watch you turn
Into ash my friend
This life is only as empty
As you want it to be

No one is ever going to find out
What I am all about
No one is ever going to find out
What I am

Time is my beholder
These hands will get older
As my wrists are losing their grip

No one

No one is ever going to find out
Not even me

Victims in pain keep the doctors away
When wanting to die is the cure
