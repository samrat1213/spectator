Upon these walls
Draping outlines of once living parasites
The human as a rotten spectacle
I eat your skin

Sheath of epidermis
Fillet of flesh
Stripped, washed and tanned
Source of vitamin D and protein

Oils drained for future feminine products
Perfect hollow shell--I now am someone else
I eat your skin

Step inside the human jumpsuit
See what they saw, feel what they felt
As you now kill yourself
Only to be gorged--I eat you skin
Dead meal--no meat
Only dry, cooked skin cells
All surface blemishes discarded
Parts is parts
I eat your skin

Sheath of epidermis
Fillet of flesh
Stripped, washed and tanned
I eat your skin
Squamous and transverse
Masticating the coetaneous
Acne, boils and pus
I eat your skin; I suck the very life out
Sheath of epidermis
Fillet of flesh
Stripped, washed-rawhide!
I eat your skin
Squamous and transverse
Copulating the coetaneous
Blackheads, scabs and pus
I eat your skin; I suck the very life out of your rotted corpse--leaving you dehydrated
