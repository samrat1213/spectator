Taken and lead, entering strange corridors
Housing a mixture of unfamilial life forms
And native creatures of earth

Segregated and on display
Sedated for transport
A course is left unknown
The hope of return at its furthest distance
Impulsed to explore the spacious constraints

Oblivious to their constant surveillance
Accessing rooms of voluminous proportions
Within these walls hold a brilliant display

The regeneration of extinct life
Re-creation

Worldly limits sustained
Holding every known species captive

You are enslaved

Within astonishing scale of confinement
Your final purpose is revealed
Preserved and displayed
Imprisoned light years away
On their home planet
