Vamos

Come tell me do you pray to the devout Santa Muerte?
Or do you slay for Hel Nina Blanca without mercy?
The cavalry of this calvary
A nuevo testament that decimates
The reconquista of the crematoria
A gathering corpsestorm of hell awaits

Bloodied but unbowed
These seasoned grievances will be avowed

A dark mobilization
An aphotic horizon
A war unrestrained
Reign of terror is unleashed
The battalions of rage are trouping
Down from the heights of bible hill

This was no new Jerusalem
But a Golgotha that you created
Oiling the machines of your opulence
A sprawling barrio spawning an open living grave
Mountainous Calaveras
Come hold my hand witness the truth
Mass execution of juvenility
The liquidation of a whole ungodly youth

Bloodied but unbowed
These seasoned grievances will be avowed

A dark mobilization
An aphotic horizon
A war unrestrained
Reign of terror is unleashed
The battalions of rage manouvering
Down from the heights of bible hill

Stupefying horror across the river awaits
Can't you see narco insurgency death rattling at the gates?
Barrios of destitution from the desolate valley arose
Come taste god's own medicine
Dispensed from the horn of the goat

Stupefying horror across the river awaits
Come taste god's own medicine pooling at your gates

Unleashed-cartel commandos will rain
Down from the heights of bible hill
