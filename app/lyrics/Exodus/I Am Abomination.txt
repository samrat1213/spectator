I am affliction
The cause of all that ails you
I am addiction
That blinds and assails you
Through all confusion
I am the chaos
I'm the the thing that makes you hurt
Laughing at your loss

Just underneath your skin
Is evil's origin
Come see the face of devastation
You are me, I am abomination

I am the bleeding
When you open up the vein
I am the overdose
That rushes to your brain
I'm all you've come to loathe
All you've known to hate
I am the hunter
When you come to take the bait

Just underneath your skin
Is evil's origin
Come see the face of devastation
You are me, I am abomination
I am Jehovah
I am the virgin whore
I am the battlefield
Of pestilence and war
I am the monster
That lurks beneath your bed
I'm all perversions
Trapped inside your head

Just underneath your skin
Is evil's origin
Come see the face of devastation
You are me, I am abomination
I am abomination
I am abomination
I am abomination
I am abominationEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
