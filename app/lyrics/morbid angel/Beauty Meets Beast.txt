Beauty Meets Beast LyricsYou're ripe for ensnare
Your dreams and longings are beyond compare
Call on me willing child
Trade me your life for one without care
Show me the wounds
Exciting me now the closer you get
Miss nothing your world so full of despair
You will never regret
I am all you know
And it's deeper we go
Gift me your soul, please me
Deeper and deeper oh beauty, meet your beast
Bloody notes slurred
Dreaming what's human becomes but a blur
Oh beautiful child
Come to me moist I'm the great connoisseur
Woman you play this dangerous way
Unknown, unalarmed
To majesty kneel
My allure makes you feel
Your wounds are your charm
I am all that you know
And it's deeper we go
Gift me your soul
And it's deeper and deeper we go
Feel my embrace
And the deeper we flow
And the beauty will grow
She falls deeper and deeper and deeper
Till beauty knows beast
All the while your pleasure is here
No need to fear
Don't look back
Your pleasure is here
In my hands cavalier
When beauty meets beast
When beauty meets beast
When beauty meets beast
When beauty meets beast
I am all that you know
And it's deeper we go
Gift me your soul
And it's deeper and deeper we go
My embrace
Found your beauty that grows
You're with me now
Beauty I'm your beastEmbed
