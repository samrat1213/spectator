tweets
stand united when others are looking to fill your light with darkness.
"stability is sometimes a difficult concept for me. i spent years travelling and living in different countries where nobody knew a thing about me. it felt like freedom. i wouldn't trade what i have now, but there are days i miss being a stranger in a far away land."
i ache to wander. to return to the sea and the sky.
there is too much judgement and unkindnes in this world. sometimes it covers me in darkness. i will always choose hope and seek out the light.
"whenever people speak unkindly of another, my first thought is, they probably wouldn't hesitate to do the same about me."
sometimes i react when i should respond. i speak when i should consider my thoughts in silence. i try too hard or not at all. i am lost and then found again. i am flawed. i am human.
what is going on with twitter? all my notifications have disappeared and it's showing i'm only liking my own tweets! anyone else?
"words are beautiful, but it is actions that show love."
sometimes hope is the person who will sit with you in the darkness.
when you are preparing for growth there will be people who aren't ready to come with you.
so much of our pain is because we all speak different languages of love.
love has nothing to do with control or cages. nothing.
"i buried the past, but sometimes it is a ghost climbing out of its grave."
i stood beneath a starlit sky catching those that dared to fall. i filled my hands with precious light and cast it on your garden of shadows.
"the shadow forest, where flowers only bloom in the darkness."
love will never ask you to hide your light.
sadness is a picture you hang on the wall of a house that has been abandoned.
to see something in others we must have first known it ourselves.
"you have shown me the midnight of your heart, but i am not afraid. i only wish to be the stars that light the darkness."
love will never isolate you or try to control your narrative. it gives you hope and the courage to spread your wings.
some memories hold a darkness the light will never reach.
i built a bridge from my heart to yours. it is made of hope and light.
i promise to walk gently through your forest. i am in love with the beauty you hide there.
"love allows you the freedom to be your truest self. if you're hiding that person in the shadows, i hope you find someone who will always want you to stand in the light."
if they are constantly draining your energy maybe it's time to let them go.
i collected a pocketful of light to plant in your garden of shadows.
"you are a wildflower blooming deep within the forest. beautiful, alone and touched only by the wind."
a beautiful mess we are and together we will heal each other's broken pieces.
people who love you will never take advantage of your vulnerability or use your insecurity against you. they will protect the most fragile parts of you.
"love itself will not hurt us, but perhaps our perception of it will."
the forest is beautiful again. the leaves are dancing and all the butterflies have found their wings.
today i am a tiny boat lost in an ocean of darkness.
"it takes courage to love without a seatbelt, to love as if loss doesn't exist."
"you protect the most fragile parts of me, but still there are days i feel i could break."
the sweetest surrender is to drown in his ocean and still be able to breathe.
sometimes courage is to breathe when the weight of a thousand wars have moved their fight inside your chest.
your love is a shelter when my heart is full of storms.
when the demons come for you we will fight them with an army of love.
your love is the reason i'm no longer afraid of the dark.
"you are everywhere in my heart, at the end of my fingers, and under my eyelids when i dream."
i wish i could become a star so your darkness has light and you're not fighting this war alone.
when i touch your hands i can still hear echoes of all the people who let them go.
sometimes these old words remind me i'm in a much healthier space now.
"to the right heart, everything about you will feel like home."
to exist in a place where the only sound is your heartbeat and mine.
love isn't about sacrificing everything you are for another person. it wouldn't ask you to do that.
the way you love me softens my sea glass heart.
the memories that haunt me have strong bones and sharp knives.
home was always a stranger until we found it in each other.
sometimes you are alone and hope is the only thing that's still holding your hand.
when you love someone you protect their vulnerability as fiercely as your own.
"i can't make the darkness disappear, but i will stay with you until you're ready to touch the light again."
sometimes people don't need words. they need a hand to hold and eyes that long to understand their painful melodies.
Please consider donating to help our friends on the east coast of Canada affected by #HurricaneFiona   our friend @babybadwolf and many others have lost their homes üíî
i will hold your hands when they're empty and love you through your darkest storms.
you are an ache that never leaves me alone.
i am trying to love you quietly when really i want to scream.
"i held a light for you once, but it eventually burned my hands."
to be the stars that make your darkness beautiful.
to meet our own suffering with the same compassion we show others who are in pain.
i hope today you can meet yourself with love.
i hope today your courage is louder than your fear.
you exist everywhere i am. in the quiet corners of my mind and the steady rhythm of my heart.
&amp; some old friends i adore ‚ù§Ô∏è @wildflowers_jay @VVanGone @ShePlaysLoud @dullandwicked @RantingsOfaGirl @ItsAPerfectLife @mineisforever @fuwolfman @incharmuese @JwPrebich @VladaMars @christinastriga @sirensong1208 @babybadwolf @AreYouNobodyT00 @forlornskies @QueenofCups99 @mnm67
"from someone who studied it for six years, i'm almost certain psychology doesn't actually say that üòâ"
some lovely new people i've discovered @PoisonWineKiss @retrorayna @youjustroll @YourSomeone11 @fragrance_soul @cold_lil_heartt @morningstarrzz @DrShamwell @ThisHeartisLove thank you for your words ‚ù§Ô∏è
"don't listen to your fear, lie with me and listen to my love."
i will be hope when you have lost yours.
you are so much more than your story of survival.
"i can't change what others did to you, but i can love the scars they left on your heart."
your darkness is beautiful. i want to explore it as much as i do your light.
"sometimes our branches are fragile, but how long can we avoid dancing with the wind."
at some point your light has saved someone from their darkness. i hope you never underestimate your power.
to soften your edges with a forever kind of love.
"if forever exists, i want to spend it with you."
there are memories in these walls and they all have your eyes.
"from the ruins of your past, i will build you a cathedral."
why do you have to exist in a place i cannot reach with my hands.
i know your heart so intimately. it's how i'll find you in every lifetime.
hope was the only thing that kept a light in the darkness until the day your forest met mine.
to watch each day disappear with you. to hold you in the dying light.
i will always follow your light no matter how fragile it glows.
your heartbeat has echoed around this forest for centuries.
when we don't own the darkness that exists inside of us we project it onto others. facing our shadow self is difficult work but an essential path towards healing and emotional freedom.
to resist reality is to be in constant battle with it.
you are the love i undress my heart to and i am not afraid to show you the fragile landscapes of my mind.
the problem with 'protecting our peace at all costs' is that we avoid difficult scenarios instead of learning ways to cope during those times. avoidance can eventually turn into a very lonely place.
"like leaves to the forest floor. we dance together, fall together and get lost in the gentle winds."
you are the light at the end of the sadness.
my heart is the stranger that beats inside your chest.
if you are walking with darkness i will always share my light with you.
the past is a graveyard and i no longer bring it flowers.
i remember when you danced with demons. how beautiful it is to watch you dance with love.
to watch you peel back the layers and show me the beauty of your wildflower heart.
grief is the darkest midnight and you wonder if the sun will shine again.
your gentle hope softens the darkness and i can almost see the light again.
i want to escape this house. there is darkness in every room.
have you ever felt afraid to be happy? because as soon as you find your breath again another tragedy takes it away.
today my mind is a room with no exits. i walk these halls of darkness looking for a way to escape myself.
you listen to your mind when it tells you you're not worthy. i hope the voice is louder when it speaks to you with love.
i would be your shelter even when you are the storm.
"the heart wants to be held, but will crave freedom if your grip is too tight."
eventually fear will take everything and you are sitting in a room alone.
i am a map folded too many times. worn at the edges and hard to read.
sometimes we have to choose a path when more than one is calling.
if you love me you will also love the ghosts that haunt my starless skies.
"i will stand beside someone i love, even when their pain is trying to push me away."
some people are a language you are not meant to learn.
"when your eyes are heavy with memory, close them and dream with me."
i hope you forgive yourself today and that you're patient with your heart.
sometimes there is a fine line between setting a boundary and building a wall.
"i know you have held temporary hands, but i will never let go of yours."
to be brave when fear tells me i am small.
to be a wildflower blooming in your garden of sorrow.
your love wraps me in light and now i shine in the darkness.
"when you are lost, i hope you'll let me be your map."
there is light on the road ahead. it waits for your arrival.
the night and her painful melodies like ghosts haunting the sunlight.
the kind of darkness the light will never reach.
sometimes i find myself in darkness and there is not enough light to read this map.
"you hide your pain in the darkness, but love has never needed light to see."
"next time you get lost in the darkness, i will bring you a pocket full of stars."
this dance between the wind and the trees has always reminded me of you.
"hanging stars on the trees in your forest, because you said you're afraid of the dark."
when hope is a stranger i will help you find the light again.
a love that keeps you rooted and encourages you to spread your wings.
"of all the forests you could get lost in, i'm so happy that you chose mine."
i understand your quiet heart. it's a language i have always known.
"when the darkness echoes around you, i will help you remember the light."
"when you are sewn together with painful memories, i will unravel you and bury the darkness in a shallow grave."
every night i dream of your forest and wake with fallen leaves in my hair.
hope will not abandon you and neither will i.
the day disappears into a graveyard of fading light.
"the leaves in this forest, they only fall for you."
another day. another beautiful forest.
"i will help you fight your battle, but the only weapon i have is love."
i see you there in the darkness and i wish i could make you believe in your own light.
sometimes silence is like the darkness and we fill it with our worst fears.
love believes in you. especially when your light is small and your mind is filled with shadows.
i wish i could bring you the scent of this forest with its singing birds and silent trees.
"we are so used to pain, we often don't recognize love."
sometimes the scars hurt. they sing a song we don't want to remember.
"you are the forest i get lost in and just like the leaves, how softly i fall for you."
you are the light that captured these once vacant shadows.
the way we treat people leaves an echo.
"the light fades, but it never leaves us. i'll be yours until you can breathe again."
"the streets are dark, but i have never needed a map to find you."
beautiful things are fleeting and that is why we build sandcastles so close to the sea.
when your forest is dark i will ask the stars to dance for you.
some memories are the ache in your bones when it rains.
you can still be heavy with sadness even when surrounded by love.
folding paper stars to hang in your sky when the darkness comes.
sometimes i am burdened by a past i cannot change and a future i'm afraid of.
i dig graves but don't have the strength to bury my sadness.
i will only burn this bridge once i have crossed it to meet you.
Beautiful Canada ‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üá¶
you wander so gently through my mind. your soft footprints echoing like a dance of wind and leaves.
this sadness is a war and i find myself with no weapons to fight it.
peace is hidden deep inside of you. it waits for you to give it light and together you'll find your way.
"hope is so terribly fragile, but i will hold on and wait for you."
"i prefer the night hours, where memories stay hidden in the shadows."
sometimes there are no answers and we have to make peace with an apology that will never arrive.
nature is a powerful healer.
"if i am the rain, you are the clouds and i cannot fall without you."
"i hear you, even when your voice is small and the words are drowning in darkness."
"when your stage is a theatre of darkness, i will bring you an audience of stars."
somehow you are a beautiful memory of a place i've never seen.
sometimes fragile hope is all we have to wear.
to write the missing chapters of us. the delicate pages of a love that remembered.
sometimes i sit with the trees because they might be lonely too.
quite often those who think they are not worthy of love are the ones who feel it most deeply for others.
hope is stronger than everything. it has no limits and there isn't a place where it cannot exist.
"sometimes we bury hope, but we can still visit its grave."
to plant love inside your garden and dig tiny graves to bury the pain.
you are an endless poem your heart chose me to write.
"when the wind is strong and the leaves are falling, rest your delicate branches against the warmth of my sky."
to be the soil that nourishes your wildflower heart.
"i'll meet you in the dark hours. where the day fades, where our love will turn into light."
"if i am the trees, you are the wind and i cannot dance without you."
i hope we can stop choosing loneliness and allow ourselves to be loved.
"hope is more fragile in the dark. i wait for light to touch me, but there are days it doesn't arrive."
"and just like the stars, you make the darkness beautiful."
i can hear your voice in the wind. a delicate song of sorrow.
i collected a handful of stars. i will save them for your darkest nights.
i woke to the sound of rain and the familiar ache of missing you.
i dream of wings and to fly without falling.
when your tears are shadows i'll be a lantern to light your way.
you can breathe here with me as we wander through these clouds. this sky is filled with hope and mystery.
"if fear exists within the darkness, then maybe hope is how we're meant to find the light."
pain always walked with me until i stopped giving it a map.
a beautiful madness. this dance from your heart to mine.
"when you are silent, i'll be the words your heart longs to speak."
i hope that one day this pain is just an echo you struggle to remember.
maybe trust is to walk with you among the shadows and not be afraid of what the light reveals.
"courage is a light that exists within all of us. it may dim sometimes, but it will never go out."
"we are made of dark forests, of ancient light and both horizons are beautiful."
the night hours. a delicate dance with the shadows.
you are fragile because you see the world with your heart and that is what makes you beautiful.
sometimes the memories push through the dirt no matter how deep you dig the grave.
the child inside me hurts today. i'll take her hand and dream of a better tomorrow.
words give me hope when the darkness says there is none.
it's raining and i am drenched with the words you wished upon the clouds.
"i have wandered many paths, but none were home without you."
to be like leaves and fall without sadness because your heart knows it will bloom again.
"there are ships sailing to many ports, but not a single one goes to where life is not painful; nor is there a port of call where it is possible to forget. fernando pessoa."
i am a tiny echo tumbling along the walls of your heart.
in a dream you held a galaxy of stars. they were my shield against the darkness.
there is a place for you here in this forest of hope and light. i will sit with the trees and wait for you.
"your love is the path i found myself on and now that i'm here, i hope i never lose my way."
in the darkest part of the forest the shadow flowers bloom.
"i could not let go of your hand, even when the forest was dark and all the butterflies lost their wings."
"loving more will not empty you, but isolating yourself as a form of shelter will. this is a hard lesson to learn."
healing is a painful journey. remind yourself often that you are brave and courageous for working so hard to find peace.
"i hear your beautiful heart, even when it's too tired to speak."
you are a delicate echo. i see your soft footprints in this forest and every night i watch you dance with the fallen leaves.
"sometimes the night holds us, but hope is always there even when it dances alone."
i have lived in many places but none as beautiful as you.
if only we could shine a light on our beauty as much as we do our flaws.
love itself isn't complicated. it's that we all speak a different version of it.
"to plant hope inside your heart so when it beats, you will hear the song my love sings."
you're not hard to love. you were only made to feel that way by someone who didn't know how.
sometimes the first person you have to forgive is yourself.
"""remember your words can plant gardens or burn whole forests down."" gemma troy."
to fill your emptiness with hope and shine a light inside your sorrow.
there's an entire universe on the forest floor.
the history of our darkness. a delicate dance in the shadows.
i have light in my pocket. i saved it for when your mind is plagued with shadows.
some people are a map when you did not realize you were lost.
lost is also a place and i often find you there.
to be a place where you can both lose and find yourself.
"to find a language in yourself you had forgotten, because they loved you enough to help you remember."
"a worn map, an unknown path and you."
even your edges are soft. a delicate darkness dancing alone in the wind.
gathering all the light our hands can carry so we'll be ready when the darkness comes.
i sat alone in a vacant room fighting a war with my sadness.
"when you lose someone you love, the light returns but it is never the same."
"take me, to where the trees are tall and the mountains fall in love with the sky."
maybe the rain is there to teach us that falling is beautiful.
there are too many on this path. i search for the comfort of shadows.
hope is fragile but it will only break if we  stop believing it exists.
you are the hope that burns in the dark.
i kept a fire burning in the forest so you could find your way home to me.
your eyes are a beautiful prison that i do not wish to escape from.
at night my mind is loud and all the memories carry knives.
sometimes healing is like trying to cross an ocean in a boat that's made of paper.
detecting every little change in people's behavior (real or imagined) is exhausting.
"my hands are small, but i will carry your sadness for a while."
"hypervigilance is exhausting and with no pre trauma identity, i still search for the child i could have been."
"i dug a grave, but i could not bury my sadness."
i can't stop reading the stories in your eyes. there are centuries inside them you are too young to have lived.
i'll wait for you in this forest where the leaves dance and the wind speaks. i'll wait for you...
sometimes this path is silent and the shadows are not mine.
read my skin like a map and make the journey slow.
one day you meet someone and all the silences inside you turn into a song.
i am completely lost in your eyes and how they speak to me before you do.
i need to live by the ocean again. to sit in the dark and listen to its torment.
i can breathe here with you.
i'll share in all your happiness and love you harder when it rains.
the sky looks like your eyes today.
"the miles of nothingness, but you still know every word to the song my heart sings."
today just be the darkness. i have always been able to see you there.
"a graveyard filled with almosts, of the promises that never arrived."
"child of orphaned nights, of starless skies."
the night an orphan. the sky without stars.
we found a home where the trees grow wild and the paths do not carry a name.
your light is so soft but i can see it burn from oceans away.
all of the beauty we miss because we are not free of the pain that built walls around our hearts.
'you showed me love when i wasn't feeling it' kina - get you the moon
this path is so familiar. i hope it never ends.
"every night i fall in love with a chorus of darkness. the wind, the rain, and the gentle sound of your heart beating."
allow love. it will make you stronger than your wounds.
love people. especially when they think they don't deserve it.
the rain in this forest only falls for you.
"if you wander far enough through that forest, you will find me."
to walk with you until the light fades. to always take the long path home.
and all they needed was each other.
one day you meet someone and all the dying flowers in your chest bloom again.
it felt safe to flirt with hope again.
i've waited my whole life to miss you.
"i feel this so deeply, but i cannot give it a name."
"the past doesn't matter anymore, but i'm glad i met you there."
your heart is the softest song that i have always remembered the words to.
your heart is a gentle wind that spoke to me across oceans and time.
some old words
"you hide your heart, but those who are meant to see it anyway."
to enjoy someone without expectation or pressure. to not label one another as any particular thing. to be inspired and grateful to exist in their present moment. it's beautiful and i'm here for it.
you are a beautiful storm and i long to get caught in the rain.
last night you were the storm that fell in love with my window.
maybe we give pain a heartbeat because it reminds us we are alive.
i am drawn to your light and the pale blue sadness of your sky.
i lit a match and burned those walls i built to the ground.
still going! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"everyone has experienced hurt, but people don't heal the same. be patient with their hearts."
quietly in love with those who hear music in the sunrise and the darkest depths of night.
it's raining and i realize i am not afraid of falling.
please don't punish people with silence.
sometimes people are a beautiful mess and you cannot help but love them.
"some people leave and you can't quite remember their face, others are burned in your memory forever."
the trees wait for you and i.
"there is something so beautiful about being lost, about darkness, about sitting in the rain alone."
it's an incredibly beautiful day.
unfortunately it's easier to criticize people than it is to try and understand them.
"of all the forests i've become lost in, yours is where i hope to never be found."
sometimes we carry the pain because we don't recognize who we are without it.
the pain you no longer have the strength to carry.
"if you can't wish them peace, you can simply leave them alone."
there is peace in the realization that so many things are not my concern.
five years of loving you. five years of knowing without any doubt i am loved ‚ù§Ô∏è
for so long courage was hiding in a room i didn't have the key for.
to wear bravery like it isn't a stranger to your skin.
your memory of it will differ from theirs and each will be the truth for both of you.
to keep digging up the past and find nothing new in the wreckage.
i hope the endings you endure become a doorway to something better.
shine a light on the good in people and they will find it within themselves.
you lay your hands on me and light appears.
avoid those people who create chaos where there is none.
it is brave to swim when the sadness is pulling you under.
the doors i've closed and the memories i left behind them.
the lie they live. the truth they expect from others.
i miss old narrow streets and the ancient stories they tell.
"it has taken years of practice to only exist in the present moment, and it is the best education i've invested in."
i am in love with the language our hearts speak.
"i hope, but no longer depend on it. i've missed too much beauty focusing on distant paths i can't yet see."
"i prefer to be quiet, unseen."
horizons lost in the imagining.
wind and rain are beautiful hymns that the earth sings.
"hope is so quiet, tragedy so loud."
you are the light where there is none.
hope is fragile and we hold it with careful hands.
i still remember when i did not welcome the light.
"when i was a teenager i liked poetry and books instead of parties. i stayed home on friday nights to watch re-runs of anything narrated by david attenborough. although older now, i'm happy to say this has not changed."
the love i once felt for you is a stranger to me now.
it's because you love the sadness that sometimes lives in me.
to plant love in everyone you see.
perhaps you do not find peace until your narrative is transparent and truthful.
thank you beautiful earth.
time passes so peacefully when you are loved.
old sailboats and ghost shores.
"when you try to change someone, they will fight even harder to be who they truly are."
i have reached a place where words do not find me and the past is a journey i can't quite remember.
the tragedy that out stays a welcome it was never given.
when you're finally ready to meet yourself exactly where you are.
grief comes unannounced and does not know when to leave.
the answers are often in the last place you look.
i hope we can be brave for those who are suffering.
love is the key that fits every lock.
i need to do more reading by lamplight and walk barefoot on forest paths.
i love you when your rooms are empty. i love you when your heart is full.
time passes so peacefully these days. my eyes and heart are open.
over time the memories become silent. i am more than what you did to me.
when you leave the page empty because that's exactly how you feel.
some people are like a violent sea. they look so beautiful but will eventually drown you.
the darkness that follows you no matter how fast you run.
i spend hours with trees and i do not miss people.
the world looks so different when you are loved.
"sometimes pain is a long road without lights, but hope burns gently in the distance."
"people leave, but how they treated you remains."
to learn the art of vulnerability without being afraid.
the doors you walk past. the doors you dare to open.
the dark universe i climbed my way out of.
i love you when the seas are wild. i love you when the winds are calm.
It's because you saw the light i thought had gone out.
and one day i remembered i am more than words of sorrow.
cold and beautiful.
you've been gone for so long and yet grief is not a stranger.
i built this castle and i am in love with every room.
"you don't have to support poor decisions, even when they're made by people you love."
don't abandon what makes you different for the sake of fitting in.
i'm so proud of myself when i don't cancel plans. related: i'm not often proud of myself.
hope whispers while despair screams.
will you walk the rest of the way with me?
sometimes the ending is beautiful.
sometimes the people who love you pay the price for those that didn't.
"don't allow people to invalidate your experience with toxic positivity. sometimes life is incredibly hard, and that isn't negative, it's a reality."
sometimes i am still the child who found safety in the shadows.
i hope your self worth is no longer tied to what people think of you.
"it's not that you don't have patience, you have finally realized your worth."
some people only love you when you're burning.
sometimes we choose the same places to hide.
i found a way to be stronger than all of the things that broke me.
it hurts because you hold hands that have already let yours go.
it all makes sense here with you.
your love revealed a language i did not know i could speak.
sadness can hold you even when you're surrounded by love.
happiness was a place and i searched many empty cities before i found you.
the light fades earlier now.
sometimes i lose my way and you are always there holding out your hand.
love is the castle that only we have the key for.
the light is living inside of you. i hope you believe in its power.
"freedom is having nothing to say, because i have finally made peace with the stories inside of me."
avoidance didn't protect me and i wish i hadn't missed so much along the way.
all the things i have become because of love.
love is where i found the lost parts of me.
i love you more than i knew my heart had room for.
"if i knew setting boundaries would make me unpopular, i would have started working on them a long time ago!"
there's always something beautiful to see.
"people are fragile right now. if you can't touch gently, please walk away."
i don't feel lost when i'm with you.
"no matter where i am, i look for you."
stay wild love.
"you'll find me where the trees are tall, where the paths do not carry a name."
perspective.
i no longer have room for those who only come around when there's light.
it took me a long time to exist around people and still be someone i recognized.
stay close to what heals you.
you're beautiful just as you are.
sometimes you look back to find treasure that you missed the first time around.
i hope you find what you're not looking for. it is so often exactly what you need.
the daily battle to not live in the space where you hurt me.
i can breathe again.
we see what supports our narrative.
"there is often a story behind the silence, but i have learned to wait for the right people to hear it."
the realization that most opinions do not need to be shared.
i experienced the worst case scenario and now there are times it's hard not to imagine it.
"i miss your light, your wisdom and your truth."
"for me, this was not in the literal sense but in the space i allowed it to take up in my mind."
"if you want to heal, you can't live in the same house as the pain."
"the more i see, the quieter i become."
sometimes you just have to stop putting out other people's fires.
we take pieces from different puzzles and wonder why it doesn't fit.
i love you. i'll help you dig the past a grave.
sometimes you don't get answers and you have to find a way to make peace with that.
we see what validates our story.
"perhaps we are not afraid of silence, but rather what we think lives inside it."
"silence is a peaceful answer, because often being right is not worth the noise."
a light at the end of the sadness.
the light holds on even when you can only see darkness.
"there is freedom in the realization you may never understand why people do things, and that you don't need an explanation to move on."
what a beautiful story your eyes tell.
sometimes when people demand explanations it's because they are struggling to understand themselves.
you are at peace with anyone's perception of you once you have fallen in love with yourself.
energy tells the story and it is often quite different from the words.
when the house is haunted and you are the ghost.
"if you can't be nice, you can shut up instead."
sometimes you have to sit and wait for the light.
my history is a graveyard and i no longer bring it flowers.
"i am in a place i thought was impossible. surrounded by love, consistency and stability. i am in control of the energy i allow around me. i don't feel guilty about prioritizing my peace and i'm surrounded by people who don't require explanations. love is so warm and beautiful."
there's no need to walk quietly. people who love you don't view your existence as noise.
it's because you stand beside me when it rains.
"you're not difficult, you're finally putting yourself first."
the people who don't want to respect your boundaries will make you feel like you're unreasonable for having them.
"if it doesn't happen organically, i don't think i want it."
perhaps hope is to shine when there is no light.
the beauty of survival.
cold and beautiful.
the trouble with power is how some people choose to use it.
sometimes it is a weight when your soul is much older than the rest of you.
i hope you stop filling your hands with other people's chaos.
i didn't like my roots so i planted new trees.
"people reveal who they are eventually, so don't believe the first mask you see."
beware the subtle bully and the false guilt they try to impose.
fear stayed for so long because i didn't know who i was without it. i am finally learning how to bid it a gentle goodbye.
"fear, shame and guilt are all unreliable narrators."
past conditioning is a prison. i hope you find the strength to set yourself free.
"you're not too sensitive, you're awake."
but you're always looking through someone else's window.
i stopped hiding from those memories and they eventually lost their power.
the trees always find me.
some people will never hear you because they have not yet learned to silence their own noise.
"i love every part of you, even those i have yet to discover."
i'll be an open window when you feel like you can't breathe.
"pain is heavy. i can't take it away, but i will carry it for you."
please don't tell people they'll be more attractive if... (insert certain thing). this isn't helpful. people are beautiful at every stage of their journey. healing isn't a race. it's an individual path. there's no right way to walk it. there's only the way that works for you.
for the people who accept you for everything you are. who try to learn your language of sorrow.
"it's not hard to show a little kindness, even if that means leaving people alone."
this ledge is high and i do not have wings.
a map of all the feelings you couldn't name.
"if someone hurts your peace, don't give them access to it again."
for so long i allowed the trauma to define me. i was terrified of who i'd find once i started to heal. i let it happen and i love her.
sometimes you have to be careful that boundaries don't become walls.
"the past is a cold and lonely place, but sometimes i hold it to remember how far  i've come."
follow the trees home.
triggers are there to let you know the wound needs more love.
choices.
one day i'll learn how to bring you the sky without the rain.
to be like the rain and not hurt anyone while you're falling.
you become the wound you abandon.
sometimes you have to stop pouring light onto other people's shadows.
and still i seek quiet places.
i love you. thank you for sharing your fire.
we can respect the experience of another person by not comparing it to our own.
my heart hasn't broken since i met you.
"the quiet, the stillness, the fading light."
shame and guilt keep us attached to our trauma. i hope we can all find the courage to stop giving them a voice.
i have finally stopped running. i have reached a place where i am not afraid.
remember when i had nothing to give but hollow ribs and a paper heart that so easily burns?
i'm still learning the art of not absorbing other people's chaos.
fear only lasts for as long as we give it a voice.
i love you because you take my hand when it's empty.
"to seek only your own peace, and leave others to theirs."
the lessons only the trees can teach you.
there's beauty ahead. walk with me.
healing from complex trauma might look like this - i trust someone enough to allow myself vulnerability. (today anyway. it's okay if i have to try again tomorrow) - i didn't use ineffective coping mechanisms when faced with a stressful situation today.  that's growth right there.
the untangling of hard wired survival skills.
meet people where they are or let them walk alone.
it's because there is a quietness in you that not many people understand.
the love i resisted for so long would eventually save me.
hope.
"empathy is a choice, a way of life. empathetic people aren't interested in manipulating your emotions to serve their needs and empathy doesn't attack what it doesn't agree with."
"both empaths and narcissists are highly tuned to the emotions of other people. this is why the narcissist can initially appear attractive and exciting. if your emotional energy doesn't serve a purpose for them, they'll ignore it. if it does, they will manipulate it."
stay with those who are listening before you speak.
"a person was upset with me this week for not paying them enough attention. (we are not close). i'm over here working full time. i also own a business, have a boyfriend and teenagers in high school. i wish i had the time and energy to ignore people. wtf!"
thank you for loving me with such a patient heart.
"some memories become words, others i do not dare give voice to."
some shadows follow you looking to steal your light.
i have never liked crowds. i can't imagine following one.
i avoid people who feel like storms. at this point in my life i want to wander with the softest wind.
"there is a beautiful life waiting beyond the pain of trauma, but we have to be willing to open the door and allow it to come in."
"some people will try to revive an older version of you. they felt better about themselves when you were in a darker place. you don't have to go back, for anyone."
a love you can undress your heart to.
when you are both the city lights and the starless sky.
sometimes the light becomes buried beneath the shadows.
home is.
it took me a long time to build this castle and i only made one key.
i love these early mornings. for a while i can pretend nothing else exists.
the only cure i've found is to accept that it does. to make peace with it.
control is a concept we create in our minds. a coping mechanism for when life wanders too far outside our comfort zones.
i thought acceptance was a lack of control until i realized control is an illusion.
impermanence is everywhere. we hurt because we don't want to believe it exists.
"i collected all the light my hands could carry, and i want to share it with you."
"letting go involves a grieving process that many of us don't allow ourselves to experience, but if we don't, it can feel like they never left."
don't let so many people wash their hands in your light.
"aurora, i love you."
at peace.
"i don't know how, but i survived."
richer soil.
what lies beyond is beautiful.
a map of abandoned places.
some memories touch the softest part of the wound.
"internal work is difficult. the suffering caused by repeated patterns, even more so."
i don't create boundaries because i dislike people. i do it because i value my peace. it is critical to my survival.
i have become like the rain and leaves. i am not afraid of falling.
"the sea and her heartbeat, so similar to mine."
i hope the darkness is forgiving. i hope it doesn't stay.
"i listen to energy, not words."
our first date was exploring each other's book shelves.
"people say don't forget where you came from, but if that place was filled with abuse and trauma, it's quite okay if you don't want to remember."
healers.
the light follows you everywhere.
it's okay if you don't hear it at first. what's meant for you will continue to whisper.
empathy doesn't need to be announced. only practiced.
the mind eventually accepts what our hearts see.
you realize the heaviness when you finally let it go.
you know you have found peace when you are no longer irritated by insignificant things.
human behavior. a fascinating mystery.
i hope you're able to validate yourself and not rely on the opinions of other people.
the light. it waits for you.
i am wordless in your light.
"what is borrowed, is paid for eventually."
"i'm at peace with the things i've lost, because i now understand they were never meant to be mine."
i hope you're not afraid of uncertainty. i hope you see possibility instead.
don't change yourself to fit within walls you no longer recognize.
to be brave when fear tells me it's an impossible dream.
where the magic is.
strong reactions have never changed the outcome of the chaos i was facing. it took me a long time to choose a response instead.
listen to what people show you. it's often quite different to what they say.
when the ruin starts to look beautiful.
"i still wander, but now it's with purpose."
the beautiful quiet.
sadness has its own kind of silence. a room where it is hard to breathe.
"when you grow, there will be some people who can't come with you."
patiently rebuilding all that the past had taken away.
the wounds that reopen. the ones you are sure you had healed.
acceptance isn't passive. it is the doorway to change.
"sorrow too is a path, and i hope it doesn't take you long to walk it."
sometimes i still find myself anticipating people's moods. it's exhausting to the core of me.
i sensed what you were going to tell me before you had a chance to say the words.
it hurts because you love and that is just the way of things.
love has taught me that i don't always have to be brave.
this is what the sky told me.
"trauma survivors have intuition too. not everything is a response to past hurt. trust it, and don't let toxicity tell you otherwise."
the emotional work of other people is not your responsibility. read that again.
"it was a long road back from lost, but there was so much beauty along the way."
you don't need a reason to help someone. especially when it's yourself.
i'm not ready to say goodbye to your light.
i wish time had waited for you.
"sometimes love is to say, i don't understand what you're going through, but i won't let you burn alone."
i always wanted to be somewhere else until i met you.
to love because you are ready to share yourself and not because you fear being alone.
"if it echoes, perhaps there is something that we still need to learn."
when you start making boundaries you lose the people who had no intention of respecting them.
you're not lost. there are just places you haven't discovered yet.
hope is what keeps us going when we feel like the path has ended.
opening my heart to love closed the door to fear.
i thought vulnerability was a weakness until i met you.
"people: are you okay?  how i really feel: this is my regular hypervigilant state. i'm constantly assessing my surroundings for threats. i wish i'd never left the house. i don't feel safe and my anxiety is in overdrive.   my answer: yeah, i'm great and you?"
when you long for silence but cannot quiet your mind.
darkness is beautiful because you cannot see the horror.
where i can listen to myself.
i need a certain amount of ignorance to survive. i get tired from thinking so much.
"surviving life finally turned into living it, but sometimes i still catch myself watching for those shadows."
"if someone opens up to you, try not to discredit their experience by making it about your own."
trauma isn't a competition of who has the worst scars.
i no longer feel guilty for your choices.
i'd been in survival mode since i was 6 years old.
"letting go of the idea that certainty exists isn't doubt, it's freedom."
where you are right now doesn't have to be where you stay.
we can disagree and not hate one another because of it. pass it on.
a beautiful haunting.
hope can see in the dark.
"grief, i've learned is really love - jamie anderson."
fear itself can't actually hurt us. we give it power by listening to its lies.
we lived 20 minutes away from each other and had no idea. we stopped at the same coffee shop at different times almost every morning for 2 years. one day he was late for work. the rest is history ‚ù§Ô∏è
"i am going into my 4th year with a man i met quite by accident. a man i had met 10 years ago, but we were passing through life on different paths at that time. the fact that we're together today is definitely no accident. i love this story, it's the best one i don't write about."
"and now that you've found me, i never want to disappear again."
i didn't want to be found until i met you.
the light will always return.
we are flawed and full of contradiction.
"for all the endings i have suffered, i am never prepared when they arrive."
"grief doesn't end, it only changes and as a result of that, so do we."
"grief has taken a seat beside me. i want it to leave, but it has nowhere else to go."
the light touches everything since i met you.
the memories are quiet now. they no longer push through the dirt.
old haunts.
isolation is not the same as independence.
"i am exactly where i'm meant to be. my decisions and actions led me here. the beautiful part about travelling through life is this, if it doesn't feel right, i don't have to stay."
focus on one step at a time when the path ahead is overwhelming.
"when i watch nature unfold, i am reminded that control is an illusion."
you will not find healing in the people who gave you wounds.
"we create an idealized version of ourselves in the hope people will accept us, but it doesn't fit well and is a heavy burden to wear. let's take it off, and allow others see the beauty of our authentic self."
"every person we meet speaks and acts from their current level of awareness, ourselves included. there is no separation or superiority, only different levels of awakening."
"love doesn't hurt, but unmet expectations do."
"observe, don't absorb - ross rosenberg."
we need more open dialogue about emotional suffering. a place where people can speak without shame.
ancient teachers.
"i approve of myself as exactly as i am. i will not criticize my mistakes, but i will learn from them."
"new habits were like a foreign language, but i learned them until i didn't recognize the old ones."
healing is a door that's always open. walk through it when you're ready.
"people say don't let the past control you. as if it is easy. it isn't, it's a journey, and it doesn't happen overnight."
i hope you love who you are today.
when we stop judging ourselves we also show more kindness to others.
his gentleness makes me cry.
"attachment and expectation tie me to old and limiting beliefs. there is no growth in that, so i happily let them go."
"sometimes i think chaos into being. this doesn't help me. if i can't change a situation, i change my thoughts about it."
"i create my own reality through my thoughts, actions and reactions. when something isn't right, one of them needs to change."
the night and all its terror.
focusing on how we think other people should change is really just a resistance to the work we need to do on ourselves.
i hope you can accept yourself with kinder hands.
"attachments are like expectations. if we attach ourselves to the idea that happiness or love should equal a particular thing, we're disappointed when it doesn't happen."
the hardest part of a healing journey is the first steps. i believe in you.
"people need to breathe, change and grow. let them."
the door that doesn't close because we haven't yet learned the lesson behind it.
"you don't have to hold everyone together, only yourself."
compassion without words often speaks louder.
making yourself a priority doesn't deny others. it's okay to meet your own needs first.
time collapses around us. we catch memories as it falls.
"sometimes i still say yes when i mean no. a terrible sense of obligation, but to what i don't know."
the quiet is such a beautiful place. i listen to everything it has to say.
courage is whatever you want it to be. it's whatever action you take to be walking on the other side of fear.
sometimes courage is just deciding to get up and not give up.
today my courage was louder than my fear.
"you are brave for having no weapons, for walking away from wars."
it takes a lot of courage to undress your heart and show other people why it beats.
some people live in darkness for so long they become it.
some of my greatest accomplishments came from doing the things you said i couldn't.
for the ones who say it quietly.
the light i won't give away.
i see your hand. wait for me.
it's only a promise until people change their minds.
forgive yourself for accepting their behavior.
"many people struggle &amp; don't hurt others in the process. pain, trauma or circumstance is not an excuse to manipulate &amp; harm the emotional fragility of other people. it's okay to protect your energy. it's okay to create boundaries and erase these people from your life. it's okay."
"i still see the ghosts, but i won't walk with them anymore."
endings have a language and i don't regret those i have learned.
perhaps if we saw uncertainty as possibility it wouldn't be so difficult to accept.
the world is drowning and our boats are made of sand.
"a narcissist will isolate you for two reasons. one, as an attempt to gain control over you. two, because they fear your friends and family will start asking questions about this person who is monopolizing your time. their greatest fear is people seeing through the facade."
a narcissist will never tell you the truth. they will play the victim and make you feel like you're the one hurting them. they won't take an ounce of responsibility for their behaviors. they blame others and will do anything to keep up the appearance of their delusion.
the memories keep coming and you are tired from digging so many graves.
i stopped worrying about why people do things. it was a constant source of terror.
"no one can take your peace. you have to give it to them, and that is a hard lesson to learn."
"that child will always be a part of me, but i see her less as the years pass. my hope in talking so openly about this is to give others hope. sometimes it's all we have."
one thing i do know is that it does pass and i am me again. i accept the darker days without judging myself for having them. i don't stay in those shadows anymore. it's much more difficult to stay present and i have to work harder to do so but it does lift.
"when i feel this way, i accept the love and support of my boyfriend &amp; family, but everything inside me is screaming to be alone. i learned avoidance as a child as a way to cope. i wasn't safe around the people who were supposed to keep me from harm. alone felt like a safer place."
"those experiences are long in the past and in my wise mind, i know i am safe. trauma altered my threat perception. i spent years in a state of hypervigilance. even after all this time, the fear response can at times consume me."
"over the years i have learned how my trauma has impacted me and what might trigger me because of it. this time of year is difficult because of traumatic childhood experiences. i can be in a room full of warmth, with the people who truly love me, and still feel an emptiness."
equally beautiful and terrifying.
disconnected from everything but the shadows who haunt me.
life will always be complicated because we can all look at the same thing and see something different.
putting light in my pockets so i'll be ready when the darkness comes.
it didn't exist but i know i felt its darkness.
"sometimes i dream of you and when i wake, i can't remember which ghosts are real."
i dream of a strange planet where i am a child who is not afraid.
"the kind of darkness you know so well, you don't even try to give it light."
"each person is their own language. we don't have to learn it, and we don't have to judge because we don't know how to speak it."
"non attachment is not a lack of love and compassion. we are not distancing ourselves from people or things. we experience them exactly as they are, and without expectation. without inserting judgement or our conditioned beliefs."
"some things don't end, they just change, but it can feel like an ending and we suffer. making peace with impermanence can ease that suffering. we cannot stop change but we can accept that it will always exist."
"life has its own way of moving forward, but we are still attached to the idea that we can control it."
i hope someone shares their light with you today.
i hope fear is a language you have the courage to unlearn.
the nights we sat on the sand and could not separate the sky from the sea.
i remember when i was just a girl armed with words and a camera.
we are always preparing for something and in doing so we ignore the now.
"some days don't go how you want them to, but please don't give up on the person you're trying to become."
i hope you have the strength to walk away from those who disturb your peace.
the past doesn't weight as much as it used to.
"it's taken a long time, but my mind is finally a nice place to be."
"i may not get it right today, but you better believe i'll be back tomorrow."
you are not what they did to you.
normalize talking about really fucking difficult things.
i spent my whole life preparing for endings until i met you.
i left you behind and i also left the version of me who tolerated you. i'm so grateful i don't know either of you anymore.
i could not heal so i repeated the same tragedy.
i am light in unlimited space. i am.
sometimes i still feel like that frightened child.
"saying no doesn't mean you're a selfish person, it means you know what you can and can't tolerate in your life."
i don't compare myself to others anymore and i am glad there is no one else like me.
i broke and i love the person i rebuilt from the pieces.
when you realize the light never left.
i built a library of memories and sometimes i open the door.
rest in peace emma peel. what a legend.
you don't have to be anything but true to yourself.
"if you change your mind tomorrow, that's okay."
don't let anything define you unless you believe in it with your entire heart and soul.
"trauma doesn't build character. it broke me and tore it down. it changed my threat perception and ability to feel safe. the effects are life long and exhausting. trauma didn't make me who i am today, i did."
i hope you are a cloudless sky today.
simplifying my life has been the greatest gift to my emotional well being. i say no a lot more these days and i no longer feel guilty for putting myself first.
the bones more fragile at midnight.
a tree cannot escape and sometimes i wonder if it wishes those branches were wings.
please don't change your language so it's easier for someone else to learn.
i hope you find purpose. i hope you carry it like a flame when your path is filled with shadows.
solitude is beautiful. to be free of noise and expectation. to truly hear the song your heart sings.
i hope you find peace from your suffering today.
i'm still learning to accept love and to trust it as well.
"there's no real winner in a war, but there is growth when we try to understand."
stay close to those who can hear you when you're quiet.
perhaps maturity is when you start looking inward and stop blaming others.
"often when toxic individuals are caught they play the role of a victim. they may hide for a while, but will always come back to find new people to terrorize."
"today needs your undivided attention and so does tomorrow, but not until it arrives."
these views never get old.
i love you like i love the stars. i had to explore my own darkness to find you.
"i know you're gone. i place flowers on your grave, but still i wait for you."
a terrible fascination with darkness.
she talks to trees and he was the first person who thought that was beautiful.
boundaries help us with emotional safety. it's okay to set them. boundaries are only unreasonable to the people who want to disrespect and cross them.
hope is the light we believe in even when there is none.
we're not different. we share the same nothingness.
you listen to your mind when it tries to convince you of unworthiness. i hope the voice is louder when it speaks to you with love.
respect your pain enough to feel it.
we fall in love with things as if their existence were permanent.
"some people are not strangers, even when you meet them for the first time."
be mindful of the words you use with people. sometimes they wear them forever.
wanderings.
hello.
"if they demand that you follow their script, leave and write your own."
just us and the universe.
"fear still talks to me, but i've finally learned not to react."
i wish my fears didn't make me doubt you.
we resist because we are so attached to our beliefs. imagine a leaf falling from a tree and let go of what no longer serves you.
to let go of the idea that you can control everything is such a beautiful freedom.
"when we are attached to a specific belief or outcome, we will always be disappointed when life goes a different way."
"when reality isn't in line with our expectations, we suffer."
the more we resist uncertainty the more chaotic life becomes.
"avoidance was how i survived, but eventually the pain caught up with me."
i'll shine a light and wait for you.
yesterday has already disappeared and we know nothing yet about tomorrow.
to truly listen is a selfless act.
we focus too much on people and tomorrows we have yet to meet.
pain is an inevitable part of being human. i hope you do not carry it alone.
i have no expectations of this moment or the next. perhaps that is what makes them so beautiful.
we spend so much time focusing on tomorrow when the real power is in today.
i am many languages and you have learned all of them.
i am mostly able to manage consistency these days. except for when the memories haunt me.
discoveries.
i cant stop looking at your beauty.
the company of trees and each other.
i hope you have a quiet mind and a peaceful heart today.
there is a darkness in those memories that light cannot reach.
"thank you for learning my language, for loving me exactly as i am."
you don't have to explain your sadness. i'm not sure i understand the language of my own.
when we can't read people's silence we fill it with our worst fears.
we're all going somewhere.
i am no longer the person who tolerated you.
peace was to come face to face with everything i'd worked so hard to avoid.
"people will paint you in a light that suits them, because they have no idea how you actually shine."
i hope you live without shame today.
you don't need anyone's permission to be who you are. read that again.
sometimes silence reveals more about people than the words they use to tell their story.
"you built homes inside people, and abandoned them when they started opening doors."
i don't want to be rooted. i want to have wings.
wisdom is a quiet echo.
i don't want a map. i want to go heart first into the unknown.
"be patient with yourself, especially the shadows."
we continue to judge others while standing in the shadows of our own crimes.
"if people don't like your growth, do it without them."
all the abandoned things inside me found a home in the arms of your love.
you found me when no one else was looking. when i was lost and a stranger to myself.
we focus on complete recovery but perhaps it is better to take one moment at a time.
all the endings i suffered brought me to a better place.
i kept running to avoid your arrival.
eternal optimism is an unrealistic mindset. pain and loss are a natural part of the human experience. don't be afraid to explore difficult emotions to see what you can learn from them.
the inevitable reality of joy.
the inevitable reality of suffering.
"the consequence of your choices eventually catches up with you, no matter how fast you run."
sometimes all you need is the wind on your face and the company of trees.
loving people was easy for me but allowing myself the vulnerability to receive it was terrifying.
i hope your sky is clear today.
it takes courage to keep moving forward and most of the time we do it without a map.
"when you treat your emotions like an enemy, you will always be at war with your own mind."
"you don't need to understand people to love them and sometimes, the more you understand the less you love."
"my father had a long list of weapons, and he used all of them."
i slowly unlearned the language of who i was until i'd forgotten how to speak it.
sometimes i sit alone with your memories. i want to leave but i don't.
we speak the same language of sorrow.
"the universe can hear you, even when you have no voice."
when we deny our emotions we invalidate them too.
i hope you don't doubt your resilience today.
you're not weak. you were never taught how to be strong.
i hope you find your voice today. i hope you have the strength to use it.
the night and its hollow bones.
when memories become the ghost that haunts you.
i don't chase people anymore. only sunsets and light.
i hope your eyes are patient with the world today.
everyone spells happiness differently.
each person looks through a different lens. even what is similar is not the same.
i stopped judging my emotions and started listening to what they were trying to tell me.
"i existed in the darkest of shadows waiting for someone to bring me light. no one came, and i realized everything i needed was inside of me."
i used to fill time. now i live.
"i was never good at being the version others expected of me, even when i had no sense of self to hold onto."
we are not taught to validate our emotions so we look to others to do it for us.
i eliminated the word 'should' a long time ago. it fuels self judgement and pain.
"hello, i hope you don't judge your emotions today."
"when talking with someone who cannot wait to speak, you know you have not been heard."
i buried the person i was and i do not visit her grave.
don't be afraid to walk away from the noise.
watching the day disappear.
"if you're wondering who you are, let go of the person you think you should be."
people will grieve a version of you that no longer exists.
i'm so in love with your arrival.
accepting your limitations is not the same as giving up. read that again.
all the time lost to building walls. all the beauty we missed outside of them.
when you realize you've been waiting for yourself all along.
"time doesn't change anything, it reveals who we are."
please don't change your shape just to fit inside a box someone else has made for you.
"i wish you could unlearn the idea that in order to love someone, you have to sacrifice yourself."
"if you hold something too tightly it will break, and this is also the same for people."
"when we allow others the complete freedom to be themselves, we are practicing detachment. we have let go of expectation and conditioned ideas of how people should behave. this is the most sincere and pure form of love."
courage is often quiet and unannounced.
i stopped listening to fear because it lies.
"when you first find your voice it may sound like a stranger, but please, keep talking."
i hope you validate yourself today. i hope you realize the only approval you need is your own.
acceptance saved my life.
"the truth doesn't change, no matter what you think of it."
there is a person who is reaching out to my friends telling them i have mens all over this app. i told my boyfriend of three years (who i just built a house with) and we laughed and laughed and laughed. find something better to do with your time you sad little person!
peace is somewhere on the road ahead. it waits for your arrival.
"if i could, i'd fill your emptiness with hope."
"i don't have what you want from me, it belongs to someone else."
i hope you don't suffer alone today.
you cannot eliminate uncertainty and the resistance to it is why we suffer.
"take the light, it belongs to you."
i'm no longer in love with sadness.
the wind is softer since i met you.
i hope you don't build too many. emotional defenses keep us safe but they also trap us. we have to allow ourselves vulnerability to let love in.
walls keep the light out and the fear in.
i hope you sleep without terror.
"hello, i hope you don't suffer quietly today."
surreal scenes from a child's toy box. artist xue wang.
"if the fire goes out, light it again."
your history is a faded map and you are glad you don't remember.
people will have entire conversations without you and then judge you based on what they said.
"it's okay if you don't know the way, i'll hold your hand."
i truly believe we are in each place for a reason. i hope it doesn't take long to find yours.
we suffer because we pursue answers that don't exist.
the bones of old memories pushing through the dirt.
"to find true happiness, we must detach ourselves from the learned ideas about what it actually is."
"hello, i hope you are patient with your heart today."
maybe being lost is simply part of the journey.
i cannot stop reading the history in your eyes.
i stayed lost because it was full of beautiful places.
"i'd woken up early, and i took a long time getting ready to exist. fernando pessoa."
"it's okay if you're sad, but i hope you don't stay there."
"it's okay to be a constantly evolving person, it's also okay if others don't understand it."
i hope the war inside you is quiet today.
most battles are not worth the peace they take from you.
it takes courage to use your voice and also to learn when not to.
if you can't find your voice right now i hope you find comfort in mine.
"self care doesn't mean selfish, but sometimes that's necessary too."
and also close it.
courage is whatever it takes for you to open the door.
"when you are made of light, the darkness will never truly own you."
fear will always exist. i hope i'll be brave enough to not let it stop me.
courage is many things and different for everyone.
perhaps bravery is to recognize when fear is a liar.
"if you don't believe in failure, it is impossible to fear it."
"with you, someday has become everyday."
sometimes silence is the only answer you need to give.
loving you is the best part of every day.
i am learning to experience fear and not be intimidated by it.
"the echo, the stillness, the graveyard of buried light."
we own nothing. even feelings are temporary.
part of becoming your truest self is realizing that you have to allow others the complete freedom to do the same.
"we are taught that burning bridges is a bad thing, but some people truly don't deserve to walk across yours."
"hello, i hope you forgive yourself today."
sometimes the path is a ledge. perhaps courage is to not look down.
the ancient light inside of you.
"the cliff, the lighthouse, the sinking ship."
for everything i thought i needed and didn't get. thank you.
tiny kingdoms built upon sand.
"in becoming our most authentic self, we have to let go of our ideas and judgements about life. that it should be a certain way in order to be happy."
i want to hold your hand forever.
medicine lake.
athabasca river.
"when a wound is triggered, the sleeping horror is awake again."
quiet your ego and listen to your intuitive voice.
some people are not quiet enough to listen.
"there is so much wisdom in the quiet, in the soft winds, in the gently falling leaves."
my focus was always other people because i wanted to avoid myself.
i chose you because i cannot explain your beauty.
"unhappiness is the need for things to be a certain way, but they rarely are. freedom then, is to welcome the unknown."
old tree bones dancing alone with the wind.
old tree bones and a night that does not stay.
"don't be afraid to let go of anything that doesn't help you grow, and that also includes people."
i travelled many forests before finding the one that welcomed my roots.
no is a powerful word and you have every right to use it.
lake water.
"listening to the rain, i learn about the beauty of falling."
"when we try to 'fix' or rescue someone, we are talking responsibility for their behaviors. this denies them the experience of dealing with consequence. allowing people to be completely accountable for themselves may be difficult, but it is truly the path to growth."
i haven't met you yet but somehow i always miss you.
"sometimes i wonder if trees are sad, standing out there alone in the wind."
heal responsibly.
"if what you do to survive hurts other people, maybe it's time to apologize and change."
"child of silent wars, of hidden sorrow."
"if sadness is a path, i hope yours is filled with flowers."
"i realized i wasn't afraid of the shadows, it's what i imagined hid amongst them. that's what fear does."
you are the light when i return from that heavy place.
this reaction is a form of manipulation.
i'm uncomfortable with unwarranted affection from people i barely know. i'm even more uncomfortable with the resulting passive aggressive behavior when the adoration isn't returned.
please don't change just to make someone else comfortable.
"if someone is angry with you for setting a boundary, peacefully stand your ground. don't change it to suit them. you are the one who must exist in the reality you create. do what is right for you."
"to be happy with who we are, we must first accept who that is."
"our minds can dispute what our eyes see, and sometimes we believe it."
the dialogue between you and your fear.
your inner dialogue has to be louder than your ego.
the predictable hostility when things don't go their way.
change is an action and it starts in our minds.
this. now more than ever.
i have not lived enough years to have all these memories floating like ghosts inside of me.
"the quiet does not explain itself to the noise, and the light does not ache to understand the darkness."
"if you have to teach them to hear you, they are not meant to listen."
the tree that does not realize it has fallen.
sometimes you have to cross the fallen trees.
stitching up wounds and the only tool you have is love.
to write of sadness when it no longer lives in your bones.
when the escape becomes the thing that traps you.
i found a love that exists on no map.
childlike.
the only thing people who have never spoken to you are an authority on is their own bullshit.
growth can scare people. they grieve the strength they felt around you when your pieces were broken.
when you don't need words.
the wind carried the ghosts in.
a rusted lock you will never find the key for.
"trauma is the ghost that haunts me, even during my happiest times."
"the beauty of a falling leaf, its graveyard the forest floor."
where we go to escape the noise.
"when the shadows are long, he holds my hand."
"if fear is darkness, then hope is how we find the light."
nowhere is also a place.
"mountains, lakes and each other."
"let everything happen to you, beauty and terror. just keep going. no feeling is final. rainer maria rilke."
"it's okay to say no, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to set boundaries, it's okay to pursue whatever your heart truly needs."
"the death inside of you, even when you're breathing."
the death inside you as you breathe.
we can't stop exploring.
today's path.
tonight's view.
when i was young i watered your grave. i thought it might bring you back to life.
quiet afternoons with the water.
every night we wander into the beautiful unknown.
sometimes i pray for ignorance because what i've learned about human behavior haunts me.

judgement is only given life if you believe in it.
bravery is whatever it takes to get to the other side.
i no longer revisit what was done to me. i will not give that terror a voice.
"in this love, i have learned to be my most authentic self. i can't pretend and he doesn't want me to. until now, this is a freedom i had never known."
"i am a shadow‚Äôs shade, a lunatic perhaps, of two dark moons. marina tsvetaeva."
the madness hummed. like a song i couldn't forget the words to.
i am the sea you try to hold in your arms.
"some of my bones are still hollow, and i'm not sure the light will ever reach them."
"when your experience of love is from an abusive and unhealthy childhood, it can be difficult to accept the real thing. it takes time to recognize what love actually is, even when your life has been filled with everything it isn't."
some people will be uncomfortable with your growth because it reminds them they're standing still.
i've grown. that's why you don't recognize me anymore.
"the places you go, to forget the places you have been."
i'd forgotten about the love inside me until you took my hand and helped me remember.
nature. explore once daily.
boreal forest.
there is a quiet in the forest that no noise can disturb.
so many things are not worth our worry. i've learned this with age and the long journey of discovering who i am and what works for me. i hope everyone finds this place of peace.
there is no right or wrong way to heal. there is only the way that works for you.
magic happened here today.
a beautiful night with my love.
"running nowhere, and you don't have a map."
we are drawn to people who have fought the same wars.
we choose and create a consequence of either joy or sorrow.
the truth as you perceive it.
i left pieces of myself in these places. i also became them.
love will never ask you to sacrifice your independence. it does not want you to be defined by someone else.
looking for fulfilment outside of yourself will always turn up empty.
all of the things that don't arrive because you are searching for richer soil.
it's raining and the night is falling quietly to the ground.
"you remind me of old forests, of all the times i sat alone in the rain."
the things worn by the touch of too many hands.
don't project a gentler personality on someone because you fear being alone. don't elevate a person who only wants to bring you down.
"the edges of memory, not sharp anymore."
"your heart, so soft and aged with sorrow."
i exist quietly. you heard me anyway.
"i was a different person when i accepted your behavior as friendship, but i am no longer that girl."
there is nothing broken about what you had to survive.
"sometimes when we are afraid of what we feel, we make that part of ourselves a stranger."
"sometimes love comes to you in a shape you do not recognize, or a name you have not spoken in years."
"i am drawn to the forgotten, to all the things we leave behind."
leave it beautiful by not giving it a name.
the journey the rain takes before it finds the ground.
"the fragile bones of a cemetery, of the stories they can no longer tell."
"the sea at night, clinging to ghost shores."
people's expectations of you are about their own needs. you are not obligated to live up to anyone else's ideal.
remove yourself from other people's outcomes.
"there is a quietness to you, like you haven't used your voice in a very long time."
"your progress will not suit everyone, but keep moving anyway."
i hope you don't sentence yourself to a life of painful memories.
"we'll be here again, and that comforts me."
i made this happiness with my own hands.
i remember a time where i believed acceptance equalled defeat. it is anything but. it is powerful and beautiful. it is growth.
an important part of healing is to unlearn traditional ideas of happiness.
"and this disease has turned an already busy environment into chaos. we are working our bums off to make sure no one is forgotten, that no one falls through the cracks because that happens all too often with mental health, but i won't let it. i truly hope you're all safe and well."
i miss reading you all. i miss having the time for creativity. everyday there are more people who need help. mental illness doesn't stop for covid 19 and we have to be there to help them. it's hard enough to find people placements and the help they need on a regular basis.
"love, courage and hope are all heroic acts."
such strange winds surround us.
perhaps despair is hope not yet realized.
suffering lives in the space between how we hope things could be and how they actually are.
i haven't needed external validation since i learned to love my own.
"when you understand that love does not include guilt, judgement or shame, you will not accept these burdens from anyone."
i listen to people talk about their dark places. i give them hope that there is light.
i have removed myself from anything that made me feel confined.
"people are comforted by the idea of karma, but it doesn't exist. the universe delivers love, not vengeance."
the way you treat people leaves an echo.
you can love people and not tolerate their behavior.
"no one will save you, from the monotony, the horror."
disappointment is to focus on how you hoped things could be instead of how they actually are.
"the universe will always give you clues, but sometimes she whispers quietly."
"you don't have to subscribe to any bullshit theory about healing, only the one that works for you."
worrying about what others are doing and why takes up so much energy. energy you could be using to nurture your own trees.
"off to the place where all is forgiven. alberta artist, catherine mcmillan."
trans allegheny lunatic asylum. west virginia. photographer unknown.
i have fallen in love with everything that sets me apart.
"sometimes i still look for shadows, and all i see is your light."
rebuilt from ruin.
i like people who are unconventional. who are rebellious against societal norms.
"things are falling, and they are landing in all the right places."
i'm not empty enough to be there.
baby can we disappear...   alina libkind - radars.
"allow people to be who they are. if it doesn't suit you, perhaps you are not meant to walk with them."
to be lost in the night. in its beautiful mystery of nothingness.
"my heart, wild with the freedom of love."
there is a beautiful quietness in the way you exist. for an audience of no one.
maligne canyon. jasper national park.
i need trees and mountain air.
"your burden. your beautiful tragedy, to feel so much."
what you tolerate will always find you.
"i won't feed your ego and when you wake up, you'll be grateful for it."
"your love, and the gentle collapse of all my fears."
the gentle devastation of his hands.
the realization that it is you who decides your worth.
i wonder if when the leaves are young they know they'll eventually fall.
"i'll keep reminding you to sing, because you're too beautiful not to be heard."
i have abandoned the past. at least all of the parts that hurt me.
we suffer from the remembering. to forget is a cemetery for the pain.
pay attention without using your eyes.
i have found that a good place is wherever you are.
i am a stranger to you now that i have found my voice.
i stopped needing people to accept me once i learned to fully accept myself.
i do not run from silence. i am not afraid of what's inside.
a beautiful day off.
sometimes enlightenment means moving on from those who choose to keep living in the dark.
"perhaps you are meant to grow where you are planted, instead of constantly searching for a place with richer soil."
the real power is in every choice you make. it's in how you choose to respond.
"2.5 years ago i fell into the deepest, most beautiful love. a love i had only imagined but never experienced. a love that has supported and believed in me. a love that stops at nothing to help me grow."
i didn't change. i just realized my self worth.
you are allowed to change your mind.
everyone's truth is different. stop judging and allow people the freedom to tell it.
perhaps you don't fit because you have outgrown the walls that surround you.
there is just so much i no longer have time for.
"sometimes fear keeps you safe, and other times it lies."
you will always be unhappy when you ask love to be more than it is.
you can impress nature by leaving her alone.
because beautiful things leave wounds.
hope was a church where no one worshipped.
generational crimes.
"i could have continued your story, but i wrote my way to a better ending."
perhaps freedom is when you can read the pain out loud.
"needing self care is not a sign of defeat, and putting yourself first does not mean you're not capable of deeply caring for others."
i took my childhood back from you by finding the meaning of true love.
looked at you and saw all the days that are left.
you may just find freedom in all the things you resist.
wandering
i finally learned to hold love tightly and still let it breathe.
stop telling people they're doing it wrong.
i remember when i needed to be here. now i look for reasons to stay.
"with you, i finally understand the difference between staying because i want to versus staying because i'm too afraid to leave."
perhaps you are not at peace when you are so disturbed by other people's noise.
"forgiveness is a completely different experience for people with complex ptsd. sometimes they never get there, but are still able to heal."
"i am no longer afraid, and sometimes i don't know what to do with this new power."
i am so in love with everything about you.
the dust doesn't always settle. sometimes it hangs in the air and chokes your lungs.
i'm sorry. the weight of your decisions does not fit inside my hands.
"sometimes i hardly recognize myself, but i love the stranger i've become."
"good morning, i hope you find freedom from shame today."
"if you see something pretty, leave it to become beautiful. it doesn't belong in a house or pressed between the pages of a book. leave with the healing clarity the forest gifts you, but not her possessions. leave your grateful energy, and always leave her just as you found her."
"when i go to the forest, i dig my hands in the dirt. i wash them clean in the ice cold river and lie with the roots of a tree, but i take nothing with me. nothing there belongs to me, belongs to us. nature thrives untouched and left alone."
"saying yes to keep the peace is to disrespect your own boundaries. no is an answer, and you are not unkind for finding that voice."
limitations only hold you back if you believe that they exist.
the orchestra hiding in your lungs. let it sing.
"trees lose their leaves, but it is not with sadness. we can learn so much from them about letting things go."
my past was painful. i worked hard so the rest doesn't have to be.
you are necessary.
love became a completely different experience once i learned to be whole alone.
i have sat with these questions until i no longer cared about the answers but every so often i feel vulnerable and ask myself why.
"the worst pain i've felt is that of my children. when they hurt, i would do anything to take it away, and it makes me question over again why my father was so horrible to me."
i took control of my own recovery. i started the difficult journey from victim to survivor. no one would take my power from me again.
"as a child, when faced with thoughts that were too difficult for my conscious mind to process, i created a paracosm. it was a magical forest, and it saved me."
"existing at a higher frequency does not make you superior to anyone else. if you have found this freedom, help others to get there."
not everyone will like your song. sing it louder.
"don't argue to change their mind, speak and help them understand."
"if you've made friends here, written a book, sold your art, or simply used this platform to express your pain and suffering, i applaud you. healing is completely personal and the good work can begin anywhere."
i'll talk to the person everyone else ignores. their story interests me much more than that of a crowd.
"when your mind is truly open, you seek understanding. there is no desire to battle people over whose opinion is right or wrong."
"when you find yourself judging someone, perhaps you have triggered the unresolved conflict that lives inside of you."
"the forest floor, a quiet cemetery for everything fallen."
"when people talk incessantly about their successes and look to you for a similar response. i'm like, hey i'm good, i have nothing to prove to you."
when you realize love isn't about words at all.
those days i spent in the nothingness. i always knew you were there.
remember when i had nothing to give but hollow ribs and a paper heart that so easily burns? i don't recognize that person anymore. i don't miss her either.
working in healthcare is great because no one thinks you're weird for wanting to do a training rotation in the morgue. thanks so much.
the stories behind old doors.
he looks at me like the only thing in the world that matters is what i'll say next.
hello. eventually drug resistant bacteria will wipe out humanity. this is not a test.
the most alive i have ever been.
i admire people who forgive evil. i stay clear of those who continue to walk with it.
forgiveness doesn't include silencing your voice. forgiveness doesn't ask you to stay quiet.
"when we're honest about who we are, compatibility in any relationship type is much more likely. but we are conditioned to hold parts of ourselves back. again, we fear judgement and isolation from 'acceptable societal norms'."
"we find people exhausting because we wear masks around them. we engage in acceptable societal behaviors. perhaps not showing our true selves for fear of judgement or disapproval. people can definitely be exhausting, but so is the constant need for acceptance &amp; validation."
"when you can be your absolute authentic self around someone, you won't crave time away from them."
hypervigilance was a survival skill and sometimes i am a stranger without it.
and all of a sudden it's -18 üò©
freedom came when i stopped examining my own mind.
little towns along the way.
"your space is sacred, and it's okay to be completely selfish about who or what you allow into it."
"the beautiful quiet, and each other."
"the mind is infinite, but we allow ourselves to ruminate the same toxic thoughts. to change is completely within our power. to remain in this prison, or set ourselves free."
i've thrown so much into the fire and there is nothing i want to salvage.
coven of one. stephen mackey.
"the asylum will always live in us, and we, in each other."
"i have nothing to say and everything to live. forgive me, but i have waited so long to get here."
"""my brain is only a receiver, in the universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. i have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists."" nikola tesla."
hello.
i used to dream. now i create.
"i view most people with a quiet indifference, and this is a truth that's saved me."
terribly beautiful things have a darkness about them. i believe it is called impermanence.
i love you.
the madness eventually leaves. like the last act of a terribly written tragedy.
sometimes i exist so quietly. like a soft light carried along by the wind.
live life. it is too exhausting to constantly examine the meaning of it.
the most integral part of a tree is buried beneath the ground.
good morning beautiful.
people will take your silence and fill it with their own terror.
"sometimes i don't understand the energy i feel, but it always makes sense eventually."
"a room made of echos, and every once in a while, it's healing to open the door."
sadness was a room without windows. growth was to realize the light is not outside of me.
where are you on the scale from altruism to psychopathy.
you can act from a place of pain without hurting other people.
some will manipulate until their ego is gratified and your self worth has disappeared.
"i love you so much. it hurts in the most beautiful way. your belief in everything i say and do. your support while i finished my degree. your laugh, your hands and handsome face. i am better because of your love."
"of all the things that captured me, the only one who holds my attention is you."
expectations will always get in your way.
"i like being alone. i have control over my own shit. therefore, in order to win me over, your presence has to feel better than my solitude. you're not competing with another person, you are competing with my comfort zones. horacio jones."
"and please remember, everything you read or hear is based on someone else's experience and how they perceived that experience. you don't have to agree or align with anything that doesn't fit with your journey."
"you can be in a loving relationship and be completely self sufficient. being there for one another doesn't include giving up parts of yourself or your inner power. love is beautiful and never perfect, but anything that strips you down and ruins you is not love."
try not to associate self love with someone else being able to love you. your journey toward peace and inner power is internal and ongoing whether you have a life partner or not.
"we don't self love to have a relationship. we work on it because it is good for us. for our well being, for the internal peace we seek. relationships are external. if we are blessed with one, it's a beautiful thing, but it doesn't change our personal path to peace and self love."
"having someone love you and loving yourself are two completely different things. loving yourself is a life long journey that you take regardless of relationships or surroundings. every person is worthy of love, even when they don't love themselves."
returning to situations that hurt us is a choice. you cannot go back to a toxic environment and expect healing to be successful. those two things can't happen simultaneously. your inner voice and physical response will keep reminding you it's time to go until you're ready.
far from the city streets where the night has a quiet echo.
self centred people find it difficult to understand that others have their own lives. they only see the world according to their need of you.
habitual thoughts become your reality. habitual thoughts become your reality. habitual thoughts become your reality. habitual thoughts become your reality.
always honor your body's physical reaction to the energy surrounding a person or situation. its voice is trying to protect you.
"sometimes the noise comes back, but i don't listen. it has nothing new to say."
500 kilometres north of civilization.
"an abandoned cemetery, where the gate has a rusted latch. there is a fallen tree, and she grows toward the light."
it was so emotional to see him perform the songs that literally saved my life as a teenager üñ§
"if we do not acknowledge the trauma, the child will grow and still be wounded."
the war is rarely worth the wound.
the past is a faceless echo and we remember it differently every time.
sometimes people wander because they ache to disappear.
grief is a frightful darkness. no stars burn there.
even gentleness wounds.
you are a stranger again. you do not know this city or this life you have a key for.
i do not take the worn path. there are many at its destination.
"like the sea and the sky, we cannot look away. this love is ancient and unending."
the passing of time and all of its sickening crimes is making me sad again but don't forget the songs that made you cry and the songs that saved your life steven morrissey / johnny marr
"sweetness, sweetness, i was only joking when i said by rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed and now i know how Joan of Arc felt now i know how Joan of Arc felt as the flames rose to her roman nose and her walkman started to melt steven morrissey / johnny marr"
"lately when i touch people, i sense either light or shadows crawling up my skin."
sometimes i return to the hollow to remind myself how i filled it with love.
all of me unmasked because i no longer fear this skin.
hate wants your attention. don't give it that power.
i live simply. detached from the heavy weight of thought.
the clarity after it rains.
"you only exist when others breathe life into you, and that is no existence at all."
i am no longer a slave to the fears my own fragile mind created.
this place of beauty.
yesterday is a corpse trying to dig itself out of the grave.
i see october is making the other months jealous.
a poorly translated perception.
"i wrote of sadness in another life, and i do not know the stranger in those words."
the silent acceptance of a tree that her leaves will disappear.
perhaps we are most wounded by the wars we did not fight.
"if you are a city, it is one abandoned long ago."
authentic love will never silence you. it will only encourage you to have a louder voice.
i hope you're ready for october.
today we wander.
i no longer listen to fear. it bores me.
the same tired words filled with rot and sorrow.
i am soft but no longer fragile.
"how soft the earth, when you no longer feel the need to fall."
"all of the things we miss, because we think we need light to see."
the light that beckons. i'd rather not give it a name.
"beyond the mist, it's beautiful."
you cannot know the sea. she goes on without you. watching you drown as you try to catch her waves.
the words came from an empty place and i do not live there anymore.
"like love, listening is an act."
memories worn at the edges. i can't find that sadness anymore.
"i was 17 when a psychiatrist told me i had ptsd. 17, and already more tragedy than my mind could handle."
"for the first time in my life i know what it is to love. to never tire of his voice or the history on his face. to only want more of everything he is. to ache for it, and to know, we are reading the same page, the same line, the same word."
"the blue of your eyes, made from light and distant sorrow."
"and even when she walks through fire, he doesn't let go of her hand."
"hello life, i love you"
peace is not outside of you. it starts in your own mind.
for so long i survived. now i live.
"i had no concept of what good parents were, but i managed to became one. i love their heartbeats more than anything. change is powerful, and entirely possible if you want it bad enough."
"changing my thought process about what love is and my own self worth has been a long and difficult journey. having happy and healthy children is my biggest achievement in life. my relationship, studies and career are all more beautiful because of that."
"i learned self sufficiency through poor coping mechanisms as an abused child. i had to in order to survive. those mechanisms served me through my childhood but were very unhealthy. as i journeyed through early adulthood, i realized just how broken they were."
"a person's behavior is often a reflection of their internal struggle. it's okay to offer help, it's okay to set boundaries too."
"when you realize it is the ego you're competing against and not other people, you free yourself from that cage."
i miss alice and the glass lake. what's your paracosm?
i am in love with the evolution of me.
"if it shows up, open your hand."
breathing the mountain air.
i am an evolving narrative. slowly unlearning all of the stories i used to be.
"my boyfriend is tall with a deep voice and a full head of salt and pepper hair. his mouth is full of wisdom and love. his hands hold no old memories, only us, and this peace we've created."
it happens because you create it.
i do not search for regret. i cannot remember its name.
a magical exchange you and i.
the strength of those who don't lose their way in the dark.
"i respect sadness, because even though it does not plague me, i once lived there for so long."
"deep in the burial vaults of unfathomable sadness to which fate has already consigned me, into which no rosy cheerful beam ever enters and in which, alone with that surly landlady, the night. the shadows. charles baudelaire."
life is too beautiful to slow down.
a different person emerges from the grief.
"when we judge others, we reveal a part of ourselves that is still in pain."
you are infinitely connected to the universe and it wouldn't be the same without you.
from ignorance to wisdom. a journey with no end.
some energies are put in front of you as a reminder to not repeat the past.
we keep finding beautiful places to grow our love.
"no one's thoughts are wrong. people express their reality as they perceive it. we don't have to agree or even like it, and we don't have to be critical either."
always wandering.
"the empty spaces are now filled with love, and i can no longer find the person i used to be."
"if you write people off because they make mistakes, you will find yourself in a very empty room."
detachment doesn't mean you're disconnected. it means you have released the need to know what happens next.
i believe in everyone. in their ability to change. to find peace and a place of happiness. i sometimes wonder what the world would be like if we all did.
i cannot be caged in someone else's loneliness.
"there is so much to love, and i want to touch it all with you."

sweet baby.
i will see your mountains. there will be no distance between our hands.
i no longer have space for anything that doesn't move me forward.
reality will look for you until you accept that it exists.
i found freedom by waging war on everything i was conditioned to believe.
"to touch another's hand, you must first open yours."
your behavior does not belong to me.
"i don't think about scars anymore. abuse is what happened to me. the horror it left is a life long healing. and let me tell you, i'm winning. i am fucking winning."
a different place. where i am a stranger again.
when the wounds are quiet.
i no longer need to escape my own mind.
i can recognize the darkness now before it has a chance to hurt me.
some much needed relaxation with my love.
you cannot demand grace when you show none.
it's interesting how those who demand we not judge their choices are the most critical of others.
"i am so busy i can't catch my breath but i am finally doing everything i want with my life, my love, my career, me."

the light is on your side. let it touch you.
"people who claim to love you one day and show coldness towards you the next are exhausting. this is not friendship, it's manipulation."

i love you with all the days that are left in me.

"imagine being so immature you tell a group of people to go fuck themselves because of their beliefs. imagine being so unenlightened, you agree with that hate."

"when unsettled, we search for people who might calm our fears, but often become entangled with those who feed them."
everyday i live a little more. i've grown a garden in those parts of me i was too afraid to water.

perhaps the saddest part of this is when people engage in passive aggressive behavior. as if you're somehow supposed to know that you exist in their silent conversation.
sometimes a person's inner dialogue includes people who have no idea they are part of it.

we are packing for our trip to beautiful british columbia. my camera is charging. i can't wait to breathe in only him and the mountain air ‚ô°
it takes courage to stand alone with your opinions. i will always choose this over the shelter of a crowd.
"i love you beyond anything you could ever imagine. i'm in love with how no day passes where we do not remind each other of this. you said, just always be you. i have, and how beautiful we have become. in this love, in this freedom to be who we are, without limit or expectation."
i love you more than i knew my heart had room for. you show up everyday with unwavering words of support for everything i love &amp; believe in. words only outdone by the multitude of actions that follow.
"your love has shown me that good men exist. that my mistakes will never be held against me. i believe in truth and honor, because it is the only language i've heard you speak. i no longer fear lies and falsehoods, but stand strong in this extraordinary reality you have built us."
i love you.

"i have learned over the years that you get what you can afford, and this also includes people."
to say what is necessary and nothing more.
the emotional mind rarely stops to consider its actions.
sometimes telling a person you know how they feel is an insult. simply because you don't.
i love what instagram is doing with the likes on posts. twitter etc should follow their lead.
don't be afraid. even lost is a place.
sometimes people will label you as sensitive to justify their cruelty.
"my boyfriend's family are here from Scotland. i asked his cousin if he'd, like a drink. he replied, aye lass, i'll have a wee dram. i've now asked them to take me back with them!"
"sometimes. okay most times, when i see an assholey comment left on my tweet, i look at the account, and that's their whole tl, making assholey comments to people. what an accomplishment!"
control is attached to the ego. an illusion i am happy to betray.
a series of well constructed falsehoods.
"the ego does not like boundaries, and the larger it is, the louder its protest."
the ego does not exist in any substantial sense. it is our belief in it that makes it reality.

everything that wasn't love helped me find the purest version of it.
i am so in love with your light.
"i love you, and you deserve to live fullfiled. you are so much more than just survival."
this is a letter to humanity.
"if we hold hands, we can be still when the wind is strong."
get up and do it before your mind self sabotages your motivation.

time is a secondary element to emotional recovery. we have to heal the deep trauma ourselves.
healing is painful because you have to revisit the wound.
"sometimes when people cannot find peace, they will try to disrupt yours."
"if the need arises, it's possible to defend yourself quietly, with dignity, and without harm."

learning to exist without needing anyone's approval is a most powerful freedom.
hope in the forest.
i've spent much of my adult life trying not to be a disaster. i think i've finally nailed it.
hurting your own heart for someone else's happiness is not healthy. it's also something love will never ask you to do.
"basic human decency isn't that difficult. my ten year old son can grasp it. if you don't like someone, leave them alone. if you don't understand something, learn it. if you don't care to, simply walk away."

"a map of imaginary places, and my love we will visit all of them."
"three story treehouse. the enchanted forest. revelstoke, british columbia, canada. photographer: tyson wheatly."
your existence will only bother people who are deeply unhappy with their own.
the only thing we truly own is our reactions and behavior.
people like to talk about what's real as if they've never worn a veil.
to remain nameless. to be without the expectation a label can bring.

"if you act without integrity, you cannot then demand it."

fear is both a liar and essential to our survival.

"so much of adulthood and maturity is about being 100% accountable for our choices &amp; actions, but we are more comfortable shining a light of judgement on others to avoid the important work needed within ourselves."
when to speak up. when to listen. when to fight or let go is different for each person. everything is.

love is already enough. it is expectation that makes it almost.
i love you. i could find you with my eyes closed.
love is a freedom i did not understand until i met you.

"we cannot change the past, but we can touch it with different hands."
compassion does not choose harmful behavior. people do.
i love you. i don't want to breathe another time without you.
forgiveness doesn't mean you accept poor behavior. it means you value peace.
"when you find true happiness, you also find out who's truly happy for you."
life is a beautiful dream. one that i imagined and then built with my own hands.
child of the woods.
"social media is an escape for many. a place to express and create. for some it may be the only place they feel understood. who cares why anyone else is here, what they tweet, who they do and don't follow? it's not your business, it's not mine."
"idk about you, but i think being a grown up is hard enough, no matter how much we try to simplify our lives. even when life is going well, our responsibilities never leave us. more importantly, we don't get to leave them."
"i love you. i could give you a thousand reasons why, and a thousand more that even i don't understand."
"people are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them. epictetus."
"you were here all along, but i had to free myself to find you."

healing is dirty work.
"stunningly beautiful isle of portland. dorset, england. photographer, ig. richies_incredible_britain"
we suffer when we try to attach permanence and certainty to our experiences. freedom from this is to accept the ephemeral nature of all things.
"no is an answer, and you are not obligated to explain why."
"perhaps the truth lies in how people treat you at their worst, not yours."
"""quality is not an act, it is a habit."" aristotle."
"""the most common form of despair is not being who you are."" s√∏ren kierkegaard."
fear is also a choice. freedom is not listening to what it has to say.
fear no longer steals my happiness. i don't let it.
there is something about your voice that helps me see in the dark.
the lightness of hands no longer filled with sorrow.
forgiveness is rather courageous. a graceful act of love.
it's important to own our behavior. especially when it has hurt the peace of others.
"i was alone in that house, but i still looked for you in every room."
"we keep learning, because knowing is the death of wonder."
i've been fragile winds and fierce storms. both have destroyed me.

"my existence was a constant state of transition, until peace allowed me to stay."
my god i fucking love this man.
"when we met, i wrote my number on a napkin. he still folds it everyday and keeps it in his pocket."
i held everything like it was leaving.
it doesn't exist but you remember it well.
you're exhausted because you react to everything you notice.
i found a way to be stronger than the tragedy.
i love you with all the rage of the sea.
i don't care about hands or eyes that don't belong to you.
better not to preach what you yourself cannot practice.
i love so much that i belong to you.
i have held your pain. i could not be a stranger to you now.
i love this time of day. just us and the night sky.
wanderings.
we filter the world through our own subjective perception &amp; personal judgements. reality is buried somewhere beneath those layers.
√âireann.
i write my own truth. i don't know yours.
things that don't need to be explained.
"i was transient, so i built my dreams on sand."
"i am wrong. i am right. i am gentle. i have edges. i am hypocrisy and sincerity. i am freedom and captivity.  i am,  human."
"before adding your narrative to everything, understand there are things you're unaware of."
remember that people have already seen you through their own filter of perception.
if you are kind or supportive to a person/cause/opinion i don't like. it does not mean you're being unkind to me.
sext: i'll let you read my thesis.
what i actually am may never effect how you perceive me.
so many opinions from the same people who tell us to stop sharing ours.
"it's a good day to remind ppl @soyourelikethat exists. a smart, kind and amazing person. she shares her kindness and wisdom here every day. doing so takes both vulnerability and courage. i'm truly grateful for you S ‚ô°"

grief is a weight i never get used to holding. its shape changes with every passing year.
you are not lost. every choice has led you to exactly where you stand.
"we often suffer, because we walk every road expecting a different view."
he says i cry because you're beautiful.
"sometimes i stand too long in the wind, because i can't take my eyes off the beauty."
i love the way this view makes me feel.
no thank you to those who can't support you in the bright light.
"i'm not motivated by what you think, and that is a freedom for both of us."
"i love you, and that is the purest truth i know."
"when we allow words to touch old wounds, the current message is lost on us."
stones in the road? crushing on all of you üñ§
mystery.
i think as soon as we label something we limit its potential. it becomes caged by the definitions society has attached to it.
"find peace with what success means to you, and never again will you look over your shoulder, and compare it to anyone else's."
i still cry when people show me kindness.
strength is peaceful. aggression is insecure.
"he says son can you play me a memory, i'm not really sure how it goes, but it's sad and it's sweet and i knew it complete when i wore a younger man's clothes.  billy joel"
"all of this beauty we live, and none of it needs a name."
silence speaks just as well.
the darkest part of the forest where no map can find you.
"do you ever look at smart, capable people and think, are you really falling for that?"
we've had so much snow. looking forward to days like this again.
"peace cannot be taught, it can only be found."
"everytime you change something, you create a new reality."
sometimes people become a place you will never visit again.
you are not what you left behind.
"if you are buried under criticism and abuse. please know that someone loves you, and wants to dig you out."
passive aggression is a defense mechanism we should all unlearn.
i love him so much that my breath is a stranger to me when he's not in the same room.
"the power to change exists within all of us, even when we feel surrounded by darkness. even if we're crawling towards the light. acceptance is the bridge we cross to reduce suffering. it's the mirror we look in to completely accept who we see."
acceptance doesn't mean we're giving up. it means we're no longer fighting it. it is the doorway to change. it is the first step to finding peace. it's the realization that how we react to any situation is ultimately our choice. it's about owning our own behaviors.
"these truths are not good or bad. they just are. we are human. we make mistakes, we repeat mistakes. instead of pretending this doesn't occur, hold it and accept it as a part of you."
"it helps to understand we are all capable of hypocrisy, of turning away, or even looking too close. we have all experienced envy or fear. we have crossed boundaries, and had our own knocked down because we weren't strong enough to enforce them."
he is a safe place where the air is free from sorrow.
one of my most important realizations was to truly learn the difference between reasons and excuses.
the beautiful realization that hope is not a dangerous place.
"touch me, like the world will end if you don't."
"in my dreams i've travelled to every universe, and i belonged to you in all of them."
we like to demand people recognize our change while refusing to acknowledge theirs.
"unpopular opinion. every reaction is a choice, and blame is something we engage in to avoid our own behaviors."
you're not entitled to what others have worked hard to earn. you're not entitled to anything.
"lost, always found its way to you."
a war whose only weapon is love.
i once kept the company of locked doors and empty rooms. i no longer understand that silence.
i don't like the new algorithm. i asked to see tweets as they happen and i'm not. why can't twitter leave things alone?!
"the universe can tell when kindness is layered with hostility. thankfully, so can most people."
when life becomes better than a dream.
"if you were a planet, i would land on you and never leave."
"share your knowledge, and don't be afraid if someone is able to use it more beneficially than you can."
good morning. i love you.
"there are still days when i struggle to accept my past. i allow thoughts into my head i know can never materialize. i wish for a different father, or one who didn't hurt us. this non acceptance brings great suffering, and i am reminded why i traveled so far to change."
a lifetime of beautiful words could never describe what he does for me.
"the stranger who thinks they know you, but does not dare to look at themself."
drawn to those who know what it means to survive. who have loved and lived life.
i thought about my dad today.
"the less i think about happiness and what it is, the more open i am to receive it."
the memories are bedridden. soon they will vanish on their own.
i knew jacob banks would hit it fucking big and he has. his voice is incredible. he deserves every success and more. chainsmoking.
i love sasha sloan so much and can so relate to her songs about her father. ready yet.
"self acceptance is a tough road, but once you get there it becomes a wall of peace that nothing can penetrate."
you've made my life more beautiful than anything i can capture with this lens.
"when your energy changes, so will the people around you."
"we praise ourselves for positive reactions, and blame our negative behavior on external factors. growth will only happen when we are ready to own it all."
"we are so driven by external rewards, when the real answers are inside of us."
self deception is so powerful because we have not learned to accept the truth.
"acceptance can be a battle, but you must lose it to move on."
freedom came when i let go of the constant need to know what happens next.
"people still grow despite efforts to burden their path, and are usually stronger because of it."
"tonight we ate out, bought ourselves a new vehicle (as you do)! now it's netflix and cuddle time. diary of an old married couple who aren't old or married."
"when you are in love, everything is extraordinary."
"we made dinner and walked the dog. now we're watching family guy reruns like some old married couple, and this is honestly the happiest i've ever been!"
"don't hold too tight because whatever it is will change, and that is a certainty you can rely on."
pain changed me. suffering taught me i had a choice.
narcissism is pervasive. a history of patterns and behaviors. not just a label for every person you don't like.
you cannot ask of anyone what you're not willing to do yourself.
"today, i need me, and i'm allowed that."
success is personal to each individual. it's not for us to say what it means to anyone but ourselves.
trouble tends to find people when too much of what they speak is not their story to tell.
"it's more than love. it's ancient, feral, and it cannot be named."
one of the sexiest things a man can do with his mouth is speak the truth from it.
"life is really bloody good, and i can say that for the first time without fear. i'm proud of that because it took a lot. a whole lot."
i write my thoughts. i don't need a label for them.
hanging on hurts much more than your hands.
i love you. i'm here for you. i won't let you lose your way.
who will you be when you're down to your last skin.
i was a ghost once. i no longer need that map.

nature is why i believe in magic.
you will not find happiness until you are at peace with all the clocks that tick inside you.
words are truly inadequate when it comes to describing love.
when you've arrived and other people haven't even left. that itself is the lesson.
the duty of youth is to challenge corruption - kurt cobain.
"i've learned many lessons about what love isn't. i can now say i'm grateful for these experiences, because they've helped me let in what love truly is."
"i hope you realize, the only opinions that matter are your own. your own, and those you have chosen to live your closest life with. it only needs to make sense to you and it's all perception anyway. give every person the grace to interpret life in a language they can understand."
"suffering is deeply personal. trauma takes a long time to process. sometimes it's so tragic, your mind can't make sense of it. love and trust are difficult concepts when you've grown up with abuse. don't rush. don't let anyone tell you how to do it, but know that you can."

"almost nothing material is needed for a happy life, for he who has understood existence - marcus aurelius."
"no one can stop you, but the consequences are always your own."
i relate to the sea because she doesn't end. she is rage and calm all at once. she is depth only few are meant to understand.
and the narcissist said.
"love that is transparent, that tells the truth. it has nothing to apologize for. sincerity allows each of you a choice. the choice to live with each other's honesty or not. love itself asks for nothing, it is people who always do."
the trees trust the sky.
"i'm still unpacking my past, but i no longer give it a place to stay."

"since i met you, i do everything unarmed."
when the time comes. let the sea take me.
a love that has never needed an apology.
when i exit this world. i want you to hold my last breath.
loving him is the most natural thing i've ever felt.
change is ephemeral too.
i don't forgive people so they can feel better. i forgive the person i was at the time i let them hurt me.
the part of me who punished herself. she healed and disappeared.
don't spend time longing for the closed door.
the way he looks at me with his dirty mind.
hands.
a history of avis.
"everyone has something they find difficult to negotiate. mine are trust and loyalty. once they are broken, i don't go back."
"i'm happy to say, this narcissist didn't win. from this, i made a beautiful friend, who is now like a sister to me. we healed, and she went on to use this experience to help others. i love her so much. there is light."
narcissists grossly exaggerate their capacity for kindness and compassion. truly kind people don't feel the need to talk about these qualities. they do it naturally and without the desire for an audience. trust the actions people communicate. their words are sometimes a lie.
they will devalue you until you are at complete war with your own mind.
"when they can't control how you view yourself, they will try to control how others see you. they will attempt to sabotage your reputation.  create stories to make you look like the abuser while they play the victim."
they will make you feel guilty when you attempt to establish boundaries. they will shame you for having an opinion or trying to give your thoughts on theirs. they become aggressive when their sense of entitlement or over inflated sense of self is challenged.
they wield abuse like an axe. they attempt to reframe what you've said to their advantage. they turn your emotions into character flaws. they use circular arguments and gaslighting to disorient you.
narcissists engage in malignant behaviors to distort the reality of their victims. they will do almost anything to escape accountability for these actions.
manipulation and its false narrative.
i am a child of winter tragedies.
"in you, i have found the love of my life. my most loyal and trusted friend."

i sometimes wonder why the stars keep lining up so beautifully. then i remember all the hard work i put in to make it happen.

you cannot abandon change. it will haunt you.

belief.
he shows love so naturally. like breathing. like my heartbeat is the only thing he can hear.
i don't believe in labels. they narrow perspective and restrict independent thinking.
moth gets it.
sometimes i hide from the knowing. from the shadows that surround people.
"my comfort level has gone from, omg, can't leave the fucking house to speaking in front of a room full of people."
"i'm not sure what you want from me, but i know i can't be it."
i write about things that used to make me uncomfortable. i worked hard and sat with them until i wasn't.
"people don't hate you, it's your ego that thinks they do."
love lives here.
it is our perception of reality that tells us an event is painful. this is a difficult truth to accept and change. a life long journey.
"you don't have to face your fears all at once. one small step is a victory. do it until you're uncomfortable. do it for a few minutes more each time, and don't let a bad day distract from your progress."
avoidance was my middle name. it took me a long time to realize it was preventing me from living life and actually making my anxiety worse.
covert narcissism is a real thing.
"growth is uncomfortable, but avoiding it only prolongs the pain."
timeless.
"i can't help but reach out. i overwhelm myself sometimes, but it's always there in the back of my mind. what if. what if there is something i can do."
"courage, peace, success and love. they are all tailored to suite your narrative. it doesn't matter a goddamn bit what anyone else is doing. forget society or the next person. invest your time in figuring out what these things mean to you."
i always remember when people are kind and supportive. it stays long in my memory. i'll stand in their corner for as long as they need my hands.

those who long for silence until it actually arrives.
"love, trust and affection are all languages we learn in childhood. sometimes our teachers are broken and the true meaning is lost. if you choose to relearn anything, please, let it be love."

the same question asked a different way until they find an answer that speaks to them.
"it took me a long time to realize, i am in control of what i give a voice to."
the past no longer has an echo.
live life. document it less.
insecurity will help you misinterpret everything.
i've only ever felt this way about my children. now i feel this way with him.
"i love you, and i don't remember breathing prior to your arrival."
the decay of fear with the rising sun.
honesty is how we form trust. it's how we grow. it's how we develop integrity and honor. there is nothing else.
home is wherever you are not a stranger to yourself.
the same tree stripped bare by winter blooms relentless in the spring.

we turn every corner together.
"i've been left behind and have done the leaving. we grow differently, and it's okay not to take everything with you."

"you, and all the days that are left."
i always see what's hidden. their darkness feels so heavy.
"the history you wear on your face, softens when you're in love."
"still somewhere, the child who learned to walk in the fiercest weather."
love will turn anything into a map.
the memories forgotten with dust.
so little to say when your hands are full of love.
people and their hurry.
still walking.
"when people lie, they take away your ability to make the best decision for yourself. don't give them the power to do it again."
to the ones who watch quietly until you are ready to stand in the light. the ones who look beneath and wait to undress your wonder.
when you have love you have everything.
our heartbeat.
beautiful winter.
"i found my person. he's beautiful. and none of it matters anymore. the words, the past. nothing, because i found my person. i found him."

"i seriously spent much of my life thinking everything was 'my fault.' if only i could do this or that better. there are fewer people in my lane now, but god am i grateful for those who are."
"i have become so comfortable with not devoting any energy to following: people who don't listen, who make everything about them. jealous people. judgemental people. those who want the world but give nothing back. people who are ruled by their ego. manipulators, liars and frauds."

don't let fear take your voice love.
love is never knowing where the trees end.
"imagine accepting that people are acting of their own accord. that their reaction to you is based on their experience with you. no one is telling them what to think or feel. there is no one to blame. own the interaction, and any consequence that follows."
"imagine sitting your self righteous ass in front of the mirror and owning every aspect of how you treat people. especially people you don't like, agree with, or struggle to understand."
the girls october built.

the slow realization that you may have trusted a demon.
i feel so devastated for him and the life he won't get to live. for his girlfriend and his family. what a tragic loss.

morrisey's sideburns were legendary.
"sometimes people have their dialogue prepared based on what they want from you, and it's rarely the same as what you're able to give them."
"imagine what you might hear, if your mind wasnt distracted with all that you need to say."
happiness doesn't mean the absence of suffering. it doesn't mean the darkness completely goes away. it means i've taken back the power from everything that wanted to drown me.
sometimes people gather dust too.
the forest is so beautifully dark today.
"i guess the point of my ramblings is this. the other side exists. you can go there, no matter how slowly it takes you to move in. there's a place for you. i may never know you, but i'll keep a light on. we should all keep a light on to help the next person, even when ours is dim."
"i love these people. my heart hurts for them. i was them, and now i'm standing on the other side in a position to help them."
"i never imagined i'd be standing here. still healing, but in a good space. a happy space. a healthy space. recently i became part of an organization that improves the lives of those suffering with mental health issues through adult literacy programs."
"healing is so personal and nothing about it involves what suits other people. it is your goal, your timeframe. it's whatever you can do to slowly transition from existing, to living the life you so fully deserve."
"i have been in that place. where all i could do was exist. anything that required higher functioning was beyond me. if i showered and ate, it was a good day."
"this love is such a beautiful place. like you have always been here, and i do not remember a time without you."
the burning sea. the sorrow of orphaned waves.
people will cross your boundaries and become upset when you define them. this is an effort to meet their own needs and a disregard for yours. your goals are not the same. it's okay to move on without them.
"he said, i love her. she's a gentle girl who talks with trees."
the eventual decay of things. the thoughts worn with remembering.
they kissed me good night. never knowing my little bones were breaking with sadness.
the light collapses around you.
the belonging and the vanishing.
october leaves. fall gently with me.
he has moral courage and integrity when no one is watching.
"if i could gift you all something, it would be stillness. i think some of our greatest inner work is achieved there. through meditation i found stillness. don't give up, keep trying. you and your journey are so worth it."
"when i meditate, i place one hand on my chest and the other on my tummy. that's how i can best focus on my breath. i've reached a point now where if i just place my hands there in a stressful situation, it calms me down. it works, it helps, it is also a lifelong process."
"it has helped me to also view life this way. there will always be distractions, but i can refocus like i do with meditation. nothing can take away the steps i've walked so far, and nothing can stop me from continuing on, from moving forward."
"our minds are like that. natural wanderers. our inner voice is a distraction as well. i found it difficult not to judge my wandering thoughts but i kept trying. the more i practiced, the more natural it became."
"when i first started meditating, it felt unnatural. i even felt a little foolish. my mind wandered a hundred times. i'd quickly try to refocus my thoughts back to my breath. i often thought i had 'failed' at meditation because i couldn't stop my thoughts from traveling elsewhere."
an absolutely gorgeous weekend on the trails.
i can barely conceive of a type of beauty in which there is no melancholy. baudelaire.
a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. franz kafka.
perhaps hands are small for a reason. they're only meant to hold the present moment.
"when i touched his hand, i knew his spirit fire burned the same as mine."
"i cannot name your hurt, but i can love you, and show you how brightly you exist beneath its layers."

my parents. frailty and nothingness after their son died. they hid unimaginable pain inside of them. we were all changed. not one of us recognized the other.
it was january. three feet of snow had london at a standstill. dad took a taxi to identify his son's body. a different man returned that day. the father we knew never did come back.
"cold are the memories of the night you died. i lived inside them for so long, and now, i struggle to remember."
silence isn't terrifying. what we imagine lives inside of it can be.
"i didn't pursue happiness. instead i searched for peace. i found a place for all the tragedy and who it had made me. i stand beside it without falling. i'm no longer consumed by ghosts, but here in every moment. happiness was always there, so i opened up, and let it in."
"sometimes i return to the place in me that was abandoned, but the voices no longer echo. there is no more sadness living in the walls."

i love you. tell me all your difficult truths.

there is so much light. i wish i could share it with you.
isolation used to feel like home. now i feel out of place there. living life felt like effort. now it's all i want to do.
despair is a terrible place. it steals all the light.

the truth is often brutal enough. say it kindly.

"the way we love each person sounds differently, because we love each person differently, and this creates the most beautiful song."

i want to be remembered as the girl who disappeared.
"we can take similar journeys, but no one's life will look the same."

"if you believe you don't judge anything, you have not fully accepted your humanity."

"i stay up too late and get up early. i can't miss the sunset or the sunrise. i'm in love with the night and everything in between. i listen to the city as i fall asleep. suddenly i'm wide awake because the noise inspires words. i am alive, and every moment, a discovery."

because i am not made of cruel beginnings. it is only the place i come from. a place i gladly leave behind.
"therapy has saved my life, but the time for talking is done. the memories are so distant now, they often don't feel like a part of me. speaking the words puts them in front of me again, and i have already said goodbye."

peace is when you are much happier minding your own business than worrying about anyone else's.
open your mind. to speak of a memory doesn't mean you want it back. to write of the past doesn't mean that you still live there. to remember a tragedy does not mean you are sad. to question expression is to stifle it. don't be the reason anyone holds their breath.
"courage is to let yourself be seen, and not mind if there are people who don't like it."
i fell in love with transience. to resist it is to suffer.
tragedy has no song. only the silence of disbelief.
"the map is torn where the road ends. i will meet you there, in the nothingness, in the place of broken light."
"i found myself this year. i realized i had an abundance of love to give, and that i deserved to receive the same. i let go of energies that looked like love, but in reality were rooms i'd gotten lost in. rooms other people had the key for."
the open road. miles and miles hiked. a summit reached. good food eaten. a thousand pictures taken. beautiful memories made. falling deeper and deeper in love with him. i hope there's no bottom.
"that's on us. that doesn't make someone else a terrible person. don't be the reason a person cries, or goes to bed feeling badly about themselves. if you don't like someone, walk away, and always ask yourself how you'd feel if that tweet you're about to send was directed at you."
"if you want a better environment, be it. we are all guilty of wrong doing at some point in our lives, but we are also capable of great love. always look within. we often react because something inside us triggered. something we don't want anyone to see."
"no voice should be censored, but when intentions are to hurt, please take a step back. bullying hurts everyone. no one here really knows anyone else. we can't demand that others realize this is only a snap shot of our existence and in the next breath generalize theirs."
"13 year olds are committing suicide because of bullying. one even in my daughter's school. this hurt her deeply, and the conversation about why some people are mean was a heartbreaking one."
people are not bad because something about their truth triggers you. they're not bad because they have different opinions or experiences.
"there is too much judgement. too many preaching kindness in one tweet, and in the next taking shots at other people. this is not kindness. this is not love, and it's definitely not how we can improve the world."
sometimes i can't believe i live in Canada. so grateful üá®üá¶
"take me, where there are no hearts beating. to where we do not have to give our silence a name."
"you can't hide the truth from an empath. so be yourself, they will feel it anyway."
"his is such a beautiful energy. it creates a light that touches everyone he meets. his unforgettable eyes, and that feeling you're the only other person in the room."
"maturity is to love and accept those in your life even if they're friends with people you may not care for. it's to never put them in a position to choose or take sides. if you can't do this, you always have the option to do no harm and walk away."
sometimes kindness is just leaving people alone.
"to distanceyourself from people who are unhealthy for you is a good and necessary decision. don't feel bad, and don't look back."
"remember to be soft today, and reach out to those who have forgotten."
"i want to haunt your lips, and make a home in the palm of your hand."
moral courage is often a lonely fight.
cognitive dissonance.
"if we come forward with a truth, i think sometimes we need to share with more than just the person we are telling. this is the only way we can reveal it. the only way to make a change."
"he knows his worth and his beauty, but i still remind him everyday."
"it's interesting to me how other people like to throw shade, and when you've finally had enough and throw some back, they're innocent and you're the bad guy."
"on the flip side. my boyfriend has never spoken about his ex's and i've never asked. he opened up about his ex wife after months of us dating. it was a painful experience for him, but he's never said a bad word about her. i think that's how it's done."
isn't it bizarre when a guy tells you every one of his ex girlfriends is crazy. i'm trying to figure out the common theme here ü§î
"sometimes a beautiful friendship develops, because others have tried to keep you apart."
i wonder if you could set down your ego for a moment and understand nothing here is about you.
i'm all out of second chances. i've given away too many to the wrong people. i only want to focus on those who've never needed to ask for one.
i don't take sides. i wasn't in the room.
i've always found the change in seasons difficult. each one reminds me of a different tragedy.
"the deeper you go, the more beautiful it gets."
the way people love him is so beautiful. it makes me cry. it makes me feel so grateful he allows me to love him too.
the stranger disappears when i'm with you. all of it does.
"i am quiet today, and there is a stranger inside my mind."
sometimes people will keep you in a cage until they are ready to escape from their own.
a love story on the forest floor.
it's okay to change and choose who you take with you.
this inner stillness. this precious place. where want and need have become the same thing.
"if i am a language, only few are meant to learn it."
"""when the roots are deep there is no reason to fear the wind."" unknown."
this is a load of bollocks.
"how i was raised: go to school. get a job. meet a boy. get married. get a better job. buy a nice house. drive a new car, these things will make you happy."
people with empathy don't do that.

finding your own voice vs the language you suddenly speak when high on romantic love. a voice powered by the very feelings you're attached to. the difference is immeasurable. one is true freedom. the other leaves when people do.
there's always something beautiful to find.
it's only wrong when you do it. this mentality has become a disease.
"when the corridors were dark, he looked for me."
the things you only show each other.
"i think he was that while he lived, and i believe it's where he is now. i'm glad to have known his light, despite how briefly. good night sweet Thanh. until the next lifetime."
"i felt so devastated for them, and also because the world seemed a little less peaceful knowing he's no longer in it. i looked up the origin of his first name tonight. it means delicate sky."
"i've often thought about this beautiful man, this stranger that i knew. his granddaughter came in today with her husband and two children. her grandfather passed away 3 weeks ago."
"when they left, he asked the staff to find me. he took my hands in his one last time and simply said, 'friend.'"
we held hands many times that day. it was never uncomfortable. i was so completely touched by his presence and the love this family had for one another.
"he noticed my accent and asked his granddaughter to translate our conversation. (he was Vietnamese) when i told him i was originally from London, he said he had seen many wars, and although i was young, he knew i had too."
"last summer a family came into our restaurant to celebrate their grandfather turning 100. he was such a sweet man. when i shook his hand and looked into his eyes, i knew we'd crossed paths before. probably many lifetimes ago."
"tell them they're beautiful, and that you're proud of them for considering their body art."
"to call a person 'fake' because they wear make up, lashes, or choose to do something that adds to their appearance is not very nice. it's also a terribly shallow insecure statement."
i fall hopelessy in love with him everyday. i fall hopelessly in love with who we make each other.
our history doesn't have to influence where we travel now.
"the only direction you can 'control' is ahead of you, and even then."
"still beautiful, because someone remembered."
same.
"the reality is everyone puts their best face forward. we've lived generations in a society that tells us it's what we should do. it takes time to let go of those ideals. some people may not even want to, and that's okay too."
stay with those who understand it is a privilege to receive you.
i'd meet @dullandwicked and gently remove the forest from her hair. i'd put the pieces in an envelope and read them like a letter when i missed her. i'd tell her how i see her and that i'll never turn away.
the bones of old sailboats are still haunting the sea.
i will still love you if you contradict yourself or use a filter on your picture. if you do or do not show your body. if you use twitter to shout from the rooftops or never follow a single soul.  do you know what i mean.
to fully realize it's not your concern why other people do things is actually a freedom for you.
"sometimes i still look for the little girl who walked alone. a fog surrounds her now, but i will never forget the warmth of her tiny hands."

"we lie, but want the truth. we wear masks and demand that others be real. we are irony and hypocrisy dressed in fragile skin."
"i was a stranger inside my own veins. sweet girl, i do not miss you."
i often sent myself to places where i could not scream for help.
"i stayed alone because i wanted freedom. then i met you, and realized that's exactly what love is."
he has wood hangers and an old fashioned shave kit. idk why but these little things about him drive me fucking wild.
"people come around in their own way &amp; time. sometimes they don't, and that's okay too."
"insecurity will take an interest in who and what interests you. not because it is interested too, but to strengthen what it feels is a fragile presence."
some people will not understand you because they are not awake yet.
"we create a false image of people who see us too deeply. it makes us feel better about what we are trying to hide, or avoid within ourselves."
to acknowledge something never means you have to become it.

a warning in the forest.
awoken by the same dream.
"even as a child, i was happy to wander alone."
it's kind of sad to watch someone try too hard. it's like an insecure love that is only there to receive.
one day our immune systems won't be able to keep up.
i can't stop inhaling the air that exists around you.
classified. she ain't gotta do much.
it is the ego that wants to hold on. allow the awakened you to let go.
"i'd meet @WillyGCmas  we'd make narnia our reality and write our own book of adventures in imaginary places. we'd sit with the crows in a forest in the rain. we'd put a spell on time until it ceased to exist, and our laughter would echo forever through the leaves."

"i'd meet @sirensong1208 but first i would write a poem about her eyes. we'd dip our toes in the calling sea, and hike for miles on a path to nowhere. i'd tell her how she inspires me, and how when friendship is meant, there is no sword sharp enough to harm it."
"i don't throw anything away, but sometimes i have to leave things behind."
i'd fly to @VladaMars we'd tell stories by the sea. i'd ask her to read me poetry in her native tongue. i'd not understand a word but it would be so very beautiful. i'd brush her curly hair and hold her hand if she felt sad.
"if i could meet ppl, i'd meet @VVanGone in a quiet bar. we'd drink wine &amp; talk until it closed. i'd wish for rain &amp; we would walk the humid streets. the sun would never rise so we could hold the moment forever. i'd never forget the smell of that old city or the rain upon his skin"

my boyfriend's son invited me to movie night with his dad. they've done this together every week since he was 11. he's 24 now. i feel so honored to have shared this special place with both of them.
"and for the love of all things good, let's be better to one another, because all shit stinks. no one human is better or worse than another. we are only on different stages of a journey. please focus on your own and respect theirs.  peace"
"if we only encourage the good parts of ourselves, we will never grow. take ownership of your own toxicity. drop the pretense of self righteousness. stand in your own shit before you judge another."
"that reaction is a choice. everything we accuse others of, has at some point existed in ourselves."
"toxicity exists in everyone. it is a symptom of being human. don't be afraid of it, but do ask yourself why it's there. many adverse reactions are because of pain or insecurity. our fight or flight is triggered and we react."
thank you to all the lovely honest people who speak out and stand against what the dishonest ones say and do.
there are two sides to every broken journey. try not to judge people because you choose to listen to the echoes of only one.
"i won't judge your past, only what you have done to me."
"sometimes people are a catalyst. to something else, something better. you are not meant to stay long, only to move each other into the next phase of existence."

aggression is not strength.
some people are consumed by all the ways that life has wronged them. both real and imagined.
the rocky ground you're trying to patch with yesterdays.
the gentle beginnings of a collapse.
"i always try to like people's selfies because it's brave to put your face on here. it's brave to put any part of yourself on public display. your pain, joy or indifference. it's a very personal thing to share, and i want you to know i see you."
"it is a privilege to be called a friend. to be included in someone's private space. to witness both their joy and suffering. to stand with them on good days, and to lie with them on nights they cannot breathe."

narcissists will play the perpetual victim to divert attention away from their abuse of others.
circular arguments. the narcissists favorite tool.
"a most private space where my head lies buried in his chest. i can't seem to breathe him in deep enough. a smell i'm sure i can no longer live without. only the night surrounds us, as we listen quietly to this living breathing love."
"narcissists need a supply of adoration to survive. they rarely get their own hands dirty. they draw you in, and without realizing it, you start to believe what they believe. before you know it, you're defending them, and you no longer notice the blood stains on your hands."
i don't recognize this child in me. the one who isn't afraid and tired with abandon.
the gentle ways people reveal themselves.
"you don't have to say a single word. people will always create a reality that doesn't exist based on their fears, thoughts and assumptions."
"you cannot love or even like everyone, but you can do nothing and leave them alone."
i can't stop going outside.
everything is sweeter once you've learned to breathe alone.
"there's so much to love, and it all begins with you."
self importance and self respect are two very different things.
even if your heart were a century away. i would walk until i reached it.
how i wish time were still when you are near me.
"a while back he said i hope it's not too soon to share this song with you. we listen to it every night now. his arms are strong, his body is warm, and it breaks my heart open in the most beautiful way. ron pope. you're the reason i come home."
peaceful does not care what others do. she is content to bathe in her own light.
"he's had the same map for years. his fingers touch the faded paper, gently like a lover's skin. adventure lies in the creases, and the roads we can no longer read. take me to the sunset on a hill, and don't let go, until the sky is filled with light again."
"i've searched my whole life for this kind of love. i knew it existed somewhere, and i have found it here with you."
"i'm not always good at mornings so he calls me everyday to say, baby it's time to get up. he tells me about traffic and the weather so i'm never late and i know exactly what to wear. at night he tells me stories if i can't sleep, and that he'll wait for me in a dream."
pouring rain. couch cuddles and the shining.
learning new things about old friends. beautiful.
i knew the forest was a girl.
the forest loves you.
the only enemy you have is your ego.
"always ask for facts, and watch that mountain turn into a stone."
sometimes people are too self important to be at peace.
sometimes people are too self conscious to be at peace.
i will love you in this beautiful light. i will love you harder when there is none.
i am well aware my writing touches nerves people don't want to admit exist.
the truth is always better than approval. don't be afraid to tell yours.
there is lightning and rain and it is beautiful.
i don't think happy people do that.
don't disrespect another's truth. you were never in the room.
love and compassion is all i've ever seen him wear.
be yourself in every room.
i am alive at the same time as two of my heroes. this is beautiful to me.
"his eyes. a blue lake, and my heart can touch the bottom."
his eyes. the color of sea ice just melted by the sun.
"shitty people exist, but so does this, and nature will out live shitty people for all time to come. ignore them. enjoy this."
who are we to judge another's worth? we are not. focus your attention on knowing your own.
there is no empathy in judging people. only an indication of how much you dislike yourself.
"he said i miss you already, come back."
hello. this is who i am. it works for me.
"all gratification is transitory, but perhaps more importantly, so is pain."
we continue to hold on to the idea of certainty. our resistance to the fact it does not exist is often the root of our suffering.
trees need no audience to grow. do you understand.
our beautiful little city on a hill.
effort takes you to beautiful places.
"i don't really believe in karma. i think people who do bad things are their own karma. they harm their energy and inhibit personal growth. perhaps karma is to live within that miserable existence, and what is received will not change until they do."
"""and so it is."" i listened to this song long before i met him but it will always remind me of dldemons."
so underrated. so in love with his mind and voice. jacob banks. unknown.
"""the only reason god gave me eyes was to see you. the only reason god gave me ears was to hear your voice."" i love you so much my beautiful man."
"isn't it all so beautiful. love, madness, and even the pain."
it's about loving people as they are and giving them the freedom to do the same. it's about not imposing ideas on each other of how love should be. should is on my list of bad words. fuck however is completely acceptable.
"idk why the principle of non attachment gets a bad rap. maybe because it's not well understand. it has nothing to do with being distant, or not nurturing the people you love. it's actually the opposite. it's the purest love you can give someone."
yasmin mogahed.
love isn't about words you want to hear. it's about actions you need to feel.
turns out it was human noise.
he said i only like these rooms when they are filled with your laughter.
"""funny thing. i just got back from the centre of the universe. i didn't see you anywhere."" unknown"
promises are a trap.
"stop worrying about other people and study yourself. it's where you'll find peace, wisdom and clarity."
lovely days with the people you love.
"sometimes people walk away from something that isn't bringing them peace. they don't announce it or talk about. they just take a different road. there's no need to follow them or tell all your friends. just leave them alone. if they wanted you to come, they'd have held out a hand"
"the freedom of loving who you are without shame. of not wanting (or trying) to be like anyone else. of accepting some will not want to share your enlightened space, but knowing the right people are around you."
stay clear of people who go to church on sunday but wouldn't piss on a motherfucker if he was on fire.
i love you so much more than i love looking for an exit.
the things you buried rot in the ground. nothing grows from the corrupt dirt.
"sadness grew inside me, and for a while i could not tell us apart."
"resistance is a paradox. to resist the present moment will surely bring about suffering, but to rebel against injustice is the only way history will change."
"so i thank it quietly. and i know, like an old friend. i will see those memories again."
"and the difference is, i can breathe when it's beside me. it reminds me of everything i have. of who i've become in spite of such tragedy. it reminds me i've walked long roads to be free of who i was. it reminds me not to look back because the only things worth seeing lie ahead."
"i sit alone with the sadness when it comes. i don't mind, because no one understands it but me. i cry for everything i've lost. my two brothers, my parents, and the youngest parts of myself. it's not unwelcome anymore, because i know it won't stay. i won't let it."
some of the best advice i was ever given: i love you are just words too.
i take pictures because some things are too beautiful to only be looked at once.
just us and the open road.
the well of his mouth. overflowing with love.
memories. like an ache in your bones when it rains.
"sometimes people are afraid of another's truth, but will gladly deny their own."
friday night magic.
we should have stayed in the asylum. it's terrifying out here.
there is something about the night that i can never leave alone.
i wish your mind didn't lie to you.
that anger you feel. it's the truth hurting your ego.
i love you. please hold the parts of me that don't exist yet.
i'm sorry that fear holds your hand tighter.
proud misfit.
"the first time i saw your eyes, i knew i wanted to miss you."
"infp people: want to heal the world but struggle with the reality of it. come into my space. i'm sorry i can't breathe around this many heartbeats. i love you and i'm tolerant, but not about injustice. it was great seeing you. please leave, i need my quiet time now."
"i've hiked with my kids since they learned to walk. they call the forest, the calm place."
we are all an audience of one. each with a different interpretation of the play.
"omg! person x stopped liking my tweets. what a monster! i better share with everyone else what a monster they are too. i'll embellish the story based on how this makes me feel and not any actual facts, because of course i've never spoken to them. how dare they, right?!"
i could not define anyone if i am not prepared to label myself.
only you can do that.
the buried things will push through the earth because they are screaming for you to see them.
"big up to anyone trying to cope with trauma, depression, whatever it is. it's all you. we all heal differently, but we got this."
"i am a work in progress &amp; i always will be, but there is an ocean of difference between who i was then and the woman i am today. i love my dad. sometimes i even miss him. i could never say that before because i was so full of anger towards him. most importantly tho, i love myself"
"there was a freedom in this realization. i decided to stop crying and put everything i had into becoming the person i wanted to be. that person still had a bad childhood. i can't change that, but i have painfully accepted it over and over again."
"everything hurt all the time. i cried endless tears for that little girl. i tried to fit in. i wanted so much to be 'normal.' but i wasn't like anyone else. i was me, and i could either make something of her or lie down in defeat. well fuck that."
"i had horrible unhealthy coping mechanisms. i allowed people to use me because i thought any attention was love. i had no boundaries, and when i did try to create them, people easily knocked them down."
"child abuse robbed me of so many things. suddenly i was an adult trying to navigate, love, trust, self esteem, confidence and stability for what felt like the first time. i had no idea how to be an adult because i'd never been a child."
this smile comes from a true place now. i am proud of myself for that.
all of the reasons i love you. all of the things i never need to explain.
bad days used to last for months. not any fucking more.
i don't explain. i never have.
the child in me doesn't hurt anymore. she runs through the forest with me. she is why i'm not afraid.
pain is only a memory away.
please remember that everything you read is an opinion. based on a perspective. based on how a person has been treated and raised. based on a reality that may be entirely different from yours. take what you need. ignore what you don't.
new age bollocks.
beautiful things carved from centuries of torment.
"sometimes people will try to convince you what you're feeling is wrong. that it is based in fear or insecurity. if something is consistently pulling at you, or it just doesn't feel right. please listen to it, not them."
"the roads aren't paved and the signs have fallen, but we keep walking anyway."
this terrible beautiful ache. please don't ever leave me alone.
"the beautiful agony of waiting, when everything inside you is screaming to let go."
my boyfriend is out with his son tonight. they've been going to a movie together every week since he was 11 years old. he's 24 now. they are adorable. love them both so much.
"we are all filled with melancholy &amp; error. take my hand, and i will love you anyway."
do not share the things your heart cannot do without.
the problem with twitter is people think you're writing about someone on twitter.
you can be confident and humble. you can also have fierce self respect and be kind.
true humility is not thinking less of yourself: it is thinking of yourself less. c.s. lewis.
"the need to convince people stems from insecurity. yours, not theirs."
we need more love. tell me something you like about yourself. or a compliment you've received. or something another person loves about you.
it's a beautiful day to be in love with reality.
tonight my boyfriend and i both looked for my glasses for ten minutes before realizing they were on my head. we function quite well as adults otherwise.
i'm sorry. i don't go quietly.
"i struggle to remember how it feels to be hurt by love, and this is the greatest gift i wish for every human to know."
the kind of love that doesn't go inside when it rains.
"we sit and watch the day end, like two people who've known each other far longer than this. like two people who can no longer imagine watching the world fade alone."
the city is lonely at night. the people are loud because they want to disappear.
"i opened many doors that hurt, before finding a room i was meant to be in."
"some truths are on a different level of consciousness, and not everyone will be ready to hear."
"people will misinterpret you often, but please don't change your voice."
"this is why i like cemeteries. some graves are over a hundred years old, and even ghosts ought to know they are loved."
"i look for ruins. with the hope whoever left them behind, knows they're not forgotten."
"we found an old door. he said i want to buy it for you, so every day you step on a love letter as you open it."
the old world. where we wrote our hearts on paper and slipped them through a hole in the door.
"your energy has changed, but have you."
being happy now doesn't mean i don't remember how it felt to be terribly sad.
"a good place takes a long time to get to, but i'm so glad i found it."
"it took me a long time to realize as much as i loved being alone, i desperately needed validation from others. when people left, so did my happiness. this was a self imposed cage, and it wasn't until recently i learned to be free of it."
"you are there under the wreckage. you are beautiful and worthy. it is a privilege to love someone. it is also their privilege to love you. it's not easy, and the hardest part is actually seeing and absorbing that. please, start looking. always peace."
"what it has done for me is allow me to be more mindful, to set healthy boundaries because i'm worth that. i recognize my insecurities now and realize not everyone sees the world through my filter. you have to want to change and start acting on how."
is there a definitive answer? no. is it beneficial to be in a healthier state of existence before we enter into a serious relationship? yes. because even though it may still frighten you. it will enrich you. you will allow the love in.
"when we constantly focus on the things about ourselves we hate, all that shit will eventually manifest throughout every relationship we engage in. work, family, partners, everyone."
"personally, the term 'self love' makes me cringe, but there's no other way to say it. it's a journey that never ends. it's working with yourself daily to accept and be more comfortable with who you are."
"our relationships suffer because we need constant reassurances. we feel unworthy of anyone's affection. believe me, i was the fucking queen of this. we don't have a clear understanding of people's love for who we are. we question it, because how could anyone love me? am i right?"
"it's about having more compassion for yourself as a human being. when we don't, we project our insecurity onto others. we take things personally or as criticism, because that's how we see ourselves."
"self love isn't about being perfect or having your shit all figured out. i sure as fuck don't. it's an appreciation and acceptance of who you are. triggers, vulnerabilities, insecurities. all of it. we make an effort to love and care for other people. now turn that effort inward."

i abhor injustice and cannot relate to anyone who chooses to stand beside it.

"she said i'm not the only one who feels this way, but i might be the only one who isn't afraid to tell you."
i like people who are worn with history. who have the courage to speak their terror out loud.
an obsession with old doors.
"sometimes when people feel bad, they try to make those around them feel worse."
i love you. please let me walk your heart home.
i was a child with old bones. she who lived in me had led a troubled and violent life.
"i live beside the cemetery. you have no grave, but i talk to you there."
"if you don't like someone, leaving them alone and getting on with your life is a thing."
i am not hurting you by doing nothing. it's what your imagination perceives of the nothing that causes pain.
"not everyone agrees with the love yourself first theory and that's okay. it's personally what healed me before i could truly give love to someone else. honestly, anything can work, unless it's hurting other people. then we need to try something else. always peace."
i read hamlet when i was 13. this struck me even then. i read it often. thoughts are temporary too.

"falling in love with different people over and over is like a disease. one that rests in your heart, and you must love yourself first to heal it. i'm sorry if your mind isn't ready for this."
i used to ache with vacancy. now i don't know where to put all this love.
i got here on my own. which is why i'm able to open my heart and share this view with another.
"i often don't know where i'm going, but i know i'll meet you there."
"i woke to trees and sunshine. to a tall dark, very handsome man making me breakfast over the campfire. hello beautiful day."
"we dislike the truth so much, we often don't trust the people who tell it."

i am no longer infected with memory.
"everything experiences some sort of death, but we make homes in the ephemeral anyway."
i'm sorry. i just can't take you seriously anymore.
driving into the mountains always takes my breath. doing it with the people you love most in the world. there's nothing better.
i knew i would love you because we have the same bones.
our irrelevance in the universe.
you are the opposite of truth.
i left myself. i became a stranger with who i used to be.
you are frozen. you are filled with the horror of yesterday.
turn around. the new paths are this way.
"when the days run out and i gather up everything close to me, your hands will be the first thing i touch."
"tbh, she doesn't interest me much anymore either. i will always be grateful, but she represented a very sad &amp; difficult past. letting her/that go, is my biggest growth."
and he did. raine doesn't interest him and i couldn't be happier about that.
i didn't want someone to fall in love with my words anymore. i wanted them to fall in love with me.
"i think that's the thing about being with the right person. you can be true to yourself and each other. you can have your solitude, your quirks and differences, and absolutely love &amp; adore one another through all of it."
"since my divorce, i haven't loved or trusted anyone enough to take next steps. i fiercely preferred my solitude over the thought of living with anyone. that's all changed with him. i want to open that door. i want it to take forever for us to walk home."
anywhere that he isn't feels like a strange place.
"when you change, i might believe that you are sorry."
wisdom and new life.
"canada is so vast. we drove five hundred kilometres north on a one lane highway. nothing but trees, a few wolves, and each other. coming from a city like london, it still takes my breath away every time."
"you can do whatever the fuck you want. you can also have a spine, and deal with the consequences."
we drive around looking for things everyone else has forgotten.
forgotten.
"the thing i've learned with love is, so little of it is about the falling."
"where the water is shallow, and the veils are thin."
i wish i could tell you stories of all the cities i fell in love with. of all the homes they made inside me. of all the languages i did not know i could speak.
stop holding people like they're not allowed to leave the room.
it's so hot my eyelashes are sweating.
i dream of forests and wake with leaves in my hair.
"the distance you keep to feel comfortable, and to also not be alone."
the quiet ones with a lot to say.
sometimes it only looks like an obstacle.
human A is sad. they find human B and are suddenly happy. human B leaves. human A goes back to being incredibly sad. i hope you see the problem with this picture.
we keep finding beautiful things.
"his eyes are sea blue, but not the light colored waves that lap the shore. they are of distant waters only the night can reach."

"i've stood there before, but only rotten things grew from the landscape."
sometimes people are obvious. it bores me.
my childhood in a painting. artist: xue wang.
"i am the common theme in every disaster, but it's never my fault."
"idk who i feel worse for. grown folk who blame everyone else for their situation, or the other grown folk who believe them."
i want to kiss all those dirty prayers from your mouth.
you can say your truth without being hostile. the truth of another is not less than yours.
this is not a bad thing. it's a real thing. it doesn't mean we can't dream and strive for great things. we spend 90 percent of our time in reality. make IT liveable. make it a happy and peaceful place. stop grasping for unreachable people &amp; things. look inside your own hands.
don't listen to society. it's more than okay to have your own definition of happiness and success. it's also acceptable and realistic to understand your limitations and work them into your plan.
"you don't have to convince people of the horror existing in others. you only have to wait, because eventually they show it themselves."
he picked her up carefully. every piece mattered.
hypocrisy is a plague.
"the keys are rusted, and i can't remember when i wanted to touch those doors."
"i will always speak the truth, even if i'm alone in it. my tiny voice screaming, lost to the roaring wind."
"you cannot love someone whole. it will never be enough if they are empty of self love and inner peace, and that is a deeply personal journey we must fulfil alone."
society hates the truth. we need more people who are willing to speak it.
"severe weather warning from environment canada, and the first thing that comes to mind... is my camera charged?"
wrote a poem on the window of a dirty car and made him lick the dust.
put on your favorite dress and ask to dance with the sea.
"the map is torn where the road ends. i will love you there, in the nothingness, in the place of broken light."
nicoletta ceccoli
"when there is distance, people can hide the truth and fill the space with meaningless words."
non attachment has nothing to do with detachment or apathy. it is to love people in the purest and brightest light.
accept what is without effort. let what isn't leave with grace.
love is not continual self sacrifice or putting another's needs before your own.
i've never given less fucks. my old nan would be proud.
sometimes we receive attention and mistake it for love. attention is what we need when the rooms in us feel empty. love is what we give when those parts of us feel whole.
"i keep telling him to write a book, and anytime i feel sorry for myself, i scratch my own nose. i love you baby, to all the moons and back again."
"a year ago he suffered a spinal injury at work and for 28 days was paralyzed from the chest down. he had to learn to walk again, to do everything we take for granted again. for a while, he couldn't even scratch his own nose."
my boyfriend is one of the most inspiring people i know. his ex wife cheated and left him to raise their 3 children. he worked construction 60+ hours a week and stacked shelves on weekends to put his son through film school and pay for his daughter's wedding.
fix is not a word i subscribe to.
"if you hurt someone, you don't get to judge the validity of their feelings. you also needn't apologize for who you are. a paradox perhaps. a fragile balance."
how many times it's a mistake vs maybe it's just the truth of who you are.
"orphan of the sea, of things locked in old rooms."
"honesty, and to accept its consequence gracefully."
"dear longing, i have to let go of your hand because i've found everything i need in his."
a little escape from unpacking.
"tell people you love them. don't wait for a day that isn't promised. don't allow the past to walk with your future. don't punish yourself or anyone else for mistakes other people have made. this is what you have in your hands. love it, drown in it &amp; if it doesn't work, let it go."
imagine moving on with your life. imagine being full enough to not harm people even if you don't like them. imagine owning your truth and not blaming the world for your tragedy. imagine being emotionally mature enough to let go. imagine.
"i hope you've a good memory, so you can remember all those lies."
moving to a loft in the arts district today. excited beyond words!
"i love your truth. i love the way your laughter sounds when the room is dark. i love this light we've made, and how it fills our old wounds."
i can't go out tonight. i'm walking my ravens. art. talaina fisher.
"if something doesn't add up, walk away, don't waste energy trying to count."
she is a beautiful creature of sea and light.
"i love you, and i'm sure the sun takes longer to set because of it."
"a sign on the door says, welcome. behind me is a place where the past no longer exists."
a clock with no hands.
i'll walk gently through your forest. i love you and all the beauty you hide there.
"once i killed my ego, i truly felt alive."
you're no longer behind any of the doors i open.
beautiful things will always make me cry. the human heart included.
"i'm odds and ends, but that's me i'm stumbling away, slowly learning that life is okay."
"sun, water and beautiful forest air."
fear is also a choice. perhaps freedom lies in not listening to what it has to say.
love everything like this. (artist unknown.)
"tomorrow is a big day for him. i love you. you are stubborn and beautiful. you can do this. you will do this. i am right here, cheering until my lungs burst."
act with aggression and i am gone before you've even finished what you're trying to say.
"your lungs are a garden. as you move through life, some will steal flowers. weeds will grow. do not search for the lost pieces, they are forever changed. put your hands in the dirt, water yourself, and know that everything you need is growing inside of you."
"a lake, a sunset and him. (and 30 degree weather)"
"we are both wanderers. sometimes we walk in silence. sometimes we talk until our tired voices become a whisper. always, we hold hands."
"i wish i could show you how everything you need is within you, but these are things you have to feel with your own eyes."
the ego is heavy. take it off and wear love.
all of the ephemeral beauty we ignore because we're looking for something certain.
she has a voice that could make war sound kind.
a beautiful day travelling the back roads of alberta.
pessimism will follow you everywhere if it's all you choose to see.
the only thing that survives without attention is time.

villains playing victim.
people.
at some point you have to decide if you're committed to being a victim or to growth.
i love my baby so much. he listens to me like it's the first time he's heard another human voice.
how old are you?
"i feel unstoppable, and the only person i'm competing with, are former versions of myself."
"once you're able to accept yourself, without judgement, you can give others the same."
i am filled with beginnings and the beautiful mystery of change.
"if the narrative doesn't change, neither will you."
"i've suffered with insomnia on and off for years. when i'm with my boyfriend i sleep like a baby, and that is the overwhelming beautiful fucking power of love."
where do you go when you're trying to find who you are.
you don't look at a beautiful forest and want to change it. maybe love is learning to see people through those same eyes.
the line between pride and arrogance is thin.
"hello, i hope you love yourself without shame today."
"you make the world so beautiful it's crushing, but when i can't breathe i feel no pain."
"nobody owes us anything. not a person or the universe, but perhaps we owe it to ourselves to realize this."
people move on. their interests change. they choose different paths. these are not crimes. allow people the power to pursue themselves gracefully. allow yourself the gift of doing the same.
creating a reality i actually don't want to run from.
i hope you let the light touch you today.
i think there's so many people who don't realize they're actually choosing it all.
"some memories do not lose their way, and they will find you until the light runs out."
perhaps character is how you exist when disaster has filled your hands.
"i have never needed much. a small forest, and to know intimately the hearts of my trees."
"the divine comedy was written in 1320. the book of disquiet in 1888. the brothers karamazov, 1880. this is why 'dead poets' are still so relevant. their thoughts were years before their time. thoughts that we still try to understand and translate today."
i hope you're in love with your own bones.
keep hating me. maybe it will help you heal what you detest so deeply about yourself.
i only want to put effort into what brings me peace. into the people i love. i'm leaving all that doesn't matter behind.
"wild we are, and graceful af about it."
a voice like soft light.
"you, the engineer of your own annihilation."
"""life should be lived to the point of tears."" albert camus."
"if you've been broken and have not broken other people, you are more whole than you realize. if you were not loved, but have gifted someone with yours, you are capable of more than you can imagine."
"sunsets, wine and people i love."
"being entirely comfortable with who you are allows you to feel vulnerability in the right circumstance. as opposed to fear, which makes you feel vulnerable in every circumstance."
super fun night exploring with my girls. (my daughter's picture)
"i press my face against the dirt, and tell the forest i'm in love."
"i wish i could reach the sea floor, but loneliness is all its ever known."
"you're so beautiful, where did you come from? i'm sure not anyplace i know."
the sun will set soon. wait with me.
i don't measure myself against other people. i only want to be a better version of who i was yesterday.
love and truth.
"not everyone will understand you, because sometimes you'll speak in a language they haven't learned yet."
'and she is paralyzing.' fleurie - there's a ghost.
"things on my mind: the smell of damp forests. naked trees against the sky, and how love tastes when i drink it from your mouth."
plot twist: your therapist is a psychopath.
i have seen days darker than you. i have survived nights more lonely than the end of the world.
another night of beautiful discoveries.
i don't judge you for what you choose to put in your stomach and why. so piss right off with the nasty comments about veganism.
"our experiences, especially during childhood teach us about love. what love means to one might be a foreign language to another. love is universal, but each person has to discover the healthiest version of it on their own."
he said you're the person i want to stare at when we have nothing but time and stars.
i wish i spoke a thousand languages so i could tell you i love you in all of them.
we aren't meant to stay for long.
"be like the rain and the leaves. let yourself fall, because you are  beautiful, even when your heart is kissing the ground."
"hello, please stop thinking you have people all figured out because of their thoughts on this medium. this is only a microcosm of an entire existence they allow us to see."
he looks at me as if i'm the only thing that exists. like his heart would break if i ever turned away.
"a love that i have craved, and did not give up believing its existence. you, in every way, have given it to me."
his hand never leaves mine.
"i don't look back, you hurt me there."
"as a child i dreamt of your footsteps. my little arms clung to the open window, but there was nothing. only a dark street and the wind."
perpetual self justification will distort your reality until the only one in it is you.
"you'll find life's shittiest truths here. i have lived everything i write. tragedy, darkness, love, deep pain &amp; unhappiness. i own it all &amp; none of it scares me anymore. it's taken me a long time &amp; a lot of hard work to find the light, and i finally believe it will never go out."
"you can show, people who you are, but not everyone will believe you. they want you to be something that makes them feel better about themselves."
your pain does not give you the right to bully or hate on someone else.
all that rage can't be good for you.
the trees are always calling. a voice that has settled in my bones.
"i used to cringe at the thought of social functions. now i just think, fuck it. this is me, take me or leave me."
i will not give this love a stage. it is far to precious to share.
"today was beautiful, and i want you to be in all of them."
"he said your body is young, but your heart was born in a different century."
words and fantasy do not last long. especially when veils are thin.
we walk hand in hand. we talk until the miles disappear. we capture beauty and each other.
crimes committed in the light.
that didn't take long. it never does.
i often dream of little boats. their tiny voices lost in the howling wind.
"you were a map, when i didn't even realize i was lost."
it's the end of the world. i want to love you until the stars die. until the floods recede to a single drop of rain.
"we wrote of forests, and then burned them all down."
you may never know peace when everything you seek it in lives outside of yourself.
i will love you on the days your heart has nothing to wear.
"over my lifetime i've given up eating meat, fish, smoking, dairy, sugar, toxic people and environments. i've abandoned words like guilt, shame and should. i cling to no false beliefs about happiness or love. in all of this i've found peace. in all of this, i found me."
"i love you, and i'm here if you ever lose your way."
i love him too much to hold him tightly.
everything was loud and i could not find my way.
every night we waited until the moon fell into the ocean.
fuck revenge. no motherfucker is worth the energy.
the best revenge is to remove the word from your vocabulary.
every ending is an arrival to somewhere else. you may have to release your grip several times until you find what you're meant to hold.
"tonight the sky is ours, and the stars have never been more alive."
you guys are beautiful!
"we can write endless threads hating on something and not feel ashamed of ourselves, but are shy to express love."
spread some love. everyone needs it.
"say something nice to someone who inspires you. whose writing you like, anything and pass it on."
sometimes words return to me.
"your fence is broken, but the wildflowers make it look beautiful."
"love is an infinite numbers of things, and i think problems arise when we try to define it."
i'll speak the truth to all of your faces.
"in love with forgotten things, and those rotten with abandon."
to leave the doors open and live amongst the light.
these old wooden boards have known no other stories than the ones told by your shoes.
memories rotting in the room upstairs.
"a box of photographs you don't look at. rusted hinges, because you can't bring yourself to open the door."
people will paint you in a way that makes their self hatred suffer less.
i need to wander the forest and share nothingness with you.
i am not fond of religion. i choose no social construct to define me.
i find myself often discovering the core of people. they don't like that.
he is the solid ground and the dream above the sky.
let the road vanish behind you.
you don't have to visit yesterday.
morrissey and his beautiful metaphors saved my dark teenage nights.
i want to wander old cities. i want to breathe the ancient air.
i want to kiss all the pieces you can't bring yourself to love.
"some will leave when you're at your worst, others can't handle when you change for the better."
i have opened doors to him i didn't know were closed.
"loving and respecting yourself first is not a selfish act, it's a necessary one."
"i fall in love with him, more (and again) every single day."
"everything is a choice, be a grown up and own the consequence."
"i am a peaceful person, but no longer a quiet one."
"not tolerating abusive behavior is a good thing. and when the person tries their very best to hurt you because of it, you know you've made the right choice."
i let him inside my heart. he wandered around and asked if he can stay.
"""big egos are big shields for lots of empty space."" diana black."
"you died, but no one has buried you yet."
"i still feel everything deeply, but i am not attached to the outcome of everything i experience. it is the human ego that makes us believe we can control things, not our true consciousness."
"sometimes i return to the place in me that was abandoned, but the voices no longer echo. there is no more madness living in the walls."
a map of imaginary things. a box of memories that don't exist.
fuck off. i'm happy in real life.
"we judge others in the same way we hate to be judged, and this is our fragile humanity."
country roads. clear skies and the warmth of his strong hands.
i can't think of a better person to explore insanity with.
sleep in the womb of the universe with me. lay your head on the soft blanket of time.
"i am reduced to my core, and i have never loved myself so much."
let the ash slip through your fingers. feel the memories of everything you've burned.
"he was an october sunrise, and it hasn't set since the day he touched my hand."
"you wish you were alone, but there are ghosts, there are echoes."
you arrive into this world as carefully folded light.
perpetual unhappiness is believing the same ideas will work over and over when they've proven not to. we don't change because this is the way we've always done it. we don't grow because we are clinging to illusions.
"non attachment is a pure and beautiful concept. it is not an absence of love. it allows you to view the world as it really is, not through the eyes of your learned ideas about it. it is a complete freedom from the cages of expectation. it is how i've learned to breathe."
the sea of relentless terror.
i'm sorry if your mind isn't ready for this.
"certainty. security, and permanence are all illusions. the only constant you can believe in is change."
i love you. please sit here quietly with me until the world runs out of light.
praying to fraudulent gods in churches made from purloined stone.
the fraudulent gods you seek.
what will you leave here when the endless night dawns.
sometimes there is more horror than refuge.
the beautiful gift of surrender.
"a togetherness, of all the strangers you have been to yourself."
to be human is a paradox. a soft fleshy machine powered by illusions.
i found an entrance to something beautiful.
"i can only believe in the present, and the knowledge it will change. this is how i found my freedom."
"infinity doesn't have to be vast. it can be the light in his eyes, or the sound of his breath when he's sleeping."
i think you open a door to happiness when you let go of the idea that it includes security and permanence. when you accept the ephemeral nature of all things.
"people will keep asking you to explain yourself, until you touch on something they want to hear."
"when i'm with him, i want time to have slow hands."
"he didn't mention anyone, and neither did i."
whoever they tell you about the first time you meet them is usually the person they haven't let go of.
feral little whore.
please show yourself kindness and respect. stop talking to people who aren't listening. stop reaching for empty hearts and phantom hands.
"wanting him aches. missing him hurts, but his love never pains me."
"there are quiet rooms inside of me, and you are the first person i've given a map to."
"some of my past is hideous, but it's still more beautiful than a lie."
tell me everything and watch me stay.

"this is beyond beautiful. gourock, scotland. photographer: glasgowdave on ig."
"i'm not afraid of my darkness, and i am not afraid of you."
i have been a villain and a hypocrite. i have been completely selfless and kind.
i want to give a voice to things that have no reason. to anyone whose mouth is too afraid to speak.
"i have gone from the person who fiercely defended you, to understanding why you were attacked."
people claim to like a strong voice until you have one.

fuck me against these crumbled walls of madness. of where it all began.
"today my privacy was infringed upon because of the shitty actions of another person. and this is the crap side of social media. people hurting people because they have an email account, a computer and a gaping void inside them that they fill by being dishonest online."
the way your voice breaks when you talk about things you love.
i heard your voice between my thighs.
"all the pretty hearts you broke, crawling out from beneath their silence."
abundant knowledge will always amount to suffering.
the erosion of things. the gentle collapse of time.
he makes my heart happy and my skin burn.
"i wish every heart peace, but watch me become a burning tower if you try to interfere with mine."
"you're just a sinner i am told be your fire when you're cold make you happy when you're sad make you good when you are bad  i'm not a human i'm a dove i'm your conscious i am love all i really need, is to know that you believe  prince rogers nelson"
"hate doesn't deserve an audience, but in order to fight it, we often have to give it one."
"a little bit of fight, courage and grace."
infp people: always searching. endlessly curious. you'll start wars if you're passionate enough about it. you want to heal the world but no one's listening. nature makes more sense than the human hand. you always root for the underdog. you are the underdog. i love you.
not many people survive my curiosity.
when he calls you in the middle of the day just to say i really fucking miss you.
"i've never met you, or spent any time with you, but you can trust me, and i promise i'll make all your dreams come true.  the world gone mad."
he said how will i find you. i said i'll hang the moon outside my window.
"you cannot wait for someone who keeps promises, for someone who might love and understand every single part of you. we are too human to meet such expectations and disappointment will often be your path."
"every night we love before the dreams take us, before i rest my head on his beating heart."
midnight is so fragile. she weeps with you. she understands the rot inside your core.
she is an orphan of the sea. of forgotten prayers still pressed between decayed palms. she is an imagined promise of tomorrow.
i am a widow. i have finally destroyed the past.
"a quiet moment with the cats after a long ass day. i'm covered in hair and sneezing but gosh i love them. next stop, taxi service for my teenage girls. i bet you didn't know i was this rad."
"her palms bled, and i swear i could smell flowers."
"i dreamt of an open window, and escaped my childhood home. i walked until the woods met the water. i filled my pockets with stones, and forever buried your memory, deep in the burning sea."
"i will look at you deeper than anyone ever has. i'll study your hands and the changing colors in your eyes. i'll tell you what i see, and you will finally believe that you are beautiful."
"when you realize it's you who is home, that you will not give away that key, but will happily let him stay forever."
"don't compare your pain. never promise to fix theirs. lie with them when it's too hard to stand up. love them harder, when they have turned all the mirrors away."
"you can only bury the past once it's behind you, because it will find a way to crawl from the grave."
"everyone is a traveler, and there are very few i care to know."
"he said i will love you so hard, you'll wear your heart on the tip of your tongue."
"he is all the things i feel, but am not yet ready to say."
"things i've learned. narcissistic people have an inflated idea of their significance. they think everyone is watching, that everything is about them. they don't realize this only exists in their own mind."
"again, you have loaded your own gun."
"happiness is complicated. your life experiences may have made it difficult to pursue. redefine your version of it everyday if you have to. today it might be getting out of bed, &amp; that is fucking ok. make manageable goals until you can cope with more. it's all you &amp; your two hands"
catastrophe will always remind us how terribly human we are.
"sometimes we walk through the forest at night. the air is cold, but his hand is warm, and how i could stay here, until the earth ran out of reasons to live."
"we, the night people. the curious lovers of danger."
we are the same you and i. we fly with the ravens and stand with the trees.
"i was built to wander, and every time i do, i fall in love."
"child of cruel beginnings. of vacant rooms, of savage seas."
"don't be afraid of yourself. learning the deepest parts of who you are is a call to freedom. listen to what speaks to your core, and if you can't hear it, it's not meant for you. focus on what is. open a channel of energy for those who are drawn to your light."
i'm sorry. your wars do not interest me.
we stay up and listen to the night. he is the poem inside the darkness.
"our little boats against insurmountable waves, but still we go into the water."
i am drawn to old pictures. to things that gather dust.
we don't speak of permanence. it is a promise no human can make.
watching the man you love go about his business is sexy af.
i watch him when he turns away. i learn so much by the way he moves. i've never heard such beautiful silence.
do not share with the world anything your heart can't do without.

we registered my daughter for high school today and she drove us home from there. i need to slow down time!
he's reading crime and punishment. he gets it. he loves it. he pushes his glasses up to look at me between pages. i fall in love with him more everyday.
"sometimes our past is tragic, but life doesn't have to be. it might include things people would rather turn away from, but never let that silence your voice."
i told him i like the quiet so he picked up the city and hung it from the sky.
you can do anything. you can change negative patterns and replace them with healthy ones. i changed because loving people believed in me.  i believe in you.
"for the first time in many years, i truly stood on my own. i was happy wearing my skin. i let go of ideals and expectations, and also some people. i decided the only moment i could control was this one."

"having children of my own was my first big step to healing. i'm overwhelmed everyday at how much i love them. i drive them crazy with constant hugs and kisses. i am their biggest fan, and no matter what, i always will be."
"i searched for the my father's love in the most unhealthy ways, but nothing filled the void."
"as the years went by my brothers became men and fought back. i left home at 16. it's because of my brothers, i know good men exist."
"i lost myself in the woods across from our house. i read books and started writing at a young age. in those stories, i was invincible. no one could hurt me."
"i asked myself over and over, what have i done wrong? my world was not safe. there was no stability or consistency. this is devastating to a child's development."
"i loved my dad. i wanted him to love me too, but he was so disappointed i was a girl. instead of love, he drank and beat us almost every single day."
my family and my boyfriend are helping me with some things. i've cried off and on all day because of their love and kindness. they're laughing at me now. i can't stop hugging them. there is no end to our love for each other.
"i could not escape your loneliness, because you called it by a different name."
"how tragic, to only remember and exist."
"self care is healthy and necessary, even if it means leaving people behind."
"don't tell people to fix themselves. they aren't broken pieces of furniture. healing is a long and personal process. give them support, space and time. don't judge them, and if you can't be nice, fuck off."
rid yourself of anything that isn't a part of your arrival.
the wet road under the streetlights.
again we have talked until the night became us. until our eyes are drowsy with dreams.
and i feel infinitely more healthy at this revelation.
"i'm still a dreamer, but it seems bizarre to want a forever with someone you've never met."
"his hands are strong. his heart is soft. his jaw has edges, and i am so fucking in love."
the sea will spill from your eyes no more.
"reality is something you can only escape temporarily. it's a healthy thing to do, but you cannot stay there. invest fiercely in yourself so your reality is a safe and  comfortable place to be."

kananaskis country.
"i'll do anything for someone i care about. literally anything. until they fuck me over, and then i attend their funeral in my head."
"orphans we are, of everyone who didn't want us. of all the things we couldn't have. rich we are, from everything that is meant to seek out our light."
you are surrounded by people who are meant to see your light. don't chase anyone who chooses to live in darkness.
"please remember that some people are suicidal, are battling with mental illness, are barely making it through the day. try your best not to add to their war."
"i received @elfincharms book today. the missing light on shorter days. thank you dew for writing it. here is a reading of her beautiful poem, i might cry."
"i have put so much of my past to rest recently. i do not dream of it. i no longer hold its hand. i am not weighed down by its memories. i may never be completely free of it, but i can breathe."
i am unsure what to write when i don't feel loneliness and despair.
i think we'll just keep talking until there is no time left.

"please remember, not everyone who gaslights is a narcissist. it is a form of manipulation anyone is capable of."
"when you achieve a certain level of inner peace, you don't feel the need to be anything, to prove anything. you let go of what doesn't nourish you. you stand down to no one. you finally understand that others are privileged to have you in their life."
i wish i had left when i wanted to. i wish i had never ran back towards the flames.
he said i won't rest until i've filled every city with your laughter.
"i've never craved another human being so much, and it is the most beautiful fucking crazy madness."
"if we spent as much time on ourselves as we do judging and criticizing others, we would be infinitely better people. happier and more content people. humanity needs this. you need this."
drive faster. i miss you.
"i haven't seen him for two days, and everything is screaming."
i would live in this. like absolutely without a doubt.
"and remember, it is for YOU. all the beauty around you, including people, can enrich your life in the fullest and most amazing ways, but they can't make your life, they can't live your life. that's your creation. to nurture, water and grow into something that makes you happy."
"without peace, you're running down a road that never ends. heal your beautiful self first, and do it in a way that works for you. reach out to someone. therapy, exercise, cleaning, writing, screaming into a pillow. ANY place can be a starting point to healing."
"none of this is easy. happiness and success are long ass journeys, and they mean something different to each person. you also need to make peace with YOUR version of happiness. fuck what society says or what the person next to you is doing."
"sometimes healing ourselves is first about peace. i truly believe happiness will follow once you've made peace with your past, or whatever it is that's holding you back from being your most authentic beautiful self."
"if you feel empty, you will feel empty again once you realize this person was not made with magic potions to constantly fill you up."
"you cannot exist for another person, or for the love of another person. if you go down this road, you are almost guaranteed unhappiness. every breath, choice &amp; action you make is your responsibility and yours alone. no one has the power to make you happy at your core, only you."
"stop acting so self righteous. like you've never done a person wrong. like you're innocent, like you're the last kind person to exist. stop acting and be real. everyone has been a villain. everyone. don't deny your shadows, learn from them."
stop looking. nothing here is about you.
"the door hinges are rusted, but the memories will not decay. even time cannot grow new skin over wounds that are open."
if there is doubt. it's not love.
"he starts to take off his belt. i know soon it will be around my neck, and my mouth will be full of him."
it's a solid bond. it's not ever giving other people power to interfere in your private world. it's validating each others thoughts &amp; feelings even when you don't understand. it's standing by one another unconditionally. it's how we love.
i don't question why he loves me. i don't need to. we have the same values and ideas. we speak loyalty and trust in the same language. it's constant action. it's not letting each other down. it's effort &amp; understanding. it's the absolute knowledge that we put each other first.

"some people have no clarity of their inner self. they search for it in others, but it is a light no one else can hold."
"sometimes i hide in his hands, and sometimes i believe him when he says the world needs more of my light."
i want to be quiet and graceful. i want to disappear with the gentle flow of the wind.

"you are a beautiful forest, and i cannot see where the trees end."

no one wants your opinion on their closed doors. you weren't in the room.
it's okay to have a muse @Lanesbrew is often mine. strong. beautiful. gentle. real.

you have to learn to breathe alone or you will suffocate those around you.

"he has a gentle voice, a warm heart. my hand feels small wrapped inside his, and there is no comfort like his arms."
"i watch him brush his daughter's hair. his fingers trying to make sense of tiny braids. he tells her she's the most beautiful girl he's ever seen. she laughs and throws her arms around his shoulders, too wide for her little hands to meet. i am overwhelmed by their love."
"all of the red flags we ignore, because they look so beautiful dancing in the wind."

"he stands on the horizon with blue eyes and scarred hands. chase the light with me beautiful, chase it, until there is no light left."
the sad thing about betrayal is that it doesn't end with you.
"hurt, yes. surprised, no."
"some people twist the knife and still manage to convince the world, it is they who are bleeding."
"these are my thoughts, they don't have to be yours. generally my words encompass no one and everyone. society, or humanity as i see it. i might change my mind tomorrow, so take from it whatever makes sense to you, but know it isn't about you."
"""sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all."""
we can only be grounded in reality because that's 99% of who we are. the rest is escape. i hope we can all make it a healthy one.
omg! he/she gets me. i'm in love! you know who gets us? the people who put up with our shit everyday and still love us. the friend that stops by after a long ass day because they know you had a bad one.
"on social media we trust people we've never met, often in a short time. they make us feel interesting, intelligent, or desired. this is how strong the human need for validation has become. that we seek it from strangers. that we risk ourselves for the illusion of connection."
"last night i studied his hands, and then they learned my skin."
"be happy in new love, but never use it as an opportunity to degrade the person who held your heart before."
"give up the illusions attached to love. people are found beneath layers that are not revealed at your initial meeting of love at first sight, and you are not obligated to keep peeling them back. you are enough. you are not 'hard to love' if you don't stay."
"if love were easy, there wouldn't be so many poems about drowning and broken hearts."
we are beautiful mistakes. held under the light but never exposed.
"i will always hold you with hands of forgiveness, with adventure, wonder and love."
"there is a quiet place where love grows unannounced. where no strange hands are given access to its roots, and i have found it. i have found it here with you."
i've seen those tired words before. they're not poems. they serve a purpose.

"he said please don't try to define love, just let me show you what it feels like to me."
"feeling used is an awful thing, but i wonder if they needed something, more than i am impacted by the pain of their behavior."
"we hang on for selfish reasons. i don't claim to know what love is, but i know it isn't that."
worrying about how others choose to do their twitter seems like a lot of wasted energy to me.
"i cannot stay here, because even though you're gone, you still haven't left."
"i can do this. we can do this, and if no one is there for you, i will be.  peace."
"it's not sad, it's just real, and you never know what people are dealing with. i am so much more than this battle, and so are you. sometimes it's hard to focus on the whole parts of ourselves when so much is broken."
"so i don't talk much and let few people in. i'm becoming more self aware in terms of absorbing less negative energy, as opposed to trying to control the energy around me."
"sometimes it hurts to be me. not just the remembering, but because i cannot give people healthy love. i can't name what i grew up with but it wasn't that."
"in my everyday life i hide all of this which is also exhausting, but for some reason i let you see me."
"hyper vigilance is exhausting. it physically hurts my chest and creates complete chaos in my brain. it doesn't surrender, not even to sleep."

keep me out of your conversations if you have not had one with me.

abruptly cutting off a person who suffers from severe abandonment issues is probably one of the most intensely cruel things you can do.

"sometimes you can't help people, and all you can do is watch as they slowly dig their grave."
"it's child abuse and abandonment. it's more death anniversaries than I can count. it's my brother's blood on my clothes before he died. it's a whole lot of fucking shit and pain. fuck poetry. fuck labels. this is real life, and it's my life."

"i am enough and so are you. people stay because they want to, not because they're forced to. and CODEPENDENCY ISN'T LOVE. you can escape this cycle. it hurts like fuck and you have to be ready to face it, but you can do it."
"that somehow you will be enough. let me tell you what i've learned. this circus doesn't work, and i myself have lost people dear to me because of it, but today is not yesterday. my boyfriend is not my father. i will not suffer the same fates at his hands."
"you put unrealistic expectations and pressure on people, including yourself. somehow in your mind you are convinced that if you have control over this, you will feel better. that it will be different."
"if your parent didn't want you, how could anyone else? you can't separate the people in your life now to what happened then. you are often codependent because you convince yourself, if this person stays, it'll be okay. it will fill the void left by what happened during childhood."
"the thought of a person leaving begins to consume you. you question their every action, their motive for staying. you don't believe them because you were abandoned by the most important person to your existence, a parent."
"when you are abandoned as a child, you grow into an adult with very real, but irrational fears that everyone will leave. you are easily suffocated by love, but hold on too tightly to people you care about because of these fears."
"i can breathe here in the nothingness. there is no chaos or despair, but the walls are thin, and my arms ache from building."

"every choice i have made brought me here, and i will own this truth."
"sometimes i can't help but stare. his scarred hands wander over mine, and i feel his heart unclench."

i love you. please unclench your teeth and breathe again.

how sad a world of clenched teeth instead of held hands.
i keep going back to sit with the roots. fascinated by their ancient connections.

our minds are wired to repeat negative emotions and remember pain. what was god thinking?
"i opened my suitcase, it still smells of you."

"the thing is, you actually choose it all."

this is what eternity looks like.

you ask for rain and get a flood. do you still think that god answers prayers?
what is enough when you are empty of yourself?
lately i can't breathe unless i'm here.
my heart is a borderless planet. seek refuge there my love.
seeking asylum in the steady rhythm of his chest.
the tranquil melody of your sleeping breath.
i want to tell you how i'd rather kiss your mouth than watch it speak.
how fond we are of reliving our sorrows.
some tragedies have no song. there is only silence to fill the air.

i keep watering flowers that died long ago.
"last night the darkness wept, and when i asked her why she said, midnight is a prison, i cry, because i'll never meet the sun."

"i will go to the forest and lie with everything fallen. i will go to the sea, and tell her all i know about drowning on land."
"it's raining. the streets are empty, the houses asleep."
always torn between wandering and searching for a home.
all the magic happens in the forest.
"you want people to hear, but you speak like you're hiding."
i'm quite tired of being brave. i wouldn't mind retreating to a little corner of oblivion.
her breath is a ghost town. her heartbeat the bells of an abandoned church.

"when you are made of fragile branches, avoid those who look like the wind."
she's a pretty little mess and she only wants you to ruin her more.
"the truth is often hideous, but i will not turn away."

"the sea understands, because she cannot escape her own depths either."
your voice calms me when fear tries to talk louder than our love.

this garden is haunted. their voices are under the stones.
there is a secret planet that serves as a graveyard for dead stars and fading suns.
"everything was soft, and melting in his hands."
when you always return to the same place you found each other.

slowly found my sanity in the beauty of the forest floor.
"you are the only one who stands with me in loneliness, the only one i trust to dry my tears."
i burned the past. i flee its ashes.
"ghosts, who never change their method of haunting."
a fabricated existence where everything you have is stolen or borrowed.
the girl who couldn't feel thorns.
"the seas inside her are ancient, and this is why she writes in a language forgotten long ago."

silence is a state i rarely return from. the unsaid words lingering in the nothingness.
sea creature. dweller of the forest floor.
"perhaps when you bury something beautiful, it pushes through the dirt and wildflowers are born."

i don't think this path has many steps left. i have wandered it too long.
"my father always showed more care to strangers, and when he died, he died alone."
"any sentence that starts with ""if you love me"" is a trap."
"the freedom to be yourself, and to be loved for every mad atom that makes you."
your voice late at night. your sighs before you dream.
"houses made from driftwood, that was brave enough to reach the shore."
abandoned light.
"twitter: where adulterers give relationship advice, and narcissists tell us how the world needs to be kind."
"people run away from everything, to seek what's over the hill. a horizon they cannot see, but falsely believe is better."
you stretch your body like a flower blooming. the curtains yawn. the sun covers you in dappled light.
ty beautiful! @mnm67
"to my love. ty for being real, kind, honorable, decent, for yr commitment to always say the truth. for being humble &amp; authentic. i love you."
it's sad to create a complete fabrication of who you are. it's cruel to deceive others because you want them to believe it.
"i don't care what you've gone through, it doesn't give you license to mistreat other people."
perhaps the trees surrender. they put their backs against the sky.
"when you love and care, you show up. you don't just say, you let them see."
"i'm not here to be ""figured out"" or to cure anyone's loneliness. kindly fuck off if either is your motive."

it hurts when beautiful people don't know that they are. let's do everything we can to show them.
the only way we grow is when we turn towards the light.
perhaps letting go is the closing of many doors that were never really open.
stop building sandcastles so close to the sea.
some people will always be blind to the color of your light. don't try to make them see.
don't give too much of yourself away. you become an empty room.

"look into your corner. you will find me there, quietly celebrating every breath you take."
"it's not that i won't notice you, but i'm not here for that. i'm here to write, for me."
i no longer give people the chance to show me a second red flag.
there is pleasure in the pathless woods.
"in all my years of being a briton, i've never heard anyone say they fancied a spot of tea, but i've heard bollocks &amp; cunt said many times."

"i wish to live a simple life, where only nature surrounds me."
the magic waits for us.
"when all the hours have passed, and every truth has seen the light, i hope it's you who holds my hand."
silence isn't painful. the disconnection from the person you care about is.
"i think it's impossible to expect nothing, as long as you realize nothing will live up to what you expect."
you're welcome. your words are lovely. @CuteFaceAI

"it's okay to believe in shaping your own destiny, and also that the universe lends a helping hand."
be unpredictable. be authentic. compare yourself to no one.
why is nature so beautiful yet so full of rage.
"so i surrender myself to nature, to the elements, to some kind of fate."
turns out expectation is a human madness.
imagine the uproar if the sun expected payment for rising.
"humans suffer, because we walk every road expecting a different view."
how some of us see with so much more than our eyes.
my daughter told me she is drawn to the color of the light inside people. she said it's also the same reason she stays away.  she's 11.

"even kind hearts have agendas, and kinder people don't always realize this."
i don't want to be the type of person who only worships things when they die.

sext: sometimes i don't open my mail for weeks.
"strange people in my head, why do i let them in."

love is at its loudest when explored quietly and privately between the two of you.

"prob their saddest song. daughter,  landfill"
"intelligence is destined to suffer, open hearts to feel the most pain."
these are the same people who will blame anything but themselves for the consequences of their behavior.
"people who fuck up and act like the victim when they get caught. fuck you, try an honest apology, make the effort to explain."
my brothers and i.
"we were never afraid of being alone. abandoned was a place we knew well, and even tragedy can be a comfort when it's familiar."

i think growing up is just learning to let go of things that don't matter.
you are lovely &amp; worthwhile. you are someone's think outside of the box. you are someone's warm ride home in the rain.

haha x bats eyelashes. i love you.  @ShePlaysLoud
please do not involve me in your drama or petty wars. if i have something to say i'll say it here. it's called having a backbone.
it still fascinates me that some of you think i'm a teenager.
i relate to you on so many levels. @galiamango

press your palms to the forest floor and ask it for forgiveness.
tombstones cover the ocean floor.
a box by the bed for all the things you forgot to say.
violent little thing.
that isn't nostalgia. it's your heart aching for something you never had.
to hold the terror as if it were fragile. as if you can stop it from breaking your bones.
you cannot divide and conquer people. eventually someone will find their voice.
"if i havent told you lately what a wonderful friend you are, i'm reminding you today. @John_Whittemore"

you are breathtaking. i love you my sweet crazy sister across the other side of the world. @ShePlaysLoud
do you ever go back and touch the ashes just to feel the memories that you've burned.
the glow of firelight in your eyes.  the wood screaming as it burns.
"children of lamplight, of worn shoes, of harsh abandon."
"if you were flowers dying in hollow ground, i would make it rain, i would pull down the sun to warm you."
how long ago did sadness come and sit beside you. how many times have you asked her to leave.
i read about how every single person wrongs you and have to wonder who the real victim is.
nothing can become everything if we react to it enough.
L is so adorable! @Ben_in_yeg
ditto beauty x @wiltedwild
i woke with a feeling of emptiness because the space between us is filled with too many miles.
a sleepover at the morgue.
i love your eyes because of how they see people.
almost an exestenstial crisis. nearly a paradox.
the tragedy of the trees.
i'm not convinced of a tree's longing to become paper.
how can you worship the forest and have a towering shelf of books.
the shipwrecks look so pretty at night.
manic fairy poet womb.
his eyes had committed atrocities. started wars.
her eyes were the birth of the sea.
child of the sea. swamp. forest. night.
i preferred you manic.
a serial killer of words. your pages filled with savage crimes.
his eyes are rich forests. hers are a frozen sea.
often a person's distaste for you is just a reflection of their own self loathing.
you're too pretty to be human.

we keep looking for light in the same place that showed us darkness.
anchor yourself to a silent ocean.
one day the trees will not forgive you.
do not share anything sacred to you with the twitter dot com.
tell me how you'd burn an entire village just because i like the sound of flames.
i caught the sun through the trees in a mason jar. it glows green and gold. i have named it your eyes.
she is blue eyes. she is a relentless drowning.
your voice echoes in my head. your hands touch me from a thousand nights away.

"i am captivated by your sweet voice. your courage to always be yourself, and the honor with which you live each day. i love you."
"he is every path. every temptation, and all the love i have ever known."
"show me who you are he said, so i took him to the edge of the sea."
maybe love is when he holds the deep scars of your heart as if they have no edges.
he reminds me why the sky is beautiful.

"there's something beautiful about your soft voice in the darkness, and the need that pours from your hands."
she's just like nature. full of subtlety and rage.
"i try not to get distracted, i really do."
the trees will not wait for you. they have stood tall and alone for too long.
i will leave winter voiceless. i will watch as she screams beneath the ice.
"and when a hand reaches to save you, will you judge then the color of its skin?"
we will all be shipwrecked in the end. our little boats raging against death and the calling sea.
lay with me here on the sand. we can listen to the heartbeat of the sea.
"some people present themselves as an act of kindness, but their kindness is an act."

gentle souls and the way they feel the world.

"keeping the lights on, to remind her of the empty rooms."
she was the kind of place you went to but don't remember being gone.
the things you know but can't give voice to.
"the ghosts are trying to leave, but your bed is warm and the moonlight is so pretty."
some will leave gently and still leave an exit wound.
i know where you are. i've found you there before.
i wonder if the ocean floor craves light.
"i used to write so much about demons. fuck the demons. i have a past, and it only controls me if i let it."
imagine the countless shores the sea has abandoned. imagine the kind of darkness that lives on the ocean floor.
the paper boat you sail in. the tower you built from grains of sand.
Baudelaire was a poet. Pessoa was a poet. I just write shit on Twitter.  Perspective.
today i have to leave the house and act like an adult. terrifying.
you can't resist me. you're addicted to the way i wrap your words around my tongue.
"his eyes are the color of mountain lakes, the color of her. they are where she lives &amp; dies in a single moment."

i love your logic! x @WaterLilyDreams
his beauty makes me nervous. i hope i never stop feeling this way.
so much of our misery comes from trying to control our own destiny. i don't think life is pre planned but i'm learning to trust the universe
instead we hunt them to extinction and make them flee their natural habitat because of ocean noise pollution.
whales are graceful and peaceful despite their power. we should learn from them.
i'd rather be listening to whale song.
happy birthday beautiful soul. i love you xx @galiamango
some people are a closed door and you've no desire to find the key.
love is a bridge you never stop building.
distant galaxies exist that are over thirteen billion years old. let's show the universe some fucking respect.
the night sky is an ocean haunted by dead stars.
all the paths are better with you.
fuck me on the church steps. god's not watching anyway.
i want to love you in murderous ways.

good hearts.
"there are many reasons he loves me, but the beauty is in how he loves the things i'm not."
i can't sleep so i'm going to the forest and this is the madness that i am.
i'm not stable or consistent and my wings fell off long ago.
pretty desperation.
another night where the hours pass like centuries.
there are some corners you turn and the road behind you disappears.
"touch her as the leaves fall, and see who crumbles faster in your hands."
keep moving. i promise the light is there.
"if you love me, you will also love the forest &amp; the ocean. you will love the quiet rage inside of me &amp; everyday, chaos will hold your hand."

"as in, control what i can and fuck the rest."
"when we fly we relinquish all control, to the pilot, aircraft &amp; nature. might sound silly but i'm trying to apply this logic to everything."
still an idealist. still believe the world  can be healed with love.
"i'm sorry, but this forest is full."
"voice like a church choir, hands like a cardinal sin."
today i'll visit long forgotten graves. i'll lay a single flower and tell them i remember.
i want to fix everything that bleeds but the only power i have is love.
"you'll find her writing poems on cemetery flowers, and reading them to ghosts who aren't ready for goodbye."
a thousand cities longing to be named. cracked sidewalks praying that a story will fall through.
"people will go where they feel wanted, even if the door they walk through doesn't belong to them."
such pretty words from her little whore mouth.
mostly disgrace and a mouth that wants to swallow your sin.
we contemplated loneliness. the night our only audience. dead stars the only witness to our love.
"when she leaves, your bones will ache with vacancy, your paper heart will burn."
"the sea looks calm, but beneath the surface she is panic stricken."
when unfamiliar places won't stop calling your name.
write of how you'd burn cities just to reach me.
i love this wilt x @wiltedwild
your sweet voice and the world is okay.
the asylum walls still whisper her name. you want to leave but you don't.
love is the forest you run through. leave it pure and untouched.
the unseen between us. the power of it.
"i had nothing to say to the ocean, but she always speaks so much to me."
sometimes the ghosts leave and you wonder what to do with alone.
you are the amazing one. my sweet bff. i love you so xx @ShePlaysLoud
the horror and beauty of places you don't call home.
"the air is different in every city, but the stories people tell are the same."
"maybe if i stop chasing the light, it will find me."
"you think you don't need people, until you're around the right people."
shadows.
the sweetest surrender is to drown in his ocean yet still be able to breathe.
i never comment on followers but thanks to kush &amp; wizdom for the recent big pushes. it's nice to gain them for the right reasons...
"be proud of where you are, but never forget who helped you get there."

South Carolina.
"if you are kind to ten people and cruel to one. you are cruel, not kind."
there needs to be more worldwide frolicking xx @galiamango
love affair with the skies again.
"sometimes there's nothing to stand on. the bridge falls into ocean, the road you were so certain about gets swallowed by the void."
giving me rules is like trying to tame the wilderness.
"we'll take the long road home, in every season, in every century that is left. #v"
i remember.
flowers need water and light to bloom. which one are you?
my therapist read my poetry &amp; said it was like a modern day book of disquiet &amp; now i'm so happy i no longer need a therapist.
prayers that make your hands ache and your heart believe that someone might be listening.
"today i helped at the homeless shelter. everyone had a smile &amp; a story. no pity or sadness. gratefulness actually, for a safe place to eat."
we're all slowly decaying. make the days count.

the sound of your morning voice is still sliding down my spine.
"all that evil you're putting out to the world, will find its way back to you."
you cannot make a home in arms that are holding someone else.
darkness can be so beautiful.
awkward misunderstandings with an over inflated ego.
this is long overdue but i just bought dan's book. can't wait to read it! x @5daysoffalling
i watch and absorb. i wish i didn't.
"i'm not afraid of death, i'm afraid of what it would do to the people i leave behind."
night adventures.
accounts like @sixwordshort and @PoemsPorn should be taken down. every word is stolen without credit to the author. bullshit.
you should be crediting the original author.   @sixwordshort
perhaps our hands will ache with vacancy once all the stories have been told.
if i could choose a little sister it would be @whorebaby she doesn't know how beautiful she is. i read her heart everyday.
"he is everything beautiful, with a heart that knows no crimes."
"i am a lighthouse, and i will watch your ship every night to make sure it doesn't drown."
pretty paranoia.
stop searching for love inside words that don't belong to you.
"bollocks to hate. inflated egos, and passive aggressive behaviour."
you can expect an eternal haunting. @VVanGone
when you're done with me. i want my body to look like a bruised sky.

i have made too many decisions out of fear. the past is a noose and i hang myself everyday.

"i don't belong. i want to, but this idea was chiseled into my bones you see. yet i'd break every one, if i knew it would let the voices out."
so i ran to the forest and hid with the trees. i played in the river and imagined a different horizon. i was a child there. i was unafraid.
"i'm trying to forget the memories i do have, but they haunt me so, and every day is a reminder. i am not like you, i am not like anyone."
"i don't have those memories of being surrounded by people you love. nobody came to our house, they were too afraid of my father."

you don't fall in love at art museums. you fall in love at 2am after he's patiently listened to all your fears.
sometimes those words are like windows. i peer in and wonder about your life.

"hearts and minds are no different. expect nothing, and be open to another way."
"i like to look at people's hands. the lines drawn, the color of their skin. all beautifully different. not one is raised or taught the same."
not everyone will extend kindness the same way you do. this doesn't mean they're not kind. it doesn't mean they don't appreciate your hands.
and you will be continually hurt if you cannot differentiate the two.
"people are private. it's not that they don't like you, they just don't want you to know."

"happy birthday beautiful. ilysm, truly xx @whorebaby"
"i cannot kiss you deep enough, love you hard enough or know a world without your hands."
i kind of don't buy any TL that preaches kindness yet has a bunch of nasty subtweets thrown in between. hbu.
"there are still things to believe in. like your sea green eyes, and the love that beats throughout your heart."
talking to walls again. they stare blankly.
the night is our only audience. perhaps the darkness understands us. perhaps we are drawn to not having to explain.
my father's funeral flowers lived longer than the grief in my heart from his death.
"time will steal things, but we cannot live inside the void it left. if you stay there too long, it will eventually destroy your future."
"this day is fading. the tree canopies move with the wind &amp; bid farewell to the sun. the forest is dark, and i am finally alone."
"it's like reaching out to the ocean. she rages, full of turmoil, but she is frozen by eternal winter &amp; her waves cannot speak."
"we are old buildings with the scent of abandonment. but once we were loved, and someone cared enough not to let the dust settle."
"this shouldn't look like a safe place, but it does."
things that get left behind.
you'd have loved it! @higherhawk

some ppl i like @wand3rlost @bugbowl @CasusBelIi @blackthroatbird @WaterLilyDreams @trajectoryuk @UnderwaterCop @theimmortalgoat
"i see what's inside, that's why you're invisible to me."
"alone in the forest. i can only hear the trees, the wind, and the songs from your hands."
politeness. manners. respect. put those you love first. fight only when it's truly worth it. put your phone down. go outside. breathe.
"the pouring rain turns the sidewalk into a mirror. you see a thousand reflections, but none of them are your face."
drowning in cold water. the slow descent into a lightless void. the grasp for nothingness. the lack of breath finally crushing your lungs.
you are the sweetest. i hope you're well beautiful blue xx @blueeyed444
i miss you like leaves miss trees when they fall. like the forest floor misses your footsteps now it has memorized your name.
"you have eyes like forests &amp; lips like hurricanes, and please god just fucking tangle me in your wind."
"every day is better, because you are there to soften the fall."
i haven't seen it before but i LOVE it! ty for posting it beautiful. ily xx @WaterLilyDreams
"loving you isn't terrifying, the thought of being without you is."
everyday is a balancing act at the edge of a steep cliff.
"perhaps these are my demons, and i haven't learned how to dance with them yet."
"which battles do you fight, and is anything really worth the pain of bloody hands."
you know it's love when you see a future after tragedy.
hate everywhere. i'm going to do another love fest. lord knows we need it.
i don't hang pictures. they make me sad. they make me miss people more.
"it still hurts when people are kind, and this is both beautiful and sad."
"some (most) days, i just don't have a map for."
plant wildflowers. help save the bees.
"i love the quiet of early morning, i'm still invisible to the world."
Still love this song so much. Swedish House Mafia - Don't You Worry Child ft. John Martin
"stay with me here. first we will watch the stars die, then we'll hold hands as the sun burns the earth to ash."
"lie with me, and watch the world end."
"the sound of inhibitions falling quietly to the floor, as we fell, for each other."
the early morning rain falls on a solitary street. such a beautiful chorus of loneliness.
"you told me to swallow the memories, but they blocked my airway, and crushed my lungs."
"your hand is my hand, and we will hold this world together."
"that city burned, the streets emptied long ago. you are the ghost who thought there was something to stay for."
"i miss the rainy cities. hollow dreams dimly lit by streetlights. i miss the people, and all the smiles i believed that were real."
"sometimes i can't be bothered to speak, and sometimes i am tired of not being heard."
i wish i were in 1920's paris. i love you guys @John_Whittemore @VVanGone @elfincharms
"tell me again, until i believe it."
"when your heart is barely beating, like the hands of an antique clock, someone forgot to wind."
"more of the same, and i have never admired that type of consistency."
"i miss you. my breath is still. time crawls across the distance between us, and my heart aches for the day we share the same horizon."
nothing to save

"i love @WaterLilyDreams bc she is so authentic. she's a beautiful friend to me, and i love her honesty &amp; vulnerability. she is fearless."

"the problem with rivers is they look calm on the surface but underneath they're unpredictable, full of chaos, and this is like most people."
it is the most beautiful night here in canada.
"plant something with me. over the pain. over the past, so only the future may bloom."
he only worships them behind closed doors.
i feel your heart beating in my chest before the fog of morning has even left my eyes.
the night is restless and so am i.
mostly from my life experiences. @taylorrummel
"once you cry with someone, you are no longer a stranger. the pain of mutual sadness builds a bridge."
i'll be dragging my ass tomorrow but here i am at 11pm wanting to chase the stars &amp; take pictures of the moon.
"i see you, taking other people's words and wrecking them. if i see you, others do too."
motivation. where does it go. how do you ask it to come back?
"he is water, he is fire, and i cannot decide if i want to burn or drown."
i burned every door i ever closed so i wouldn't miss the one you held open.
"""the madman is a dreamer awake."" freud."
i lie awake again. haunted. the quiet always speaks your name.
this right here is how child abuse effects a (mostly) fully functioning adult long after the physical pain has healed. it's a prison.
"when people raise their voice, i hear nothing. i am eight years old again. i am frozen by a thousand seas inside my chest."
emotional bluntness. it's a thing.
"on the outside looking in, and how strange it is."
i'll take you everywhere. nothing exists without you anyway.
"i love you in a place where there is only room for us. the loss we have felt, and the short distance between our hands."
i don't actually romanticize anything. this is just who i am.
"the distance between our hands is too far, but our hearts have never been closer."
"don't fit in. let's be lonely together. like darkness, it can be so beautiful. @ItsAPerfectLife"
i am both of these in the same day. sometimes the same hour. people like us.
"i wrote a poem in the clouds, so when the rain taps on your window, let her in."
all the things that rage. all the courage that gets stuck between our teeth.
this is so beautiful. i think we have different soul mates in life. you are my soul mate in poetry x @VVanGone
humans. good at coming to conclusions without using facts. excellent at assuming things that don't actually exist.
so you'll have to settle for my horrific childhood and poems about asylum walls.
"i think when you find love. the real stuff, the good stuff. you hold it, protect it. you don't share it here."
loving and being loved. i deserve it &amp; so does he.
and some days come dressed in silence when all you can long for is words.
coke products are truly evil. a full 24 hours without Diet Coke &amp; i feel like shite!
"i am tired of speaking to the wind, she doesn't listen, and she blows whichever way she wants."

pretty pills everywhere. each color numbs a different kind of pain.
"i have patience for children, animals, those without a voice, but little else."
"don't get too close, i'm trying to quit my Diet Coke addiction. savage."
"i've spent much more time in reality lately, but tonight i sit &amp; comfort the child i was never allowed to be."
"we never met, but i read his story on the asylum walls. i slept in the same room he took his last breath, and fell in love with his ghost."
i always leave something behind. you won't forget me.
ty my darling friend. me too xx @VVanGone
i wonder how many childhoods have been written on asylum walls.
one day the forest will say fuck this &amp; set humanity aflame.
this language between us we speak without words. it's so beautifully loud. it's what tells me we'll never be broken.
this could be our song x   @VVanGone
writing poems with you on the last train to purgatory seems like an awfully good way to die.
"we walked hand in hand on centuries old streets, barefoot, hoping to tell them a new story."
"someone apologized to me today, and an hour later did the same behavior they were sorry for."
"you drank the holy water, but you still have all those demons inside."
if you set donald trump's hair on fire you could warm a small country for a week.
wretched fucking creatures some humans are.
"a good thing is to not worry about the next moment, because you don't even know if you'll be in it."
"in a dream i've met you a thousand times. you are always beautiful, and you always feel like home. @ShePlaysLoud"
"a good thing is to tell the trees you appreciate the oxygen they provide your lungs, and to spend entire days giving without taking."
ty lovely person for supporting all my words. xx @you_mustobeyme
today i thought less about myself &amp; more about the sea that might be raging in another's chest.
"but now i'm in love with a green eyed boy, and my heart can't stop talking."
sometimes i sit in the room where i left your memories. i want to leave but i don't.
i am often frozen. like an ocean that has not seen the sun for too long.
"i am a stranger to people i've known for years, and most often to myself."
"if you think something is unjust, speak of it. don't let that one person can't make a difference bullshit stop you."
"you have to get on with the terror of things, but speak when others want you to be quiet. stand up, when they're trying to pull you down."
"i can never turn away from injustice. my voice is small, but loud enough to care for those who don't have one."
funny how kicking your own ass hurts the most.
that's lovely x tysm @Ivsy01
i love you LOTS miss suzy! xx @Chantic
this love rages quietly.
all the love to you sweetheart xx @CelticMoonDance
he said i love you to all the parts i could not. he gathered them up like fallen leaves &amp; set them free inside the forest of his heart #v
i loved her too. absolutely brilliant x @trajectoryuk
"i'm a nice person until you fuck with what is dear to me. then i'll have to kick you in the shins. yeah, that's right."
"you made me realize living and loving are the same thing, and i could do neither without you."
just dropped in to vent about what a pretentious little prick my boss is. carry on.
"a thousand souls in this forest, and all i see is you."
"i want to be the reason you worship the sunrise, instead of clinging red knuckled to the end of a dying day."
"in a dream your voice was silent, and your hands spoke better than your tongue."

how dare Leonardo DiCaprio not follow me back.
"i am not feeling this day. it stood up &amp; crawled under a stone, but i can see it watching me."
people are too selective in this life. i'll be your friend &amp; support you but only on the things i agree with &amp; like. is this friendship?
"i love men (one in particular) the way he smells, looks, tastes. i'd be his little whore 24/7 &amp; not a BIT sorry for it."
truth is i don't want to be a good girl.
don't leave. pull up a chair and talk to me. @whorebaby vincent @VVanGone will join us too.
it's so hard to be a good girl.
chase me through the forest. i'll let you catch me.
i dreamt we were trees. our branches tangled and our leaves danced as they fell to the forest floor.
editing your poems is a little bit like eating your brain. yum.
"i love boys who taste of the wilderness. their lips, their heart, their untameable spirit."
the light in my eyes belongs to you.
i like what you say. i believe what you do.
i met god in central park. we shared a sandwich. he was homeless too.
"when i was 15 my father kicked me out. for 3 nights our priest let me sleep in the rectory. he didn't touch me, but sadly neither did god."
i miss the unholy acts of your hands.
i miss the nights when you touched me before the darkness did. when you kissed me before the sun had warmed her hands.
i miss those nights where you and i were the only sound.
"she wrote her suicide note on a foggy church window. it simply said, what a fool, i believed."
let's go somewhere quiet together @ItsAPerfectLife
"yes, the noise. i can't stand the noise. @VuelvoHappy"
"i did not cry when my father died. a man who caused me so much pain, yet i could feel no pain for him."
i love this. i'm so glad to see you well &amp; happy xx @CelticMoonDance
"every night i fall in love with a chorus of darkness. the wind, the rain, and the gentle sound of your breathing."
i dreamt you were mine long before i held your hand.
it's kind of sad to be considered naive because you want to see the good in people.
the sun gets on her knees for boys like you.
i spent the morning retracing the stories your fingers left under my skin @higherhawk
"that night you died, i don't think you came back alone."
i prefer to live in the forest. it doesn't collect dust.
tonight. romeo and juliet. leo style.
"i wish you were here, drinking up the darkness with me."
my head is a noisy street &amp; most of the footsteps are mine.
maybe the trick is to only treat people with the same level of respect they treat you?
trying to understand is exhausting isn't it?
"maybe love is to keep their fires alive, &amp; not be the ocean that puts them out."
pay close attention to a person's natural tendencies. these tiny actions tell you so much more than words do.
"wrapped so effortlessly around him. his tangled fingers only ever fit between mine. his heart, wandering for centuries, finally coming home."
watching blood diamond. major leo crush at the moment. not a bit sorry for it.
a thousand cities inside me &amp; none of them will sleep.
happy birthday gorgeous girl! xx @mnm67
comfort zones aren't comfortable. they're boring af. the seats turn into limbs and try to keep you there. to keep you from moving forward.
about to take on the world with love and softness.
"the desire to write leaves me more everyday, replaced with the desire to live."
"pressing palms to the wall of his chest, like he's the answer to all my prayers."
what is it about ruggedly handsome boys who like trees?
"i love the darkness. it's where i first met you, and since that moment, we have never needed light to find each other's hands. #v"
"the world weighs too heavily on me, and i've not enough hands to help it."
success isn't one thing either. for some people it's getting out of bed. create your own definition. don't be drawn in by societal pressures
"success and people's definitions of it make me uncomfortable. if you're happy with who you are &amp; what you have, you're successful."
big warm hugs for you. love you to the moon and back xx @WaterLilyDreams
"you will never owe me anything. i give this love freely to you, until you take your last breath."
i still haven't moved the eyelash you left on my pillow.
sometimes it's not the ghosts holding you back. it's you who won't let them go.
ticking clocks and heartbeats. reminding us of the time we waste.
"on some (most) days, it takes more courage than i have to interact with other humans."
"in a dream, i found you, and that was all i needed."
"you, a journey with no map. i, a fearless traveller."

"it's 2am and i should be asleep, but i'm renaming the thousand cities that live inside my head."
it's 2am and the stars are impersonating your eyes again.
imagine being a forest where every night you are tucked in by the moon.
never met a forest i didn't love.
i prefer dirt paths and the cover of tall trees.
"i miss you, and would crawl across time to touch you again."

"to love is to build him up. to help him be all he can be. if you're tearing him down, you're not in love."

types of abandonment: you don't remember yr father's hands or yr mother's soft voice. yr childhood home didn't make it out of the fire alive
types of abandonment: puts others before you. repeats actions they know you don't like. they're always home but never present.

"people aren't possessions. they are hearts, feelings &amp; skin."
"expectations, a sense of entitlement &amp; a lack of respect for personal boundaries will kill a relationship every time."
you kiss like a poet trying to rewrite the language of love.
"and we are so desperate to keep alive that which is dead, while we ignore the garden growing beneath our feet."
and we learn to move on. to exist in a new terror. to become an adjusted version of who we used to be.
a nothingness exists because of all the things that were taken away. it is both painful &amp; familiar.
beautiful nicole xx @WordsUnderStars
"your love is a bridge i am certain i've crossed a thousand times, and i am not afraid to cross it a thousand more."
all the beautiful parts of you quietly raging to get out.
humans will gather to stare at destruction and ignore the beauty of a rising sun.
sometimes you revisit a bridge to remind yourself why you set it in flames.
yes! &amp; a couple of boys for us to sacrifice to the tree gods. xx @SpiritsTempest
i love you too. i'll meet you in the deepest corner of the woods at midnight. xx @SpiritsTempest
i have no concept of time until i'm without you.
this is canada. canada protects its wildlife and forests. canada doesn't unnecessarily destroy its landscape.  be like canada.
maybe angry storms are nature's way of asking us to leave her alone.
humans should be charged with multiple counts of murder against nature.

"people will look at us and say, i want what they have."
trees are poems the forest has written about your eyes.
imagine sailing in the forest and cutting down the ocean.
gentle reminder. you are entitled to nothing and must earn everything.
i'll be your first kiss and your last goodbye. i'll be a lifetime of love in between.
you're where i want to be when the sky collapses for the last time.

he thinks he's nothing and that's why he's everything.
i love you in a place where the past stays safely in the shadows.
your mouth will ache with vacancy when the distance takes her kiss.
and we must move on with the beauty &amp; the terror of things.
"the houses are abandoned. only memories remain, clinging to the walls like dust."
and how our fingers ache with memory from touching homes that didn't stay.
"there is a map beneath my skin. choose a path, and make the journey slow."
"be careful, my map will lead you astray."
i think it comes down to values. they value doing that behaviour more than they value not hurting you. @RobotSkeleton69 @elfincharms
but they continually do something they know hurts you. it's a fuzzy line but that's how i've felt in the past xx @elfincharms
i think maybe eventually it becomes the same thing. if their intentions were never to hurt initially but @elfincharms
"but if their intention is to hurt, for me that's not love, it's something else. something unhealthy. btw, i love you. @elfincharms"
good question dew x i think with any love there's potential for hurt &amp; is sometimes unavoidable due to the intense feelings. @elfincharms
hate will only anchor you to the depths of an empty ocean.

"you're not here, yet you have touched me in a thousand ways."

planting gardens on graves as if the dead can smell the flowers.
"my biggest fear is that you'll leave, and i'll be trapped in this room knowing how it feels to drown without water."

love is the stranger we cannot live without.
"imagine a silence that spoke a thousand words, that held you, that made you feel unafraid."
some people look like promises &amp; you don't realize they're already shattered until you've cut your hands.
my head is swimming with memories we've yet to make.
"today, just disappear with me."
"today, just chase the light with me, even though we know it won't last. nothing ever does."

you're not shy vincent but these are perfect. @VVanGone
shy boys who spit out a mouthful of metaphors just to describe your eyes.
"you hold someone for the first time, and suddenly realize they've been there for centuries."
i will fold my hands into a boat when you're drowning. i will draw you a sun on the days it doesn't shine for you.
you are brave to swim in such an impossible sea.
i will look for you in places we have never seen &amp; on the empty streets of cities that don't actually exist. i will look for you.
"ache for me in the morning. long for me as the sunset turns your green eyes gold. love me, for every moment in between."
when his silence alone tells you you're beautiful.
"we are addicted to longing, and would ache with indifference if it ever left us alone."
i wonder what it is about the darkness that makes us lose ourselves. everything there is imagined.
"pack your bags. you don't need the stars, just follow the fallen leaves."
"until i hold him, his voice is my home."
i must write my own reality. i cannot risk the tedious burden of trying to exist in yours.
"a fire won't burn out if you don't light it, but what a tragic way to live."
"the night comes too soon for some. they are drawn back to the light, while we ache with memory, in the darkness."
tis true my dear friend @VVanGone
where does your heart live?
"maybe love is to keep dancing together, even when you're not sure of the steps."
breathe her in like a cigarette. see how beautifully she destroys your lungs.
we will all be shipwrecked in the end. our little boats raging against death and the calling sea.
"if there's a thousand moments between hello &amp; the final flicker of light, i want to spend them all with you."
but does your breath catch when you watch the sunrise. can you hold onto the notion that one day you'll hold the wind?
love me with your pure heart. fuck me with your dirty mind.

"he used her ribcage like the rungs of a ladder, and climbed straight into her heart."
this is exceptional @VVanGone
"he was a lighthouse, and he watched her ship for a thousand nights, to make sure she didn't drown."
i'll touch you before the sun does. i'll hold your hand when the last light burns out.
it's a lot harder to say i love you with a mouthful of self sabotage.
"you'll find her everywhere, in the mouth of a stranger, in the eyes of a girl you've yet to meet, in the quiet corners of crowded rooms."
"let me float on your chest, in an ocean of sighs."
you're beautiful. i would love those lips forever x @sapioslut
the sea has not seen a storm since you arrived.
"i want to fall asleep in a lighthouse, to the sounds of waves crashing, and the steady beat of your heart."
"you're either a moment away from tragedy, or a moment away from falling in love, and often they're the same thing."
"don't give it a label, let it be what it is, in all its terrifying beauty."
wear the forest as a dress. bathe your skin in winter sun. sleep to the sounds of a midnight sky screaming.
"stay close to those who hold your hands, even when they're empty."

my veins are empty. they are done pumping promises they're not strong enough to keep.
imagine being the sea. she has countless shores to abandon.
where do you learn about love when your mother leaves and your father has violent hands.
do you pray before you kiss her. do you fall to your knees &amp; thank god for such beautiful sin.

"come to me sinner, there is a church beneath my dress."

"a girl like the air you breathe, so why does it feel as if you've swallowed half the ocean."
"a love, where your chest aches with absence, even when he's only across the other side of the room."
i've stopped thinking about worst case scenarios &amp; started focusing on the things i actually hold inside my hands.
"cool places to meet: an asylum. the forest during a meteor shower, or that bridge you were just about to burn."
"all those times you walked through fire, just to rescue the girl who had set you in flames."
"and when you hold me, there's nothing more i need to be."
beautiful like dead trees.
"your onyx eyes have watched a thousand sunsets, and your ears still search for the sound of your mother's voice."
"maybe love is to hold each other so close, there's no way to define where you end and i begin."
"you keep leaving things behind, it's impossible to forget you."
i only know who i am when you love me. i can only exist if i am folded in your palm.

i feel like there's still so much our hands have left to do.
the sky is watching you.

their first meeting was a fatal collision on an abandoned highway.
"you keep searching for love in the space between my fingers, forgetting that my hands have never learned to hold."
"when i touched his hand, i could hear echoes of all the people who'd let go."
people are fascinated with me until they realize i'm human.
"some doors shouldn't be opened, but humans have such a violent need to be loved, so we break the locks and let the demons in."
"she never left the house, but she always looked pretty, and she imagined one day hearing the turn of his key."
"i'm truly sorry my existence hurts you, but i'm not sorry for who i am."
we feel safer on empty streets. reality is too big for people like us.
when you are peculiar. people will admire you quietly.
she's like the rooms in abandoned hotels. filled with dust &amp; someone else's memories.
"it wasn't the way you looked at me, but how your eyes never left, long after i walked away."

"she is all the mystery of the forest, and the maddening depths of the sea."
"i could fill a small city with the assumptions, rumours &amp; misinterpretations made about me here. i only wish i were so exciting. do carry on"
"you're still riding trains, but you can't find a stop called home, and none of the passengers wear her face."
"and if your veins are rivers, i wish to swim until i'm trapped inside your heart."
cliffs jump to their death at the sight of her.
"you're so quiet and unassuming, i had no idea you were in pain."
do your fingers ache with memories from touching things that wouldn't stay.
i wish reality had warmer hands.
just lie here on the sand with me. we'll listen to the ocean breathing.
"some people never leave. they're always inside you, crushing your glass bones, and setting fire to your paper heart."
"you were a stranger who came with words, and you wrote such a beautiful lie."
"i miss your face, and how sometimes your eyes look sad even when you're smiling."
we are but two strangers who share the same ghosts.
she is a house with a thousand empty rooms.
"the way we always seem to find each other, even when there's no light."
i tried to be a home. so sorry i'm more like an earthquake.
the forest sees everything. including you.
i'll be here for a little while.
"Sara Bareilles ""Gravity"""
"i can only write of you, and you will live here with me, for as long as my hands can hold a pen."

the sunlight is violent today.
your eyes are such a beautiful shade of vacant.
stop stealing my fucking tweets. @ImDeepVerma these are all mine
detritus.
i want to understand but i don't. it's like trying to hold the universe with two small hands.
and we love with murderous hearts.
there is no door i can close. no noise loud enough to shut you out.
"we are crumbling cathedral walls, because nobody believes and there is nothing left to worship."
"you meet her &amp; the wars inside you grow silent. you love her &amp; that's when you realize, she's the only thing worth the pain of bloody hands"
"it's dark. fog hangs over the lake. you look down into the water, your dead father stares back at you."
"some things are best left unspoken. like how you're still here &amp; in a crowded room full of strangers, you are still the only person i know."
giant demon birds looking down on city streets. pitying the poor caged humans.
trees have started growing through these abandoned walls. the rain and leaves are falling on the inside.
quietly in love with you for centuries.
"all the nights you sat alone with your pen, trying to find the words that would make people stay."
this is so beautiful. ty baby. ily too x @lostwallfl0wer

"everything he says is poetry, and i am still learning how to speak."
tragedy had left its fingerprints all over her skin.
if you're not following @John_Whittemore you should be. he's a fabulous writer &amp; incredible human being.
she carried him with her everywhere. like an empty suitcase she had packed with absent hands.
i like you. let's share a straitjacket.
"break open rib cages. knock down walls. build bridges. be terrified, and love."
"fear and rage held hands. oh how they loved. how they tried until death, to give each other a home."
we are not those abandoned children anymore. we are the fear &amp; rage it left us with as adults.
yes
why do you exist in places i can't reach with my hands.
i'll be the hall light that stays on in the home you never had.
we are all clouds who drift through the same delusional sky.
"years later, he could still smell the forest when the wind blew a certain way."
the atoms that made her are still tangled in his hair.
"when you die, you sit in a room for eternity with all your past selves."
and we rage towards a balance that i do not believe exists.
i am overwhelmed with knowing and also the terrible feeling that i might be missing out.

you will miss him the most when you're trying to start fires with a boy who cannot understand your need for flames.
you spoke of monsters like you weren't one.
"some people will start fires in you, even when they have them burning elsewhere."
she's still searching for her poet. imagine being the words nobody wants to write.
"a branch breaks, and the tree is forever changed."
imagine being the sea. she has countless shores to abandon.
she's the kind of quiet that hangs in the air after a storm has hit the ground.
"the house sits abandoned, but you can still hear their voices. that vacant feeling in your chest, the reminder that no one was listening."
alone is never lonely until they plant you a forest &amp; then strike a match to burn it down.
"no matter how subtle it is, i'll see it."
my mind is home to a thousand ghosts and each of them wear your face.
he always stuttered apologies when he kissed.
i wish i could look at you with closed hands.
i hope you don't pray with that mouth.
happy birthday beautiful! @Tannyasaroha
"i wonder where she keeps her box of souvenirs. i imagine the key is bloody, from all the hearts she locked in."
you'll love her mind until you realize the hallways are endless &amp; all of the doors are locked.
"all the boys she loved were abandoned churches with no forwarding address, until the day she knocked down his door &amp; walked into a cathedral"
"but darling we're safer inside the asylum, most of the lunatics are on the other side of the doors."
constantly torn between city streets and the quiet rage of a forest.
"you will miss her the most when you walk through the forest, holding the hand of a girl who does not like trees."
"i love you in a place that is void of mistakes. i visit you there sometimes &amp; you're still riding trains, because you don't want to go home."
perhaps the truth is easier when the lights are dim.
"we took trains to cities that don't exist. we learned about their impermanence, and how desperately we needed to hold each other."
you watch the grass sway in the wind. your mouth waters and your mind imagines her hips.
"some times i still undress with the stars, and hope the night is watching."
"i am a loner who has not yet learned how to hold the hands of fragile things, and when i do, everything inside me is screaming to let go."
the sun is rising and i'm panicking at the thought of light &amp; people.
"i'm hopeless at polite conversation &amp; i can't relate to most people. it's lonely sometimes, but mostly strange, and quite beautiful."
"a thousand cities inside me, and none of them will sleep."
"i choose acceptance and to keep moving. my reactions are mine to own, and that's all i can control."
"i think some actions are unforgivable tbh. for me forgiveness has very little to do with the person, it's for my own healing."
a question about forgiveness. are certain wrongs unforgivable? thoughts please. ‚ô°

i am drawn to things that other people have abandoned.
the worst kind of pain is not being able to tell anyone why you feel it.
the winter afternoons that wander around in her eyes.
"we are so much more than our words, and sometimes, quite less."
i'm not really afraid to speak my truths. perhaps i should be.
"she had all the burn of the sun, but sadly none of its light."
"i don't like explaining myself, and this is not conducive to love."
decaying gracefully.
"life is full of cracks, and i suppose it's all about when you let the light in."
my psychological contract with the universe is broken right now tbh.
zette you are amazing x @driftingixland
we hold on so violently to soft &amp; fragile things.
i wish i had a memory of you that wasn't burned by the sun.
"i'll help you carry, so it's lighter for us both. @ShePlaysLoud"
"i have lived hours in the presence of nature, hours sculpted in the tenderness of isolation. fernando pessoa."
i deal with pain in the strangest ways. i need to focus on another reality to avoid the one i'm facing here.
thank you kind beautiful people for your love &amp; prayers.
i am mostly lost by design. there's a freedom in it. to be accountable only for myself.
transient @elfincharms this thread is beautiful x
"your windows were broken, but i don't think you understand how much i loved looking inside."
your fingerprints are fading. i don't think i knew those hands anyway.
"i wore you, like some sort of winter wrapped around the sun."
"when you accept &amp; forgive, the only person winning is you."
the love &amp; care of friends make difficult days more bearable. thank you.
"i love your mind. you're beautiful, ty! @lostwallfl0wer"
"people will ask you to hold them through their darkness, and let go of your hand as soon as they find the light."
"i make no promises because i'm terrible at keeping them, and i'll never leave you with the illusion i am good enough."
when i get scared i still search for your hands.
"he's the kind of boy you can never see again. because when you do, it all comes flooding back, &amp; you're untangling sheets &amp; hearts for days."
you cannot know me if you are used to swimming in the shallows.
bury the pain and plant a flower over its grave.
"very little interests me, but the things that do are usually beautifully destructive."
perhaps it is the longings of my mind that keep me company. the curiosity of words &amp; nature. the constant wonder of human behaviour.
the same rooms are empty but yet i never feel alone.
look at how the trees reach for the moon.
i think we only love abandoned houses because they remind us of ourselves.
"you kept trying to apologize but instead i kissed you, and now my lips taste like all of your mistakes."

you needed the ocean. it was the only thing big enough to hold all those different versions of you.
"your hands are not clean, but i admire the dedication to convince yourself, it's mine that are dirty."
"it's a hard lesson to learn, but trying to make others accountable for their actions is not my battle to fight, even when it's me they hurt."
i wonder if tears makes a sound when they are cried into the ocean.
you did &amp; i'm glad. @rynosoares
anything truly passionate comes with a certain amount of chaos.

maybe one day you'll tell me why and these demons will finally go to sleep.
"you wrote this story, with a pen and a person who doesn't really exist."
"i don't think we're meant to endure such intense emotions. perhaps they exist for the experience, or to give us memories we'll never forget."
"sometimes the truth is so fucked, you're better off with the lies."
i'll be the bridge. you'll be the match that burns me down.
"i'm kind of a snob &amp; also quite aloof tbh so if i make time for you, know that you're special to me."
"some people are a crowded hallway, others are the solitude we so desperately crave."
the sun gets on her knees for boys like you.
why beautiful things hurt.
"there are fires existing in all of you. some we start on our own, others are lit by those around us."
"this is who i am. i know it's not easy to know me. one day i'll be your light, the next i am filled with the darkest storms."
mostly we fall in love with the face they wear.
"no one can save you. please don't ask them to. it's a huge burden, and one day you'll realize, you can only save yourself."
"the problem with abandoned things, is they don't know how to be loved."
"the sad truth is, people lie to get what they want."
i'd rather love a forest.
i'm still searching for the lesson in all of this.
"some nights your name still echoes in my chest, and your skin still speaks to my fingertips."
everything beautiful is sad.
girls with bruised knees and broken promises stuck in their teeth.
you rely on too many people to pull you back from the edge.
you keep telling me to breathe but you're pouring rivers inside my lungs.
maybe it's about learning to speak with quieter lips and louder hands.
"maybe love is to keep their fires alive, &amp; not be the ocean that puts them out."
"mistakes don't define you, but how you fix them does."
some people are a love letter you're too afraid to read.
one day i'll learn to be soft again.

you and i should be more afraid of flames.
"i'm fascinated you want to get inside my mind, because i've spent many nights wondering about yours."
"i could stay here with you, but the night comes too quickly, and the memories start to feel like knives."
"when i saw your headlights on the rain soaked highway, it felt a little bit like home."
"i often like to disappear. this time, i want you to come with me."
there was just something about that girl with the sea colored eyes.
happiest of birthdays to you sweet jon! @Sailsman777
"when your mouth is filled with bad memories, i will kiss you and hide them in mine."
"i've never really fit in anywhere. there is a loneliness that comes with that. sometimes i think i should change it, but i don't."
"you only know what people show you, and most of that's a lie."
there's always something beautiful in the shadows. wait with me.
"hearts are soft, and yet they still shatter."
someone once told me the truth shall set me free. and it has.
"i'd like to touch the space between your fingers, so i know how it feels to be your pen."
"getting things tangled in my hair again, like chaos, sunlight and the memory of your hands."
"subtle things, like rage, insanity &amp; love."
you let her go but you cannot forget her crimes.
your breath is a poem. your heart is a door always open.
i see different versions of you everyday. maybe love is learning how to hold all of them.
to love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise. fyodor dostoevsky.

her favorite drug was a boy with a beautiful mind.
if only we knew how to hold things when they are actually in our hands.
you always did know where to find me.
to the people who dig and find me under layers of doubt. thank you for getting your hands dirty.
it's because i hide and you love me anyway.
and i remember when i wrote only to escape myself.
"the curious in you, trying to figure out what makes the rain fall, and this is why she rarely speaks with the wind."
still thinking about the time you loved me against the forest floor.
you'll find him there still wondering about her sea glass eyes.

you are so lovely x tysm. i adore your account too @lostwallfl0wer

we take turns in pushing each other away.
conversations that travel across the wind. somehow reaching the sands of a distant shore.

"pretending to be someone else takes energy, and when the fuel runs out, you see them for who they are."
this is what love feels like.
"i'm not fascinating, you just need something to fill the void."
"keep the things you love in your pocket, like a memory or the ocean, and the boy who holds your hand."
"a love so hot, it starts fires on the ocean floor."
she's why all the fires start.
"i'm certain the ocean is beautiful, but i would rather look at you."
"i wish i could be better for people like you. i suppose that's why i built a bridge between us, because i know deep down i'm not."
"you're the only place that's felt like home. sometimes the windows were broken, but we'd fix them and the light fell through again."
there is no in between. i have to consume you for the rest of your life or you can turn and walk away.
i only want to be touched if your hands are like a slow burning fire.
and i imagine all you can do is pray you loved them enough while you still had a chance to look. while you still had the chance to stay.
death doesn't scare me but dying does. those final moments when you're looking at eyes who love you. eyes who'd do anything to make you stay

most of what you search for in others is actually hidden somewhere inside yourself.
gentle reminder that you don't actually know anyone here and most of what you feel is based on your perception.
i really am writing an article. it's about perception &amp; how it affects business. still trying to figure out how i can relate it to trees.
"i'm supposed to be doing an article on things i love, and so far all i've written is your name."
i'll keep pretending i don't think about where your hands go when you miss me.
trapped
sometimes i wish i weren't so aware. sometimes i long for the ignorance of only seeing with my eyes.
i'm at my best in the midst of destruction.
wherever this leads. let's go there together.
"sometimes gentle is a foreign language, and everything i touch meets a tragic end."

"nobody cares who you are but if it helps your ego, I'll pretend I do."

i tried to become a forest because you said you loved trees.
"love is a song I keep forgetting the words to, but there's something about your voice that helps me remember."
all of the horrific ways she loved you.
holding on hurts so much more than your hands.
how did the words you once used as band aids suddenly become bullet holes in your chest.
i long to write a poem that speaks as much as your eyes do.

"i'll tell you every day i don't love you if it helps, but every day that would be a lie."
why are people always in such a rush? they suffocate me. smell the fucking wild flowers mother fuckers!
most of my days are still covered in your fingerprints.
somehow still surrounded by all the things you tried to take away.
"i told the trees about you today, but they do not bend. maybe they see something i don't."
"it hurts because you love, and that takes more courage than you know."

i think of you and your pain. carrying it around like a suitcase you can't bear to unpack.
"i always think of you when it rains, and how we made love to the sound of it falling."
"i always think of you when it rains, and how we fell asleep to the sound of it falling."
"sometimes i wish i had consistency, but the monotony of it terrifies me."
the things you see when you stop looking with your eyes.
most days the biggest challenge you'll endure is yourself.
i'll wake you to tell you i miss you. i'll call you at 3am just to hear the sound of your voice.
"i need to get tangled in you, and forget that there's a world outside our door."
"i've never let go of your hand, even when you don't have the strength to hold mine."
"receiving answers to questions, you wish you'd never asked."
it's the way we keep reaching for the same cold hands.
quietly in love with anything that falls outside the lines.
i still look at you with my hands open.
there are days when sadness takes a seat beside you and doesn't want to leave.
take a seat and i'll tell you about all the times i've set myself on fire.
people like to put you on a pedestal and then kick it out from under you.

we open doors with such hope. we close them with the pain of reality.
"i held a bird in my hands. its wings were broken. it begged me to fix it. i tried, but all it really wanted was the strength to fly away."
people will leave. let them.
i'm in a strange place. i can hear the ocean and see a thousand faces i don't know. someone tell me i can stay.
"people like to say ""just be you"", until you are."
the quiet things that rage inside of you.
i don't judge people. except trophy hunters. you can all go fuck yourselves.
"i'm not mysterious. the truth is, i'm just not that great at being human. people suffocate me, as does their need for meaningful connections"
continually absent from any reality.
we lived on sunlight and the breath we stole from each other's lungs.
we like to love things the most when they are broken or leaving.
a few brushstrokes short of a masterpiece.
i will look for you in places we have never seen &amp; on the empty streets of cities that don't actually exist. i will look for you.
the hall light will always be on in this house. stop by sometime if you ever lose your way.
i didn't say goodbye because i don't know how to leave.
i just want to make out in the back of a police car.
"i hope you know, that even when my hands touched other things, it's always been about you."
i am the voice screaming inside your head. i am the fingerprints on your memories that time will not erase.

"there is beauty amongst the ruin, and still i seek it."
"i'm like the ocean. i can hold so much, but nothing will ever know me."
"i am the voice who tells you not to, and the reason why you do."
i am the quiet hum of a silent house. i am the storm that wakes you from your sleep.
"if you &amp; i kissed in this forest, i'm almost certain we'd burn it down."
"I cannot fix the empty spaces in your chest, but I will build a city, plant a garden, and grow a sun to light your way."
"eventually, the ocean will erode everything."
maybe the sun holds you tighter as it fades.
"i will write of gunfire on an empty street, and the hollow sound the bullet made as it exited my chest."
"when you cannot resist the fire, but don't want to get caught in the heat of its flames."
it's like i'm lying right beside you and i'm too afraid to reach for your hand.

low hanging clouds touching the phone lines. i hear your whispers in the static.
the quiet hum as this city falls asleep.

sometimes what you see today is best spoken of tomorrow.
we feel with the same heart. we see with the same eyes.
"my mouth is filled with words but none of them make sense, so please, just fucking kiss me."
That's a beautiful thing to say. Thank you so much &lt;3 @brockinlife
"the clouds are filled with every second i have missed you, and i sit here with the hope you can feel me when it rains."
i wish i were softer. i wish reality hadn't given me edges.
"and even when you've kissed every city beneath my skin, i'll pretend you haven't so you can start all over again."
i keep remembering the sound of your breathing &amp; how i fear mine would stop if i could never hear it again.
"how words become doors, and some we write without locks so no one can ever come in."
the paint on the doors was peeling. the locks had been changed too many times.
the ocean is filled with every day i waited for you.
"and my only wish, to be eternally lost in the madness of your waves."
"you're always my soft landing, and you'll always be the bridge i build &amp; jump from."
at work we were asked what inspires us. everyone said money. i said the way a wildflower grows in the desert. now they think i'm strange.
"i don't need a map to find you, i only ask that you walk with me, because i know no other way."
"i keep thinking about how you kiss, and all the stories i've yet to taste from your mouth."
"i dreamt i folded myself into the sunrise. i flooded your window, crawled across your sheets, just so i was the first thing to touch you."
i like how the night feels against my skin. it reminds me of your hands.
"and then there's the quiet disbelief that hangs in the air, right after a tragedy strikes."
"i held him so close, he's confused about whose heart it is beating inside his chest."
"we like to close doors, but never remove our fingers from the handle."
one day you meet an abandoned house that actually loves you back.
lost
"maybe the lost parts of each other, is where we'll find ourselves."
"i don't think you quite understand that you're actually the entire universe. disguised as human boy, with sad eyes and soft skin."
"i'd be lucky to fill one bag with material possessions, but i could fill the streets of a thousand cities with memories i'd sooner forget."
"if those walls are your arms around me, then i only wish to be trapped."
"who are you, at the end of the day, when the stage is cleared and the seats are empty."
"we came from nothing, and made it everything."
"somedays we are our lost childhoods, still learning how to tie our own shoes."
there's a little boy's voice in your 4am heartbeat and i always remind him my hands are his home.
poets will turn your teeth into skylines &amp; your hands into tremors that leave cracks on the ocean floor.
had a date with the sunset.
Beautiful. Ty! @brockinlife
maybe love is when you're not afraid to look at mirrors anymore.
"i'm not afraid of the dark and the questions she brings. i reach across sheets, and run my hands all over the answer."
"i will love you when the light falls out, and when you're afraid to speak, because you don't recognize the sound of your own name."
don't judge someone for not living up to the expectations *you* placed on them.
even your tears are beautiful. it's like you're looking at the world through your favorite window when it rains.
"i am composed entirely of the light spilling from your mouth as you speak, and the breaths you held every time you whispered you loved me."
she's an elegant kind of madness.
"it's ironic that stars are dead, yet still manage to light up the sky."
"he'll be the one standing when the hill crumbles, holding my shattered voice in his hands."
it was his eyes she fell in love with. sometimes they spoke to her more than he did.
sometimes i don't need you to speak because your hands say more than enough.
and your words are the hands that dry every silent tear.
lightning is actually the sound of our bones cracking when we have to say goodbye.
"it's still raining on that stretch of road where you first kissed me. the streetlights flicker, and the phones don't work for miles."
"the sign said this highway doesn't end, but it is short when i drive it with you."
it's the way his breath catches when he looks at a sunrise. it's how he'll never give up on the notion that one day he'll hold the wind.
i want to kiss you in all the places you can't write about.
"if you don't believe in yourself enough, it can mean too much when someone else does."
"i don't know how the child i wasn't allowed to be can feel pain, but she does."
"sometimes i wish you'd stop talking so i can kiss you, others, it's because i'm afraid of what you might say."
"i don't want experiences to define me, i'd rather my reactions do."
"love walks around like a flower with a hand grenade. so i pick the petals, pull the pin, and await the next beautiful destruction."
"one day all of this will be gone, and although there's sadness in that thought, it's what also makes it beautiful."
"when you love someone, i think it's quite ok if their beauty makes you cry."
"he is the wind, and once he passes through you, you'll never breathe in the same way again."
"look baby, i stripped myself bare for you."
i'll fuck you like a wildfire. i'll burn your forest to the ground.
"it was dark that night, and i couldn't find you on any map."
he can never say no to the ocean.
i like it when he forces the words down my throat.
"if you left, it would be like someone telling me i can never go home again."
"i tried not to feel lost today, but the feeling found me anyway."
"i've tried to write it myself, but this story always sounds better in your hands."
JP Cooper - Satellite (Acoustic)
we are the same you and i. more at home with the wind than four walls and a locked door.
"we don't have to go inside. we can stay here to watch this village burn, and witness the death of another day.  we can stay."
"there is a winter existing in all of us, regardless of the season."
i sometimes wonder how people exist without burning it all to the ground.
"the moon is hanging so low, i just saw it kiss the ground."
"tell me, how your hands claim what your body needs when the night falls over my skin."
we just can't stop falling in love with each other's chaos.
"you cannot prepare for love &amp; how it makes you feel edges, when you've only been surrounded by things that made you feel numb."
"perhaps waves are relentless, because they don't speak in the same language as the shore."
she's that girl in the corner looking for an escape route. looking for a way to go talk with the trees.
i often feel like a shipwreck trying to survive on dry land.
"no matter what I write, this ache always spells out your name."
last night i slept on the forest floor. i undressed for the stars and prayed the night is still watching.
we like to close doors and then complain that nobody ever comes in.
i like how the air feels when everything else is sleeping.
they found her body by the river. but not her heart. her heart's still beating in his chest.

he just wanted to be something his mother kept in her jewelry box.
you left too many keys under the mat for people who never came.
she is a quiet forest. she is new york city at night.
i spend so much time feeling sad for the wind because she's something that cannot be held.
meaningless conversations just to hear the sound of his voice.
whatever i have. i'd like to share it with you.
whatever i have. i've come by it honestly.
"let's not give power to those who don't deserve it, and stop looking up to people who only want to keep us down."
this forest has memorized the sound of your breathing. these trees will always be calling your name.

i wanted to miss you before i even knew who you were.
you'll find her where the tall trees are.
i don't need to kiss you to taste your sadness. everything you feel lives in me. you live in me.
i want to get my hands filthy with your sadness.
"sometimes i feel sad for trees, because maybe they don't all want to be rooted."
when the depths are shallow and there's not enough places to hide.
"i'm tired and i can smell you on my pillow, even though you are a thousand miles away."
she's like nature. full of subtlety and rage.
"i make no apologies for being quiet, obscure, or the decisions i make to protect myself. none. and you shouldn't either."
"when you can't resist him. when you can explain nothing, and he means everything. you stay."
"sometimes the battles grow silent, and you realize there is comfort in the noise."
sometimes words are not needed.
"there's too much air between your lips and mine, come closer."
"i'd wake at night and remember his name, as if the sound it made would penetrate the dark and bathe me in some kind of light."
"if i could i'd turn the miles between us into a bridge, and then burn it after i crossed it to reach you."
"one day we'll be traveling the same abandoned road, and our eyes will collide like headlights."
write a poem about your own eyes. draft a letter about the strength of your own hands.
"there's no such thing as failure. only lessons, if you choose to learn."
the only place i've ever belonged was in the palms of your strong hands.
"love is when you keep dancing together, even when you're not sure of the steps."
i'm the awkward girl who either says too much or not enough. the girl who'd rather talk to flowers and dance to the sound of storms.
i used to hide my differences. now they've become my middle finger to the world.

"silence does not scream. it sits in your chest, until one day, you're speaking the language of hurricanes."
"the highway is long, but maybe she'll find a home in the glare of a stranger's headlights."
"i keep looking for a version of myself i might recognize, but the mirror only returns an unfamiliar face."
"i'm fascinated with doors lately. the way they lock people in, and just as easily let them go."

"it's the little things you notice. like how his left dimple is deeper than the right, or how the air gets thin after he's left the room."

it's not because i showed you things i've never shown anyone else. it's because you already knew they were there &amp; wanted to see them anyway
the sky is its own paradox. infinite &amp; transient. endings are only beginnings that start in a different place &amp; time.
love is a series of crime scenes and violent longing.
things that are still beautiful after everyone's left the room.

"when he's angry, you want to be the door he slams. you want to be the kiss that quiets his mouth, when it's filled with violent storms."
i don't know how to sleep unless you're wrapped so close you've almost crawled inside my bones.
you miss him before he leaves. you want him to wake before he's even closed his eyes.
maybe love is letting go of empty hands and trusting in the arms that want to stay.
"narcissists don't actually love themselves, that's why they want everyone else to."
the universe will let you know when it's your turn.
"it's hard to be good at anything as an adult, that you didn't experience as a child."
I am bare branches. I am a quiet city at the edge of the sea.
touching you was the only reason i learned how to speak.
"tall trees and tall boys, mostly the same thing."
"i often wonder if you're made from the sea. because you are deep, seamless and full of beautiful storms."
"and somedays words are a bridge, while others they are the fire that burns them."
"there's a little girl inside of me who's slowing dying, but i don't want to revive her, because it's the girl who needed her father's love."
i miss you so much i've drank a glass of my own seawater tears.
"reality is a slow death for a poet, that's why we write another."
"i feel the world in the palm of my hand and while it's beautiful, the weight of it is heavy."
trying to motivate myself to do something other than write about how much i love you.
"everything is for him, but there should always be some things, that are only for him."
"some people are just familiar, like they've been living in a city deep beneath your skin. like they were always meant to be there."
pack up your childhood memories and throw them under the next passing train.
"summer still remembers how the sweat pooled in your palms, how your eyes burned brighter than the late july sun."
i covered the exit signs so you can't run away.
he's the reason i no longer look for the fire escape.
she is the shipwreck and the rescue boat.
she's the quiet when he enters a room and the walls aren't sure what to say.
"you are the quiet that whispers my name, when the rest of the world is screaming."
he's the book she can't put down.
she's the song he can't turn off.
"winter still remembers how the light fell off your lips. how the words you spoke, softened the ice around her heart."
"words sometimes fail me, but you never do."
"these floorboards remember your footsteps, and they cry when they miss you too."
kiss my neck and breathe your story down my spine.
"our love is never quiet, even if we are."
"when you touch me, gravity doesn't exist. your body turns into a black hole. and god i just want to fall. endlessly. eternally."
i don't think the ground will ever recover from how hard they loved.
"i keep drawing your hands, but they don't listen when i ask them to hold me."
the moon hides herself but i don't know why. i wonder if she knows the night would die for her.
the traffic lights change whether you're waiting at them or not.
perhaps you're not an angel when your halo is made from the bones of those you've broken.
i want to know how your sighs taste when the words don't come &amp; how your hands feel when there's nothing left to hold.
my favorite rooms in this house are your eyes when they're watching the sunrise.
my father yelled with clenched fists. so i fell in love with a with a boy who speaks with open palms.
we can choose to be alone or make a home out of hearts that eventually stop beating. and this is just the way of things.
i've checked a thousand maps and every road leads to you.
last night i burned the sky.
"be my burden. allow me to hold your hand. let me carry you, when you're crippled by memories of the past."
she's all red wine and russian poets.
"she is a cautious body of water, but she is deep and she will drown you."
it's you that i hold onto when the wind gets too strong.
"i am mostly made of sleepy summer mornings, and the breath i stole from your lungs last night."
"she's the cigarette you know you shouldn't have, but yet you cough up a lung and can't wait to light another."
i am flower petals in his hands and i trust their strength not to crush me.
i sit in the cemetery where there are no beating hearts and this is a quiet escape for a while.
the rain only falls on your hands. you're the only one she trusts to catch her.
"sometimes i don't speak, because all the words sound like i miss you."
i want to live in an old house with wood floors and sounds that make you question the night.
today the wind is harsh. the branches tremble at her softest whisper.
endings are really just beginnings that start in a different place and time.
all those times i sat by my window and watched you take over the world.
and yet there is no language that exists to adequately describe my love for you.
"fragile, like an earthquake."
the sky is littered with dead stars and still my wishes came true.
it's because of all the ways you touch me without using your hands.
you're my only audience. you're the only one i need to know is watching.
"to love something eternal. like the wind, a forest or you."
love will lift that pile of rocks up off your chest.
"you don't have to accept people for who they are, but you don't need to judge them either. if you can't find something you like, move on."
i used to write about closed curtains on a cloudy day. now i get up and can't wait to eat the sun.
i'll be your devil princess. i'll be your favorite stay in hell.
"things that happen on quiet street corners like buying drugs or falling in love, and realizing they're mostly the same."
"tell me again how your heart stopped when we met. tell me again, i'm the reason it keeps beating."
you meet her and suddenly the world spins a little slower. you love her and realize it would stop if she left.
kiss me like your mouth is on fire and my lips are the ocean.
"i woke in a room full of mirrors, and every one l i looked at stared back with your face."
"when i met you, my sadness stopped causing collisions on abandoned highways, and my eyes believed in the beauty of a sunrise again."
"disappear with me, to a place that has no name."
i only know how to exist when you're in love with me.
"when you're drowning and don't want to be saved, because he is the ocean."
"if i've held you, then surely i've held the universe."
"last night i dreamt of tangled things. my hair in your hands, bed sheets and our limbs hiding from the sunrise."
"if you are the storm rolling through this town, i hope you stay, until your hands have destroyed everything about me."
get outside and stare at a tree.
the cemetery and an eerie face between the trees?
"last night, i touched myself with your hands."
"when i think of you leaving, the ocean inside me smashes against my ribcage, and erodes a little piece of my heart."
drip your sweat and blood into tiny vials so i can wear them around my neck.
"because if you do, credibility is lost and more often than not, so is your cause."
"and whatever you do, don't disregard the safety and/or reputation of other good people in your quest to do good."
"even activism has boundaries, at least it should. make people feel uncomfortable but speak informatively when trying to change minds."
"i'm all for activism. i marched through most of my teen years against animal cruelty, equal rights for homosexuals and ridiculous tax laws"
every time you look at me there's a collision on a candlelit highway.
eyes capable of starting a war.
he kissed like a poet trying to rewrite the language of love.
"the way fog creeps over the hills, chasing the fire that burned them."
the door handle is crying because it doesn't want to close.
when you're both the quiet room and busy street who's not sure if she wants silence or noise.
"your bones are creaking, like the floors of this old house."
the sunrise leaks onto raised rooftops. like a fire burning without a flame.
we try. we might fall and burn things but we get up again and love.
may your hands commit savage crimes against my skin.
the scariest place you will ever visit is inside of your own mind.
his smile starts and ends all the wars inside of me.
"when you take a picture off the wall, a shadow of the memory is all that remains."
"when the hill crumbles, hold on tight to those waiting at the bottom."
"it might be cliche, but i still wish i were a forest fire."
Fernando Pessoa. The book of disquiet.
she is the sunrise stretching across his sheets.
girl dressed up like a tidal wave.
your voice is still sliding down my spine.
we wrote poems on the walls of abandoned houses because we knew they were the same as us.
i feel so small against the sky. maybe that's how it's meant to feel. maybe it keeps us humble.
"you touch me, and even when you leave, i can still feel your hands."
90% of natural disasters are actually caused by his eyes.
the light tapping of rain on the window. a symphony of madness.
there's a fragility in you that is offset by something unbreakable.
the world is both a beautiful and horrific place. it's up to you which eyes to view it through.
i never felt alone until i realized there are days that exist without you.
"Hope came knocking again, but this time I set her on fire so she can't come crawling back."
"My pain is covered in the smell of this centuries old city, and somehow that makes it easier to bear."
"I keep dreaming your heart is a locked door bound with heavy chains &amp; when I reach down for the key, I realize I don't have any hands."
There are memories in these walls and they all have my father's eyes.
"I can only love you hard, but I'll do it with gentle hands."
My hands catch fire every time I try to write your name.
"I'm afraid of what I'll find when I see you, so I hold my breath and hope the wind takes my hand."
Home is not where you were born and raised. Home is in the people around you.
I think he did x @aphrodisiac_she
"The wolves are close tonight, but I'll outrun them. I always do."
"And I will sit with the trees and hang onto hope, because today it's all I have."
"And we wait and hope you stay, while you close your eyes and hope it takes you without pain."
We don't get over death. We only find ways to live life without that person in it.
"When somebody dies, a part of you dies too. Something new and unknown emerges from the grief."
"And love just keeps on coming, like a river that doesn't know it's reached the mouth of the ocean."
"She learned from him. There were parts of her she didn't recognize, but she touched them, loved them and decided they will stay."
Do you remember the night of the storm? The way you dried my hair and kissed the raindrops off my skin.
I realized when I met you poetry wasn't words. It was all the ways I touched you and loved you without a pen.
We won't get along if you don't like things in flames.
You can tell when they've kissed. He's left with moon dust all over his tongue.
Some people will stand with you even when the ground beneath them is on fire.
"I watched the trees today. The leaves don't fall the same, but I keep a fire burning in my forest, in case you want to come home."
"Life can change in an instant. Don't be the one crying at a funeral, with a pocketful of things you should have said."
"Touch you, like the world will end if I don't."
Sometimes you have to ignore the world and concentrate on the air hanging between you as you kiss your lover's lips.
"It's hard to breathe when my heartbeat is all the way over there, still thundering inside your chest."
"Love was a song I kept forgetting the words to, but there's something about your voice that helps me remember."
"He's like the ocean. Mostly undiscovered, and I feel like my hands still have so much more to do."
I found your hands all over my memories again.
Until I conquer you again.
Maybe the wind is a permanent sigh for all the temporary lovers it has passed through.
His mouth is a place where good girls go to die.
I trusted the wolves. I could have stayed with them. I wanted to.
The kind of boy you'd like to smoke so his scent clings to you hair and his poison never leaves your lungs.
The walls are peeling. This house feels abandoned. I want to leave but I don't.
"You stay awake at night to smell his clothes, and remember how your hair felt in his hands."
We either hold on too tight or not at all.
"I've been catching pockets of air for days, and yet it's still so hard to breathe."
I visited a place once that reminded me of your sad eyes.
How can I be a body of water and always be in flames.
"I wrote poems on the walls of an abandoned house so they'd know they were loved. So they'd know, a part of me will always live there."
"I don't have much, but this morning I put the sunrise in my pocket &amp; I'd like to give all its light to you."
You don't get to anything on time because you spend all day writing poems about her eyes.
I became the moon because you said you're afraid of the dark.
Find someone who walks you through the fiercest storm and turns the wreckage into shelter.
"Because you are too concerned with what grows in the garden of others, your own is dying and full of weeds."
You are everything I didn't ask for and more than I could ever dream.
I have nothing to give you but hollow ribs and a paper heart that so easily burns.
"He has never let go of my hand, even when mine were empty."
"Fall in love with a boy who makes the world spin a little slower, but still holds onto your hands as if life were his final dance."
"You are like the sun in winter, or a cool rain in the middle of July."
"Love is a blind man touching your face, and understanding your beauty through the tremble in his palms."
To look in her eyes is like drinking a glass of the ocean.
"When you touched his hand, you could hear echoes of all the people who'd let go."
Her kiss tasted like seawater and shipwrecks.
He is a small church. He is her god. He is the reason she still believes there's a point to pressing palms.
"Some people slip through your fingers, others will purposely let go of your hand."
"If I am rain, you are the clouds I want to sleep in."
But does he give you flushed cheeks and sweaty palms.
How dare the day keep calling when I have such weariness in my bones.
"A small garden, where you grow your own fear."
Look at the trees. Look at how the leaves fall for you.
"I didn't know who you were then, but I wanted you to walk with me."
Somewhere there are hills burning. Somewhere else the ground is colder than your breath when you have to say goodbye.
"I am quiet but nowhere near calm. I am an empty church but rarely a cathedral. I am often fire without flames, but above all, I am yours."
"""The only reason god gave me hands was to hold you. And he finely tuned the drums in my ears just to hear your voice"". JP Cooper"
My hands are full of promises. Please hold them.
Hold you so close you're confused about whose heart is beating inside your chest.
Time flows like a frozen river every time you have to say goodbye.
"No one will protect you, like the man who loves you, more than he loves life itself."
Can't keep up with this love for you. It's running me over like a freight train.
Wanna kiss you like it's the last time the sun will ever set.
You were finishing my thoughts before we even met.
"I can't breathe when you're around, and lately I've been drowning."
"A head on collision with your lips, and quite happy to be lost in the wreckage."
"I've been lying in this forest all night, waiting for you to come and kiss the moonlight off my skin."
"An antique shop, but for memories, because your pain might be someone else's pleasure."
My favorite color on you is courage. You look good in love and lust too.
"A love so hot, it starts fires on the ocean floor."
Wanna be your antagonist. Wanna destroy you in the most poetic way.
"My biggest fear is that you'll leave, and I'll be trapped in this room knowing how it feels to drown without water."
"All those times you walked through fire, just to rescue the girl who had set your heart in flames."
"I fell in love with the bruises on your hands, and how you climbed out of who they said you were."
Fall in love with a boy who holds you like your father never could.
What if fingerprints were memories you can't get back. What if you could leave your childhood behind on random things that you have touched.
"When you're not here, the air moves around me like a stranger, like something foreign invading my lungs."
"I'm sorry the forest won't love you back, but you're not very nice to the trees."
"I dreamt the sky was empty, until a sunrise bloomed from the curve of your smile."
I keep the breath from our first kiss stitched inside the crease of my palms.
"She is the wind, and once she passes through you, you'll never breathe the same way again."
Catching Flies - Stay Forever (Live)
"He's called me beautiful so many times, I'm almost convinced that it's my name."
"I'm tired, but the sun keeps calling anyway."
"I want to exist in the lines of your palms, and hold all the memories of the things you have touched."
I can't imagine a world without your hands.
"Touch me, like it's the first time you've ever used your hands."
Be careful where you throw your match. She's a forest doused in gasoline.
"She's shy, like gunfire."
"One day, I will wake in the night, and instead of grabbing a handful of sheets, I will sink my hands into you."
"I'll keep your breath in tiny vials, and your fingerprints pressed between the pages of a book."
"He starts wars with that smile, and I'm always unarmed."
I will hold your storms in the palm of my hand and turn them into shelter.
"It's raining, and when it taps against my window, I swear I hear your voice."
It's quite okay to love your own hands. And maybe we should before we let them love anyone else.
Jacob Banks - Worthy (Official Video)
"Because your hands are full of real things, and your mouth is full of words you're not afraid to say."
The fields are burning. The sun hangs low in the sky.
Some people make you believe the wind only touches you like that.
Trying to describe my love for you is like screaming at the bottom of the ocean and expecting someone to hear.
There are no dark hallways in this house. We commit our sins with the lights on.
"His lips are a taste of summer, when winter holds me with cold hands."
"When your mouth is filled with bad memories, I will kiss you and bury them in mine."
My hands are small but they will hold this ocean you have given me.
"I want to hold you like I'll never see you again, because I miss you like it's the last time I ever will."
Imagine if we lived in a world where it was the truth that spread like wildfire.
"I miss your face, and how sometimes your eyes look sad even when you're smiling."
I'll visit places that remind me of you until I can see you again.
The universe sighs with trembling hands because she hasn't been able to hold you.
"I don't care if your eyes hold sunsets or pour oceans, because I want to taste it all."
"The way a room smells after you leave, and how I can feel you for hours on my hands."
Madness must seek its own help in order to change.
He is open doors and simple rooms lit with chandeliers.
I would crawl across time to touch you.
Did you know the rain only falls just to touch his skin?
"Well, I just might be in love."
"And you'll fall apart, like a house torn down by a hurricane, until he can hold you again."
"Love like a silent movie, because sometimes actions are all you need."
"Some people are gunshots, others are the silence that hangs in the air after the trigger is pulled."
How do you tie my throat in knots and still give these words their wings?
I have walked these dark places inside of me &amp; take comfort that I fear more what dwells outside my window once the sun has risen on the day
"Suffering will cross every man's path. The test of character, is in how well he walks with it."
"True compassion is shown quietly, and not a garish act for all the world to see."
The sun is shining but I am cold without the warmth of your hands.
"Atrocity likes an audience. Don't give it one, not even quietly from the sidelines."
"I want to be the poem that keeps you up at night, and the ache inside your fingers, until your hands can write it down."
He's why all the fires started. She's the reason they still burn.
"No one will remember your ""epic point"" if you're insulting. Spit out rose petals, not thorns."
"I'll never forget the first time I saw you, I coughed up butterflies for the rest of the day."
"This is beautiful. ""Slap her"": children's reactions"
"Be kind, always. For some people just breathing is harder than it looks."
Tracing figure eights on your lips while you're writing about how much you'd like to kiss me.
"I wonder how many stars have died, because they could not compare to the light inside your eyes."
These trees know me by name.
"""There is no subject so old that something new cannot be said about it."" Fyodor Dostoevsky"
I love this. Thank you! @precariouswords
The conversations your body has with your hands when you miss me.
"Everything about her is a rainy day, and even your hands are cold and clammy at the thought of touching her skin."
"People are blind until they see. You can offer insight, but most will find clarity on their own."
I lay awake at night wondering how many conversations the rain has had with your window.
"These flowers have survived the cold. They are beautiful, still and remind me of you."
"When I miss you, I stare at the stars the same way I've stared at your eyes, and for a brief moment, I can feel your presence surround me."
Winter has cold fingers and I miss the warmth of yours.
Her hands were the shape of a door. He waited patiently for her to open it.
"You are why my heart is beautiful, and the reason it keeps beating."
"She wasn't doing a thing that I could see, except standing there leaning on the balcony railing, holding the universe together. JD Salinger."
"I want to be the breath you hold when you're nervous, and the butterfly wings you pick from your teeth when you finally say it out loud."
"One day, someone will love you exactly how you need to be loved, and you will burn every poem you ever wrote about not being enough."
"Kiss her, like you just found god in the curve of her smile."
"And when she unfolded him, there was a picture of her where his heart used to be."
"He stood before her like a love letter, but her hands were tied in knots and she was too afraid to read."
"The difference between the way your hands tremble when you hold me, and how they shake when you can't."
I have a mouth filled with tomorrows. Kiss me.
"I don't know if it's me or the ground trembling, but you just kissed me and now I can't feel my hands."
Love people who remind you why the sky is beautiful.
Even your breath is a poem.
"Everything about you is a poem. Like the sloped hill of your cheekbone, or the low hanging valleys of your spine."
The stars were trying to impersonate your eyes again last night.
"Home is the pause between each breath, the steady beat of your heart, and the truth that escapes your beautiful mind."
He looks at me like I'm the reason stars exist. He holds me like he can't exist without me.
"Some carry a battlefield inside their chest, even though there are no wars to fight."
I believe in nature and humanity. Ignore those who have neither in their veins.
"Baby, you're so rare I should put you in a museum."
Storms are of no consequence when rolling through an abandoned town.
"It's how we identify with the wind. To pass through this life quietly touching it, without being seen, or touched in return."
My hands only exist to touch you.
"It's the way light bends around him, or how rain falls just to touch him. But mostly it's about knowing, that I exist to love him."
"Sometimes, I love you, is all the poetry there is."
"We burned our childhood home, but sometimes we go back there, to smell the memories in the ashes."
"Remember when we laid together on the sand, hoping we would feel the heartbeat of the sea."
"People are so afraid of being put inside the ground, but insist on doing most of their dying, while they're still above it."
"It doesn't have to be 3am to miss you, with shaking hands, and the weight of absence crushing my lungs."
"Be romantic. Instead of throwing pebbles at his window to get attention, throw a rock and break it."
"When you love someone, you don't let any dust settle on the last thing they touched."
"There are storms inside of me, they are not quiet, and every one of them bears your name."
Standing in the rain watching a street light flicker and wondering if it's missing you too.
I always miss you more when it rains.
Got the results of my chest x ray today.
To be the air that moves around you.
You are the reason love looks like an open book instead of a closed door.
"Something about the way you hold me with your eyes, and set me free every time you take my hand."
"When he becomes every reason, and also why you lose it."
"The fire is burning but you're still cold &amp; this is when you realize, the only place you feel warmth is the shelter of his arms."
"Because your kiss never tastes like an apology, and your hands are never excuses for the things you didn't say."
"The more you speak, the less I want to hear what anyone else has to say."
The sky has never been so clear. The sunrise never held so gently inside the palm of my hand.
"Some people reflect beauty as they speak, others make you realize the value of silence."
"I know that fear can burn bridges, so I threw the matches away the day I crossed paths with you."
"Lost with you, and searching for ways to never be found."
Then maybe love is to see everything I've searched a mirror for in the shadows of your eyes.
"I am an undiscovered country, declare war on me with your hands."
But have you ever watched the sun chase the sadness from his eyes.
"You meet her, and all the wars inside your chest grow silent. You love her, and realize she's the only thing worth the pain of bloody hands."
"The way she undresses for him, without taking off any clothes."
Running your hands over everything he's touched to feel how memories made a home in the creases of his palms.
One day.
"When I miss you, every word I try to say comes out as your name."
"Some memories haunt your fingers, and it's okay to tell them you will not write about ghosts."
The silence of a small town. The noisy footsteps of a boy who refused to be forgotten.
He loves me like a soft December night. The kind with strong winds and warm hands.
"Sometimes I am a quiet morning, others I am the noise to shatter it."
"I don't smoke but there are stains on the ceiling, and at night, they all take the shape of your face."
"When you were born, the sky changed color, stars lined up to touch you, and a girl across the ocean held the future in her hands."
Thank the good lord above for Greek yogurt and wildflower honey.
Things I love. The forest at night. Sounds of the ocean and the way he breathes when he's dreaming.
Just gonna love you until the sun burns us all into a pile of faceless ash.
"The irony that trees are killed to make coffins &amp; paper, and she was in love with both words and death."
"We take the hands of those we love for a reason. If you project negativity and hate, don't be surprised when yours are always empty."
"She writes poetry without a pen. She speaks loudly of her love for him, without saying a single word."
"I think I existed before you. Although I never really heard my heart beat, until I placed it in the palm of your hand."
"Everyone has a story, only some hands have the strength to write it."
Swallow life. Pick the debris from between your teeth.
An isolated cabin. A melody of wind chimes. The faint smell of burning leaves.
"It's like my mother always said, if you have nothing nice to say, give your man a blow job."
Wear the forest as a dress. Bathe your skin in the fading winter sun. Sleep to the sounds of a midnight sky screaming.
Contain this fire. I dare you.
There's no such thing as a gentle storm. Knock the lights out or go home.
"I'll paint my lips with every red morning, and kiss you like a sun who doesn't know that she is dying."
Fill my mouth with gunfire.
"At night the wind howls outside his window. It longs to touch him, but is no match for the warmth of his lover's protective hands."
"Keep the things you love in your pocket, like a memory or the ocean, and the boy who holds your hand."
I don't want to live any tomorrow's unless the days start with your name.
"I have been more empty than full, more chaos than calm, and never does he hesitate when I reach to take his hand."
I have abandoned melancholy for the trust of a boy with hands that wish to stay.
Abandoned / adjective. When you have curled your tiny fingers around too many temporary hands.
Hope is the sound of your heart beating after the world has swallowed you whole.
"When you love so violently, there's a crime scene in your bedroom and your chest."
"I am fascinated by the sea and love, because both can swallow you whole."
"When the world cannot speak &amp; every door is closed, She'll be what's caught in your throat. She'll be why your door's still open."
Love is like looking down the barrel of a gun but it is your fingers on the trigger.
"The schoolyard is abandoned but you can still hear their voices. The vacant feeling in your chest, is a reminder that no one was listening."
"I wanted to tell you I loved you, but the butterflies in my stomach swarmed my throat, and all the words got caught in their wings."
Your first hello made up for everyone who's ever said goodbye.
You are the storm door that doesn't close and the chaos that howls inside.
To love is to walk a journey that exists on no map.
"Someone just asked me what I cannot live without, and all I could do was draw a picture of your hands."
Love is when your hands shake but you reach for mine anyway.
Love is when your voice trembles but you say the words anyway.
"You wake in a panic at 3am, praying that miles are porcelain, so you can grind the distance between you to dust."
"Some girls are the funeral flowers placed on their mother's grave, and some girls are the tears that fall into their father's hands."
I dreamt love was a staircase once with heavy wood floors &amp; wrought iron rails. I tripped on the first step &amp; I've been falling ever since.
Things that tremble at night: My hands as I grip these sheets as if reaching will bring you closer.
"I touched you, and you will stay here with me, like dirt under my fingernails, like ashes left from the fires we set."
Maybe it's about learning to speak with quieter lips and louder hands.
Time always has more meaning when it's running the other way.
"Maybe we need to remember while some people are roots, other people are leaves, and both make a tree more beautiful."
I miss the way you wreak havoc with your hands.
"Smoker's cough, from all the memories inside your lungs."
"Kiss me, until I forget what it's like to breathe."
But have you ever clung to a tree and watered its roots with your tears?
"Sometimes the rain is a gentle shower, others she is a downpour you'll be lucky to survive."
All I want for Christmas are your hands around my throat.
"Suddenly, the spaces between your fingers are not your own, and the air you breathe is foreign to your lungs."
I've never been so addicted to a single human heart. I've never been so afraid that one day it won't beat for me.
I miss your unsteady hands and how every time you touched me they were begging me to stay.
Accidentally cut myself and this is what I found inside.
"Hi, yes you can. If you can please add ¬©RaineCooper at the bottom of each one that would be great. Thank you. :) @lewhannie"
"It's the way she reminds you of everything you can't avoid, like trees &amp; air, and every crack in the sidewalk that has a story to tell."
I painted the sky black because he said he likes the darkness.
How dare you sleep when I miss you.
You know it's love when your heart trembles as much as your hands.
"You cannot stop time, anymore than you can change the way people move through it."
"If you peel back his eyelids at night, you'll find a girl with seawater lungs dancing across his pupils."
"She was graceful in a violent way, and he could never resist looking down the barrel of her gun."
"Cliffs are afraid of her, and leap to their death in the ocean."
"Sing to her, with gunfire."
"The wind has not stopped screaming, and yet the trees they do not bend."
She is both the dark highway and the flickering streetlights she leaves behind.
"Be something rebellious, like a wildflower growing in the desert."
the kind of girl who makes the winter air tremble.
"As night surrounds us, you slip your hand in mine, and for just a moment, the rest of the world goes quiet."
"You stare at the door wondering how many hands have slammed it, and the walls are screaming the names of every heartbeat that said goodbye."
Describing my love for you would be like trying to fold my arms around the ocean.
"When I was a little girl, I pretended to be a butterfly. It was a safe place, because in reality, you were always there to burn my wings."
"She's all crooked skylines and soft river beds. She'll lift you to places you've never seen, then gently drown you."
"Humanity is tragic but with one fall and rise of his chest, he makes the world beautiful."
"His kiss will land on your lips like a butterfly. That thing he does with his tongue, will set fire to her wings."
"All the boys you loved were abandoned churches with no forwarding address, until the day you knocked down his door &amp; walked into a cathedral"
Her eyes will make you seasick. They will pull you under until you're shipwrecked on the ocean floor.
"His heartbeat is a sonnet, written by candlelight when he thought no one was listening."
"The first time I heard my heart beat, was when it started living inside your chest."
I'll carve poems under your skin. You won't forget me.
"Some girls are made entirely of winter, and some boys burn like forest fires just to keep them warm."
She's all winter storms and rain clouds hiding beneath a white summer dress.
She'll destroy your quiet and make a home inside your silence.
"The sea is not calm. She will pull you under, and she will not rest until you're drowning on the ocean floor."
"Sometimes all I know is that I love you more than I've loved any fire, and I have no idea how to live without your flames."
I want.
"I've burned every door I ever closed, to make sure I wouldn't miss the one that you held open."
There isn't a single cell in me where you don't exist.
Staring at the ceiling thinking of all the ways you can use your hands.
"He is water, he is fire, and I cannot decide if I want to burn or drown."
Your pulse is the best poem ever written.
Stop apologizing for your existence.
The way her name echoes in your chest. The way her skin still speaks to your fingertips.
"Always listen to the person who loves you, not the voice of the past that gave you your fears."
Your stare penetrates all the soft places she lets nobody else see.
My favorite song is the sound of your heartbeat when I tell you that I love you.
You are.
"For me, there is no difference between dying and living without you."
A sudden longing for the smell of damp leaves and a low hanging sun.
Wanna be the reason you speak of god at 3am.
"Before I met you, I only built bridges so I could jump from them."
"I want to be the last song you ever write, and the only song you want to dance to."
"He is the both the night sky and the sun, yet I know nothing of darkness or burning hands."
Could of ‚ùå  Could have or could've ‚úîÔ∏è  You're welcome.
The sun trembling over carefully eroded mountain tops is how my skin feels when you kiss me.
I fell in love with a boy who taught me how to listen to sunsets with my eyes.
All my poems are original and mine. @AhsanJaved_
"The night is quiet. Street lamps flicker as if confused by an approaching dawn. The absence of people, soothes the beaten sidewalk."
"Rivers rush under his eyelids when he sleeps, she haunts him even in dreams."
"Even when he sleeps he thinks of her, you can tell by the tremble in his palms."
Clams Casino - I'm God
"You try to lock all the doors but she breaks them down anyway, because behind them is the most valuable thing she's ever stolen."
He's the only thing that makes sense. The rest is just noise.
Those who say don't get burned twice by the same flame have obviously never looked into his eyes.
"When he walks, leaves fall. When he speaks, moonlight pours from his hands."
He looked into her eyes and swallowed half the ocean.
"You exist so beautifully, even when disaster sits in the crease of your palms."
Happy birthday @jimmy_sharpe I name this day national cardigan day!
"And maybe we just need to hold things differently, because a heart is more fragile than a hand."
Fall in love with a boy who doesn't mind getting dirty from the mess left by another's hands.
I spend vast amounts of time just thinking of all the ways I can kiss you.
And that's quite enough about cardigans for tonight Raine Cooper.
I love you but not *throw my best cardigan* over a puddle love you.
What's really sad is there are people out there who don't appreciate cardigans.
Maybe we just need to fall in love with the warmth of something that doesn't burn.
"You said the world disappears when I touch you, but my world only exists when you hold me in your arms."
"Now that you have held me, I have nothing to write about absent hands."
Shipwrecked off the coast of your sea glass eyes &amp; naked saltwater skin.
He has eyes like open caskets and my god you can't wait to die.
Describing my love for you would be like trying to stitch the ocean together.
"Things that come in waves, and no one has ever been able to stop the sea."
These words are just the lunatics escaping from her mind.
No more temporary walls or loose hands to hold you.
We built a home from the ruins left by other hands.
The only language I need to learn is the one your lips tremble when you kiss me.
Those nightmares are just bad memories when there's no hands to shake you awake.
"These floorboards can't forget you, they even creak when you're not around."
Tell me something you've only told the darkness when you're alone at 3am.
"And I only know one way to hold you, like it's the last time I ever will."
"You meet her and time stops. You love her, and wish it would last forever."
"We walked hand in hand under the glow of street lamps, but we never needed the light, we only needed each other."
"You meet her, and words fail you. You love her, and realize, she's the last poem you'll ever write."
"Show me, in the language of your hands. Touch me, like you'll never use them again."
She likes flames and crooked skylines. She likes kissing under streetlights and dancing in the rain.
"Love her slow, like a reluctant sunrise."
The moon only shines for him that way.
You know she's fire and touch her anyway.
We compare people to wolves. They hunt to survive while humans choose to be predators.
"One day we'll visit all the old haunts, and discover time has changed everything but us."
"When I ask for five more minutes, what I really mean is forever."
He is the dense fog. He is the moon that lights the way.
I'd need at least 50 to crush my fellow human to death. @distantraine

"You are the caught breath in my lungs. You are the tornado in my stomach. You are the hunger that has taken root, deep inside these bones."
INFP Problems
She is a steep cliff. She is an unpredictable sea.
"You meet her, and suddenly the night doesn't seem so dark. You love her, and realize, you're no longer afraid to touch the sun."
"To my father: You carried a battlefield inside your chest, but had no real wars to fight."
"He's all white capped waves and hurricanes, &amp; often the only thing that reminds her she's still alive."
Change is often the demon who saves you.
"You meet her, and suddenly the world spins a little slower. You love her, and realize, she's the last song you'll ever dance to."
"I'll become the wind and surround you, so you are never without my touch."
"To my father: You are poems written in the fog of cracked windows. You are the house that burned down, before I could call it a home."
"Speak to him in moonlight, touch him with your sunrise hands."
"You meet her, and all the chaos inside you turns into silence."
"He loves the sound of oceans, so now she only speaks in waves."
"His eyes were like a river, a river set on fire, and something deep inside them made it hard to turn away."
"I rebuilt his heart, and this time it has no doors."
"Love me gently, like a tidal wave."
Sometimes you find a home in someone else's skin.
Humans will gather to stare at destruction and ignore a beautiful sunset.
"You meet her, and all the rivers inside you turn into oceans."
"Melancholy is an interesting place for a poet. The words are often so beautiful there, we never want to leave."
"Without you, my heart is barely beating, like the hands of an antique clock someone forgot to wind."
"Lay with me, and make a mess of the forest floor."
He poured love inside my hands and taught me how to hold it.
"Take me to bed, until nothing makes sense."
Only the most beautiful things fall.
One day I'll write a poem that speaks as much as your eyes do.
I love you more than everything in the forest. I love you more than the chaos of a dark and furious sky.
It's tough being the prettiest girl in the morgue.
"She's pure, like gunshots on a wide open street."
Happy birthday Hiren. I hope it's a great day. Hugs x @ItsAPerfectLife
"Beautiful, like toxic waste."
"There are depths to me that only you have awoken, there are parts of me, that only your eyes can see."
Dimly lit rooms. Years of escape scratched into the walls.
The banality of a moderate life. The risk of an arousing one.
"And if all the seas merged into one, I would brave such depths to find you."
"And you, with your strong hands and gentle heart."
"Write me something I can hold onto, write me something that won't let go."
She loved him so hard he burst into flames.
Pour sunlight in a glass. Drink daily.
And I have never needed light to see you.
"What does your mind undress at night, when only the dark is watching?"
We are all villains here.
"The way love used to cage me, and now it's everything that sets me free."
"Sometimes the moon shies away, but still the dark comes every night to claim her."
And I have never needed touch to feel you.
But I have never needed eyes to find you.
"I wonder if storms have a graveyard, for all the things they have taken and will never give back."
Fernando Pessoa. The Book of Disquiet.
"Love, is to be destroyed so beautifully and put back together in a single rush of his breath."
"We are the same you and I, addicted to beauty, fascinated by tragedy, and never afraid to put our hands inside the fire."
"The doors are locked, the windows smashed in, but there is still love inside the bones of this old house."
You are the secret I cannot keep. You are the jagged mountain edge I am not afraid to touch.
"People stop me all the time &amp; ask why I'm taking a picture because it's ""just a tree."" Silly people."
You are both this quiet room and the storm that shatters the windows.
*marries my cardigan*
She touches him gently with her flower petal hands.
"You're seven years old, your hands are empty, but still you reach deep in your pockets, and give what you can of your cast away heart."
"Something about burning a church, and building cathedrals out of the ashes."
"Make me the kind of wall you press yourself against, and leave a part of you inside."
"It doesn't matter what you guard your heart with, love will break it down and find a way in."
"Sometimes she was the dust rolling through an empty town, others she was the storm that caused it."
"Be something soft and subtle, like gunfire."
"His eyes are like a late August sunset, and his arms are my protection from the storm."
I took my own advice and sat with the trees.
"If a room is empty, fill it with me. If your heart is hurting, let me hold it."
She's beautifully violent. Like a flower with a hand grenade.
"Our generation appreciates nothing. Happiness is chemical, &amp; we rarely look up from our phones. Smell the air, sit with a tree &amp; breathe."
The movie Extraterrestrial had its very own smoking man at the end &amp; has renewed my long time love affair with the X-Files.
"The sky is different everyday, and this is why it's beautiful."
"It's okay to be private, it doesn't mean you're unkind."
"When I'm awake, I miss you. When I'm asleep, I dream of you."
"I carry this heart like it belongs to me, it doesn't because it only beats for you."
"Falling in love with your fingers, and how they write the future on my hands."
"She looked like silent snowfall but when she spoke, she was violent hail, smashing out hearts and distant headlights."
"We chase storms for excitement, and this includes boys with eyes like midnight, and a smile like the end of the world."
I didn't understand consistency until I met you. I was always too busy planning escape routes.
"Tell me not to conquer something, then watch me do it with violent grace."
"I am often in the same place as the rain, scattered, and never knowing when I will fall,"
I just want to write about you and forests.
The wind is restless and so am I.
"What if I told you that the sky would fall into the ocean, if you ever said goodbye."
I just watched an action movie (I rarely do) with both Arnold Schwarzenegger &amp; Sylvester Stallone. It was cheesy guilty pleasure heaven.
"When you love someone, you'd give up your happiness for the sake of their own. When that love is true &amp; returned, they'd never ask you to."
I love looking into your eyes because they tell me you're never leaving.
"She lived in a strange room full of dead butterflies, but she swore she could hear their wings."
Please get your head out of my clouds.
I assure you I was quite dead inside until he brought me back to life.
"Wrap your limbs around me like tree branches, and inhale me like the wind,"
The kind of girl who sleeps naked on the forest floor.
"He waits at the edge of a deserted highway. It was the last place he saw her, the last place she spoke his name."
"She knows nothing of consistency. She's either a violent hurricane or a single drop of rain, and you're fucked if you don't like storms."
I'd write you a love letter but you'll be unfolding it for the rest of your life.
"To be understood is to listen, and we are far too busy drowning in our own tragedies for that."
"A dying star, but still he lingered there, in the dark of night, just to watch her shine."
"When god created compassion, he placed an ocean in your palm, and asked that you would share it, with those who needed rain."
"The way flowers bloom only to die, some beauty is meant to be fleeting."
Even an avalanche would not compare to the way my body trembles when you touch me.
You are everywhere I go and everywhere I need to be.
"There are countries beneath your skin I have never seen. I will trace them with my fingertips, until every one feels like home."
*Invents a mirror that shows what's ugly on the inside.*
I can't sleep anymore unless you're breathing your dreams into the nape of my neck.
Gonna love you so hard your bones will break.
I'd let you burn my forest down and blame myself for lighting the match.
I love you enough to let go of the sea.
"When you talk, and all that comes out is radio static."
I wish I could hear something other than the silence screaming inside my head.
"I can't really call anything mine, it all belongs to you now."
"All those times you became the sea, just to reach her distant shores."
"Gonna kiss your mouth so hard, you forget time exists."
"Falling in love with your hands, and the disasters they create on my skin."
"Did you know that when you hold her, you're wrapping your arms around a flame."
"Let's fall asleep in a field of wildflowers, until the sun kisses our dreams awake."
"I love you in ways I don't understand. I'm overwhelmed, my breath is caught, and there is a thousand words stuck inside my throat."
"Sometimes I wonder where you come from. You're too beautiful to be of this world, too human to be anything else."
Winter and its bare bones.
I stopped being a winter morning the day you touched me with your wildfire hands.
I didn't know hearts could smile until you walked in and captured mine.
"I'll love you so recklessly, your feet won't touch the ground."
"I wonder, if you keep sand in your pocket, do you become the sea, or if you collect enough drops of rain, do you eventually become the sky?"
"Today, I collected the ocean in my hands, because I know you like the sound of waves rocking you to sleep."
"Communication so easily crumbles, and we are left to make sense of the ruins."
"The dawn has no patience, she smothers everything in sunlight whether we like it or not."
Orison Swet Marden. @Terrence101010
"Scream at the sky, the night is a patient listener."
"So desperate to belong, when really we're just abandoned houses with no forwarding address."
Humans are strange creatures. Their attempts to seek approval and fit into a societal mold. So I sit here and embrace my peculiarity.
"People noise is painful, I'd rather listen to the wind and the sound of falling leaves."
"We make homes out of things that can die, and maybe this is the risk you take for love."
"I'll meet you in the forest, I need to be taken rough, up against a tree."
He is the flickering street light for the girl so often alone in the dark.
"The way we love, even as the world tears itself down around us."
Somedays I fall like rain but I am caught in his palm before ever hitting the ground.
"Your hands, as a necklace."
Fuck me like there's a meteor shower about to destroy the earth.
Kiss me so hard my mouth forgets your name.
"She is a criminal, with the intent to steal his heart and never give it back."
I know a road paved with rain and fallen leaves. Walk with me.
All he ever wanted was someone who understood the conversations in his eyes.
"If all men loved the way you do, wars would end, and sadness would sink to the bottom of the ocean floor."
"When you are a song, I will dance. When you are silence, I will fill your mouth with words."
I collected a handful of dried leaves today because dead things are beautiful too.
He is a memory of silence when all I hear is noise.
We watched cities burn and slowly fade into the ocean.
"I was raised like a forest fire, and I am not done burning you yet."
To feel the weight of you and speak of god.
"Loving you, is like looking through a shattered window, and somehow clearly seeing everything that's inside."
I want to be the words that travel your mind when your mouth doesn't know what to say.
"When your hands are empty, I will fill them. When your heart is broken, I will stand guard over the pieces."
How beautiful you are with those downcast eyes and skin that smells like rain.
Don't talk to him about drowning unless you've looked in her seawater eyes.
"I watch you sleep and wonder if these words will ever do justice to your beauty, but I keep on trying anyway."
And you throw your hand into the darkness anyway.
"When the person you love hurts, it feels like the whole world is pressing on your lungs."
But would you set yourself on fire just to keep her warm?
"When the fog clears, she'll be waiting."
Let me hide with you.
"I prefer trees over people, books over television and solitude over crowds. I feel out of place a lot, but I wouldn't change me."
I only want to be touched if your hands are like a slow burning fire.
Fell asleep last night to the sound of the house burning down around me.
"Love each other through everything, and do everything, together."
"When you are noise, I will be silence. When you are fear, I will be courage, but whatever you are, you will be loved."
"Ghosts are heavy, let them go."
"Every word, every breath, every mistake is because I love."
"Ruin me, and not gently."
"Legs that go on like a highway, and I think your hand just ran off the road."
I could write a thousand love letters just with what your eyes say.
"Nothing is certain, except this cold sea in my chest every time we say goodbye."
"You cannot force what doesn't exist, anymore than you can deny what does."
"He's like a storm wind blowing through the forest, that somehow manages not to disturb the leaves."
The world is dying and you're the only thing that's beautiful.
All the good poets are as mad as the sea.
*Moves to Narnia*
"The art of learning silence, when your head is full of noise."
"We made our home in the dying forest, with broken twigs and fallen autumn leaves."
I want to burn every city between us so you can put out the fire you started in me.
I keep my windows open during a storm so all the chaos blows inside.
"My heart only exists inside your chest, my breath inside your lungs."
It's the way you never turn your back. It's the way your heart is always an open door.
"Your hands should come with a warning label, they've started fires all over my skin."
"I am a storm and I do not come in peace. I'll love you violently, because I know no other way."
"The way he makes everything right, in a world so often full of wrong."
The way you touch abandoned things and turn them into home.
"When he looks into her eyes, he can hear the sound of the ocean breathing."
You quiet the demons and silence the noise.
I wish my hands were closer so I could tell you how I feel.
"I feel like a butterfly, turned back to a caterpillar, so I could love you all over again."
"To love is to realize, you are learning how to hold each other every single day."
Entire cities collapse when you kiss me.
"Your eyes are a sort of wilderness, but I am not afraid. I'll bring the softest parts of my heart, and a sword, for the inevitable battle."
Kiss me. Let me taste what haunts you.
A heart like a crime scene and your fingerprints are everywhere.
It's raining and I miss you.
The world is cruel but we must love in spite of it.
"""But how could you live and have no story to tell?"" Fyodor Dostoevsky"
"I am in love with a boy who breathes poetry, and wears the night sky like a second skin."
"Face down on the forest floor, she grips it silently and weeps."
"A reoccurring dream where you're trying to find your childhood, that's just an endless search for a home you've no address for."
I want to be all the dark secrets you're afraid to admit to yourself.
"We took to the sea to escape the fire, yet here we are still burning at the bottom of the ocean floor."
Burn your fears and keep them in an urn above the fireplace.
She likes being his little whore.
Your wrinkled blue sheets are an ocean I'd like to drown in.
I left my sanity in your mouth the last time you kissed me.
"Apart we were broken sentences. Together, we are a poem. Forever, we are love."
"It's not the way you look at me, it's the way your eyes still see me long after you've walked away."
I miss having intimate conversations with your eyes.
Trying not to let the past harden these gentle hands.
Maybe clarity only comes after you stop bleeding.
"Let's escape this madness, to a place untouched by other hands."
You're trying to apologize but he wants to kiss you and now his lips taste like all your mistakes.
She waits in the forest for you.
"You're walking home hoping the street lights will flicker, so no one can see your tear stained cheeks."
Just want to hug a forest right now tbh.
You know it's love when you have a ten car pile up in your chest.
I'd forgotten about the forest inside of me until you brought all the trees back to life.
"Sometimes reality shakes you, violently."
How we suddenly become so fragile when being held by the one we love.
You are the quiet that hangs in the air after a storm has hit the ground.
Some people will leave. Let them.
"Your hands are a natural disaster, starting fires and wreaking havoc with everything they touch."
"I'm going to love you until the day you're planning my funeral, because you should know, I'll never survive planning yours."
The last time I saw him he was still carving her name into the asylum walls.
"You are every word I write, and all the reasons too."
Something about looking at you that makes me want to open my hand.
I am lost and this map is complicated.
"When you've found all the pieces that are lost, just remember to come home."
You are filled with words but lately I am learning to listen to your silence.
And she loved him in that dark place where self belief wept from the holes inside his chest.
"I trust you, to pull apart the seams."
"When you love someone, you keep your hands open, even if theirs are closed."
He could no longer look at the moon without hearing her name.
Some people are a cold sea and still we dive in anyway.
How do you stay so silent with all those wars inside your chest.
And some will drown without an ocean.
"How strange the language between us, so familiar, but without saying a word."
And sometimes the words wait for you.
"Likes leaves to the forest floor, everyday I fall for you."
"Whatever it is, it's always for you."
"Love me, across oceans, over mountains, beyond time."
"It may help you to know, underneath anything truly beautiful, lies something terrifying."
Your eyes are a theatre of tiny deaths and I do not mean to look away.
"Write a song with me, remind me how to sing when I cannot find my voice."
"Wind her up, make her dance for you."
"Someone smashed out all the streetlights, that's okay she said, I have you."
You meet someone who resembles a house fire yet do nothing to try and escape.
You'll find me here.
I will hold your storms in the palm of my hand and turn them into shelter.
"They say home is where the heart is, cut a hole in my chest and pull up a chair."
The way weeds now grow where flowers once bloomed.
I keep spitting out words and they all sound like I love you.
"It's time to fold up the moon, put her in your pocket, until you need her light again."
Changing my name to that sound you make every time I tell you I love you.
"I don't curse the darkness, it's where I found you."
"You are the tallest tree, you are an erupting volcano, you are viscous and violent, you are a beautiful conflict of nature."
Do you know how many wars your eyes have started? Do you know your voice has parted oceans?
"I started a fire in the palm of my hand. Reach for the flames when the dark comes, I will keep it burning for you."
"I will love the boy who lost so much in the fire, and the man he has created from the hope amongst the ashes."
Sometimes we are safer behind the asylum doors.
"The road was lonely, but still, she did not look for headlights."
Hung out with this cutie today.
"Listen to the person who loves you, not the voice of the past that gave you your fears."
"Do something you love, just make sure you tie him down first."
Reading all the love letters your mouth wrote so violently on my skin.
"When I kiss you, I'll start fires on your tongue, so the memory of me will never leave your mouth."
Still trying to flirt with the sea.
Still trying to wrap my arms around a mountain.
"If your veins are rivers, I want to swim until I'm trapped inside your heart."
My whole world revolves around his eyes.
"The trees, they missed me too."
"All those times you walked through fire, to rescue the girl who'd set you in flames."
"Today, just fall with me, like leaves to the forest floor."
"Today, I will write these words in the clouds, so you can feel my love when it rains."
"She is that girl, who will soothe the little boy, and satisfy the man."
"To discover the cities beneath your skin, until every inch of you feels like home."
"Sometimes you resemble the house fire I ran from, before I realized how much I love flames."
I stopped being an empty house the day you wiped the dust from my walls.
Jealous of the trees that tuck you in at night.
"If my hands can't touch you, they'll write about my love for you."
Strip it back to the bones and start again.
"She is the forest floor. She is decomposing branches and leaves. Now come, and get her beautiful dirt on your hands."
It helps just to know you're there.
"We are of the same mold you and I, silently understanding each other's anguish."
"The night is calling me, but I no longer listen, she always has more questions than answers."
Exist quietly.
"I won't forget these days, and you, should remember that."
"From the ruins of my past, I'll build a castle for you."
I dream of a forest where you are the trees and I am the earth that roots you.
"Dying doesn't scare me, living without you does."
"A love born from the emptiness of us. She is chaos, he the stillness, together they made a perfect storm."
How we love things the most when they are broken or leaving.
"The more subtle the change, the louder it speaks."
"Somehow feeling defeated, by what I just don't know."
"Every night, you are the reason I stare at the ceiling. You are the poem that keeps me from sleep until my hands can write it down."
"My father told me not to talk with strangers, I've not looked in the mirror ever since."
"It's the different way you hold your pen, it's the subtle gaze into the distance."
"Sometimes it's enough, just to tolerate myself."
"I borrow these words from a place deep within, hoping they'll express how much I love you."
Bury me in a field of yellow wildflowers.
"Maybe we stop asking, because we just don't care to know."
All of your words taste like you learned the hard way.
"Being whole is overrated, it's the holes that make us interesting."
"We speak of leave and stay, as if either are easy things to do."
You wouldn't have missed that if you were looking with curious eyes.
"She was raised by absence, but still believes in arms that wish to stay."
Leave it shattered and love every piece.
"Even the strongest love, will be the most fragile thing you ever hold inside your hands."
"The ghosts want to leave, but you keep writing them back to life."
"Love is a blind man touching your face, and understanding your beauty through the tremble in his palms."
Strong hands that hold me gently.
"His eyes, like dark rooms you're not afraid to enter."
He is the reason my hands tremble. He is the reason I'm so often lost for words.
My beautiful friend Suzi @Chantic took this gorgeous tree pic for me. One day we'll sit under it together. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Can you love something so hard it breaks?
He's all messy hair and trembling hands that won't quiet until he holds her.
Our safe word is do it violently.
She spits out all those broken silences and calls it poetry.
"You've burned down too many forests, to be so desperately in love with trees."
"Some will only live vicariously through danger, others, (like us) are curious enough to participate."
Some fires are impossible to put out.
"The way we always seem to find each other, even when there is no light."
"Sometimes my fingers are matches, and I burn in my own fire."
The sky has no cares today.
"That's not a bed, it's a battlefield."
Tragically curious about tragedy.
Do it violently or not at all.
All those times that we were silence when we wanted to be noise.
"Life is a series of moments, and not a single one matters without you."
"Stay with me, here."
I don't know where I'm going but I want you to come with me.
"Sometimes the past is so violent, nothing will put your fears to sleep."
I met a boy once. He had wildflowers for a heart and forest fires burning in his eyes.
"There is no remedy for pain, you carry it with you, and eventually it becomes part of who you are."
"Nothing can get close enough to the moon to know her, and the stars told me she likes it that way."
Maybe your arms are the only home I'll ever know.
Somewhere there's an abandoned house that misses you wiping the dust from its walls.
"When you know it will result in suffering, but somehow do it anyway."
You know it's love when the only things left to write about are his eyes.
"I have learned with age that I do not need much, but the one thing I know, is I will always need you."
"I sat with a homeless man in the park. He asked for nothing &amp; offered to share his sandwich. Faith in humanity restored, at least for today."
The night can beg for forgiveness but it cannot ask you to stay.
"I have learned I'm not good at listening to whispers, you have to come at me with the power of a storm."
"Don't get too close, she'll destroy you much like a hurricane."
Not all beauty is destructive but the storm in me will make it so.
The kind of love that makes you glad to stare at the ceiling when it's 3am.
"It hurts because you love, and that takes more courage than you know."
"Maybe eventually you learn to breathe, even though your heart beats in someone else's chest."
"Beauty is terrifying, it haunts us, and once we find it, we never want to let it go."
"I once went to France for a weekend. I stayed for two months. I kissed boys AND girls, &amp; sold handmade bracelets on the beach."
"Hold my hand this windy night, listen as it howls, promises of nothing."
Maybe the sound of a creaking door is all the secrets leaving the room.
She only kisses boys who taste like the end of the world.
"You're all the secrets I didn't realize I was keeping, and all the days I spent hiding from myself."
"I love you more than life, and maybe that's why I'm still breathing."
Finally closed my eyes after the forest rocked me to sleep.
"To be tangled in everything, from your chaos, to your sheets."
He was raised listening to the faint heartbeat of temporary hands.
"I always knew it was you, because even when we crumbled, I could never wipe the dust from my palm."
The burden of memories the night often brings.
"I am in love with a boy who writes songs with his heartbeat, and sings them to me with his hands."
"Some nights those words were bridges, others they were the fire that burned them."
"I am obsessed with the strength of your hands, and how gently they are able to hold me."
"All those times that we were whispers, when we wanted, to be screams."
The girl who kissed the clouds and the boy who felt her love when it rained.
A boy with eyes like a crime scene and the girl who could not turn away.
"I will always take the long road with you, so this journey of ours does not end."
You need to stop causing natural catastrophes with your smile.
"I will love you when your hands are earthquakes. I will love you, when they are silent drops of rain."
Psychopaths write poetry too.
"A girl, who knew a boy lifetimes ago but only heard his voice, in this one."
Clocks do not hold us but we are imprisoned by their hands.
You forgot to mention you're an avalanche.
"A girl who built an impenetrable wall, and the love of a boy who wasn't afraid to climb."
She fell in love with his trembling hands and the words they wrote to make her stay.
"Every night, I'll hang the moon outside my window, so it's never dark when you find your way home."
You are the words I tried to say when my mouth was full of silence.
"Memories you set fire to, that simply refuse to burn."
I will set fire to the ocean that keeps me from you.
Too many people are storms.
"You are the lost path, I found myself on."
He is the gentle quiet of midnight &amp; the unrelenting chaos of a hurricane touching the ground.
It's such a long way down and I have never been so willing to fall.
"""Everyday we were apart, I died a little. I told you I had let it go but I lied for the both of us."" ‚ô° JST"
"I'll be your shelter, even when you are the storm."
You are the window I open when it's hard to breathe.
She is the storm inside his lungs every time it hurts to breathe.
Show me your absoluteness and I'll never speak of ghosts again.
He keeps writing words of love upon her fragile pages. Sometimes she lowers her walls enough to flirt with the ink before it dries.
Sometimes you will be the rain and fall with me.
I want to explore your body like a tourist in a long forgotten land.
I can no longer speak of love without whispering your name.
"I prefer life, when everything is in flames."
Always in the same place I keep running from.
"And she fought for him, because no one ever had."
"The night is a patient listener, and does not judge the mistakes I've made."
I have nothing to give you but hollow ribs and a paper heart that so easily burns.
"The fragile earthquake on my skin, every time you place your hand in mine."
An eviction notice for the voices in your head.
"Home rests, in the space between your fingers as you slowly turn the pages of our story without end."
Lost in you and lost for words to tell you just how much.
"Because you cannot hold an angry ocean, nor can you contain its waves."
"The curiosity we hold for others, is often a reflection of ourselves."
Betty Who - Right Here - Official
A boy who didn't give up and a girl who learned to love again.
"She is rain falling into your ribcage, absorb her &amp; your heart may start to beat again."
I have seen the storms in your eyes and I only wish to become tangled in the madness of your wind.
We are so often in flames.
The way winter always finds you and every storm carries your name.
Sometimes you find a home in someone else's skin.
"""I have an ocean in my chest. It's not calm and I like it."" Words said to me today.   To you: I have felt its chaos and wish to drown."
"Exposing myself unarmed, to a boy who always carries a gun."
Fear and doubt. The fires that burn within us.
I was in flames once and all you did was fuel the fire.
Daughter - Winter:
When silence only carries more noise.
You are dying flowers inside the hollow ground and I would pull down the sun to warm you.
"You fight the wars raging in your head, while everything around you sits and gathers dust."
"You, are just another stranger with a lit match and a box filled with keepsake ashes."
"As you sleep, I dip my fingers in your dreams. I taste love, sensitivity &amp; the light inside your soul."
Beautiful Jacob. Lucky is the girl who inspired that tweet my friend. :-) xx @_Reflection5
Please keep your flames away from my forest before you burn the entire thing down.
Your sea water eyes and the way they drown my lungs.
"Some people only hold hands with the night, others spend an eternity there."
"I wish I were brave enough to stand in the light, hold your hand and teach you how to stay."
Today would be better if I didn't have to breathe.
"Your hands destroyed the castle walls we built, and some things are better left in pieces."
"You only search for solace in me, as a way to avoid yourself."
"Somedays you are an empty room, others you are a castle lit by chandeliers."
You give ink such a beautiful voice. I‚Äôd like to curl around your vocal chords and feel the hum of inspiration.
When you grow up you'll realize nothing is perfect.
She was always too willing to put her hands inside the fire.
"Ghosts, who never change their method of haunting."
The fragile earthquake in your chest as I wrap around your lungs and rest in your exhale.
The idea of love and how it never leaves you alone.
The way we held hands in the darkness and always took the long road home.
There is a ticking clock inside your chest reminding you of every wasted moment and the love you threw away.
Slit your throat with a straight edge and release all the words you're afraid to say.
Let's fill our lungs with smoke from the countless bridges we have burned.
"You are like a journey without a map, and I a fearless traveller."
"I don't want to write anymore, I want to live. I want dirt under my fingernails and yellow wildflowers threaded through my hair."
Don't leave your conscience at the door just because you're hidden behind a screen.
I'd set the entire village on fire for you.
*waves* Do I know you? ;-) @_Reflection5
You love in too many languages and I am not fluent in any one.
"A soul so dark, it's visible to the naked eye."
A mythological forest where we hide from our self loathing.
The way time keeps moving forward but somehow you never do.
Winter sits inside your chest and how I long to be the sun that warms you.
The way your hands are only good at holding phantom things.
How easily you catch fire.
Building a bridge from your melancholic bones.
He was her favorite shade of blue. Like a deep dark silence in the shadow of a sleeping sea.
Youth - Daughter
The only ghost in my forest and yet you do not linger.
Sometimes we walk paths to avoid others and end up losing ourselves.
The doors you shouldn't have opened.
"Time laughs in the distance, as I cling to the belief memories of you will fade."
"Sometimes I just need to feel your arms, silently telling me, these storms that plague us will pass."
Boys with eyes like oceans and girls who wish to drown.
You taught me how to be an empty house &amp; now your ghost roams these lonely halls.
Even the sea was sad when you left.
He is the villain in every story and you are the girl who loves them all.
The fragile earthquake in your chest as I curl around your lungs and rest in your exhale.
"Humanity pains me. The world is full of dishonest people who dig through the dirt of others, as a way to justify their own dirty hands."
I only love trees because they know how to stay.
Paint me a fire and watch me burn.
I want...
My mind is a haunted palace and every ghost wears your face.
"I can't fix the empty spaces in your chest but I will build cities inside of you, plant gardens and grow a sun to light your way."
"I tried to fit the ocean in my pocket today but like you, it was too fluid to hold."
"Pain comes and goes like the swell of ocean waves. I will be the that safe shore, for your breaking heart to rest upon."
My pockets are full of things that don‚Äôt exist.
The moon lies and so do you.
Locked rooms and fragile secrets.
"The floor rots beneath your feet, storms tear down crumbling walls and this, is all you ever knew of home."
Please do not enter my forest unless you intend on becoming a tree.
The kind of boy who steals your breath without ever saying your name.
Thunder that sounds like gunshots and how the night reminds me of you.
A love that does not care for time or the sound of ticking clocks.
"With every page we added to this story, we erased part of ourselves."
"You want him to feel like your childhood home but his chest is a door that won't open, and his heart hasn't learned to love back."
Maybe there's something beautiful after the fog clears. Wait with me.
"The truth, a kiss and nothing more from you than that."
You don't have walls. You let anyone in.
You are a brief moment of clarity that flickers amongst the madness.
How death would not separate us but this tragic existence does.
And sometimes the words wait for you.
"Sadness lived in his eyes, like the cracked window of a house that had long been abandoned."
"He carved her name in a tree, kissed her with the force of the wind, consumed her fragile body, till they lay at one with the forest floor."
Swedish House Mafia - Don't You Worry Child ft. John Martin
"Tortured by demons and ghosts, grown by your own hands."
"We have both loved too many burning houses with crumbling stairs &amp; locked rooms, and still, we can never resist the fire."
I want to fill my pockets with mountain ranges and oceans.
Humans will gather to stare at destruction but ignore a beautiful sunset.
"When you left, somewhere inside me it started to rain. Maybe one day I will realize, you are not the sun that warms me."
Obsessed with the forest floor.
"Pushing myself too hard again, and trying not to touch the edges."
Your spinal cord as a noose.
The forest is too quiet without you.
Your skin as book covers
A boy like an abandoned house and you've searched every room to find him.
"Take people as they are or not at all. If you're creating a perfect image of someone, don't be upset when they can't confirm to it."
How the clouds memorized the sound of your voice and now the sky keeps calling your name.
The kind of boy who turns a sigh into a burst of solar wind.
Writing poems on the petals of cemetery flowers and reading them to ghosts who aren't ready for goodbye.
"How your fingers tremble like earthquakes, turning everything you touch into dust."
"Loneliness always outstays its welcome, yet I cannot bid it farewell."
The taste of chaos and dead languages on your lips because we never liked anything normal anyway.
"Every night I dream you here &amp; every day, wake to the madness of alone."
"We let our demons play with matches, forgetting we both have paper hearts."
I would steal the forest for you.
A boy like an abandoned house with crumbling walls and no forwarding address.
Writing you an ocean so you remember what it's like to feel small.
You're not really a writer unless you're also mad to the core.
There are no new worlds so write your own and escape the madness.
I've never fallen out of love with a forest.
The kind of girl who turns your spine into piano keys.
The kind of girl who turns your breath into the wind.
"Your heart is barely beating, like the hands of an antique clock, someone forgot to wind."
"Some souls are consumed with what grows in the garden of others and then wonder, why their own does not flourish."
Words like broken glass and you wonder why you always feel shattered.
"You, he said, must let go of the idea that happiness is only an illusion.   I will, she said, but just not today."
"The path she walked to create distance from others, only to become a stranger to herself."
I still dream of a forest where you are the trees and I am the earth that roots you.
How you are both constantly closing doors and longing for me to walk through them.
She was either living on the razor's edge or cutting herself with it.
Sometimes the world breaks me &amp; all I can do is write myself whole.
I no longer concern myself with the way other people behave. It's a battle I'll never win.
"You, he said..."
The sky is a beautiful shade of hospital white this morning.
One day I will overthink myself into an early grave.
How nothing holds my attention but I long to be that which attracts yours.
I am constantly attracted to those who are like me. Afraid to love and running from their absurd reality.
I wear chaos like a second skin.
"She is fresh rain, falling into your ribcage &amp; maybe if you absorb her, your heart will start to beat again."
"It's not hard to translate your silence, it tastes exactly like mine."
The way you imagine alternate worlds but refuse to let yourself live them.
Love suffocates me as does the constant longing for it.
"A boy like the ocean, too fluid to hold &amp; constantly pulling you under with the shifting of the tides."
The day I saw beneath your mask and other horror stories.
"A tree is an endless poem and the flirting wind wraps her arms around its branches, to absorb every word."
Bones held together by threads of hope and candle wax.
"The battle is constant. I cannot stay, nor can I cope with goodbye."
Some souls are born without a home and that is just the way of things.
Don't blame the world for breaking your heart when you fall in love with shadows.
Sometimes all I need is the wind.
You cannot decipher your heartbeat from the sound of ticking clocks but both continually haunt you &amp; remind you it's too late.
Phantom paths that take you further into nowhere.
We stand at a burning bridge and our fears are the match we used to light it.
The constant and crippling fascination with the unknown.
I have walked many miles towards you but yet you're still so far away.
Fingers red to the knuckle from holding onto hope and finding nothing but jagged edges.
"I dreamt you came for me, we closed our eyes, became the wind &amp; fell together like leaves to the forest floor."
How you try so hard to be the wind but really you're a hurricane destroying her own fragile walls.
"I miss you. I am a sky without stars, cracked earth without rain &amp; I am lungs without the air I need to breathe."
It's sad we live in a world where you can't pay a sincere compliment without the person thinking you're either a psycho or in love with them
"Your cigarette burns in the dead of night as you sit with your lonely pen, trying to find the words, that you hope will make her stay."
Depression is a graveyard and we are all being buried alive.
I'm frequently attracted to danger but I cover my eyes from yours.
And sometimes I wish the words would just stop.
I need to stop chasing shadows who have no desire to be found.
"I'll write of your beauty, fold the poems into squares &amp; throw them with hope, over the indestructible walls you've built."
"I am dust settled in an empty room and maybe one day, your fingertips will move me."
You are the broken hinges on every door I've tried to open.
The things we won't admit and choose to write as subtle poems.
"In dreams, we sit under that ancient tree, warm our bones by a fire and tell stories that don't care about time."
Sometimes people see beyond the words and put the tiny pieces together. Those people are beautiful.
"Poetry and cigarettes between his fingers, the taste of devastation on his lips &amp; all the fire of the sun burning in his eyes."
How you tell everyone you're broken but refuse to accept anything whole.
Romantic drives through the forest and the night you wrapped your car around a tree.
You only know what people show you and most of that's a lie.
"A loneliness that exists so deep within yourself, entire cities could live inside you and still not take the void away."
Your hands are a broken vase and she the delicate flower they're no longer able to hold.
Perceptive eyes that long for ignorance.
I have always lived like this. Torn between staying lost &amp; wanting to be found. It's just the way of things.
"How everything about you felt like home, but to you I was a foreign language."
I imagine even your demons are scared of you.
Dark rivers replaced your pupils &amp; now you see the world through the eyes of a watery grave.
Pain like a ticking clock that stops only for you.
"Standing at the edge of the sea and my only wish, is to be the heartbeat of its waves."
I promise I won't hurt you. I only carry matches to set fire to myself.
You are a wound that never heals because you exist only in the breath of long forgotten dreams.
Boys who build impenetrable walls and girls who aren't afraid to climb.
I'm an introvert. Please don't expect much from me. I can barely keep up with all the voices in my head.
"A boy, in the dark of his room, burning through cigarettes and words."
"The only home I've known are these walls I've built. Inside, there's a little girl with a torn dress, still looking for her father's love."
"A dark night, the glowing embers from your cigarette &amp; how dying ashes crumble between your fingers, like all the words you never said."
"I am a loner, who has not learned how to hold the hand of fragile things, and when I do, everything inside me is screaming to let go."
"How strange the language between us, so familiar, but without saying a word."
"Most of these words are from inside the head, of a little girl who saw too much."
The way you suffer alone and hide in your own head because there's nowhere else to go.
He had shooting stars for eyes &amp; undiscovered galaxies in the space behind his ribs.
"He was made entirely of sadness, cold December nights and the faded dreams of a waking dawn."
Your presence is like the ocean and I have never felt so small.
"Your delicate shoreline of hope, littered with shipwrecked hearts."
Something about loving too many strangers but how my heart beats only for you.
Boys with eyes like wishes &amp; girls who still believe in stars.
"I can't fix the empty spaces in your chest but I will build cities inside of you, plant gardens and grow a sun to light your way."
I have walked the tunnels of my mind too much and now there's nowhere left to go.
"I used to write for you, now I write to rid myself of your ghosts."
"She was the flower he forgot to water and left, in a room without a view."
A girl like a broken street lamp and it's so hard to keep your eyes on the road.
My heart is a ship lost on the fragile seas &amp; I am certain you're a hurricane.
I keep peeling off your masks but fear I'll never find your face.
"She sent love letters to her own heart. Thanking it, for surviving the burden of sadness &amp; not crushing her limbs to dust."
I text using a ouija board.
I loved you until my bones collapsed and now your regretful hands look for solace amongst the dust.
"Somedays you are my favorite book and I wander through your pages, others, I put you on a dusty shelf &amp; can't bear to read word."
"Love, is the best horror story ever written."
"A boy like a tornado, destroying  everything in its wake and I only wish to be tangled, in the madness of your wind."
"It was in the pale skin &amp; fragile bones of her arms that he forgot the world &amp; how the face of every clock, reminds him it's too late."
"We have both loved too many burning houses with crumbling stairs &amp; locked rooms, and still, we can never resist the fire."
We are all clouds who drift through the same delusional sky.
A mythological forest where we hide from our self loathing.
"You are a burning house lit by your own match, and all I can do is listen, to the screaming of your flames."
How beautiful you are with those downcast eyes and skin that smells like rain.
"How you search for love in the space between my fingers, forgetting that these hands have never learned to hold."
I have nothing to give you but hollow ribs and a paper heart that so easily burns.
And a beautiful voice it is gorgeous x @alias_c
Beautiful x @Graphitepersona
Life is a low budget horror movie and I've lost cost count of who's playing the villain.
Your mind is an asylum and those words are the escaped lunatics.
The beautiful agony of your dangerous eyes and smooth Shakespearean tongue.
She dreams of a forest untouched by winter and a wind that doesn't fear its own voice.
How death would not separate us but this tragic existence does.
Something about how your hands are like earthquakes &amp; everything you touch turns to dust.
I held you as the night holds the moon. The sunrise stole our dreams and I was left chasing your shadow.
How those demons set fire to all your dreams but it is you who hands them the match.
"I dissected your pain and fed it to the wolves &amp; all you could do was watch, as they licked the blood from my trembling hands."
"As we froze in the depths of that bleak December night, all I could think of, was how your kisses taste like June."
Even the forest feels lonely today &amp; none of the trees remember my name.
The way clocks keep moving forward but somehow you never do.
"You stole the wonder from my innocent eyes, now I search for it in meadows and other impossible things."
You are a quaint little cottage by the sea with latticed windows and daisies growing on your lawn.
A connection I don't understand. Something ancient. And I know if I cut open your insides I would recognize everything I see.
"Mornings are the worst, where you awake with some sort of delusion that today will be better than the last."
"I dreamt you came for me. We escaped to the forest, warmed our bones by a fire and told stories to the infinite night."
We are but two strangers who share the same ghosts.
"I'd like to touch the space between your thumb and forefinger, so I know how it feels to be your pen."
I treasure the brief moments of clarity that flicker amongst the madness.
"It's not poetry, it's madness."
Replace my spine with piano keys and play me like your favorite song.
I often imagine that your mind wanders through the same forest as mine.
How your bones are made of winter and I'm so tired of being the fire that tries to keep them warm.
I imagine you as a tree in my forest. We sit in shadowed moonlight telling stories that don't care about time.
"Something about all the hours we stole, now the clocks have stopped and time wants them back."
Boys with eyes like oceans and girls who wish to drown.
A girl who is only accustomed to darkness &amp; your eyes are too much like the sun.
The type of girl who holds the sun but it is your fingers that burn.
"I hear the demons laughing in the distance. Today, I don't have the strength to listen."
Boys with vacant rooms for eyes and poetry in their veins.
I need to learn an in between. I'm either living on the edge of everything or nothing.
How the small of your back is a lost city that's just aching to be found.
"How you live a monochrome existence, and push people away when they start to see color."
"I miss the curve of your smile, the line of your collarbone and how your eyes turn to glass every time they cry."
One day I will meet you in that magical place where the leaves fall and the wind speaks and hold your hand forever.
Lonely girls and boys with hands like love letters.
"I am merely shadows, dust and vacant rooms, all moulded into the shape of a sad human girl."
How you're made entirely of winter and yet I cannot escape you even when the seasons change.
Something about loving too many strangers but how my heart beats only for you.
Sadness is like missing the beauty of a sunset because you always have the blinds closed.
My spirit was broken as a child by someone who should have protected it. I'm beginning to realize I will never recover those pieces of me.
How your bones are made of ice and every day feels like winter.
Endless sighs from the lonely spaces between my lungs.
Today I feel so detached. Like I have stepped outside of a mind I already struggle to know.
"Nights you sit with your lonely pen, trying to find the words that will make people stay."
His soul was made up of oceans and the discarded pieces of cracked shells.
"Most times, what you think you know is very rarely the truth."
Your words make a mess of my right side brain.
How your ribs are hollow and all I can hear are echoes of things that never were.
How easily we set fire to things when they no longer hold our attention.
"If we kissed in the forest, I'm almost certain we'd burn it down."
How daydreaming becomes a way of life and nothing is ever completely real.
"This bookshelf holds the dust of our memories, and all the pages we couldn't bring ourselves to write."
Something about how that beautiful sunset was just the death of another day.
"You move me, so delicately. Like wind on a lonely tree branch."
"How ticking clocks haunt me and remind me, it's too late."
The kind of boy who climbs a fence just to bring you stolen flowers.
"You, are the gentle sea, and I am the shore, you repeatedly abandon."
I am tired of your shadow. I no longer reach for your phantom hands that do not know how to stay.
"I am tired of listening to your broken pieces trying to convince me, they are whole."
Love me like an antique room and brush the cobwebs from my hair.
How many times have you sat with that tree and let your tears water its roots...
I have picked the flesh from your stories like the hungry wolves who chase you. Now the meaning is lost &amp; all that remains are jagged bones.
The sun is shining but my sky is dark and something about these tears remembering the sound of your name.
I loved you right through to your hollow bones and sad sapphire eyes.
I need to stop trying to make a home in people who are temporary.
Break me until I'm mosaic. Frame my shattered pieces and hang me as if I were art.
A boy like a condemned house with crumbling walls and no forwarding address.
How you're every road to ruin and I have no more strength to walk you.
That bleak December night when your dead pupils met mine.
Tell me about your crystal clear conscience and how your hands are stained with my blood.
Something about writing words in the clouds so you can feel my love when it rains.
"Some days you are an empty room, others you are a castle lit by chandeliers."
I've pushed myself to the edge again. I don't like it here &amp; every time it's that much harder to crawl back.
"Some days I ache for silence, others, silence makes me ache."
Sometimes I feel like a cloud. Aimlessly drifting on a journey that has no beginning or end.
I dream of a place far from these vacant rooms. A beautiful forest where the trees smile and the birds sing.
I don't know what I need. I just know it's more than this.
Fragile was his heart but his hands broke everything they touched that was beautiful.
Time laughs in the distance as I cling to the belief memories of you will fade.
"I am tired of holding phantom hands and moving amongst shadows, who have not learned how to stay."
"I am an empty room that gathers dust, a shadow, with nowhere else to go."
I need to stop falling in love with strangers.
"A boy, like an earthquake. A complex mass of contradiction, self destruction and a continual state of dormant rage."
I have nothing to give you but hollow ribs and a paper heart that so easily burns.
"And how I long to tell you I love you, without saying a single word."
"I'll build you a bridge made of words, so you may reach your forgotten dreams."
Most of you know I do not enjoy negativity but please help me block &amp; report @cybrwurm who has been harassing &amp; stalking &amp; me for months.
I am a burden to myself.
"Existence is a warrior, and I am its battlefield."
"She dreams of summer &amp; yellow fields but it does not thaw the winter, that lives inside her soul."
"Humans, how tragically destructive we are."
"Love does not hurt, it begins as a fragile ocean and the burden of expectation makes it drown in its own waves."
"When you left, somewhere inside me it started to rain. Maybe one day I will realize, you are not the sun that warms me."
I bleed words for you in the stillness of night &amp; my only audience is a sky full of dying stars.
"Yes, I do wish to be left alone. @cybrwurm"
Psychotic is the new black.
A hollow universe has replaced your lungs and now you exhale dying stars.
"I do not fear broken people. Except the high functioning intellectual, who will make you believe he is whole."
I have replaced my heartbeat with the sound of ticking clocks.
Your eyes are like a theatre of little deaths and yet I cannot turn away.
I should have covered my eyes more as a child.
How you always taste like winter even on the days your fragile hands have held the sun.
Sometimes I pretend I imagined you. It aches less.
"Burning bridges, building walls &amp; other self destructive talents."
I can't let anyone in. I've had too many muddy footprints trample across my soul.
"The horror humans create, when crushed by the weight of their own sadness."
"You are a ship lost in an ocean, that does not know how to love you."
"A girl with a heart that is always broken, but still believes in impossible things."
"Some days you are an ocean, others, the gentle rain."
Something about how your trembling hands warmed my bones on those soft winter nights.
"To escape this madness and be free like the wind but where do you go, when you're running from yourself?"
"Every night, I write you into dreams and wake up, with the madness of alone."
"There is no subtle goodbye, only the enduring agony, of the sea, repeatedly leaving the shore."
Something about your quiet rage and how you burn bridges with impulsivity.
When you leave me in ruins I wish to be a haunted cathedral with blue stained glass for eyes.
"Some days words are a bridge, others, they are the fire that burns it."
"Maybe today, the wind through the trees will stop time and for the briefest of moments, you will be by my side."
I'm so sorry to hear that ~ be well xx @McMagick
"Sometimes people burn bridges and then wonder, why they're alone."
A fragile existence that shifts like the ocean floor.
A monochromatic existence.
Silence is not without noise.
"By all means, take your time in deciding which natural disaster you'd like to be."
Humans... I'd rather have a conversation with the moon.
"Maybe one day we will love in a language that we both, understand."
"I love you, because like me, you long for rain &amp; a wounded grey sky."
"Today, just disappear with me."
"I am tangled in the notion of you &amp; tonight, nothing else exists except the footsteps of your ghosts."
"Sometimes my forest burns to the ground, but it is me who lights the match."
"As wounded as you are, I hold tight to your belief in me."
We often say goodbye without knowing how to leave.
You are a dream that breathes &amp; all I can do is write words to make you real.
"My mind is an impenetrable dark forest, full of demons &amp; raging storms &amp; still, you find me beautiful."
"Words are like exploding stars and the night sky, an endless page."
I find beauty in broken things.
"And all you can do is move through the crowds, pretending you are one of them."
Let's fill our lungs with smoke from the countless bridges we have burned.
"What I really need is someone's eyes to dance with mine, and tell me I'm not alone."
You are mysterious like the sea &amp; I am drowning in the depths of you.
Everything attracts my attention but I still haven't learned how to stay.
Please keep your delusions to yourself.
"Somedays I wish I had no taste for words, they often destroy everything I want to say."
"We let our demons play with matches, forgetting we both have paper hearts."
Loving you is like holding the sun &amp; hoping I don't get burned.
"Loneliness always outstays its welcome, yet I cannot bid it farewell."
Our love did not care for time or the sound of ticking clocks.
Your darkness sits far below the ocean floor and I have just begun to drown.
His soul was a blank page that neither words nor silence could fill.
"With every page we added to this story, we erased part of ourselves."
"Sadness lived in his eyes, like the cracked window of a house that had long been abandoned."
I am exhausted by your presence but have yet to learn a way to live without it.
You are a memory of silence when all I can hear is noise.
"Winter sits behind your ribcage, and I wonder how your arms can hold such warmth."
Haunted by invisible ghosts and long departed memories.
You are a tragic sonnet and how these longing eyes burn through every word.
I am the words of a forgotten poem trying to find her way home.
To go back in time and murder my past.
I need to stop playing with ghosts.
Sitting with the wind contemplating loneliness. I want to leave. But I don't.
I wish I were a tree so I could spend my days dancing with the wind.
"He was made entirely of sadness, cold December nights and the faded dreams of a waking dawn."
Read me a poem with nothing but fingertips &amp; naked skin.
Her soul was like a vacant room filled with shadows &amp; invisible ghosts.
"Maybe one day you will realize your worst enemy, lives beneath your skin."
Sometimes I still believe in dandelion wishes &amp; fairy dust.
She cut open his chest &amp; crawled inside it just to understand the depths of his pain.
She stared at the pile of unopened letters. Apologies from his heart that came a lifetime too late.
Please be gentle as you destroy me.
I find a strange comfort in death &amp; abandoned things.
"No matter how much I try to hide from the world, it refuses to hide from me."
He was her favorite shade of blue. Like a deep dark silence in the shadow of a sleeping sea.
Your eyes are as mad as the sea.
When I grow up I want to be a forest.
Those demons set our village on fire &amp; still we danced in the chaos of burning streets.
I miss the dream where we sat in a meadow &amp; kissed these words down each other's spine.
And I am full of incomplete &amp; broken things.
You are the words in my unfinished poems.
His soul was made up of oceans &amp; the discarded pieces of cracked shells.
Some nights I lay alone on the sand &amp; try to calculate the heartbeat of the sea.
Found my way to being lost again.
He smelled of classic books &amp; sadness yet the blue of his eyes was like the sky on a cloudless day.
There is a ticking clock inside your chest reminding you of all the wasted moments &amp; the love you threw away.
Love that built castles from nothing but ruins &amp; dust.
He had solar flares for eyes &amp; undiscovered galaxies lived in the space behind his ribs.
Wildfires burn within your eyes &amp; raging oceans rise inside the hollow spaces in your chest.
It is not you I love. It is the dead poets that live inside your soul.
You don't know me. You only know these words.
Your voice is beautiful like the wind. One day I will wake to it and your warm breath against my skin.
Your lips taste like winter &amp; how I long to be the kiss that warms them.
"Sometimes I wish I didn't have to breathe, didn't have to love you but both have become vital to my existence."
"I wonder, if you want to hear the things I long to say."
"A soul, like an abandoned church because nobody believes &amp; there is nothing left to worship."
You are a walking tragedy. Full of eccentric beauty &amp; the words of dead poets.
And some days it felt like all the sadness in the world had come to sit by his side.
"She is a wildflower blossoming deep within the forest. Beautiful, alone &amp; seen only by the wind."
You are the cold wind that reminds me I am alive.
I am on fire with dreams my reality burns to the ground &amp; still I search for hope amongst the ashes.
Where do you hide the thoughts you're too afraid to say out loud?
"And when I hit the floor, will you lay there with me and remind me how to breathe?"
And she built him a bridge made of words so he could reach his forgotten dreams.
I often imagine that your mind wanders through the same forest as mine.
She used words to say nothing at all &amp; silence to explain everything.
"I have put many miles between who I am &amp; where I came from but no matter how fast I run, the demons are never far behind."
The ghost of the child I never was has finally caught up with me.
Every day I fight these demons. My sword is your belief in me.
When your mind is a prison.
"Inside the silence, she heard his soul screaming."
"Sometimes I just need to feel your arms. Silently telling me, these storms that plague us will pass."
"A tree is an endless poem &amp; the flirting wind wraps her arms around its branches, to absorb every word."
Fingers raw from holding onto hope &amp; finding nothing but jagged edges.
These demons keep setting fire to my dreams but it is me who hands them the match.
Canada x @DanaTanne
You too ~ always nice to see a fellow Yeg-er x @C_Leatherland
"Today, just fall with me, like leaves to the forest floor."
You are like a star that fell into the ocean &amp; all I can do is watch you drown.
"I reside inside a fairy tale because there, everything lasts forever."
Chasing echoes of things that once were.
When you know it will destroy you but do it anyway.
"And today in my search for silence, I can only hear more noise."
Winter sits inside your chest &amp; how I long to be the sun that warms you.
I am the clouds. You are the rain. Fall with me.
"You are a dreamer like me. Every night, it is where I find you."
Her fingers bled on the jagged edges of his shattered heart but still she held it anyway.
"Two lonely stars at opposite ends of the sky but yet here you are, in every thought I have &amp; every breath I take."
I am tired of this skin that encases these melancholic bones. How I ache to shed it along with all the burdens of the past.
And I wait for you in this forest where the leaves dance &amp; the wind speaks.   ...I wait ~ for you.
"And I will write my way out of this madness, as I have done so many times before."
My head is a noisy place today.
"Whatever you allow, will continue."
"Our souls are like deep dark oceans &amp; we are drowning, in each other's waves."
And maybe they were like the sun &amp; the moon ~ never to share the same sky.
I'd rather not feel lost today but the feeling has found me anyway.
I bleed words for you in the stillness of night &amp; my only audience is a sky full of burned out stars.
Fear. You either face it or let it steal your happiness.
Your eyes hold the hope of a child while your heart holds the strength of a man.
I will love you when you're a clear blue sky &amp; I will love you ~ when you are your own violent storm.
I read you ~ like the pages of a book ~ I never want to end.
No matter how loud the noise gets ~ close your eyes &amp; you will always hear my voice.
She was a poem he wrote without words.
A beautiful mess we are ~ together ~ we will heal ~ each other's broken pieces.
You are the only one I want to dance with &amp; the only poem I'll ever want to read.
I stood at a burning bridge today. It was your words that set it on fire..
"Perspective has shaped my big heart a little smaller. Only those who truly deserve to feel its warmth, will."
Sometimes hope flirts back &amp; gives you wings that can fly again.
I enjoy being a ship lost at sea ~ I've never wanted a safe harbour ~ until I sailed into yours.
And some days she wrapped herself in silence for it was all she had to wear.
And all I can do is wait for you.
The world I seek does not exist. In words I create my own &amp; sometimes it quiets the chaos.
A boy whose soul is like a puzzle &amp; she a curious child with a box of missing pieces.
"""You really are like the moon - everything gravitates towards you. Just look around."" The words of a dear friend ~ you are beautiful TY x"
And some days come dressed in silence when all you can long for is words.
Thank you ~ truly x @amzofthesea
I set fire to a dream today &amp; my fears are the match I used to light it.
The rain falls silently as I do.
"I am me &amp; for the first time in a long time, I have no desire to change her."
I keep writing words of love upon his fragile pages. Sometimes he lowers his walls enough to flirt with the ink before it dries.
I am in love with a kiss my lips have yet to feel...
Her fingers bled on the jagged edges of his shattered heart but still she held it anyway.
He is the wildflower that makes her broken fence look beautiful.
one day  i will meet you in that magical place  where the leaves fall  &amp; the wind speaks  &amp; hold your hand  forever  ~
You're so kind ~ thank you lovely! x @Dv0175
I don't know where I'm going but I want you to come with me.
"If I could give you anything, it would be the gift of self belief ‚ô°"
I dreamt you came for me ~ we turned our backs on this madness ~ got lost in the forest &amp; fell together like autumn leaves.
You're like a flower that grew from the concrete &amp; how I long to be the rain that feeds you.
Thank you Scott ~ you are amazing! üíï@Scdavis24
To undress so much more than your mind...
Some people are like violent storms. They leave a trail of destruction in their wake &amp; disappear as quickly as they came.
"Today, I will write these words on a cloud so you can feel my love when it rains."
Thank you ~ truly x @Goongela @thinkingnot @ShePlaysLoud
His love made flowers grow ~ on what used to be ~ the baron landscape of her soul.
And how my heart aches for the pain others have caused in yours.
A boy who lost so much in the fire still searches for hope in the ashes.
Very nice x @fishingacheron
I would crawl across time to reach your distant sky.
You are the clouds. I am the rain. Fall with me.
Thank you for the cup @SoFuckingMature I appreciate it! #FF
You are like a journey without a map &amp; I a fearless traveler.
"Today, just be the rain &amp; fall with me."
If the dark takes you again. This time I'm coming with you.
And she loved him so much more on the days he couldn't love himself.

Beautiful ~ thank you x @ShivaBanta
Sometimes I flirt with hope &amp; believe these wings could fly again.
A soul like an abandoned house &amp; I've searched every room to find you.
Constantly lost in nostalgia for something that never was.
You are like a star that fell into the ocean &amp; all I can do is watch you drown.
"And how I long to tell you I love you, without saying a single word."
Thank you ~ truly x @JacquesDeBoys
The constant battle between staying lost &amp; wanting to be found.
The constant battle between simultaneously craving loneliness &amp; the warmth of a meaningful connection.
"Thank you, truly @DakotaRework that means so much x"
"Today, just chase the light with me, even though we know it won't last. Nothing ever does."
Standing upon a staircase of crumbling memories. Wishing I had a different view.
"Today, just disappear with me."
I'll write us a story. We'll get lost in the words &amp; leave the uncertainties of life behind.
I am a tree. He is the wind that disturbs my leaves.
I am the music you are the words. Dance with me.
Beautiful x @thismomentonly
"Today, just fall with me like leaves to the forest floor."

Sometimes you let people in knowing it will destroy you.
"I can't open the door to you, not to anyone. I've had too many muddy footprints trample across my soul."
You are a deep dark ocean &amp; I am still  drowning in your waves.
I want to believe your fairytale but the reality I find myself in keeps stealing it away.
Some masks are so beautiful you'd sell your soul to make them real.
And I was blinded with such beautiful fairytales for a moment I thought it was real.
You're welcome ~ I'm happy you like it xx @gaiarenee

And each escape leaves you more hollow than the last.
How will you hear those footsteps when you've closed the door to every room inside your soul?
No solace in words &amp; so much noise in the silence.
I'd give your demons my soul if it meant they'd release yours.
Tonight I will not look at the stars.  Tonight I will fall in love with the darkness.
Their love was an exceptional kind of chaos.
we played cards with secrets i showed mine  he held his  close  to his chest  ~
It's as real as your soul allows it to be.
"If you love someone, tell them. Tell them with everything in you. And once you've told them, spend the rest of your days showing them..."

She held on to love so tight~She choked out the light it held within~
That bitter sting from when you left~Now I cannot thank you enough~
Stripped bare to a place~Where judgement is unknown~
Turning blank pages~Unable to find the words~
Words flow~Like the tears~That made me write them~
Thanks so much! @Laid_Thomas &lt;3
