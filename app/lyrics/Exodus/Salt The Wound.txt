[Verse 1]
When I take your flesh and lacerate you
Exposing all your hate
There's nothing left but lies to throw away
Eviscerate you, reduce you to your fate
Deleted and erased all your decay

[Chorus]
When I think of all the hell you tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell and leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I do is salt the wound

[Verse 2]
The bane of my existence cancerous
A tumor on my soul
Unnecessary wart upon my skin
Full of pus, you're a Judas and a troll
Lance the boil rooted deep within

[Chorus]
When I think of all the hell you tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell and leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I do is salt the wound
[Solo: Kirk]
[Solo: Gary]

[Verse 3]
Rest assured when I pollute you
Your disease I will correct
My contagion, only now I know the source
I uproot you, lance the boil, disinfect
Pestilence of ruin's run its course

[Chorus]
When I think of all the hell you tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell and leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I do is salt the woundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
