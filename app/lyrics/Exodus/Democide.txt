[Verse 1]
Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds
For the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth
Hell bent on their genocide

[Verse 2]
Complete destruction, blood lust seduction
Drinking warm blood with a smile
Beyond the horror, they're born to suffer
Hundreds of thousands defiled

[Chorus]
Show no mercy
Slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned!
War is Hell!
God be damned!

[Solo - Holt]

[Verse 3]
Dissected while still alive
The violence you live to endure
Cleansing, inherently violent
Purging the world for the pure
[Verse 4]
Triumph of evil, hatred primeval
Unenlightened corrupted souls
Orgy of murder, heartless and vile
Merchants of death in control

[Chorus]
Show no mercy
Slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned!
War is Hell!
God be damned!
War is Hell!
God be damned
War is Hell!

[Solo - Altus]

[Verse 1]
Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds
For the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth
Hell bent on their genocide

[Chorus]
Show no mercy
Slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned!
War is Hell!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
