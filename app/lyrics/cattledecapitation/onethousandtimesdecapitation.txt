Line them all up
The smiling faces and the disheveled
The bleak and the brawn
The weak and the strong
The guillotine sits tall and blind

A head for every sin of man
A head for sympathy and revenge
Thousands times thousands and millions of wrongs
Justly and blindly executed
Persecution. Decapitation.

Curse the heads of men
Curse the heads of men

A thousand times decapitation
Hail the avengement.
