Mankind has become nothing but a worthless, feeble creation. For centuries, I have awaited to begin my ultimate emancipation.
Perfect specimen to infuse itself with the human's weak decrepit life force. Nourished by cretin's blood, now part of mortal genetic code. These foul earthlings shall feel what suffering truly means.
A nefarious machine, not to feel remorse, not to feel fear, not to feel pity.
These entities shall be condemned into the endless cosmic void.
Mankind has become nothing but a worthless, feeble creation. For centuries, I have awaited to begin my ultimate emancipation.
Intestines push forth and fall prey to my offspring. Autolysis has begun to set in 
The skin decomposes while the insides purge out. My army is beginning to take it's final shape
Take it's final shape
