We have arrived to infest and thrive
Upon billions of lives with forks and spoons and knives

Repugnant, yet we'll live on your sustenance
Preserve the living-dispose of the dead and diseased

Mortals wined and dined-led to the firing line
As throats are slit-troughs overflow as they bleed

To return what was
Before Eve and Adam
Babylon and Sodom
The trampling foot of man
Men, women and children shall be strung
Sliced from hands to feet
Innards save for a tasty treat and beaten profusely to tenderize the meat

AAAAAHHHHH! The stench of the populace!
Millions of humans hung upon hooks
Suspended in deep freeze
Subzero, sterile environment keeps meat tender and lean
Choice cuts from the slaughter-
Husband, mother, daughter
Dead families kept together
Their hides made into leather
Surprisingly, multiple uses for something so useless

We come in peace--you go in pieces
AAAAAHHHHHH! The stench of the populace!
Freeze--dried--hogtied--cryogenocide!

Your gluttonous repugnancy--a delightful delicacy
Crepitus and malignancy now part of the recipe
Harshness and voracity
Ingredients of my delivery
To serve the public
The helpless frozen subjects

Dinner is prepared.
To serve man.
