honest words are the deepest kiss
i’ll keep chasing happiness  until Your hand is in mine
the smiles between the silences
You mean every wish to me
You are passion  in every moment
i want to whirl into Your night
think about me deeper  and feel me closer
"so much darkness behind a curtain of heavy whispers, i quivered"
she smiles softer than silk rustles
You are the calm before sunrise  i’m the riot after sunset
let us drift now
crush this ache in my limbs
draw me into Your fire
tie my desires  to Your night
life with You is like love  in a dream
i need You before a good sleep
hearts racing  in the moonlight
mellow and sultry  like a summer evening she settles into darkness
i fear and love Your voice at its deepest
bury my disgrace in Your poetry
soft sobs pelted by a storm of kisses
You feel within reach  this is painful and beautiful
she’s warm as earth
raven intent  beneath a pure sky
let Your fire rest on my night
Your memories sing to me at night
the sound of Your footsteps is a love song
heartbreaking stillness
You’re the relief in my weariness
how perfectly You settle  in my emptiness
“You waste a lot of time going down blind alleys if you have no one to lead you.”
Your lust is an incessant rain  my dignity sinks freely
You love me like i’m invulnerable
shivering without Your arms around me
every sigh  echoes a desire
i can’t wait to share more life with You
the sun floats elegantly behind her brown eyes
Your pleasure  means everything  in You i find my happiness
the darkness sets the night free  painfully slowly
let’s start with love
life feels delicious as i pulse through the spasm
Your thoughts  all around me  like dew
i want the pleasures of sinning together
i feel a tide of urges coming up
the stories we tell the world
Your love is dark and beautiful like moonlit midnight
just waken a shared memory i may feel it
this silence is an undesirable thunder
quieten my cries  forever
pull me into Your dark dress me like tempest
Your touch  is but a dream
You know what i need
it’s not you  i don’t even venerate god  anymore
lost like an unnamed galaxy
i hear music in the shrill of the wind
our dreams are blossoming
how intimately our thoughts dance
my heart raves about the unspoken between us
i envy how darkness is so sure of itself
i revel in Your shadow
i want to go where love takes me i want to stay where love rests
i want to sway in the stillness of our harmony
intimidated  by our madness
without love there would be no pain  or poetry
love makes me love words  words make me love You
the heart is starved  yet it lives
ask Your heart  about my love
kiss eternity upon my lips
my eyes shine because they’re smitten
You’re the hush of my world
every star is rooting for us
to be worthy of Your desires
darkness takes  tenderly
is there an escape out of heaven
honour all my fears
her audacity  is a force
would You keep hold  of my insanity
You give my thoughts  breathing space
i need what You love  i love what You want
depraved minds and opulent pleasures
You give me something that i can hold on to 🎶
dreamed of being scorched  by Your growls
restless for a feeling
the burden of thirst
my soul is warm from the vows we’ve made
wish Your breath would feel my face
my calm is devoted to Your voice
my tears will tell You  how much i’ve missed the pain
midnight whispers  spilled like moonlight
i feel like musing in the rain
a lullaby in the hum of the wind
Your words found my smile
You feel closer at dusk
this pain of separation is precious to me
fill the rest of my years with life changing moments
You’re the patch of sunlight on my soul
i will swallow darkness  and bloom in the deepest shade of night
i feel our love growing
i feel loved
honest words are the deepest kiss
i’ll keep chasing happiness  until Your hand is in mine
the smiles between the silences
You mean every wish to me
You are passion  in every moment
i want to whirl into Your night
think about me deeper  and feel me closer
"so much darkness behind a curtain of heavy whispers, i quivered"
she smiles softer than silk rustles

You’re the patch of sunlight on my soul
i will swallow darkness  and bloom in the deepest shade of night
i feel our love growing
i feel loved
our thoughts chime  there’s music everywhere
You’ve made me a carnal addict
clinging to You  i gleam like the skyline
a soft and deep inhale  in the middle of the night
dusk draws in hunger
i want Your night to myself
some feels are forever
we love differently
in that voice
“Their solitude is a narcotic. She loves to be alone with him. It makes her life seem very manageable suddenly.”
"i’m a curve of clouds against Your blue sky, pining to be broken"
Your love is succour
how sensuously  the night opens
i smell Your skin  i savour life
Your lips rush on my mouth like winged dreams
i feel Your heart beaming on me
give me dark whispers in low light
how perfectly the stars  shape our darkness
my heart beats for the way You say my name
the night took away my calm
i crave Your roughly delicate touches
i miss love
we were in love before it had a name
my every desire  is somewhat rough
so many ways  i want You
i touched an illusion
You make my chaos seem powerless
moans echoing dark skies
midnight blue bruises  like a constellation of moons on my skin
Too high to ever come off of you 🎶
let’s get deeper
a wild embrace is peace
You hold my hand  and i have everything
Your eyes keep me warm
sensations the colour of night
the blooms You admire are a love letter  from my heart
some memories have made home in my blood
my soul burns for Your love
scars that smell of passion
“moon-suffused sky”
staying sober  feeling playful
just when i needed You You found me
i see tulips everywhere
i keep desiring You more
i miss You at sunset  i miss You at moonrise
let’s linger around the night
You turned my imperfections into art
starving but surviving
rough tongue stroking salty satin
smiling a smile Your mouth will want to devour
Your lust triggers me
the extremities of contentment
about You
i am drenched in a lifelong thirst
i will scatter the softest kisses across Your chest
escape inside me
i’m the scent of a summer night tumbling through the air to You
“as quiet as lust”
the sensations have lasted
“an aching tenderness”
the night is idly drinking in the silence
Your words kiss my unspoken thoughts
the scent of defiance  on sultry skin
a sumptuous moon  an irreverent sky  stitched together
like the rain she will always surrender
bruised by the hand that’s written a thousand poems
like the stars these eyes are searching for darkness
she’s lava in a storm
for You i would bloom all night
i am tempted to suffer
play as hard as You like
how our bodies make memories
reminiscing about Your voice
“the glow of passion”
burning to be felt
take me deeper into the unknown
when i read You i feel at home
Your simplicity is so dominant
the discord  between her shyness  and her fantasies
the feel of Your heartbeats against my palm
“the mad flight of moments”
“open irresponsible night”
Your arms keep me safe  from the storm of dark whispers at my neck
hope can defeat anything
Your words stroke me viscerally
Your eyes undress me with abandon
darkness is inherently magical
i tremble with servility  there’s love in my veins
my tears waken Your wild
satisfy my appetite
Your one verse can say everything
i’m the light spilled across the sky  the moon is my reason to exist
kissing every raindrop that carries Your scent
every desire every dream is wild
this madness is my haven  of calm
my devotion is deeper  than You imagine
"also, loving"
freckles that read like a poem
open Your arms unzip Your heart lock me in
my lips miss Your face
i was too shy to say i love You  when You filled my mouth
the lust in Your eyes licking the love in mine
saving my tears  and lust for You
touch until i don’t feel ugly anymore
tender wrists wreathed in palm prints
there’s smell of sex on my fingers
a mere thought of You and i melt
bedeck my hair with flowers and my heart with Your words
love is the way she looks at the sky
love gently with savage jolts
soaked in saltiness
dirty thoughts  scattered like night
my soul is crying  to be touched again
the enigmatic whorls of ecstasy
You’re the quiet warmth while the world burns
i can always dream up Your scent
undress my fears  in the dark
Your whispers make me come alive
eyes like barrels of opium
soft kisses in dark corners
a heart full of poems
hidden beyond my spirit You found my edge
moments melting into memories
Your love always finds more space to fill
You and i like sunshine and earth
Your lust is a roaring lion
her mind is darker than midnight in a church
Your eyes slow me down
a bare heart  laced with sheer joy
warmed to my bones  by Your violence
You’re all over my stillness
You’re the torrent in my ocean
You’re the flux in my soul
a hug is a hideaway
love me  but not just for how i feel
the world looks different when we’re together
musing so hard
my heart is piled high with the poems You’ve written about me
You’re the dawn in my sky
You sensed my ache  You found me bliss
"the way Your fingertips tease, my nipples harden with a vengeance"
say what maybe means
so elegant throughout the tempest
Your presence is fleeting  just like spring
eyes that evoke sparks in my heart
need Your power  in my riotous spaces
even my void is debauched
everywhere around me a quiet hum of Your memories
Your kisses on my bruises  silkier than snowflakes
don’t give up  on me
Your words breathe towards my heart
kiss me under a canopy of dirty whispers
hers is softness like no other
i’m a haze shimmering in Your heat
coddled by cool moonlight
clinging to You like a summer breeze on an island
You’re the perfect kind of filthy
Your eyes put my beauty  on a pedestal
the scent of carnal fatigue
settle in my core
she wears sunsets like a second skin
So much we're dying for 🎵
found my way  when You took my hand
You rewarded my gentle heart with love
kisses that have no beginning or end
can’t hold back my arousal
everlasting sunshine and a dark rose
shall we step forward?
tears in the rain  or is it our bodies mingling in bed?
blue eyes punish so hard
keep Your balance  as i side bend
my lips  warm and glowing  like a candle between Your hands
“the hush of midnight”
Your hand adores  every mistake i make
feel like giving in
You always know where to get
lead me anywhere
the ripples You cause
i covet the sky  when the flowers are sleeping
missing You is like sinking into a hurricane
smoky eyes looking for trouble
a smile that set galaxies on fire
i feel an embracing warmth flowing by
eyes an elusive bouquet of honeyed primroses
a love like a spring fairytale
take me where thousands of stars sparkle
my mind is twisted from hauling carnal aches
what a thing is passion
the stars want to know why we’re worlds apart
the void is a part of life now
a riot of intimacy
tonight the sky is decked with a lustful vibe
You’ve etched lifetimes of love on my soul
convey it with fingers
i slept and i soared  all night long
Your kisses tell such a story
pain is the tears of joy  pleasure is the smile that follows
i say Your name  and a thirst stirs inside me
You pull me in for a fleeting breath and want me to leave sated
my words seek only You
the way You touched my heart it opened like a rose
my days rely on Your smile
i settled for hope
“the provocation of silence”
reaching for the dark finding light
souls linked by words
musing on the meaning of love
acquiescence  and pleasure
that one scent that stills me
Your lips stop at my eyes  Your hands always wander
soft skin stained   with lashings of sunset
You’re everything i’m likely to ever need
i never stopped feeling
Your touch is all about depths
dreamer of a life
You make me forget to breathe
she’s like the moon they all write about her
a constant urge  to drown in the shadow  of the moon
she’s at her finest yet so discreet
"blow out the candle, set Your eyes on the moon"
i love that i am the woman You love
i can feel our constellation shimmer with my eyes closed
You’re the star galaxies wish for
kiss me in every language
everything about You is elegant even the way You rub Your eyes
our love is no sin  sins are weak
my desires believe in You
unbreakable promises  and mingled destinies
You’re hidden in everything
love flowed through my empty spaces
Your love is the glowing halo around my heart
lightning strikes across the skies above  as i run into the wild to find my moon
i only remember Your tenderness
just keep loving me my words will find a meaning
Your poetry is more sensual than my bare skin
Your eyes string my words into a love poem
i remember how cloudless the sky was when we first kissed
pretty eyes hide a deeper grief
moonbeams like Your hand reaching
my night is musing
a girl like a misshapen pearl
what can’t You do?
You kissed me and it felt like waking up  from a perfect sleep
kisses that outlive breaths
how well You trace  my dreams
eyes that deepen the madness
the joy of adventure
choked with waves of pleasure
voice more heady than a glass of wine
touched softly by the fire  of Your words
share my love
thunder and lightning thrown together
sadness on her face like a half moon in its full glory
intimacy too deep for words
a fuck in the middle of nowhere
use Your hands  study my body
i could crave You forever
Your poems linger on my tongue
nights ravaged by shadows
incomplete as darkness without flesh
dreams at war with the horizon
thinking of You in utter nakedness
her soft heart an abyss of madness
i believe in books
let’s be guilty together
to say no to You would feel like i stopped living
i feel happier the more i think about happiness
desires never die
desperate urges
on a grey day like today what You really need is someone warm brown
return between my limbs
caress me with raging eyes
capture my quivers
"words touch, sometimes words heal, always"
the freckles across Your chest trace my name
i only live to love You
You changed the rhythm of my heartbeats when we held hands
the eroticism of Your anger
ever since we met i’ve been dreaming
"in bed, a windstorm of kisses"
a suffering full of glory
life’s a house of dreams when you’re in love
our contrast  is so satisfying
i might touch You first
the strength of a perfect moment
bring our past into my present
immersed in overflowings of humility
seductive like summer
words that hide feelings
You torment me like snow falling upon summer
undress my shame
eyes that can see the havoc in my soul
love is a divine fire
"Happiness is..... astral  A theme that has always possessed the art of writing   There’s a @quiet_relief in flirting with the sky, the moon, the stars and sunsets"
tell me i’m fierce
i always waited for You not knowing when You’d arrive
dreamed of the moon and sea touching
undress slowly  finish faster
unzip and spoil me  like only You can
unlock my yearning
sensation is everything
my universe craves a space in Your world
"soft heart, thick voice"
dropped my fantasies  in the middle of Your life story
thoughts of You like a gold rush
Your every smile  a new dawn
i might never have believed in the purity of darkness
feel my mess
You always open my mind  just a little more
taste my hungry heart
Your love lingers in daydreams and lullabies
my blessed soul has memorised Your touch
my wishlist is black in colour
undone hair is a sexy kind of assertive
say something  heal me
reimagining pain with passion
a feeling called forever
the torpedoes in Your voice will tear me apart
keep Your mind on me let Your hands wander
let’s just get swept away
the war of patience
You make me feel like i can defy destiny
You are happiness  that’s an ocean away
she’s a magnificent mystery
soft eyes that will force You to be calm
she’s wild and vulnerable  unlike anything You’ve known
a blade of grass gives succour to a solitary speck of dew
a sky obsessed with poetry
her voice is a playlist of love poems
without darkness  shine is meaningless
Your every musing is art
my ears feel naked without Your whispers
the grey sky is full of sadist urges  just like You
breathless when You’re close  choking when You’re away
hush my moans with kisses  let the souls do the talking
Your love is a god i couldn’t do without
forever freed by the way You move through my world
i want what i have  i miss what is in me
let’s pour passion on each other and start a fire
You’re the sunniest horizon
reflecting on dreams and desires
pretty eyes are always getting into trouble
there’s a homeliness about the night sky
i love a lot of everything You say
like raindrops on a rose  Your kisses make me beautiful
can’t love  any other way
the moon had whisky tonight
when cruel hands write of love
touch me make me art
You’re unbearably sexy
cup my mouth and tell me all about the good things to come
so utterly wanton
passion is a life skill
the moon is my favourite love song
believing is part of being in love
dreams are dirty  reality is messier  dichotomy
You’re mine  under the surface
in every silence  a moment of love
since You words have taken new meaning
flowering in anticipation
perfection is futile  says the moon
a night sky that’s never known darkness
You lit up the forgotten spaces inside me
You nurtured in me the art of becoming
tonight’s moon is literature
You’re a full moon in a clear sky
brown eyes are full of innocent vulgarities
looking for You  as i chase the storm
a bougainvillea of poems  glowing on her lips
think of me  when the birdsong quietens
her apple skin  soaking warm in a rainfall of quivers
palpable nightmares recur when You let go
her smile is an eternal summer
our darkness is my signature scent  one i’ll wear for life
cherry trees weep for joy  when we kiss
sensations of love delicate and lingering
hold my hand and i’ll believe in anything
Your words  like floating pearls
happier once held
Your voice is mesmerising
beat is a safe word
so hungry my throat hurts
feel me in the twilight bleeding all over itself
let’s simply romance for the rest of our days
i will start fires in Your creamy heart
aura more powerful than the blackest of skies
You’re so elegant  and depraved
happy dreams  drink my night
be my sanctuary  of darkness
reach deep into my purity
the madness of caresses
she is fresh roses
Your love always promises sunrise
You are an illusion in a dream
“He breathes into my ear until my soul takes on His fragrance. He is the soul of my soul – How can I escape? But why would any soul in this world want to escape from the Beloved?”  Rumi
looking at the moon as though it’s reading me Your poems
You’re a quiet moment of revelry
limitless thoughts of You simmering inside me
Your palm prints  on my wrists
blessed with the curse of silence
the scent of hearts blithely blooming
mood: clingy
we’ve moved galaxies apart since yesterday
You cast a spell on my universe
tough as fire i thrive in the winter  of Your absence
life’s too short  waste me away
wore roses on my lips for You
darkness  our common language
my nipples are tingling and moaning about how my lips got all Your bites
i want this every day
ours is a whimsical fairytale come true
resplendent in blue and grey  not the sky You
do You miss me by Your side?
heaven is ice tasting salt
lust rolling in love
earnest pleas in the flutter of her lashes
words and whisky
the moon tonight is essentially grey
i’m smiling about You
i feel like kissing Your palms
the sky has been blushing for hours
i miss You fisting my hair
i can’t wait  for us
You ruined me without breaking
devotion in the way cherry blossoms expose to a thunderstorm
come steal my breaths
poetry like kisses flowing down my back
You’re a part of my every wish
for You i’d uncover  my darkest fears
my delicateness covets Your violence
a fuck like a burial
around You  the rain  is always warm
lucid flashbacks and lasting illusions
the serenity of the universe lives in our silences
Your whispers are tempest
roar for me
feeling naked
You’re the quiet moon steeped in passion  i’m the sea looking for trouble
Your voice is seduction on fire
i envy the flowerbed Your shadow stretches across
Your presence is easy to recall Your absence is hard to forget
glimmers of touch  in Your every word
"with You, i’m a deep sea with no secrets"
Your love is sunshine  my heart is a wildflower
i want to be Your first  sip of morning
nights oblivious to contentment
wayward thoughts  so hard to pin down
escapist meditation
i look for You beyond the limits of desire
shadows moving  breaths deepening
take me into Your fantasies
love is a natural high
You nurture  the darkness of my mind the lightness of my heart
You sate and deny by voice
darkness senses all
moments like flowers
Your touch left on my skin the hues of summer
play with my body deeply
my soul is tense with urges
some words create worlds
i learned from the night sky  the mindful art of holding in fire
she’s a poem bound in lust
how gloriously the moonlight stretches and leaps at the tree in the dark
a rare feeling  in every kiss
Your smile makes mine sparkle
the night is starting to flower
the wind is whipping my hair
love is the warmest colour of spring
gently glowing memories
You turn our conversations into a honeymoon
You are a windstorm that i love
Your elegance is mouthwatering
i want You close every evening because no two sunsets are the same
the cacophony of evening breeze caressing her summer dress
take my all  in the richness of moonlight
a romantic bubble of our own
Your words are more sensual than evening sunlight
Your love is a rough diamond
i want to nuzzle Your dreams
Your words are unfurling along my curves
like fingers interlaced
i feel You  making home inside me
You’re more animal than the moon
Your absence makes everything slow and painful
brown eyes scream the loudest
soft lips curving into a bedtime smile that sprinkles calm
You sniff the barest hint of sadness
whisper in my ear lest i forget i exist
fondle hard and shake off  my inhibitions
spent the afternoon munching a raw carrot
i’ve been lost in love  ever since You found me
sighs like missiles
my skin is wedded to Your severity
my soft moans will darken Your night
everything about You is felt
the moonlight is pouring through my nightdress
Your poetry feels like chocolate shavings on my tongue
my longing is fuming
our love is a unique animal
i run into Your arms knowing well they’ll crush me
her mind is a firepit of darkness
always the moon
poised between wild and calm
my words  Your silence  a nocturnal love story
i’m rich with the pain of separation
You hold me together  like a bridge across the river
i want to be the words Your eyes kiss
eyes bathed in narrative
overjoyed at our ephemeral intimacy cherry blossoms rain everywhere
"i tread barefoot between the walls of our worlds, a thriving meadow beneath an open sky"
in the name of love  a savage moon  torments the sea all night long
hungry as a drunk lover  the moonlight undresses my sleep
wasn’t dreaming  until the moon woke me up
You’re the promise of spring  lingering in the air
be the weight of night  while i sleep
a painting of my eyes made just for Your lips
in Your every word a shared memory
sink into the heat of my desire
Your smile in my eyes Your scent on my lips
thoughts of You make me want to dance
You’re the horizon  in many colours
a feeling that feels like sunlight
You’re the light within
audacious restraint
i’d embrace Your every adventure
every suppressed smile tells a story
my desires follow the path of birds
less lonely when i’m alone
our silences are intimate letters
“where the sky is darker and the wind is stronger and everything seems a little dreamier”
running into Your arms is like diving into paradise
i feel Your searing need when we hold hands
You’re more dreamy than dawn  more poetic than birdsong
loving You is like waking from a sleep
Your embrace is my healing place
pull my hair and tell me to stop worrying
the sweet smell of dark thoughts
boundaries will blur
living through  a fog of sensations
never dreamed  we could  become
undress my mind
my love will never  overshadow Your heart
my heart misses no chaos
tear the sass off my black fishnets
lucid eyes that married my every flaw
deceptively deep love
i miss Your feral
want a peck
Your voice is hours of sunshine
You’re a part of my every new reality
write some more  for my hungry heart
i recognise the addiction
love is the way Your wild  reveals my quiet
Your absence feels almost human
constant music in the sky
close Your eyes  and see me undress
morning walks and evening soaks
escapist whispers
the romance of baths
i’ll write a treatise on my soul but never begin to define  our love
the way she leans on a voice
detour through my dreams tonight
my skin is ravenous for Your art
i am forlorn hope drifting as a mist
kiss me again when i stop for breath
You’re the deepest secret i’ve ever held
by Your side  is the place to be  at dawn
read Your poem to feel beautiful
i miss Your arms  in moments of weakness
O to have  a piece of Your universe
a river called love
put my stars together with Yours
paint me a life
i miss You  in every fraction  of every second
where else does Your heart lie?
we’re drawn to one another like night and day
my love found You on a pitch dark night
in a mood that chimes with the night sky
so many ways i feel Your love
i want to kiss the eternity in You
eyes casting shadows
she’s beautiful as a fruit tree
"love so sensory, dreams covet it"
You make me smile from the heart
there she is  so meek and radiant  quietly fading behind grey clouds  softly shining as if to say something
love me the way they turn flowers into perfume
heated skins kindling an open fire
Your touch feels like we’re driving through mountains
never feels right to watch the moon alone
felt subversive  wore a cream lace dress
made You a bouquet  of seductive murmurs
i crave impact
my throat is raspingly dry
an embrace freed me
Your love is an immutable moon
the fabric of our life needs no ornaments
our love is made of timeless feelings
pleasant memories and poignant absences
this rain is like our story  it keeps going
the greyness of the sky pairs well with red rings around countless cigarette ends
You’re the blazing sun i’m the radiant sea
lying in Your arms  talking in heartbeats
i need so badly to feel wanted
You’re the life i can’t wait to return to
"the pleasure was so intense, i never heard the pain roar"
a rustle of fingers under the covers  a slow curl of toes
“never very far from devotion”
“struggling roses”
the sexiest scent  is that of a lover
sass tempered by elegance
brown eyes ignite powerful passions
wholeheartedly Yours
Your every poem trickles down my spine
i just  You know what
only oppressive kisses will do tonight
my numb lips tingled watching Yours move
Your soft kiss in the dark  will still the windstorm outside
the illusion of closeness
a world of new memories on the horizon
touch me as You might  a delicate dandelion
Your warmth  in my empty spaces
she’s the brightest star in the heart of darkness
i’d scream my need  i’d swallow the wait
i’m a carnal mess without You
strip me down  to my essence
nights without You are burnt feast
You’re all the treasure i’ve ever wanted to find
the moon  and the sea  envy our bondage
i never lack  Your grip
eyes born from a sunset
we find joys so easily
"behind every cloud, is a silver lining in the silhouette of a woman"
be the pleasant whiff in my neck
dream of me arching
eager fingerprints running through bare arms
how passionately the dusk spins  around the storm
You’re a world away  yet my nights wait  for Your darkness
yes!
parched earth and a low sky
voice succulent as fruit
musing aimlessly
Your touch is a melody i barely remember
i’m claustrophobic without Your mouth on me
a quiet girl with an inner love of wild
the art of escape
woke up shorn of all shame
my scars will tell stories You’ll love
darkness doesn’t haunt  it simply ravages
my body is hungry for relief
when hardness seeks depth magic happens
i’ll hug You  and so will my thighs
love smells like honey and tastes like flowers
"words so simple, mind so dark"
You and i  like oak and wine
Your growl builds a crescendo
You know who i am i know what You like
tuck me into the corner
how did i survive until we met?
nostalgic joys and secret smiles
her smile is a revival of rainbows
You stand out
my tears will brighten up Your evening
my mind is willing to explore more
escapism through darkness
scars like medallions
it’s beautiful  to truly belong
let me breathe in Your realm
moonbeams seeping into cleavage
contiguous tongues wild for each other
how dearly  You protect my heart
a change echoes
read my eyes
longing and poetry are soulmates
drowning everything in music  except the memory of Your touch
i fear i may be losing no shame
the horizon is never far from the sea
tell me You dreamed of me i don’t care if You don’t remember it
You make desires pulse in my core
we’re the perfect balancing act
she’s the mist caressing the mountain
a voice captures my soul
Your dark whispers set fire to my ashy heart
the moonlight  is reminiscent  of Your skin
watching the moon feeling naked
You’re a constellation of moons
i need darkness to grow
Your poems could reveal me
she’s a ray of sun that doesn’t want to be seen
i feel warm  when i think  about Your body
our every kiss like storms clashing
the sublime face  of worship
You put away  all my sorrows
come before my night is reduced to dust
love is the way the wind gravitates toward the rose
always  looking for You unknowingly
the full moon is an art form
You are my solace
that smell You love  is it that of my fear
Your heart is where i am most at home
i taste dreams  as You hold me
a summer breeze caresses her face and makes her glass bangles chime as she gathers her wavy hair
the night rises  slow and gracious
i love You more every morning
lightning eyes covered in clouds
thoughts as music
"music, sky and floral smells  but i’d rather fill my evening with You"
pink and blue as one breathtaking sky
You’re a kiss of mint in a smoky mouth
Your absence tastes like the wrath of heavens
the clouds are tracing our dance steps
my dreams are hungry for You
my heart will cry till You swallow it
my demons are troubled
You are every hue  in the skyscape of my life
my breath as Yours
Your eyes were kissing me my heart was writing verses
"less said, more meant"
i miss feeling excited
when love smiles
like sandalwood  i’m forever in the mood to melt
the art of God
"“When she shines at noon of night, Free from clouds to veil her light”"
so many poems flee at night  each wants a glimpse of You
i’m the prey raging at the gates of Your den
making a list of things that make You smile
daytime moon is a perfect expression of everlasting love
pent up passions and overflowing fury
the heart is a delicate flower dancing in the storm of love
eyes pursuing darkness
You’re a distant dream
heard Your voice and forgot the pain i was in
i stay happy for Your happiness
wouldn’t miss the moon for anything but You
a visceral longing that i’m unable to destroy
natural notes in the evening sky
stay just a little bit longer  and You’ll see the world  that i do
the joy of casting a spell
i love to watch Your lips move
love bites that strangle my smile
Your eyes slow me down
Your voice is the chant i hear in dreams
how incessantly You persist  in crushing me
the moon’s hot tonight
bright eyes that strike me hard
a dream took me to far off places and i left my heart there
slowly Your absence throbs in my throat
You’re the cure for me
cocooning  not into myself but You
holding hands  on the road to sunrise
kindness is not an afterthought
loving You  is as easy as breathing
"her hands, soft and delicate and fragrant with marigolds"
sunrays evoke the taste of Your skin
Your scent is eternally sensuous  like the heart of a forest
how decadently our souls tangle
an imaginary hand around my throat
a starless midnight misses her moon
touch where my heart beats
my suffering  has been  my seduction
i miss submitting to Your kiss
love owes us a life
You see fear  even when i don’t see harm
the world will still be senseless  but we’ll be together
quivering with depravity
You helped me find bigger dreams
touching everything You miss about me
You’re thinking  what i’m hoping
Your intent could wreck a storm
our darkness could break light
You’re the drug that cannot be had
fleet me a kiss
i was a blank verse before You came along
tough love and mild injury
all that violence a new black thong provoked
Your scent is familiar throughout my universe
waiting for You with warm anticipation
You’re the blazing sun i’m the crashing surf
poetry that reads like i’m falling into the sea
murky skies and teeming cries
she’s a barrel of spice
nothing about You ever fades
read me poetry through the tempest
i envy the darkness of Your shadow
lip prints like gentle flowers  gracing my neck
"bitter wind, sweet music"
Your promises are the wings wrapped around my heart
Your words got me through a long winter
her elegance is earthy
her fierce carnal nuances
the irresistible musk  of a dark heart
chest kisses to start the day
when touch becomes ink
give me a moment  i’ll make it endless
love is the idyllic view at the end of a dirty road
there is a reason  that her eyes shine
You’re an unrelenting beast
"in her eyes, the silence of deserts"
my contemplative seeks Your impulsive
a cloud of roses
the sea and sand aren’t as intimate  as my face and Your hand
leave me memories but also footprints
a smooth evening in mouthwatering shades of darkness
swans dancing in the sunset  chasing love
so much of life is a mood
You make me see dreams that feel most real
her smile full of eager consent
love is a pain worth living for
dirty sex is a verse worth writing
the unspoken words is why she’s a chaos
let’s dance in the flow of sexual felicity
love me soft  slow as night
"evanescent kisses, eternal memories"
You’re here than elsewhere
i crave Your ravages
You devour me as if i were a new book
play with my morality
reading You convulsively  just to feel Your breath
get me off this sobriety
the invaluableness of peculiar dreams
You saved all of my parts
my eyes have very little to say unless You’re the one reading
moonlit lovers with hearts entwined
i became a poem the moment we kissed
You are a love story without end
give me a lifetime for every day that i’ve lived without You
my heart sends You infinite hues of warmth
i feel Your absence even in sleep
she’s shy as a first sunbeam
a fresh morning breeze leaps over the ocean  to kiss the sun awake
a voice has claimed my heart
my lips are sweeter from all our kisses
make love to me in the sea and on the shore
the ache You invoke
the wind hums savagely
a clamour of desires  underneath my skin
the stars twinkle as our smiles kiss in the open air
tenderly  i will throw myself  at You
Your eloquence strips me
Your soul is a poem
we dream alike
"even when closed, my eyes follow Your hands"
a yearning lurks within
the wind whirls ceaselessly  until the storm engulfs it whole
let’s just swim far away
a playlist of the songs Your soul is made of
seduction in the way the night darkens the sky
this insufferable interlude
sorely in need
"her voice, a collection of poems"
i’m the mischief You’re missing
i want vulgar cuddles
brighter skies  on the horizon
You bite as if to steal treasures
i want to return to Your world
looking up to You  from the height of the rising sun
You’re a rough kind of sky
my own darkness isn’t enough to set me free
kissing into Your palms  prayers of depravity
tenderness that beholds  my defeat
how softly You gather  my surrender
hands full of taking
a violent heat in all my empty spaces
i feel Your love unceasingly
my essence is disguised in the sultry blooms that scent Your bedroom
i need Your touch  not just words
every night i pull a heavy blanket of dreams over sleepless eyes
the One who makes me feel flawless
think of me as You watch the snow fall silently and pool at Your feet
i am part of You
even my tears are bathed in Your perfume
we’re as far from one another as night and sleep
feelings gleam at a distance
so many more words to hear  so many more kisses to collect
eyes smokier than the sky
the face of devotion
i miss floating on the seas in Your touch
she makes powerful pleas
love is quicksand
like rain  she’s destined to fall
my night Your silence a splendid fight
there’s promise in Your warmth
bodies in battle
i do not know how far  but take me there
rebellion in my fingertips
obedience is seductive
You’re the storm inside me  and the darkness that’s out of reach
fondle the flames
You burden me with need
my heady heart sings  until after dark
drive me back to the wilderness
You happened to me like a dawning i’d never seen before
i feel You across the chasm
am i wearing stilettos  in Your dream?
“All those years we could have”
i feel like a storm without shelter
the delicious ache  of anticipation
the heart You’ve stolen i never want it back
i want to sleep in Your arms and see new dreams
she squirms like it’s a ritual dance
my eyes will fight Your night
our scents must now be one
You and i bonding over  poetry
silver linings and impending romance
the great battle between pleasure and pain
love that leaves the soul unchanged
inhaled You so long ago
i see You  in every happiness  that comes to me
embarrassingly chaste
this rain  and my yearning so heavy
my heart is raging about Your silence
she sins like it’s tradition
You hide in all my words
i dreamed us into being
wonder how celestial bodies play
a world of letters  in her hushed smile
whispers that darken the night
hungry for kisses
are all loves painful
ravishing prey  when she likes to be so
the mind grows unfriendly after midnight
just like the sky i have so much unspent passion
Your gaze  resting on the arch of my back
let me fall into Your hands
the heart is a whirling abyss
You are everything  and everywhere
stormy skins and patient souls
thoughts of You swing  in a playground of happy nights
wild thoughts under dark skies
a heart that means to fight every blow
like everything pretty  she will perish
the evening is lustrous before it’s dark
cruelly lonesome without Your tender touch
sometimes my ribs arch  shining a light on Your name  etched in my heart
rough growls on soft neck
"heart of a daisy, skin thicker than a warrior"
You live in so many feelings
let’s sneak and sin
Your silence is an evening of war
Your absence is a day without sunshine
behind the ruins rises an angel
incessant echoes and overcast skies
"full of thoughts like thumping drums, my head needs to rest on Your chest and soak the rhythm of Your heartbeats"
i waver alone in the darkness  faceless like a shadow
a closed book in every smile
she’s quiet like she’s consulting the heavens
her voice is small but fiery
traces of hope  keep her from trembling
crushed by a gaze
half undressed beneath a powerful full moon
kissing Your palm is more magnificent than smelling a rose
our love is a fierce rainstorm
my heart murmurs Your name louder overnight
my heart will hold You longer than it lives
thinking of You is hypnotic
her every gesture  a wordless poem
You are my darkest secret and every colour in the rainbow
lucid eyes whispering pleasure
hold me until i break free of everything else
calamity dancing on caresses
vices so stubborn
Your touch is a beautiful language
beneath Your touch i truly exist
a girl like a lost city
take me  to the edge of excessive
envious of the way the sunlight dives towards a flower
woke up untouched
dying  to live
i depend upon hope
the sea bares its soul to light up the sky every night
dream on Beloved my kisses can wait
finish me like a story You love to read over and over
i feel a storm of lust emerging
her eyes  always wildly  evocative
the moon tonight is unapologetically glamorous
spin me around  inside Your breathing space
the sky turns pink  as if You were looking at it
love is pure  not simple
Your hungry mouth  on my curvaceous lips
You live in my deepest pangs of desire
"solid hands, glutinous touches"
stroke my spirit animal
my desires are born for another world
our love is a feast
no finer romance than ours
Your poems warm on my tongue
i’m as soft  as You’re invincible
gentle eyes and sweeping hugs
silently my lips  wander Your clavicle
curls in my hair  like fragrant hyacinths  playing with Your soft spot
me*
dreams flowering in a dark place
a thousand names  one feeling
i want passion  i want pain
You imagine  and i become
thrills shine in her eyes
love is the beauty love creates
the sky is more at home with the earth than its own cosmos
since You i love life  more than before
my silent love can’t deny Your tempest
tell me how long i must howl
kiss me hard  for i bear such a disturbing mind
Your passion all over my destiny
tonight it’s just me and Your bare words
tell me about my eyes
You love me and burn me wholly
if You’re the moon  i’m the luckiest star
the moon never fails to fill the night
You feel closer when it gets dark
unfold my soul at dawn
nothing rhymes with sunset
You torment me so freely
i want a taste as You speak
You opened my mind to strange thoughts
starvation steals my sanity
walking hand in hand discovering lost happiness
spreading my radiance  through wild nights  and tender mornings
sighs dispelling clouds
You kiss discreetly  yet penetrate my essence
Your words are a passage to pleasure
You said nothing but i fell for the story
love is the way Your voice hugs my name
Your escape in my throat
promises caressing hearts
that scent of arousal when You imagine my destruction
it’s all a bit intense outside my heart
brown kohl in her eyes  exuding forest fires
breathing Your name inside a soft embrace of pain
another sunset fading into echoes
You’re the sky that rumbles in whispers  i’m the rain that falls quietly down
smells like rain
where is succor than on Your lips?
tried to sketch You with smoke
cuffs of heavy longing around deviant wrists
been imagining  You  forever
inhaling on Your skin the aroma of love
i am the loneliest part of the shore  i covet the sea from afar
is this love  or perfection
my ache won’t sleep  pour a little darkness into my night
her every sigh  a new verse
poems as storms
flaming skies and trembling seas
my skin liked what Your eyes did
now  You know  me
like tendrils of myrrh  my words seek You
i’ll sprawl on the ground for You like moonlight
You are heaven that lies on the dark side
Your heart knows passion like no other
eager hands  like a fuming volcano
i want to feel Your hand in mine  as we watch the dancing snowflakes
lick any wound
without You this universe is an illusion
if i could i’d write to You with rose on a quill
i want to live with You as second skin
caramel eyes  full of sleeplessness
You’re made of something elusive
fragile blossom  fighting to grow
You write about me i write for You
my reserve is now a raging fever
Beloved  You and i  are darkness and moon
Your verses and i are best friends
found myself in Your poem
she dreams darker in her sleep
a piece of the sky across the moon in perfect colours of submission
boundary-pushing love  like a perpetual shine in the sky
the way Your eyes  head into my depths
there’s no elegance like You
You are an ephemeral blessing
"i lie in bed, motionless  i breathe, motionless"
my darkness is laced with Your love
hearts thirsting for a read
my dreams just want to gaze at You
think of my voice  when i’m obeying
my unbending desires  summon Your power
i only meant to disturb  not provoke  Your wrath
infinite mercy in Your savage hands  if only i can kindle it
painted my nails deep red to part my lips for Your eyes
please wake my soul from this slumber
Your words bear the heat of a million scattered stars
like a tempest You linger in me
thighs trembling with thunderbolts of need
Your touch is a song after a long silence
a new dawn thrives in our dreams
her love is purer than a hundred temples
trust the thunderstorm tonight to whisper my love to You
i love to play with Your fire
looking at the sky and not seeing the moon is a madness i cannot bear
my dark impulses never sleep
she’s an ember forever anticipating flames
i’d bloom all night long
flying kisses make me restless
*cries Your name
i deserve more feelings
"deep silence, heavy rain and Your voice in my head"
so far
i admit  Your scent is buried  in my skin
a brooding sky  imitates my chaos
would You echo my name if i fell silent?
give me kisses that deprive my lips of colour
my calm is wild without You
my soul is in constant frenzy
thoughts disruptive as dawn
eyes blinking at stars that tease
in the darkness  You love me  so colourfully
sighs that strike the clouds until they’re empty
the moonlight tried to shackle my weary limbs  but i really needed to dance in the rain
every night i let the night kiss You
lying in wait at the edge of chaos
our love is like the sky beautiful everyday
i set my head down on the waves of Your voice  it is enough to seize the night
i have mourned Your silences more fervently than the roaring wind
You kissed my ugliest scars
indulge in my sinning
there’s love in the way a rose droops to feel the thorn
woke up to a fleeting warmth
may Your desires darken
lips softer than water lilies
petulantly Yours
can’t mute love
the moon gives me little rest
a sanctuary of relief in Your arms
my eyes want to cast more spells
lie with me  stir up my dreams
the rain and i crave the same  Your touch
soft hearts and indurate words
Your voice so deceptively  merciful
kiss me and pluck all the lost words
You are cosmic if anyone is cosmic
frissons of raw desire  inside my throat
the worth of Your love outweighs the riches of the universe
my heaven bears Your footprints
my senses cry aloud
do You remember reading those eyes?
is it me You’re pondering
let every falling snowflake remind You of my surrender
what song does Your heart sing
come with me in the moonlight
my eyes are weak from waiting for the moon to rise
be my faith
her vices shine so bright
my lust fuels Your fire
darkness isn’t just a fashionable place to be
can You not be silent
forever musing over Your eyes
we touched just now i’m sure of it
desirable rules
would You like me to rouse Your fury
i suffer torments of ecstasy
i hover between pleasure and fear
there’s no abating this heat
fingertips on heated skin  like claps of thunder
no thunder can shake this heaven
"so much to say, nothing to write about"
she’s grows more beautiful with fear
i’m a book dedicated to You
You introduced new words into the language of love
give me one kiss  for every star i’ve wished upon
intercourse of verses
i’ve yet to exhaust a thousand desires
lips touching under a copious night sky
the art of well-chosen language
i want You in all my dreams
tragedies in her smile
love disguised as lust
so blue  so pervasive
some days i only step out to look at the sky
the inkling of will
the art of suffering without a hiss
the streaks of fire in the sky  are her sighs that wrote poetry
You said goodbye  and took all breath away from life
we need darkness  to read each other
You put an end to my history
i revel in the pursuit
You were born to choose me
in a bleary world You’re a shining light
the abyss and i  hold the same darkness
a void strikes me
sharpen my whimpers with Your teeth
mouthful of idleness
strained every nerve wishing for You
wake me in Your dream
everything except my eyes is overcome by sleep
lying on a bed of misery moved to tears  by Your silence
light up the fires of Your poetry and allay my hunger
i’m a grey cloud deluged with longing
lose no time  any season is spring
want Your flame to devour me  before the tide comes in
You fulfilled my abyssal desires
a flower that smells like her
"""There you were, and then you were there more."""
the way Your hands reach for my soul
love is You being tender in the dark
whisper whilst we admire the moon
"i’m a sullen planet, come illumine my core"
in my mayhem  You found a heaven  of Your own
she is every star  burning in darkness
countless dreams in her midnight eyes
steadily  You weave  all the dark colours  into my being
everlasting urges
then came sudden cravings
the eclipses i suffer
sighs like screams burning
Your soft hush is worth all tempest
i please myself  with thinking
i have loved You in my darkest hours
carry me beyond the limit
i’m weak from being strong
give me a glimpse  or a delicate whiff  i’ll ask nothing more
Your phrases caress
seeking You in every moment
i’m ready to feel now
You’re the discerning moon i’m the surging sea
pull me closer  my veins are losing patience
sinking under the pain of being away from You
"love so desirable, my morals cracked"
ruin  but slowly
thunder at me
i find myself sighing in the dark
our love is enough for the cosmos
today looked so good on You just like every other day
You’re more love than love itself
her grit could bend storms
no such thing as dreaming too far
debauchery leaning on shy words
my desire smells like a rose
thoughts that tease
my skin without Your touch is like poetry missing soul
i want to wear the darkness in Your poems
a smile like tenderness turned to excess
You own my grace and my shame
to be on Your mind is to live a dream
a veil of fire   on every kiss
let’s walk seaward together
to perfume love is why flowers bloom
quietly  Your absence pervades like the scent of smoke  in my hair
the sky has gone from pink to violet waiting for the moon to rise
here’s everything i wanted to say
Thank you for your appreciation @hobo_8 ✨
the art of beholding the simple
Your knee is where i wish to be
silently we walk  through such absolute darkness
a love truer than all my beliefs
i miss Your depraved glances
sedate voice and incisive whispers
our love is the sunshine lashing the sea
the sky grows more beautiful every day
have pity on my wretched little libido
her softest kiss bears the passion of wildflowers
there are fears i would rather not remember
You make me feel vulnerable  all over again
i’ll always hurt with You
the drought of touch
the agony of love
my universe wants to mingle into Yours
i feel colossal needs stirring
You and i  and the wars we fight
Your raw strength breaks my will deliciously
the eternal glory  of our desperate deeds
my mind follows no other
failings that conceal  so many virtues
You awakened all my demons
my weaknesses  in Your hands
ostentatiously oversized signs from the universe
pleasing You is a weightless struggle
i surrendered at a glance
wanders in her sleep
i see kingdoms in Your shadow
You blur the ugly around me
i dreamed You before You conceived us
will think of You till You’re within reach
mischief
You hear the words i hold back
You’re quiet  but awake  in my heart  and soul
hers is a body like the viola
i kissed Your heart first
You’re the smoothest fibre of my being
put all Your aggression into a loving mood
music as aura
the heavens will remain clouded until we meet again
envious of the vines twining on trees
You possess the art of everything
i receive the storm  as a sign of You
my longing is more painful  than love letters on fire
love sick eyes heavy with worthiness
so ready for infinite journeys with You
You kissed me like a thousand forevers
torn between rough and tender
softly falling snowflakes  voice her desires
“she smiled and he almost lost his balance”
a love that outshines gods
i’d happily spend my life as Your sunset
Your essence  holds me together
You’re quick to leave  quicker to turn back
You’re the wind that rushed  to lift up my heart
slain within Your mercies
i’ve loved life since You’ve loved me
You’re cruel  to slaughter  and not taste  the spoils
write our names together  where no one can find and read
savage lover  come break this silence
i touched eternity  it was but a moment
You’re the lustre in my universe
my words strut in vain
a starry sky makes little difference without Your arms around me
my decency betrays me  in darkness
untameable longings
the heart mends itself  the soul needs intimacy
Your evils are dark not destructive
her struggle eludes depths
i miss the scent of Your exertion
smiling at the days turning over
this carnal madness  is a home of our own
Your darkness fosters my desires
that distant chime is my soul thundering for You
"my heart is an open field  Your love, the yellow buttercups everywhere"
happiness is now
spurt Your grace into my beauty
sometimes  all it takes to uplift you  is cocoa
strip away let my smile be all that remains
a calm sea at sunrise  reflects the ripples You cause in my soul
my sky dreams of the heaven in Your eyes
Your words are water to my thirst
i do not deserve the tyranny of Your absence
i want to nestle in the light of the forest
Your deep growl and other tranquil thoughts
i want to bask in Your perfection
i feel that one bauble that wants to cling to the tree and not let go
hold my hand as i fill out this blank new page
ending the year with a full moon and a heart full of new hopes
"You are the radiance in my face, the end to my story, the quest of my soul"
just like the moon You lull me and You fire me up
kiss me under a flowering sky
the moon tonight adorned a halo and defied all poetry and art
a pure sensation
my seduction does not go beyond Your strength
i’m the wave that keeps Your ocean rough
lone sunsets and other terrors
Your impressions  on my soul
Your charisma surpasses my worship
a spark of intimacy  under the shade of stars
You excite the genie inside me
ever wonder if i think of You or breathe more?
a voice violently bent on caressing
my passion lives in exile
wander through my mind  if only to find a poem
enflame my skin   until my soul is steeped in pleasure
falling into Your arms  like the boundless sea
You left me unfinished  and fearless
Your words are alive in a lost world
yearning is a vain struggle
i was speechless but You heard me
love me hard enough to kill me
Your words  the calm to my chaos the soothing hands to my suffering
Your urges subdue me
use that tongue like a knife and slice my throat  then place it in my breast
shivering in wait
“eloquent stings”
i sit on my knees  and feel the miles between us  crush
her eyes expose more love than a thousand setting suns
a girl raised on thunders
feel my trembling in the storm You hear
beside You i feel beautiful
i will only bloom beneath Your rage
envious of the evening light fading into streaks of darkness
waiting for You  to squeeze my hand
wish i could show You off to everyone i know
eyes native to the night sky
"a dream fulfilled, a life stirred"
our love  has stayed the same and kept growing
write me a poem called tenderness
"afraid of the quiet, of losing my insanity"
lips eager for satiety
the sea rushed to kiss when You set foot on its shore
my feelings are devoted to Your poems
the gift of a simple life
atune my soul  to Your music
seize my mood
a pleasure rich with tears
my day is overcast without the sunshine of Your voice
a distant echo rushes in
my lip prints  on the confines of Your universe
without the storm the calm remains  undiscovered
we have  every reason  to cherish and despair
"if i could, i’d lose more  than my life for You"
a love destined for moderation
i am the smile playing  upon Your lips
thinking of You with my heart
Your laughter washes my soul
i’d give up my blanket fort to skinny dip with You
silent pining  and other austerities of love
i want Your desperate coming
dreams against illusion
i’m sure of my way  when You’re holding my hand
You make love feel like the simplest miracle
take me deeper into Your darkness
i never tire of seducing You
this ache is torture
a continual fervor  in my bones
You hold my gaze as if to find gold in my eyes
i can’t part with Your scent
think about the pretty ways i sink
"reaching out to the moon, the stars passed away into oblivion"
her skin a perfect read
tread on  my every fear
we are infinite  within this love
You possess all my eternities
a change of morals never of heart
breathe my sighs and taste my longing
the mind is an ever-flowing fount of filth
You complete my inner life too
soothe my heart with Your presence
yearning to be kissed
it’ll be Christmas the day Your kiss wakes me up
Your magic  is a force beyond Christmas Eve
the sky is clear and bright  like we were lying together watching it
all who have loved will sleep well tonight
"dark night, half-empty bed, thick silence"
took a leap in the dark  found myself in Your everything
moments worth worlds
a love lived  a life only dreamed
You disquiet my fears
my throat  will not lose hold
i feel my demons sinking away
is it just because i smell of summer?
my body is constantly seeking Your passion
a heaven so divine  i lost reverence for sin
she’s the life of a writer
the way she lets her guard down so pretty
savage bites on roseate lips
were You startled when i pursued Your darkness?
moments  make our lives  art
the frenzies of lips and souls
our love  a fount of startlingly dark  virtues
my panties miss the mess
"when longing clings to my skin, i cease to sparkle"
i want to die kissing
the air i breathe lacks life when i’m missing You
i’m spellbound by the pain this love causes
You’re so far away yet never absent for a moment
her eyes invoke salvation
i feel a want  incessantly
the ravings of a desirous heart
words that have touched Your heart have been my best writing
You are the divinity beneath a mangled sky
in my silence  and my hum  i hold You
celestial fire for a soul
You’re more gratifying than my past happiness
i’d evade the moon to behold You
the nectar of a sleepy voice  seductive and destructive
she’s a wild sea wind
i’d run barefoot to the end of my world for You
my humility knows no bounds
subdue my fears
lend my desires Your night
Your essence buried in my ruin
i shine amid the shadows that surround us
put all my perfections down  in writing
how warmly we wrangle
"soft curves, a vast havoc"
hold me tight with those destroying hands
feeling You  so quietly
a hard lesson  in a tone so delicate
i want to be lost in dreams all night long
Your memory is wrapped around me like cashmere
the soft glow of devotion
You’re the peace of my soul
trace the beauty of sunbeams on my skin
lay me down  in Your beautiful chasm
can’t tell if this is life or music
we’re the storm in the heaven of love
i anticipate Your caresses so deeply
i discovered the cosmos in You
i have endured Your rage longer than the sky is dark
some days she’s a rainstorm bowing politely
You’re the moonlight biting into my darkness
an aura inclined to violence
the night in her is fierce
my suffering is self-love
there’s defiance in her thoughts
she doesn’t ask only sighs
sexual hunger pangs and other agonies
i can taste the tide of longing
our bond is a bloom unknown
her absence awakens in Him a deep tenderness
You’ve seen me at my shameless best
Your tenderness is a shining light
my sass wants to dance upon Your knee
You cherish my hopes as they were books
a wreath of breaths  to warm Your heart
the magnetism of poise
the lingering scent of remnants  of pleasure
You possess my thoughts
i should bloom
i love best for us to exist together
if only we could live together for a season
it’s painful to feel comfortable without You
"eyes on the stars, hand in Yours"
feel my soul  reaching out for You
unceasing thrusts  and other ways to speak of love
the lust of torment
i long for the toughness of Your presence
my soft gaze  tangled with  Your riotous writing
loving touch tender as dusk
my darkness has its eyes fixed upon Your flame
i seek Your memory in every smoky vapour i exhale
freely the night pours itself over me
my spirit is on bare knees just for You
destined to lie in wait
this love is worth everything
happiness is not a dream
dark desires  infinite and earnest
love is  half rose  half thorn
she collects passions from where rivers meet
will Your fire embrace my cold?
You in my heart poetry on my lips
my soul felt everything
darkness edged with gold
ours is a sky studded with dreams that came true
our debaucheries  glittering
such dazzling madness  when she bared her heart
she smiles like a thousand stars
the moonlight tears down the glass window just to peep at her
an inborn sinfulness
Your tempest is charming
it’s midnight and i’m devoid of darkness  what sorcery is this?
remembrance keeps me warm
an irresistible desire  to give in
Your absence is a savage blade  i am bleeding everywhere
the dampness of giddy moments
patience can never be unwise
beautifully naked reality
her eyes inspire languages
the bliss of taste
we mingle horror  with love
words full of pleasure
i say we are  flame and smoke
whisper severely
You’re a delightful shade of grey
Your poems are kisses for starving eyes
fuck me if only to see how much sense i have left
my hollow mouth craves Your savagery
show me Your reading list
a thousand feels
Your silence speaks to my heart
sometimes  You put poems in my mouth
look at me with love and with lust
gave You my life so You could add meaning to it
pretty eyes delicately dripping
i’ll sing to You  in slumbers
shake me up in silence
her heart has walls of glass
the music of infinite reminiscences
repel my pleas
peacefully we live in the shadows
feeling audaciously wayward
so slender and tranquil  the moon tonight is heedlessly violent
being in love makes so many things appear beautiful
more desires in my heart than the stars You see in the sky
our spirits purge when we kiss
lovers beneath a roaring sky
Your absence  has the stillness  of an ocean at midnight
days of shining nights of burning
"Your eyes are half blue sky, half thunderstorm"
she’s a decadent wreck
heels up knees down
Your thoughts  release my drama
i want to give  what it takes
relax that muscle inside me
deeper so i can feel more heat
her beauty darkens the night
as natural  as letting go
reach deep  till i see stars
just let me keep descending
You are  a sense of ease
look how well i’m clothed with night
eyes like a forest in brown
tempest in the way You breathe around me
anticipation so deep i shudder
You rain all through my blood
You touched my heart and it magnified
"solid violence, scattered screams"
voice so eloquent in disciplining
she’s a vast chaos of dreams
the moon is out and feelings seem to have arisen
devoted to the force of Your imagination
Your darkness is my only true liberty
kept smoking so i could smell You in the air
i envy the freedom of the rain
rooted in thoughts of You
kiss me hard  for the love of verse
kisses bearing annihilation
"bare Your mind, show me Your dreams"
my shivering soul  found solace in Your darkness
You’re the zenith that waded to shore
all these sensations below the surface
satisfied in thought
fire-stained soul
Your hand drifts across my inner thigh  like it’s a page of poems
feeling steady right now
You colour the softness in my face
quietly  i fall back  easily  i let go
the sky and sea feel a connection  when we kiss
"different day, same feelings"
please roll over on top  and tune into my breath
Your fire thawed my edges
take me fast and far
she’s breathtaking on bended knees
the delight of skins slowly melting into the night
Your touch is a treasure
to love with a hopeful heart
hope You have  as much to cherish as i do
Your charisma more heady than can be expressed
ardent passion  in all Your words
decadent like a desert rose opening in the rain
my sky needs just one star to light up
sink into me again
audacity of verse  and other random acts of seduction
slyly the sunbeams   curl around my thighs
thousand desires flourish when You crush me
gather my lips inside Your kiss
hands that kindle ecstasy
the blessing of sexual warmth
the heart is so easily touched
warm brown eyes  a love story
choking for Your pleasure is more blissful than a breath of fresh air
Divine joy
woke up full of vain hopes
Your words are the smoothest manacles
breaths flowing over me like a fountain
without You my dreams  would be empty
You sway my heart  calm to wild
growl and kiss  hush and hurt
"eyes so covert, they could pass for virtues"
my want is extreme
"indulged in so much reminiscence, forgot all about the moon"
i love the pain when You’re close enough to stroke it
sore from Your caresses
i owe my share of heaven  to Your love
lips unfurl to embrace Your mouth
our rituals are everything
You fill me with hunger
You’re worth more than all the love i feel for You
let nothing stop You once we kiss
violated my sexuality  when You made me blush
"no wonder i can’t sleep, it’s never dark without You"
life isn’t how it should be but it’s undeniably blissful
Your eyes make me want to reveal everything
Your fire kissed my spirit
our silences have the finest conversations
how You strip sunsets from my shy eyes
Your untiring patience will crush me
i’d sacrifice a thousand breaths  to kiss You one more time
fears blinded by passion
like lightning i’ll break through  Your darkness
Your smile shines a light on my face
i turned the lights off  so You can read me  with Your hands
bet You miss my tears
my every dark imagination  has Your scent
wished for a spark got clasped by a roaring fire
i will pleasure You with a mouth that moves like a mountain river
foreplay and stay
crush where i’ve bloomed
Your husky voice   rubbing against my silky murmurs
her nakedness is glorious poetry
You called my name and sunshine came pouring over
at the very least  the sky must fall when You’re being missed
possessed by a whisper
i’m on Your mind my bosom feels it
i slow burn night and day
this madness in me is Your essence on my soul
the night feels delectably dark as if i were with You
Your poems expose my vices
her yearning echoes louder than the sound of breaking waves
beholding You in crimson lips
kisses that erase my sorrows
i am a gasp beneath Your fury
be the storm that awakens me
"away from You, i feel helpless and vulnerable  like dying autumn"
"insolent slut, ably taught"
Your smile  for a campfire treat
promiscuous eye contact  and other affairs of love
she’s a wanton feline
"come closer, devourer of my sighs"
the stars shimmer  to match her eyes
aroused by the suddenness of a second kiss
her powerful sweetness  and other calamities
You’re the best part of my day
i’d happily evanesce  in Your spell
evenings spent without You are more wistful than the song of a dying koel
there is no other story  like our love
how i love those fearless blue eyes
i’m the shore  wet and warm even though the sea left no trace
the sacred heat of desire
there’s no easing into the night alone
Your fury is irresistible
do You hear what i never say?
endless torments  eternal love
in love with the way You smile when i’m in pain
"lips, thighs, hair, skin so thick"
You’re the secret to my sins
i love how Your bruises hide my scars
like a pearl she is  at her most natal when muddy
watch nightfall in my eyes and i’ll find a blue sky day in Yours
didn’t know how lost i was until You found me
bodies blazing  souls in flux
You’re savage as rain in autumn
You have all my consent do i have Yours?
pleasing You is the brutal struggle i long for
darkness is never without possibilities
a lot of my happiness lies in the fleeting moments we share
kisses that dry tears
my lips are drooping roses  let the kisses linger
heavy hands ripe for riot
Your silence is a dull sunset
You for me as rage for love
punish my moans bite harder
all that prose in her madness
my mouth will tell You how my nights passed
Your arm around me our heartbeats resting together
neither love nor this hunger  will ever die
full of You when i’m silent
i found Your love in my passionate pursuit of pain
charged but not alive
drinking wine with the demons
my name is succulent  when You speak it
i miss You with my soul
rolling my eyes at Your merciful violence
pour love into me   against the wall
take it all once more
the gleam of willing eyes
tongues immuring sonnets
snug in my heat
my evenings are bound to Your darkness
i long for kisses that speak the language of fire
savour dawn on my lips
always hoping  for one last kiss
turn my prose into Your life story
contemplating the night sky  naked
i have the softest spot for Your rough
a lust list of everywhere i want to kiss You
lingering at the closed door secretly tasting Your kiss
soft kisses that warm dark and drizzly evenings
the breathtaking immersion  as You read me
violent night  #NSFWChristmasSongs
white Christmas #NSFWChristmasSongs
brown eyes are passionate mourners
scrape the disquiet from my nerves
darkness weeping with solitude
clandestine hues of Your love  on my soul
Your echo sways  in the recesses of my heart
didn’t wear high heels because i was hoping we’d dance the night away
one glimpse of You i shine all day
eyes that own drunkenness
(moon to sea)
spiky gooseflesh peeking out from under her ribbed cardigan
You are succor at a bleak time
drunk on memories of late nights
i love to breathe in the fragrant lust on Your skin
You’ve kindled my soul for many more lives
You and i  sublime as the moon and its lunar halo
dark minds sharing colourful stories
feeling the love
the eternal allure  of animalism
we were brought together  to be one forever
i could spend hours shying from Your gaze
i have more than i deserve
away from You i’m uninterested in a lot of things
this love is a precious timepiece
i feel You every time the moon ignites the evening
i’m the quiet delirium  in a small corner  of Your world
the moon is glowing pitifully  maybe she needs a hug
the trees are fond of surrender
kisses that uncurl poems on my lips
i can feel the moonlight dip gently into my spirit
there’s an exquisite silver magnet hanging in the sky
i’ll be hiding and reading until You find me
You’re all the love imaginable
i want to breathe a forest
You take more breaths away than give memories
her heart
delve deeper into my decadence
my heart is a starry sky full of kiss stains
ephemeral smiles and stiff autumn silence
the day our world became one
nurture my obsessions
i want to undo Your shirt buttons
everything beyond You is a blur
come and turn me inside out
smear my skin shame my mind  be kind to my aching soul
rising sun blushing sand  such elegant balance
sensations flowing like poetry
Your smile is soft but not forgiving
consume my night
i will follow the rising sun  until i melt into Your eternity
lay over me  a cosy blanket  of hazy whispers
is writing or loving me  a bigger relief?
eyes brewing dark potions
malevolent pauses
the soft power of her prose
touch me the way the rainstorm indents the desert
You sense it all
moans that make music
Your check shirts leave me soaking
something  is keeping me  sad
unpleasant is my favourite  dirty word
You got my chaos tucked into Your heart
taste of coffee and scent of memories
one touch  long familiar
she is wilderness  laden with fragility
the sky is dense with starlight
let’s not take a lifetime to escape
a patient flowering
desires as young as the night sky
You’re a thought to savour
what would a glass of wine be without a whiff of Your skin?
eyes sadder than milky coffee
i breathe to feel You
You’re the light i reach for every morning
thunder and savagery
holding all my fire
gold dipped dreams
some reminiscences left me smelling of roses
let’s be all moonlight and kisses
Your words carried me to bed
i’ve chosen the song i want us to slow dance to
my fears need freedom
love will always dare to speak
kisses bearing eternity
"voluptuous scent, explosive sexuality"
the crescent in the sky tonight bears resemblance to Your lip print on my soul
the way Your teeth..
i accept the proposal Your eyes made
Your memory keeps me warm
You mean more than all the stars in space
"i want You alone i want You, alone"
petals drifting to Your tastebuds
a cascade of wet kisses covering my inner thighs
You own all my firsts
animalic harmony
vulgar thoughts and a dark mood
"cigarette in my mouth and You all over my mind, only one of those things is beautiful"
You keep reading me like i’m an open book
You’re the heat  beyond the reach of summer
planting iris blossoms  along the edge of forever
another lonely night  like a thorn in my flesh
for You i’ll say  the quiet things  aloud
"unable to fly, unable to exist"
irresistibly poetic eyes  like a day at the sea
supple skin lovingly bathed in burns
she’s aroused quicker than the flutter of a butterfly’s wings
is it the wind or my demons humming?
"kisses sinking, spirit soaring"
the lure of her ragged edges
tassels of whispers caressing my neck
Your breaths unfurl my being
sunset is my hometown
"darkness, like love  will swallow the pain whole"
without You my stars resist harmony
how smoothly we sail bearing the burden we do
prey when i kneel
i listen for the sound of silence   but hear only noise
give me something to survive on
the sweet scent of cosy nights
all is  as dull  as possible
the art of meaningless refrain
Your smile has the tenderness of wolves
to spend a night in the blazing forest of Your passion
Your depths   hold my peace
You’re all the light my world needs
restless twilight  feeding on shadows
i’m hungry for Your wild
over my soul a veil of Your control
infinite clouds of poetry in her eyes
desire is no delicate flame
how easily i remember
assertive spooning
You and i  south of sunset
love is here to stay  are You?
Your poetry is my truth
i read You and feel immortal
the moon is a shadow  of Your smile
can’t smile without You
sexy sailor come lie along the shore
she’s a lost love letter  on a journey
her words taste of gunpowder
eyes born to sing the blues
touch  Your woman
the wind knows the way i want  to touch You
sighs and sins raging inside me
my vulnerabilities  are for Your eyes only
brown eyes are soft fire
stolen glances and sweet ache
the heart is a house of hunger
a web of lip prints all over Your chest
a fine night for dying missing You
a poet’s voice is effortless foreplay
Your absence is more terrifying than a scream in the dark
You make love  stay dangerous
overlapping souls and other neverending stories
breaths like a realm of care
rain on my tongue
my story would be groundless fiction without You
the sky has buried the moon like a true savage lover
i want to wake every morning to the calm of Your beating heart
a mesmerising scribble of freckles
can’t tell if You are playing or preying
our differences are happily married
i’m the river wrapping itself around every spare drop of the ocean
i want to retweet @GarteredJune’s bio
dark and dirty deeds  beneath a bright sky
be more mine  as the pages turn
she’s the wind that changed a ship’s course
love by hurting punish by loving
every last word is Yours to speak
kisses deeper than seven seas
moondrunk
she’s gold dusk
Moonlight
somewhere there’s a cosy cottage  not lived in yet
what You said and what i imagined are now all the same
"love so soft, touch so savage"
You’re the lightning that brightens my empty sky
my skin is having intimate thoughts
chaste knives in that voice
hush my heart just for a moment
why leave behind what You love?
tears are a metaphor for freedom
Your depravities make me swoon
every ritual a vestige of my devotion
i glow like a firefly  in the soft armour of Your arms
i’ve seen the dark side of the moon and i’m ensnared
You’re all of the pages unfolding my story
life is an evening of long goodbyes
i will swallow all Your curse words
a needy girl  in Your maybe world
eyes like a fresh dawn steeped in espresso
dreams chasing sleep
need You far longer than forever
Your scent hounds me
a saint she ain’t
You seem miles beyond the moon
Your body speaks my mind
our beautifully twisted fantasies
can’t live without You  won’t leave without You
sip the gin and feel the music
"my earth moves for You, it always will"
dangerous stiffness and soft openings
i’ll be Your skin art
hearts of summer  setting the winter on fire
love brought me to my knees where lust still thrives
feel the night opening up
You’re more than just a dream come true
our passion is the beautiful black sheen on darkness
sinfulness and morality  my love doesn’t know the difference
a deep pleasure  on the cusp of pain
You brought so many feelings into my life
so many shades of cursive in her eyes
been telling all about You  to the relentless rain
"i miss You so much, it feels like even the songs have emptied of poems"
this timeless world of ours
Your ferocious growls my tender throat
suppress my screams  with the hand that writes gentle poems
beautiful bruises  like a never ending sunset
awoken by the sound of silence
the star of our love is its own constellation
the ruby glow on her lips stokes a destructive fire
i ache without limit
like a high sea she’s wild everywhere
whispers that slay syllable by syllable
handwritten from the heart
some hearts are abandoned warships
some days she’s a shipwreck some days she’s a storm floating on the sea
there’s always plenty of love to feel
"i’m full of random imperfections, but so was the sky today"
cradle my sass in Your sadist hands
how effortlessly  You get hold of me  from afar
Your eyes smear rose blossoms on my skin
Your words make me who i am
you could decorate every cloud in the sky with her sadness
want my rapture in Your hands
You are love of all kinds
promise to never unchain my heart
"the only whisper, that of soft white sheets we lie on"
missing You is no dull pain
sweltering sand  salty waves  earthly pleasures
Your ropes are stitched to the edges of my feet
i worship Your unholy ideas
Your warm breaths caught in the meshes  of claret pearls  around my neck
i finish another cigarette  then freshen my mouth  even though we’re too far apart  to kiss
bursts of sweet pain in my heart from the teeth of Your love
You’re my darkest thought
meet me half-way between the horizon and zenith
i found everything when our eyes met
You live in my mind
the fullness of autumn so perfect
sun above horizon me beneath You
i have a better world in mind
my thirst arises from the ocean floor
i revel in Your fearlessness
both of us nurturing darkness  makes life beautiful
my heart will always hold  Your magic
scrape every surface
stay close until Your scent is mine
every petal hungers for a stroke
You play my yearning like a marimba
Your taste in my mouth from feasting eyes on the moon
we long like fuck
Your absence shows no mercy
a throb of raw desires
the slow seduction of tenderness
in You i seek the unknown
You make me feel different
love me to destruction
Your thought makes a difference
blooming in anticipation
throw me into Your shade
heartbeats submerged by dark whispers
Your words tempt my senses into a spiral
a lightning bolt of windfallen tears
folds of flesh weeping like a masochist
a fire only You can fuel or douse
lovingly cornered and intimately loved
expressive silences full of unspoken words
paradise is the depth  of our love
Your solid chest  warm on my back
tremulous wind beneath a nudist sky
dark intent  in steel blue eyes
"Your every kiss, a surrealist dream"
souls disappearing in a haze
a visceral fever  to feel Your soothing rage
i struggle not to wish the impossible
all night long  the sea slakes  the thirsty rock
the bruises are my fantasies coming to the fore
wine and moon and heat and depths
watching the moon and learning the language of seduction
her madness is beyond divinity
Your compelling words and a blue moon for a reading lamp
an incredible upheaval of boldness in the sky tonight
breathe moonbeams into my skin
tuning into the sky
take me into space tonight
Your love taught me how to trust
wasting paints instead of hours
love is a brutal storm  love is a crowning wave
"You are many dark things, all of them celestial"
"kisses that taste like the first rain, long after the monsoon has gone"
a perverse silence deepens the night
a subdued tinge of glory
"hurt more, kiss longer"
found You without knowing where to look
we start with wine
there’s healing in the suffering
i find hope in how the sea retreats to the horizon
You make my inner self feel elegant
dreams drawn to colour
Your body scents my skin with the perfume of moonlight
You’re a faultless blue sky
autumn leaves are poems floating
love transcends limits
whispers like seas cradling me
Your poems strip my calm
my darkness craves You
a silent sky revels in watching the wind heave
the quiver on my lips is a howl for violence
the moon like Your skin
You’re my reality my only dream
hearts need poems to carry the burden
we belong in the wilderness
the night is all but dark
a bubble of our own
let me silken the wine on Your tongue
let’s spend a night away from our lives
was it my sobs or poise that shocked?
was it the kohl or the gooseflesh that wooed Your brutality?
was it whimpers or giggles  that intoxicated You?
feel the rhapsody evolving
Your words cuff my core
memories wading through heart strings
Your eyes touch me with the eloquence of a hail storm
i dream so we can sleep together
even autumn is full of respite
You want me
i could wander with the moon  to the ends of the earth
a frolicking wind  an open window
"my mind, a blank page  Your darkness, calligraphy"
You leave pleasures wanting
You are my truth  heady and poetic
"be here, forever"
when we’re together  everything is love
forever blowing kisses to the silver sky
life’s too short let’s sin innumerably
the moon subsumes all my desires
You’re a universe of timelessness
welts from Your belt glowing like fireworks
sighs scaling skies
You are mesmerising wanderlust
i lean in to breathe hope
seal my lips with a kiss
fragile dreams of a fireball heart
she’s a story best read after midnight
sprinkling stardust  along the curve of Your shadow
the moon has no side that is constantly dark unlike You
Your mind is a book of spells
a wild canary without a branch to perch on and sing
our love will live through   the apocalypse
the revivals to come
the bliss that lies ahead
to be the dew drop quelling Your thirst
i look more Yours when destroyed
my heart will hold You to Your promises
darkness has parallels with us
an overthinking fiddly thing
she is shades of autumn a beautiful chaos
the ache of emptiness
running into Your arms like falling rain flowing back into the ocean
i love the sky in every colour
eyes lingering on my face as if to pen a sonnet on my mouth
wearing just arousal
kisses that draw blood
"away from You, i’m a dim star in a cold cosmos"
her curves make storms spin
Your memory is a warm season
surviving on fragments of intimacy
"like a burning coal, i fear the wind of Your absence"
this love is life
the rain doesn’t want me to sleep tonight
my heart is Yours to stab or kiss
nights twice as long  need twice as much
what would love be without us?
love overcame lust
oceans revere us
i don’t know how or why we’re not together right now
i am usually thinking back or thinking of
think about me and feel my smile  touch Your lips
a sea of flames  with a passive voice
clinging until after dark
just let me stroke every freckle on Your chest i leave the poetry to You
once i wanted to write a book  now i just can’t get enough of Your voice
my eyes are in love with Your collared neck
Your touch and a sunrise a day is all i want
holding hands is silent poetry
we cannot help sinning
Your absence is a red sunset at the horizon of love
You’re the light beaming around my universe
the year without a summer
dark whispers  by the light of the moon
Your moon blue eyes  my heaven
be my monsoon
nothing to see here - yet
sometimes  a phantom not the moon keeps you awake
dominate my hormones
i remember the moment that changed life forever
"eyes so dim, i looked up at the sky and made the clouds glow"
i’m a gust of wind shackled to the depths
fuck you restlessness
make me not think for a long time
i need a deluge of touch
i am heated dust
pinpricks of silence keep me awake
Your essence is unique
i want to watch You sleeping  and i want us talking softly in the dark
passionate caresses that coloured me in sunsets
kiss me while the sky roars
i’d move mountains of stars to make You stay in my sky
my darkness alone isn’t hot enough to burn the night
it would be lovely to ride on a comet together
a galaxy small enough  to fit in Your hand
wrist so tender and fragrant with an evil eye around it
nothing rhymes with music
words are us
"questioning eyes, fearless spirit"
my heart is incensed by this yearning
aching in the dumps
some evenings strike like a hammer
burning candles and idle hours
living in stagnant blues
wrath of ocean depths in Your silence
eyes that starrify my soul
eyes drawing spirals on my body
i want teeth on curves
a sky where poems were written without seeing
my soul is losing sleep waiting to feel
find my intentions in my words
say the words You haven’t written before
"a girl called autumn fiery, messy, beautiful  and full of surrender"
"thunder, because hell has feelings too"
vulgar names are my sacramental wine
an open bundle of insanity  in Your arms
i want dreams of You to stir my snoozing flesh
we are in every love story ever written
some days i’m a wingless mynah with no song
what am i to do with these empty spaces between my fingers?
hot whispers like wax drippings
i walk through Your darkness  and come back to life
i love You and i don’t fear fate
You walked into my life like a windstorm
fingerprints resembling scars
Your scent   has touched me everywhere
"every moan, a musical note"
You scented my life with bliss
take me where roses grow
rip my senses
Your eyes speak of summer
this love is madness  like the cosmos devouring fire
tweed cape and other femininities
sepia eyes like a thundering sunset
our love is what gods are made of
You are inexorable drunkenness
my evenings are becoming and feeling longer
the only darkness is far away in the sky
homemade cake and a teddy coat  but i’d rather You warm me up
one kiss and i spin  like a hurricane fed by the ocean’s heat
astral eyes chasing the dark
"write me poetry, mark me red"
the art of loving from far away
"away from You, i fear stillness"
Oh i will
Copy/Paste but change what the bunny is holding.   (\_/) ( •_•) / &gt;🍿
only You can salve this burning
i set Your memories free in the quiet rain at night
You’re the love song i hum at dawn
be wild or i’ll die  of unbearable tenderness
the pain of love sweeter than a farewell kiss
wishes bound in kisses
sometimes the moon is oblivious of the darkness
she’s crumbly
"spank the good behaviour, bite the bad"
‘how do i look?’  “You are beautiful!”
there was too much silence around so I opened a bottle of red
caress me like it’s yesterday
i can never distract You from my sadness
"in the deepest yellow, autumn is full of brightness"
i’m a restless flame  come be the wind of passion  and sweep me away
You’re more magical than a full moon
"without You, life would have no horizon"
fleeting kisses beneath cherry blossoms
"when i fade away, plant night blooming jasmine where You can smell me"
i think about You when i’m feeling
"i feel You between my cheeks as i walk i feel You on my jaw as i eat savage lover, You’re a hungry beast"
when You lie  on my back  i know it’s time for silent screams  and hot tears
keep my soul until it smells of You
sass bared to violence
i feel sated as a firefly sparkling in the moonlight
"no hooks on my bra, just to confuse and provoke You"
"You kissed me everywhere, i’m now a bed of flowers"
brown eyes that warm Your skin
Your ripe scent  my tender skin
high tides and wet sand
her heart is a bookcase full of wish lists
elysian moments
kisses that make goodbye less painful
You are the altar and the incense on it
i’d rub rose oil on my neck but You want to sniff my panties
feral curls in my hair provoking Your savagery
the sea wants the horizon all to herself
i’ll be the night lingering by Your pillow
her wetness is sweeter than rose water
i am the tidal wave in Your imagination
my last smile will be Yours
looking up at the stars  feeling Your love inside
You’re the dream i’m living
You’re a heartfelt fever
stinging eyes echoing my ruin
shadows of whispers keep me burning
i feel the depth of Your soul when we hold hands
i’m in love with the love i see in Your eyes
art is the softness in Your words
wreckful fingers feeding on raindrops
we made the fireflies and darkness fall in love
O to be sun-drenched in Your arms
like a flame i linger by Your pillow
moans gliding through You
whimpers making music
i’d come back from paradise to smell You once again
the aroma of ecstasy
a love rooted in subtlety
a quiet elan  in her smile
the sound of Your knuckles cracking makes my heart spiral
i retweet to subtweet
is it Friday yet?
Your poems are my feelings in Your words
You are the presence of everything
a windstorm in white  with the sleeves rolled up
this lingerie is covering nothing
now is the time  for our future
i heat up twice as fast in the rain
refill my mouth with Your breaths
my palms  for Your feet to rest on
i find myself fumbling for You in bed every night
a sensual trail of blushing lilac  from Your caresses on my inner thighs
we’re on the same side of the sun
unusual colours in the sky from our daydreaming
libido in divine chaos
Your love is the seascape on the canvas of my heart
"when kisses turn to bruises, kiss the bruises"
"youthful in passion, mature in her yearning"
her kisses are little poems bursting with heat
a soft heart sensitive to evening musing
our story
the soothing hypnotism of wandering through thoughts of us
clouds shaped like exceptionally dark odes
swim on my back
kisses are the best kind of promises
finding each other  in beginnings that surround us
the musky scent of sultry nights
"i’m a vulnerable forest, crying and dying to be saved"
the stars shine to say i love You
i’m only a poem if You’re the reader
You’re the rhythm of quiet times
sunset eyes that home You in
she’s the narcotic flower blossoming in His dirty mind
she’s made of glorious moments
lips like figs dipped in honey
fetishistic about the sounds we make
eyes too elusive to escape
my universe sleeps best in Yours
"running to You in bare feet, sweetening the air on the way"
"the heart is a river, of memories immersed, and loves drowned"
Your absence has perfumed my world
we all start human  we end up human  human first  human last  we're human  or we're nothing   #poem #adrianmitchell
Your poems make sense of my character
You own the sensuality i’ve always protected
Your soul seized my emptiness
only around You i feel more  and think less
Your writing is an art more powerful than skies and sunsets
Your love flows in mysterious ways
a girl like watercolour  delicate and subtle
Your voice is my therapy
feel me into being
You shape my dreams
everything is still but i don’t feel the quiet
"doused in the glitter of Your memory, i glow inconspicuously"
a heatwave of longing
"in a life without hue, the sparkle in the sky infuriates"
open a new door for me
femininity fighting fragility
still feeling the tremors of overthinking
a love rich in raw
keep me for some time
dreams hurt tonight
instill in me the will to believe in the future
Your each filthy word has its own feel
"You write so dark, my eyes shimmer"
take me to the mountains
sensual thoughts like waves of wildflowers
eyes exuding sunshine
"sleeping apart, dreaming together"
adorn my pain with the art of Your prose
my nights are obscene without love
i miss hiding in Your world
we’re darker together
melancholy makes the rain worthwhile
she’s a bottle of warmth
the chaos of passion the calm of submission
her silences speak of undoing
twilight musings
take my hand and fly let’s celebrate our love
everyone’s sky is different
You write everything i feel
a mesh of memories  to edge off loneliness
wears unmissable pink when she’s blue
our passion is my meditation
the shimmering sky is more than just wanderlust
a heavy silence spoons me as i contemplate Your absence
i’ve taken to daydreaming late at night
kisses unwinding a rich ream of darkness
Your touch and my madness are intimately tied
her smile is forged from sunflowers
love to see the sky shout of power
i want Your scent to permeate my soul
You build a crescendo i acquiesce to darkness
"in every flick of her gaze, a dusting of spice"
elegance heightened with surrender
delusions kissed my skin all night long
the relentless grip of love
she’s elegant even when careless and hungover
she is slow rhapsody
the grey and unforgiving sky reminds me of You
"a torrent of promises, not a drop of relief"
a world covered in possibilities
love and hurt me  with the same ferocity
the mind roamed throughout the day
my soul knows no weakness  for You are within me
You and i loving in the hours of silver
melancholic to the core  but her smile is more colourful than spring
"hug me tight, i want to scrawl my insanity across Your back"
pivoting on loneliness
dive deeper until You hear my heart open
apocalyptic sighs beneath thunderstruck skies
no breath is ever wasted i think about You in each one
Throat
Your absence rattles my spirit
ecstasy born of fear
the rich hues of my lips the turbulent reaction of Your mouth
surging to darkness under Your weight
hands lurching across wrists
You bite harder and growl louder  even though i’m already quiet
feeling rain drops nursle me as i inhale Your scent from memory
Your eyes on me  like sunshine resting on hay
unrest bubbling in my bosom
kiss my lips blue at sunset
belt marks like petunias blooming at the war front
nirvana in the last gasp
i’d be blind without our darkness
soften Your hand through these crescents of night
spent an eerily empty afternoon curling my hair
Absences
"a rockfall of memories inside me, evoking Your taste on my tongue"
i’ll take Your every mood
fill my silences with the deep breathing of love
You’re a rare sense of madness
lust morphing into rain
our lips need conversation
highest admiration for the sky flaunting its vulnerability
the rain is all heart
found You lurking behind my layers
lingering on You like sandalwood
settling into Your dreams
i’d only dance in Your flame
kisses are rich flowers
my mouth will sin with reverence
a whiff of You and other whispered myths
the earth is boozy from all the rain
"love at first sight, lust too"
when tenderness triumphs over tears
Your scent is the pinnacle of my sexual pleasure
You are fresh air in a boundless void
"when the skies are dull grey, i’ll dress for You in blush moonstone and gleaming lapis"
Your love immortalised me in myriad ways
i’ll be the candlelight easing You through the night
skins on pursuit of serenity
my soul is scented with luscious swoops of Your darkness
eyes loving and souls rekindling
Your touch is love with a Parisian heart
perfect emotions in the sky today
found myself in Your peace
i miss the glow from happy tears
keep me snug as the future unfolds
how veraciously You look at me
"bodies enmeshed, scents overlapping, disorienting intimacy"
tongues chiming
Float
Your lip prints  on all the salvaged scraps of my heart
the heart is a narrative of seasons
"history in my eyes, future in Yours"
spoil me wear white
my destiny won’t ever let go of Yours
"in a misshapen world, how perfectly my name rests on Your lips"
Your words know where to touch me
i don’t know what is enough but i want You more than that
the moon rises to see the colours on earth
the rain falls to touch the sea
"Your words, my skin  a floral love affair"
we’re so in love!
finding happiness  starts and ends with You
playing  in private
Your eyes are skylights spilling dawn
Your mouth rarely writes to my skin
take  just a bit more
i want to watch while You love me
she is layers of art
lips like slivers of wild strawberries
my core is steeped in immutable lust
gentle touch and masculine whispers
i hope to beset Your mind like bronze strokes of evening all over the blue sky
Your bare back is my dreamscape
i share the passionate language of surrender with the breaking seawaves
do You find my complications adorable
eyes like a night sky doused in constellations
wear a tuxedo in my dream tonight
"our love is no flame or fragrance, it won’t ever die or fade"
she’s the incense born under a scorching sun
smiles triggering impulses
the addictive scent of earth softened by rain
still glowing like we kissed yesterday
a prayer in her every teardrop
i wear Your poetry to bed every night
hearts illuminated by night
dark whispers in low light
"a sensuous splash of rose all over my skin, when i say Your name"
desiring Your wrath is an instinctual need
feelings arise as if my heart is a bottomless pit
a huddle of dreams  Yours and mine
hear my limbs roar
"riveting journey, fragile future"
lying catlike between Your thighs
the high romance of clouds and mountains
Your darkness is better than the best of all worlds
You’re the distant horizon  i’m a turbulent sea wave
Your love is the birdsong in my still life
look at the amber moon and think about the feel of my neck
the sky is on the cusp of autumn
absence creates deserts
kiss me like the moon warms the night
dark thoughts on my mind and i see colour everywhere
uncaged love is the loudest night noise
i feel restless like the wind in an uncut forest
living life in chapters
our alchemy hums ever so quietly
the interplay of raw and bold
Your poetry is more soothing than a garden landscape
leaning towards a feel of You
i want more of You in the next lifetime
the moon has me tethered tonight
our neverending passion  for the elsewhere
"Your eyes, an intense sapphire sky"
her love is  a deeply crimson  and fiercely thorny  rose
basking in rays of carnal insanity
smiling at You  while the clouds gather
honeycomb eyes and burnished vanilla lips
found freedom outside my comfort zone
"so beautiful in white, You’d think she’s a priestess"
her voice is a smoky flower
my lips are glossy from reading You
wearied skin like a balmy summer evening
imagining Your scent
Your heart is full of trapped sunshine
somehow  i keep becoming  more than i am
my breaths will outrun the storm Your hands bear
she writes to explore herself
our first dance
Your silence is impenetrable
You always find something new in me
sometimes  more is less
maybe the wind is her desires sashaying naked
the colour on my nails is called tra la la
retell my heart  about love
white wine and dark chocolate
the greyness is the sky expressing my mood
my yearning is an undefined abyss
You already knew what i wanted
we create light and darkness together
steaming love and smoky mirrors
pain is her first true love
gag my shyness
"feminine scent, powerful smile"
oppressive emptiness
a poetic cosmos in the pores of Your skin
my heart chokes when You loosen the tie
Your touch shaped my silhouette into a rose
glitter everywhere  from our dark fantasies clashing
sunsets borrow gold from her eyes
a discreet bracelet  of Your palm print
too dirty to shower alone
daunting to think how i would never say or hear some words if we hadn’t met
skin deep candescence  from our souls embracing
delirium dwells in the broadness of Your shoulders
this love is a part of the growing pains
dressed in an excessive ache of longing
study volcanoes to feel what her heart feels
feeding on memories
the storm is a soft imitation of our passion
the ocean is a treatise on our love
don’t leave me on my knees
Discipline
be close enough to calm me when i tremble from pleasure
i’m a sea of chaos You’re the tranquil island
heavy hands like sailing rocks
the way Your hands accessorise my nakedness
i want to enjoy nature with You
all twinkling eyes and skies
my love knows no minimalism
You make my dreams change colour
a soft spot  for old fashioned everything
kohl eyes and barefaced heart
excessive arousal  just in a trace  of Your voice
"just like art, she’s fearless and irreverent"
soft candlelight and unabashed shadows
to hold and to escape
a compelling sense of darkness  always on my mind
my peace lies in the purity of Your presence
a book is not an umbrella
Your absence will scar me
my midnight hair  more enticing than  Your morning coffee
every sunset brings a touch of Your fire
wanton in every still moment
touch my lips and give my heart a treat
blinking hard but i’m prepared  for the unexpected
take me to the wild
"collared in so many of Your poems, i’m mortal no more"
everyone has their special place mine is You
my heart was lost from the start
"filthy words, softly spoken"
i’m powerless like a broken tree when You’re away
keep shining on me
"like sunshine, You are a necessity"
i still look back today and wonder how we happened
the stories the rain tells
Your hands are forever diving for pearls
she’s all quiet brown eyes and flirty eyelashes
solitude is bleak without You
beauty marks in all the places Your mouth escaped to
my femininity between Your teeth
You’re the colour slathered on my darkness
i believe as if i see
the dirty language of shy eyes
"night so dark, like it’s wearing our wildness"
slam till i’m sailing away
a long rippling kiss
hear my soul calling
Your eyes on me like words to a book
presence of everything pales in Your absence
the heart is so instinctive
i am only really kept going by my love of You
exhaust Yourself and empower me
she breaks vibrantly
i don’t think i just fall back
i want to kiss the hunger that smoulders from Your mouth
eyes undress me breaths devour me such subtle allure
my heart belongs to Your spirit
"when night comes calling, sleep is the first to leave"
my fears shake from Your growls
all night  isn’t all i have
the most beautiful words are always so simple
Your ferocious words  touch me indecently
i need bed time with You
to lean at rest  in Your solid arms
"standing before You, like a narcissi with the neck exposed"
the heart struggles to bloom in unheated darkness
i wish You’d peck my lips again
a tight clutch of passion leaving filthy smudges
dreams so intimate with the skies
hope we never take our eyes off this divine madness
my skin longs to burn in the fire of Your whispers
nights sing to her eyes
thoughts to sink thoughts
rasping for You
Your love is grander than my dreams
He has such confidence  in my sensuality
You’re so far  life has turned inarticulate
a mundane existence  in which she shines
You set me apart
pervading Your morning with cocoa bean eyes and a warm-hearted smile
Your touch is the lightning in my empty sky
"""We will meet again in the lake you as water I as lotus blossom  You will carry me I will drink you"""
silken skin scented with desire
our love is made of fleeting moments and everlasting contentment
walking hand in hand with our hearts flung open
the flowers are swaying for You in the evening light
paint my hollowness the colour of twilight
meditating on Your absence
in the stillness of night  i hear Your voice  guiding my hand
let’s go some place together let’s grow some place together
our words a constant thread
You’re on my mind and my heart is humming with warmth
You’re a deeper reality
a melody of weightless breaths  drifting above placid bodies
we touched so long ago
quiet kisses  that become loud gasps as You bite my lip
"no words, just love and the poetry of togetherness"
unspoken words and other persuasions
my happiest smiles are mostly invisible
blue moons on my skin  where Your fingertips lingered
You make me want to live forever
lonely without You but i’ll forgive the stars for shining
when love fires back
the way You hold the way i fold
hold my hand through my suffering
the delicious morning-after ache  of satiety
she hugs like a storm that’s homebound
farewell kisses and fresh hopes
i end the day with my heart beholden to our love
the way You define on my flesh  everything that’s Yours
Your words treat my heart
such sophistication  yet such simplicity
"deep eyes, sleepless and full of dreams"
i can’t remember if we hugged or kissed first
hopelessly lost in Your love
You think me less ordinary than i am
dangerous hands nursing my bruises
every new day a keepsake of our love
the season reversed
rolling all over Your mind front to back
kissing You in every heartbeat
whisper everything but goodbye
the way You touch my heart makes it softer
a cloud of Venus
softly chanting Your name in the dark
i’ve gone so long without revival
i’ll wear darkness  and meet the abyss
no blooming without the dirt
"Your lip print, a crescent of paradise"
smell is the most overwhelming sense  and i miss Yours
to be in Your arms  for all eternity
i will kiss every contour of Your neck
"on my inner thigh, Your wet palm print"
in You i found the best of everything
Your collarbone and other erotic obsessions
amaranthine hugs and crack of bones
our smiles melding  like oceans sparkling
gentle caresses and silent promises permeate the air
multiple strings of rubies around my neck from Your teeth loving my skin
the way You rip gift wrapping  so provocative
drawn to accidental burns
"moving clouds, soaring thoughts"
bless her heart that stays whole
show me how love grows
her mind is a labyrinth of unusual fantasies
a sense of relief palpable in her every breath
our time is now
rapture of a piano in the wind tonight
"sext me, He said"
brown eyes are the fanciest ruin
my sass is feeling edgy
pin my wrists and set me free
"in all Your words, a glimpse  of a dark dream"
"come closer, my lips have stories to tell"
her wild heart is beautiful as a poem written in the aftermath of a storm
i coloured my lips  just to write i love You
this love is a boat that’ll never sink
the stars bring back to mind a special era
her eyes will pull You under the cover of night
seducing You  with my imperfections
we’re the charm of nights
the hands of a Sadist are a thing of beauty
volcanos howling inside
arrest the butterflies making mischief
Your eyes bring me closer to the sea
You’re the stargazer my eyes rain for
she’s a sea angel and she wants the ocean
a kiss like a summer swim
i’ve come to think of blood as beautiful
her eyes are a clear and silent night sky
"my heart, a forgotten island  Your love, a perfect storm"
homegrown wine and organic conversations
i crave the burn from Your love
Your eyes spotlight my darkness
a desire  to feel at ease  with my own body
i am Yours in more ways than one
amid heavy silences i feel You  light as a cloud
Your voice is all-enveloping relief
nothing more suggestive than the way she breaths around Him
a strong hug to shatter the chaos
Your darkness shapes my own
limbs woke up raving
she’s cognac  complex but fun
You want my mind exposed   knowing it’s a war zone
You’re my most desirable near miss
it’s that time of evening
kissing fiercely is how the war began
am i missing You or is the void numbing me right the way through?
i can’t treasure You enough
a better chance of sleep by the tree
frantic strokes  painting a calm sea
ever feel like a thundercloud with no earth to rain on?
i want to just close my eyes and float
her eyes miss no words
the fragility of my wrist  the fury of Your thirst
mind like a gravel beach
my fantasies are at their peak
it simply observes
i can see the moon as i write
pushing through the pain  like an autumn bloom
poems trapped in the space where our breaths collide
she’s doesn’t say much but her eyes are always expressive
You’re a forest of love
i will always submit to Your discipline
the greatest demand You make  is of patience
an insatiable thirst in my heart in Your eyes
help me create illusions
i feel You whispering about my thighs
each carnal craving emerges  in a different way
"if Your words had a face, i would smother it with kisses"
emancipation in Your touch
"everything has changed, You are all that i am familiar with"
Your violence has a sexy voice
be mine the moment is right
the night has her silhouette
You see my filth You see my worth
women who wearties and other silent tornadoes
envious of the tree and soil woven together
remind me how to enjoy rain again
the night is starry but it can’t fill Your absence
moonshine framing lovers’ kiss
we’re no longer two just one
floral-patterned clouds
clad entirely in black  except for my heart
feather soft hands  stripping as they fondle  crushing as they caress
come closer and see how  brown eyes turn black gold
"elevated need, growing pains"
You set off a dream in me 🎵
Your eyes hold all the stars i wish upon
stories that have a happy ending
just the One
brown eyes are exquisitely wrapped desires
my obsession with the overblown moon is sexual
shout out to lovers sharing a bed right now
pink stains in the sky as if all my emotions burst at once
such fulfilment  in collecting Your thoughts
the dark romance  of a crisp white shirt
"i find Your grey so deep, dark and sadist"
the heart is a rising sea
diving into dark thoughts  just before dawn
soft folds spilling madness
"her heart, a lattice  of seasons"
hold me close through our descent into silence
Your words are more expressive than pearls
the lightness of Your eyes the darkness of Your smile
an abyss of raw and naked emotion
moonbeams shooting down my cleavage
"when the going gets tough, i think about the moments i’ve lived beneath a full moon"
she/her
eloquent expressions of devotion in her shy smile
she wants to scream with the pleasure pain brings
promise me tomorrows
with You all the way
the mind refuses to turn
i love our history
she’s like the wind never dull
darkness dims decency
hopes flickering into life
i feel like a canvas without a frame
Your absence is feeling its way through my night
You’re the only healing i need
Your charm seems to keep growing
"such a quiet night, barely any stillness"
hug till i crack or i’ll crack
i always share Your smile even if You don’t see it
how quietly the moonlight strikes
"i crave Your touch because, masochist"
Your deep voice saying my name making my soul float in sensation
You and i  like Montblanc inside moleskine
Your whispers are poems swathed in darkness
tell me more about Yourself  in kisses
wounds are stories
her smile sings in so many languages
feeling Your absence  and being torn apart
wild moonlight and soothing melodies
moods that sustain
kisses soaked with wine
brown eyed girls are dog people
i’ll love You at Your cruelest
lie still and feel the fervor pulsing through me
the arrow of time is moving monstrously slowly
"her eyes, part divination  her heart, part history book"
a songbook of her laughs by His bedside
i’d been loved before  never lovingly crushed
finding release through passion
how high You make me fly how hard You land
You on my mind music everywhere
can’t sparkle without darkness now can i?
my heart is a failing summer
"in every quiet moment, my world turns to You"
raindrops on Your skin and other small treasures
can’t get over how You take a fancy to my imperfections
she is very dark ink
i only like pink when it’s spread across the grey in the evening sky
a rumbling in the cosmos  ahead of Your homecoming
wishful sighs blown by the wind
sunsets make me want to slow dance with You
my face  in Your neck
devouring Your words all over again
eyes imploring sins
a soft morning kiss that won’t let me be lazy
lips like a swirly font kisses become verses
love went out of its way to find us
every new dawn unfolds a sense of Your presence
all ruffled skies and mellifluous seas
September is the real start of the year
sacrifice is happiness
i always feel Your eyes on my back
the night  and quietness  have arrived
plants over flowers
holding Your hand is what i miss most
the only thing we don’t have  is enough time
i’ll always want to get better at loving
trees will flower when we kiss again
Your lust lingers in words indefinitely
"if Friday was a girl, she’d have curls in her hair, frills on her blouse and thrills in her eyes"
garden smells and thoughts of us
paint me wildflowers
i miss the warmth  and scent of contact
the kind of girl that will always send a postcard
i crave arousal and only Your words will do
no one else adores me like You
i want to bathe in beads  of Your sweat
You made life beautiful  then surreal
the sky has cast off the veil of clouds
the sweeter i taste the darker You turn
hunger like percussion
i’m nothing if not Yours
keep me locked in Your thoughts
i’ll be Your signature scent
i’m so close  to Your future
dangerous hands wrapped around  sensual words
Your touch is wild grass that i want to roll in
taking vows in sleep
You’re all i need from the dark
Your pure heart  adorned with my selfless love
Muse
Your love is a rough diamond
wayward mind  surrounded by stars
You touched   every bit of my life
feeling loved and alive
my desires  tangled in Your darkness
filling the empty spaces in bed with heavy oud
Your essence is eternal
Your every urge is sacred to me
the ink in my veins won’t dry up until the night sky is dark again
the moon is bright and full from all the sins i confessed
"my good deed of the day, total immersion in the night sky"
such an excessive moon am i the saint or is she the sinner?
the full moon is its own prayer service
private indulgences
awoken by a sprinkling of moonlight
keeping Your heart safe  inside the black bow on my midriff
her moans are hymns
paint me in Your reading room
the incense burning inside me will hold You under a spell
You’re invaluable as a prayer at sunset
"walk Your hand to the waves in my hair, and let it run riot"
"a rustle in the night air, as if You pulled me closer"
You’re the thought behind every blush
she’s mostly made of beaten worries
calm and chaos both drive me to You
eager to the point of eccentric
involuntary rush of sultry thoughts
i find escapism in the rawness of Your eyes
stars over sleep
will covet the night sky until i’m lunar dust
the way her eyes embrace autumn
"a subtle tautness in my curves, just from imagining Your touch"
Your darkness echoes the colour of paradise
a little fire in the sky  lights up her whole face
demure brown eyes  swallowed up by dark cravings
a universe of timeless memories
we’re united by a passion for the full moon
feisty pink silhouettes in the evening sky
the moon is just as unmissable as You
the sunset is all about Your warmth
come make my decisions
the pain You give fills me with love
eyes become lips  lips become claws
i want to relive the wonders of the past
a soft heart  rich and swollen  with overgrown passion
summer meant little  without You
getting the best of midnight
i can feel the brightness above the clouds
sexual relief is buried treasure
wetness that will stoke fire
she’s a constant revelation
heart-quickening thoughts  lighting fires inside
the memory of Your scent and other burdens that last
i carved my devotion out of rock
"my sensitive soul, Your pervasive absence"
"the girl is lava, she glows bright and collapses hard"
softening Your darkness  with tears
torn apart by punishing caresses
an awning of soft kisses  and Your arms warming my blood
yearning for madness
dawn as an art form
one thought possesses me
sooty chasms for eyes
my skin shivers in despair
i skip out on sleep because it’s hard to wake alone
the wind is in full song tonight
Your breathing dictates my toil
"love intimately, my soul is a deeper sea"
the fear and the fetish is primal
"feel the raindrops, linger until the downpour"
"her every smile is submissive, even the coy ones"
override my fears
i want to live in a forest that only echoes Your voice
i’ll forsake sunshine for Your darkness
she is insatiable torrent
You’re the light i need to explore new horizons
"in a fleeting glance, the timelessness of sunsets"
falling apart is the best sort of joy
"heavy sleep, glorious dreams"
"pain humiliates, pain pleases"
sunrays tethered to trees
"a delicate spot, achy and wild"
"You’re a calm ocean, deep and intimidating"
You’re an open fire i’m the decadent air all around
Your words are stranglers
unzip and guide me home
burning limitlessly
a journey of the senses
my trembling lips will provoke Your appetite
You and i  a room  and a weighty bed
"sin shimmering in dark eyes, leading You on"
i feel more agonised than the storm outside
emerge into my darkness tonight
a rose for a heart
bring me You from faraway lands
a breathtaking arrangement of scars
the delectable mess of togetherness
Your absence continues to rage
a pure soul is indifferent to pleasure or pain
just let my nakedness hook into Your flesh
grey skies love me
"i heave out darkness, for You to drink"
we kiss hard and breathe loud
splashing verses at one another
my reality is at Your mercy
a million stars out to rob me of sleep
You are fuel
i miss the heat of Your throaty roar
i hang on to Your voice as i struggle
You make sure i feel nothing until i see nothing
silver threads of eternal love  holding her cerise heart together
writers say we ought to fuck
"Your breaths on me, like prayers echoing down my soul"
the virtue of being unconventional
love is the only god i know
You’re the most wonderful dream worth chasing
my cheeks wet with tears  and the taste of ground pearls  all over Your tongue
"sink slow, i want to feel it all"
He fell in love with a desert
my tears  as clear as Your intentions
she’s an open-minded mess
darkness doesn’t have warmth without You
brown eyes forever in search  of an elegant white crescent  in the evening sky
bruises like blessings hovering all over me
i feel hope when i think about You
the graceful firefight of our eyes
choked by an empty vastness
"a hard kiss, a quick soak"
dusk and night fall so does my shame
"deep dark night, howling big moon"
some days You’re the sun on my back  some days You’re the storm against my chest
the sun did not know how beautiful its light was until darkness started shining
i imagine Your fury  and i tingle
soon after dark  the storm of need hits
divination by darkness
soak in my lust
let Your tongue follow my fire
the night in her will put You in a trance
Your excessive torment  my brutal endurance
You’re the inferno that surrounds the horizon
i revere Your wild
You’re sublime as a rising moon
i feel overdressed in this twilight
infinite kisses to make up for the ones i lost
she’s a heat wave
You make my silences deep and meaningful
You got a grip on my soul
the gift of togetherness
"the more You mess me, the better i look"
Your touch connects me to the universe
the abundant intimacy  between us
soft petals to remedy Your toughness
every quiet moment evokes Your scent
dreamed of walking through the sea to You
Your promises are a pleasure to hold
a violent surge in my tear ducts
insatiable carnal hunger
the wind and rain are always tangling up
envious of the moonlight on Your lips
her imperfections are intoxicating
i want to breathe the fragrant smoke of Your midsummer skin
kisses that nurture petals from a bud
halted conversations and burgeoning kisses
"a roaring tiger, all sunburnt and irresistible"
life with You would be like living with art
she’s a fount of whimsy
anything You discard  is sacred to me
counting breaths until a new reality
hold me and i won’t care what the future holds
a language that speaks to You alone
flashes of darkness in crystal blue eyes
break me until You’re delighted with the pieces
let’s tame the unexplored together
my pent-up moans could stretch to the horizon
"the wind is subtle, the silence unashamedly loud"
You have the perfect me
"scribbling my name onto Yours, hoping our destinies unite"
a savage mouth layering my bare thighs with blossoms
You fill me with feelings that stop me looking back
i’m so full of passion but You tire me too quick
vanilla thoughts playing with extremes
fingerprints  all over the walls
"fingers like grass stems, writing You the wildest love poems"
do You love me for my poise or my chaos?
a photobook of fantasies
write me a poem for every night we sleep apart
words are home to me  and You’re the heart of that home
the balance of senses and play of breaths
i’ll wait for You even when the blue begins to fade from the sky
just devour me once again
as seductive as she is shy
the heart mends itself
"swathed in hugs, but it’s just the wind"
picturesque ruin
my fav indoor sport
thinking of You in reverent silence
You’re the fiercest storm i’ve survived
listen to the rushing wind and feel me closer
"when i’m with You, the final moments before the sunset are happy ones"
mellow lovemaking and a soundtrack of thunder
thoughts of You on every speck of my mind
a hurricane of reminiscences
i want to kiss the starscape of freckles on Your chest
i want sex that knows nothing of gentleness
You are Eden
warmth rolling off sunrays and settling on her skin
a cool breeze snaps her sullen thoughts
sit beside me  somewhere high in a treetop
You and i  kissing all the way to the horizon
never see beyond You
i always knew You would fall for me
shadows licking walls
every gentle smile feels like a battle
fuck this longing is relentless
come closer and i’ll reveal the oceans in my soul
we don’t wait for sunrise we start our own fire
my abyss matches the colour of Your eyes
lighting incense and humming a love song
i feel You touching me through the blackness of night
smiling in contemplation of our first kiss
lying in bed savouring Your words
You say so much by choosing the right words
Your maybes torture me
i dream of You after not sleeping a whole night
a burst of darkness  blessing our love
pour over me  like the mountain feeds a river
torture is sex
let’s tangle until dawn
restless like the pelting rain
the way our senses scatter into the depths of depravity
to see You  as the sun rises
touch is vital
You’re a whole different slice of love
breaths lost to a quiet passion
lonely and insolent  like a flower growing in a churchyard
a banquet of nectar  just for You
desires doused in dusk
with the wind comes a whiff
allow my heart stillness
the sky tonight is the colour of better times
You have the key to my heat
battling silent storms
an open fire when she’s wanton
shining dark eyes like a galaxy torn apart
she rains a lot
fighting with warmth and respect
the noise of dilemma
a beautiful little catastrophe
perhaps the ocean was born of a need too
let’s return to the wild
the evocative sound of rain and my Beloved in the moonlight
words give me wings
dreams like You last forever
lashings of absinthe in her voice
the craving is born of the soul and will satiate itself with soul
i can resist sin but not You
i think about You like a butterfly seeks the summer sun
black leather boots   up to the thigh
You are bliss upon bliss
i want to creep back into those blue sky eyes
the more You love the more i dare
the hammering rain reminds me of lovers holding hands
poignantly choking
the transition from passion to art
dabs of red to cover the blue
i love Your urgency
she’s more audacious than a midnight sky
nothing colder than an empty bed
imagine a butterfly who has lost all colour and You’ll know how i feel being alone
"so rosy, this dark side  of my life"
a massive thirst is holding me together
love me like we lost nothing
"let the season reverse, i’ll bring You a taste of summer"
lusty rose turned moody
"eyes a deeply hued gold mine, that only You can pervade"
the art of perishment
she’s the quiet rain that never stops falling
her intensity lies in her simplicity
i’m lying draped in moonlight that’s showing off my restlessness beautifully
"her willing eyes, morsels of soft chocolate"
You’re the moon i’m the light You cast
Your darkness is unlike any other love i’ve known
i crave the tension between tenderness and savagery
the soul speaks for itself
do You miss my sharp edges?
You’re the roaring fire  i’m the night unfolding
You gave me what i never expected to find
You hold me and i’m home
i’d give myself away like the sea
my heart wears Your smile
smiles that pull
we both feel just as deeply
she’s a fearfighter
pools of moonlight in pale blue eyes
the rhythm of perverse diversions
"perfect, even in her fragility"
being small doesn’t make a wish trivial
the book on Your chest was not even on Your reading list once
my heart is set on Yours
forever on the threshold
does the wildflower stop to think about the butterfly?
we’re so different  but we belong together
wrapped my hair around air until it curved into Your initials
a handful of pastel stains in a grey sky
are You reading my eyes or looking at art?
in the void of her eyes  lies a story
heady memories and a lingering tenderness
"more curvaceous, more human"
reliving it all
Your absence loves me enough to stay
Your final warning is caramel edged thunder
excitable dark eyes
a whiff of Your skin hangs in the air
leaving my soul to Your magic
my scent will darken Your desire
commanding hands
she’s a flower rarely in bloom
pull me closer in the open
You’re the dark streak on my wings
flower cuttings rolling beneath a leafy tree
desirous sighs in silent flight
hearts kissing wildly
far more often loved than made love to
i’m the turtle dove You’re the barbed wire
i have so many new fears for You to discover
gasping for breath  on all fours
a wardrobe of all the vulgar names You call me
who says brown eyes don’t have to try hard?
gracefully twerking
and one day lust became love   #123words
kiss my eyes  if You’re craving the taste of chocolate
fusing silence with dark thoughts
quiet evenings and shrunken spirits
scatter Your furies on me
Your love allows me the liberty to think without concern for anything
i don’t feel dressed without Your eyes on me i don’t feel dressed with Your eyes on me
i long for an echo
the taste of fresh water meeting the sea
hundreds of wishes  under the flush on my skin
"warm my throat, inside and out"
i would hold on to the pain if i knew i wouldn’t feel anything for so long
"be mine, be naked"
meshing words and sex
i want to kiss the rhythm beneath that heavy white linen
her slender ankles could slice your heart
"my thighs, they tremble and they throb,  my heart, it flutters and it pounds  just from anticipation"
what lies on top of the clouds that they feel so heavy?
bare breasts  glistening with  moonlight
fix your mind on her  not just your gaze
spirit seen through poetry
words echoing heartbeats
stretch my sensuality to fill Your poems
smiling at You in between mouthfuls
how many more lonely sunsets?
wander a little  until You’re lying beside me
"all white kind of day, all dark kind of mood"
smiling joyfully under a sunless sky
i want Your musk in my blood so i don’t cry when i bleed
seducing You with my love of darkness
"breathe in the night air, meet my longing"
say You want me in that voice bearing a whip
she’s a free verse poem
will Your hunger graze my bones?
give me Your scent back
i’d worship a storm if it brought me You
she’s a gulf of silence
i miss ritual kissing parts of You
i’ll grip onto You as we drift along in the ocean
You make me believe in an other world
love me to a glorious ruin
"You said sundress, i heard under arrest"
the butterflies inside me will settle once You’ve unzipped
the tireless ache of love
it feels worse  than pointless  to smile  yet i do
thank you for Your fierceness and Your openness
shades of grey matter
the power of a pencil skirt
when You’re missing me look east
i want a garden of Your smiles
sweaty chest and tan lines around waist
soft kisses in the rose garden
Your dangerous hands  my low back dress
hair as long as the night
"her jaded eyes, a muddy brown"
the way soft is committed to the wild
no one knew me until You
"it’s world lion day, where art thou"
fuck my summer florals if we can’t spend a day together in the park
obscenities in the sheets
You are to me  all of what lies between  the heavens and the earth
strip my mind
"sometimes a mermaid, sometimes a kitten"
You say goodbye then pull me back by the hair
tell me again how i was found in Your story like a bookmark and everything simply stopped
could we swim together in Your bath?
every sensation is that of surrender
a perfect world in the depths of love
looking to meet the edge
i’m a fan of Your everything
"in Your darkness, i found everything i was looking for"
Your hands on me a quest for inner peace
how You feel is important to me
been longer since You undressed me than i opened a handwritten letter
my decency is getting messier
"all i want to know is, how soon?"
she’s all sun-kissed complexion and natural curls
"no fire, just a lot of smoke"
the heat needs crushing
"Venerate   “Sometimes I venerate love, Sometimes it venerates me.” #Rumi"
"in her first moan, the softness of a dandelion"
"i bear flesh, no soul  when separated"
"my tongue, Your skin a flow of eloquence"
You are a feeling  beyond sense
You’re the keeper of my darkness
i look redder than i feel
being proved wrong is sexy af
write a family story about us
so exhausted i can hardly
my appetite is higher than a morning kiss
everything feels unnatural without You
You’re maddeningly out of reach
to float in Your arms like a swan in the sea
the sunsets brown eyes paint
love what we do in dreams
sometimes love is found in unspoken words
it’s not just the moon that burns in the dark
"don’t pluck flowers for her, it’ll make her sad when they stop living"
tears of joy running under the stars
wild meadows in her smudged face
"i’ll be Your canvas, i’ll be Your wall art"
fingertips like raindrops  scattering me in flux
pleading whimpers like a waterfall at sunset
i like when You’re a cuddling lion
"elusive like a spider, Your absence traps me in its web"
my eyes are shut and the view is of hills
i love to find You in everything
wish our lips could pair for life
"closer we come, darker we become"
i want to touch Your writing desk
i don’t think i could ever give up dreaming about doing things with You
every sleepless night  has a story
the opulent silk of our passion
i’ll pout if You’ll bite it
"if teardrops could blur calendar days, it would be time for us to meet"
Your salty sweat all over my caramel skin
she smells of the air after desert rain
love of sin and her eyes
sumptuous moon
a need so deep it's untouched
You make everything shine
all white walls and dark floor
coffee fuelled tongues meeting on cross street
be the golden dawn dispersing over me
want a kiss longer than my life span
take me when the mood takes You
"straight up, no ice"
teeth clawing for sweetness
i know You love how i hate some of the things You love
"her eyes, so charismatic, so daunting"
is darkness or the moon centre stage?
Your eyes are blues of neptune
every love tastes like the first fruit
poets are miracles
i’m never done watching the sky
go dark
lustful voice resembling rough wool
separation is the stone in my lungs
a heavily heated soul sighs like the earth is on fire
You look at me like You’re stargazing
parts of me are silkier than Your necktie
maybe there are calmer nights on another planet
Roots
my mind is sizzling with fantasies
"a sea of poetry, waves of pleasure"
Your words make me dream
tempest in Your gentlest touch
soft lips bitten wine red
"quiet night, graphic shadows"
love that feels like the cosmos
soft nipples twisted until they harden into clay flowers
Your poems are cherry blossoms flowering
kiss me before i kiss You again
dark angel turned dreamy mermaid
her smile is a treasure she keeps buried
she reminds Him of a peaceful lake at the foot of a mountain
feeling greyer as the night draws in
what use is my beauty if You won’t use me?
"beautiful in her restlessness, perfect in her fragility"
a hug like an ocean tide
hair like a waterfall of peonies
You’re my wishing tree
countless emerging suns in the eyes of lovers
she’s an ocean of shyness
a rainbow of tulips
a musical garden of feelings
thoughts of a moonlit shore convulsing beneath a wild stallion
"like a daffodil at the window, always seeking the sun, living forevers in finite moments"
twilight romance at the water’s edge
my day is only ever complete when You kiss me goodnight
dreams and hearts  one inside the other
"our intimacy, my deepest truth"
hopes made of rock
oneiric
the heart is exhausted from keeping still
caramel sunset and honey kisses
i want to inhale You again and again
You’re my adventure of a lifetime
my lip print  under Your shirt sleeve
we’re islands too far apart
Your eyes are a globe of hunger
lost opportunities and undiscovered books
a drowsy dawn and the tasteful scent of prey
button down so i may play around
steal life from my mouth
to breathe without feeling intoxicated is torment
indelicate conversations on a curvy sofa
Your silence echoes that of the moon
love and pain living together in the realms of art
looking back to feel better
a cascade of passionate breaths
my true happiness lies in Your darkness
Your aura softens me
waiting for You wearing nothing but shades of blush
my body can never guess what You want
"a sky so slick, pink clouds so remarkably powerful"
being on Your mind keeps me beautiful
meditation on the forest floor
sext
i don’t want to play the waiting game
severely sunkissed skin and a warm glow of summer in her smile
devoted to transcendent sunsets and darkness
reach unto my soul and tell me what lies beyond
my sweetness will temper Your rage
my lips are gathering dust #SeduceMeIn5Words
Your endless imagination
i do as Your eyes say
will You love me even if my haiku is all wrong?
You and i feel what many fiction writers have tried and failed to express
her eyes are brown and she smells like white roses
float on me
"tell me what You collect, apart from all of my skipped heartbeats"
darkness doesn’t disown
i’m a chimera authored by Your eyes
the wind is singing about places it’s been
darkness hides everything that’s special about her
fleshy bottom in a cosy lap
read my mind leave nothing out
feed me the tonic of Your soul
love is how the rock holds rain
"poetic eyes making rhythmic, intimate movements"
blazing hearts oblivious to the rain
twinkling skies and glittering shores
feel me in the leaf turning gold
my fiery energies need finishing
"Your hands beneath my summer dress, i long to feel the pandemonium"
happiness on loop
heated kisses make everything else  irresistible
moonshine and restlessness clashing in my bed
she and the stars are playmates
i’m a fragment of Your abyss
something to hold onto
i’m lucky You have a thing for stones
show me love in unpredictable ways
the liberating power in just one happy thought
“There is no harm in dawn”
dreaming of brighter moments
i believe in humans more than customs
the blood lines on my hand spell Your name
always thinking about where i want to inhale and touch You first
penetrative growls and silken moans
do words or silences  change lives?
dreaming about places we could go to
my lust is not containable
"urges, sudden and irresistible"
haven
English garden
dark ladies i mean day lilies
decaying heart
remember me
peacekeeper
memento
roar over my cries
saturate me with darkness
swaying silver moonbeams  slowing the night
"in her smile, the grace of pressed flowers"
"poetic moon, damp earth"
no shape more seductive than that of the moon tonight
for my many words  Your one touch
suffering seduces soul
impatient to feel You
an infinity of golden silence  between us
You created magic from my chaos
"heart set on the forest floor, my bosom draped with leaves"
"the sky, so blue, so quiet  reminds me of You"
"“You’re unforgettable”, He said"
the feel of Your words  is never lost
Your hand is a healing stone that i want in my hand to feel alive
hungry like an arctic fox
do You miss the feel of my skirts and dresses?
why not overlook the sadness in her shining and sharp eyes made from cuts of crystal?
idyllic kisses on the footbridge our silhouettes floating in the river
the night is warm but elusive
suffering is her identity
fluctuating between nothing and You
i’d go to uncomfortable heights just to be with You
we’re going to be together  one day   say yes say when
"hand in hand, we follow the moon"
weightlift my heart
You are the truth i once dreamed
fuck history  let’s make future
Your love cleanses the mess
her smiling freckled face is more beautiful than a poppy field sunrise
more stories than cigarette ends in her life
"in Your darkness, the brilliance of diamonds"
joy in our wake
bold black echoes slowly choking me
"dreamed of beard burns on my face, woke up feeling beautiful"
fly with me
Your decisions never crease
flowing kisses and autumnal touches
"i’m in love with a writer, there are bruises like ink blots all over my skin"
i let go and nothing has felt better
my fingertip wants to orbit the freckles on Your chest
my sunset eyes all over the sea of Your poetry
"harder You get, more i melt"
the clouds take up a lot of space between the silver linings
my wrists are home to Your fury
my eyes miss our secret language
"when it rains, the tears disappear"
she’s a flower with ragged edges
You lit up a forgotten corner in my heart
darkness fuels my soul
You deny me much too responsibly
Your touch from satin smooth to insistent
lips like wine red but unopened
a tide of dirty thoughts
my dreams of You carry a sillage
now be mine all winter
"if i could, i’d fill the gaps within the inked areas with more words about our love"
my body wants the striking dark patches of Your mind
so aroused by the way You use a finger as a paper knife
Your mind is an open country
still and silent  i muse on You
You’re everything  that i am missing
an ache heavier than Your fist
the sky and the sea just never want to sleep
the moon longs for the night
my thoughts inevitably turn to the life we always dream about
sensitive clit  trembling with life
pour more darkness tonight
my tears rarely shy away around You
i want familiar hands taking me to new extremes
i’ll follow Your dreams
i love loose  teas
it’ll take You seconds to know how hungry i’ve been for months
i rise early to watch You sleep
scented with roses but she’s no angel
feeling criminally masochistic
Madame Bovary
the calm is deadly but that’s the beauty of it
"kisses on Your chest, like a bunch of red roses touching Your heart"
our kisses are stories that start with a storm
the stars are my desires screaming
brown eyes nest the most dreams
we go together like the sheer cotton and coarse linen of my summer dress
lips hurrying down Your chest
songbirds in the wind  or is it just You on my mind?
dressed in bruises looking like mistletoe berries
a forest in the heart of her deep eyes
my fears
Your rhythm fills my quiet time
"deeper the darkness, calmer i feel"
waves constantly cheering the falling sun
Your poems are darlings
Your eyes are the colour of depravity
lost hearts are tough books to find
so much more darkness remains  to be seen
"after every bite, a soft kiss"
all day in the library all night in the treehouse  she’s a wild thing
i want to be the moonlight that goes to bed with You every night
would You still gaze at me on the edge of the abyss?
"longer i wait, closer You feel"
withering without falling off
need Your scent while You’re away
"without You, the rain tastes like water"
shake me at dawn with lips running over me
no stillness once the surface breaks
roses by air mail
sparkling mirages in sandstorm eyes
"when suffering fills my eyes, Your name echoes on my lips"
a single dream pierces the consciousness
“high as a kite on mantras”
in love with the way You dominate conversation
desires breaking into wildness
i have Your bites to thank for my thick underlip
Your darkness adorns my womanhood
i want the agony of thrusts
petals and dew in a tangle
saving sparks  for another night
she’s a neverending evolution
the beauty of crumbling limits
i’m darker than You are ferocious
You are the bliss beyond hope
You dwell in every happy feeling
i glow on the dark side of Your passion
where do i smell the best?
where do i feel warmest?
take me out of my universe
"the sky has feelings, and they’re all pouring down my window"
all dull knives are dangerous
the moon is crimson from anticipation
the longest my mind has stayed anywhere is on You
You look into my eyes like a starved chocoholic
i want lip bites and backslaps
her eyes have the softness of Pocahontas
this love is everything  i had hoped
an avalanche of nostalgia
Your hug crushes me as i breathe a silent plea to be broken
"her heart is a paper moon, make a soft landing"
my lip colour  all over Your tongue
You could find poetry watching her undress
hearts coming together to study love
hurts so good when Your hands summon my demons
flames in Your eyes  from reading my lips
the urge to plant kisses  and make Your thirst grow
i like some of my words and i love all of Yours
"You and i, we don’t need a map"
lust is a beast that never burns out
feel me dancing softly across Your mind
“algebraic simplicity”
marshmallow lips
her heart is a room full of bookcases
"a whisper of hopes, an echo of heartbeats"
Your eyes thunder
i want to romance the seascape of Your eyes
my lips miss touching the tree rings on Your neck
Your universe in my depths
thinking about the seawave rolling onto the shore over and over again
with You i’d cross a lake in darkness
Your dangerous hands write such sensual poetry
she’s all about bare knees and cherry toes
sinfulness as an art form
our truth is dirty and beautiful
she blushes like white flowers
write me into the heart of Your story
our cravings love each other
i want Your poetry written all over my womb
wrap Your sadism around my throat
give me lifetimes to make up for lost time
Your absence is feeding on my sleep
a creeping vine of need around my limbs
Your wild can tame my wilderness
"with You, the love and the danger is always real"
life on a dream’s edge
bring Your absence or me to an end
deep horizons in cloudless blue eyes
our eyes love to indulge in dirty talk
a dress with a deep neck and my head tilted right back
beads
a quiet fortress in the day a sonorous sea at night she’s always pretty
a psychic hangover
slow-burning stars in her reticent eyes
aching souls and delicate smiles
feel me in the evening breeze when You run into the sea at sunset
she’s a discreetly smiling storm with undone hair
"only with You, i prefer conversation to music"
love grows the more i feel You
she’s a poem for every season
nothing more seductive than a primal vibe
been mildly hungover ever since we met
i’ll bring my sensual darkness to Your stiff night
a forest canopy of wild thoughts
unsaid words like a bouquet without a vase
so many poems hidden in the trees
it’s going to rain kisses this autumn
a slice of forest in the way her moans resound
"the sky feels higher, better close my eyes before You feel distant"
feel my aching heart snapping in the night air
starved flesh rampant with restlessness
an evening of few words
i love You more than all the words in all the books
the stars will write our story in the sky
Your touch is a neverending sunset
You’re always a heartbeat away
it’s sexy how You don’t miss anything
You’re a warrior  i’m a worshipper
surrounded by a cascade of sunrays
rainfall on the ocean is what passion means to me
strip away the complications
Your growl darkens my fears
"You’re the author, i’m the language"
read me something from Your mind
i get my allure from the wilds
"dark mind, gem-coloured heart"
a flood of life
You and i and tempest against trees
take my hand
"we’d lie together in the meadow, and i’d skim vagrant petals off Your warm chest with my tongue"
impatient to touch
just turned over on my back
i’d willingly feel all your pain for you; it’s the smallest difference i can make as someone who loves you
ethereally delicate hopes  filling the horizon at dawn
Your charm is original
i see my exoticism in all Your poems
deeply private musings beneath a bustling night sky
unleash my yin
beard bites  where my thighs parted
Your hands left a trail of sparks
"i’d stay put for hours, just to watch You observing the sky and beyond"
her love notes are floral warfare on paper
the first thing i’ll show You is my vulnerability
i don’t want fantasy i want You
throaty whispers kissing a poetic neck
"You are the hue in my blood, without You i collapse into whiteness"
a humming firework in a strapless peach dress
thoughts of You sweep through my being like wildfire
my lips and Your eyes chiming
she has all the virtues You can conceive
need Your voice while You’re away
just a lilac cotton robe and long brown hair
devour my defences
stretch my imagination and tendons too
the beginnings  of faith
a spontaneous kiss  then a torrent
i deserve infinite inhalations of You
she’s a beautiful stone that only shines when burned out from love
i was the first to believe in our love
a myriad of colours  where You touched my heart
You’re so close in my dreams seldom in the day
she’s a slave to a merciful giver
a sensitive Man with manly hands
flowing through Your mind  like a river in paradise
smouldering hearts and their journeys by night
a night-long recitation of breaths
a sweet-smelling butterfly when i’m thinking about You; a little lioness when i need You
"happy tears in her eyes, like a downpour in a desert"
one dream in both our eyes
find my essence in the moonlight
from the first shared breath i was in love
You’re on my mind and i’m elegantly still
bite and pluck citruses from my skin
You’re the vandal You’re the witness
the still night welcomes a restless heart with open arms
our memories  powerful as an avalanche  of flowers
animated eyes anticipating touch
Your sophistication turns me on
You love my eyes  my eyes love Your words
Your voice gives meaning to my name
sensual sandalwood on my neck on my wrists  in my cleavage
"once You’ve said how much You love me, i know You’re ready to leave"
You made my fingers sin and my eyes shy
silences bearing lyrics
keeps / art as a way of life / amazing / blood / savoury sweet salty / ones who hold the words / roses / raw and riveting / spy in the house of love / a quiet confidence / ❤️ / sunsets and dreams  ~ some of the lists i’m on  here’s some yogurt sorbet with rhubarb granita as a TY!
Your soul is my life force
You hushed a silent volcano
parallel universe seen in sleep
"no worship is undue, no devotion excessive"
thoughts falling hard into the dirt
"a spanked bottom resting on heels, i pour You more wine"
"Your darkness lingers, wish Your scent would too"
"wear my hair like primroses on Your cuff, spend the evening lost in reverie"
"no matter what language the music plays in, it’s always You i imagine dancing with"
"souls in love, passionate for rain"
eyes enlivening sunset
my face in Your hands but You only look into my eyes
"a nature trail to Your heart, that i walked blindfolded, without a rest stop"
want Your soft dirty-minded hands on me
feel me in the saffron glow of dawn
summer is a girl  in a yellow as fire sundress
wildflowers envy her
she’s a book needing volumes of care
"dancing at dusk, our smiles swirling"
a raindrop that the tree won’t let fall
the euphoria of touching books
the eroticism of neck kisses
i miss evenings impregnated with pheromones
i’m a hollow flower without Your warmth
is my smile or my skin  warmer?
"tonight’s moon, a labour of love"
writing Your name with blades of grass
a dirty girl sleeping on the forest floor beneath a canopy of filthy whispers
"my scent in the flowerbed,  my eyes the colour of mud all around; no wonder You love tending the garden so much"
sometimes i envy each leaf of every tree that gets to breathe the air You expel
"in her eyes, the allure of a dense sunset"
hand-dyed love notes everywhere on her skin
always craving a last sighting
autograph my collarbone in tattoo ink
You’re the intricate lattice that makes my soul beautiful
my heart is flammable and Your memory is the flash point
a long summer afternoon spent under a cloudless blue sky illuminated by colourful kites
"write for me, feed my passion to read"
desires heavy as thunderclouds
lower waist embraces
come let’s watch the planet parade together tonight
quiet eyes struggling to go unseen
contemplating expressive possibilities
a short story
You know me beyond me
lying together brings us closer  to nirvana
kisses that feel like rebirth
a soft spot  for every crease of Your belt  to kiss my skin
"on her lips, the hue of love"
can’t find poetry away from You anymore
i want to bathe in every layer of the ocean inside You
"pouring my love into the night sky, hoping You smell roses in the darkness"
dimming in my core from missing You
promises richer than the sun
soul-darkening caresses
Your every whim my every wish fulfilled
we fit perfectly
me: You: look at me
feel me leaning in
You’re sexy af in monochrome
the dichotomy attracts
You turned my heart into a hummingbird
feels lonely to wake with the birds
a blushing dawn tucked away in the trees
mouths caught in a firefight
hands full of wilderness experiences
nightingales vibrate through her heart walls
kissing You is a healing ritual
eyes alive with dreams
music at bedtime kind of evening
hold me like You’re smashing pearls
pull me in own Your art
a love that crowns the soul
You and i  sharing life over a teapot
viscerally vivid illusions
always buzzing inside
You’re more special than all our summers put together
You touch me through the stillness
hunger in Your soul a rough ocean in Your eyes
embrace who i am
my love is a sea without boundaries
thinking about the way Your eyes dig into my lips as i speak
she blushes like orange cosmos
"on days i find it hard to express my love, You’ll hear me dignifying the sun for being worth a million earths"
a rainstorm of longing
"she’s beautiful, like an elegiac poem"
"i’m bruised in so many places, if i showed, You’d fall in love with me all over again"
"my darkness is amaranth, it never fades"
Your voice tunes out everything else
"moments spent with You are like fresh-cut flowers, beautiful but ephemeral"
"in another world, every evening You’d pin a tiara of stardust over my dark hair"
thoughts that bind
life seems more fleeting than the last days of summer
"lives matter, resting souls too"
open hearts matter
silver linings matter
my curves are thinking about Your idle hands
"kiss me, i miss the taste of ocean water"
new week unlocked
bees matter  but some plants flower at night
found love in the unusual colours of the sky
brown eyes matter
"when the sea and ocean finally meet, one defines the other"
i love You for so many different reasons
You’re all my passions
just the way You hold me  makes all the difference
my soul will always choose silence over music
pain or paradise  a pleasant dilemma
bruises like golden lilies kissing my neck
my eyes are brown meteors passing through Your indigo blue sky
"forgive me if i forget the words, but i’ll always remember what they meant to me"
a kiss like a storm at the ocean’s edge
a kaleidoscope of dark thoughts
dark country roads on my mind
her heart is a sleeping island
step back in time with me and promise me fair tomorrows
there’s no easing into the downpour without You
"when we walk together, even flowers can’t distract me"
make every kiss endless
some days are enough; on other days i want to wake up to a changed life
do You feel one day i might cease to be desired?
sated souls and light hearts
she’s sensual as sea air
"sip the tears, kiss my eyes"
the subtle play of smiles and tears
living in the certainty of being loved
i could be Your pillow mist
the poetry of evening
they’re all asking why i radiate
reach deeper  until my every fibre  becomes Your name
i feel You in every soft echo that scents the dawn
"i’ll be a prey, i’ll be a friend"
life’s a bookshelf full of unfinished stories
thinking about that razor wire tongue behind Your merciful smile
some days i can’t tell dreams from reality; is this what being blessed means?
hearts singing at sunset
she’s a soft braintwister
i would tongue every freckle
"animal bodies, celestial love"
tidal tranquility
paint me while the music plays
found treasure in the course of my wandering
how we shape moments into memories
conversations that begin at the bar
soporific poetry
"You and i, we’re all we think about"
You make me believe in someday
she is dark ink craving ether
obsessed with giving
moonlit feelings on the wind
You’re the dream surrounding my sleep
the evening is rudely quiet
the nothingness around my limbs is heavy tonight
my lockdown hair splayed on Your chest will intoxicate You so good
we love differently
effulgent waves breaking  as the sea meets the horizon
You make me glow like the sun illuminates ruins
"break in with a violent sweeping stroke, for i need a good cry"
the heavy voice of a hungry Beast calls me a fucking princess
the clouds are beginning to look like a constellation
a mere thought of You silences everything
You’ll find me  in every shadow
her darkness  is not passive
undo this innocence latching on with new experiences
"missing You at dusk, i’ve been viewing the moon"
break me and taste my intrigue
"we are stars and our love, a supernova"
haunted by a vanished way of life
insomniacs deserve goodnight kisses too
night after night of sultry highs
fill my skin with feeling
"in an ethereal state of mind, send vibes"
why study flowers?
our intimacy brings me to life
the transparency of air  the omnipresence of You
adamantine love
hooked to You like a fish to an eagle
ruby red crescents  skylarking on Your chest
"a chest full of tenderness, hands turning wild in darkness"
You’re a distant thunderstorm
"her sensual curves, a silver lining"
walks over drives
i’d always turn to You wherever i am in the world
it’s hard to exaggerate how filthy You make me feel
tell me about the virtues of decency while i choke
the moon is romancing my pain
a snow globe of fluid simulation
featherlight storms in the way she talks about her dreams
"happier with You, stronger without You"
You and i  hardening and softening on every stroke
i will claw back every touch i’ve missed
"overheated thighs, soul in crisis"
nudes lurking in gleaming mirrors
sometimes you are meant to find love and sometimes love is meant to find you
You make me feel like the only flower in the garden
"two hearts, one full other overflowing"
immutable cravings
every dusk is torture
"when i say it hurts, hush me then love me harder"
mouths clasped and our spirits soaring
hands smooth and soft  hugging contours and curves
let’s edge away into a dream
"she’s a mountain forest, quiet and fragile"
"in the middle of lovemaking, a cry goes up"
words a cocoon  of caresses
love of moon and darkness
"no matter how dark the night is, i see Your face when i close my eyes"
i see infinity in You
to love is to engage  with the cosmos
"beneath everything gloomy, an array of hope"
"she’s sensitive to touch, like a wild herb"
she’s dark like a winter sky
"tranquil and nurturing, You’re an early morning feeling"
kiss me longer than a star lifetime
Your memory is sublime as the highest star in the sky
Your lips on my eyes  my mind tasting heaven
Your absence reverberates with soul
absence is not an empty word
"the stars dig into my heart, sultriness fills my night"
nipples like bellflowers flaring  on Your tongue
"hopes high as trees, fears slipping as a waterfall"
"pain goes away, love never does"
keep loving me harder and the pain will wash away with the tears
the art of burning
You’re my Viking god of fire
"in quieter moments, i sometimes wonder how many tiers our wedding cake would have"
promise my love eternal life
a heap of berries in her voice
the persistence of intimacy
darkness as poems
"i see lightning glowing inside a dense cloud, i feel awake"
"Your silent intensity tells me to raise my arms  i close my eyes just as You lean to sniff deeply  the hollow under my arms, scented with sweat rich as rose oil  You growl urgently, i surrender  our precious ritual"
You’re a filthy animal  roused by everything primal
take me on a sensory journey
"a familiar scent is in the air sometimes i hear raindrops but sometimes, Your footsteps"
rhythm intertwined with memories
what use is rain or music? i have both around right now but neither could spoon me to sleep
"this love, an otherworldly beauty"
tears born of a piercing need
touch so i may rebloom
want to lick Your chest until my tongue burns
You are to me  what Saturn is to its rings  or Jupiter is to its moons
she talks dirty through a sheer veil of innocence
she’s a morning mist of rose buds and vanilla
You and i chasing a libidinous storm
the vineyards in my veins must wonder when the sun will shine again
waiting is a war i’ll always win
escapist desires thriving  under a compelling evening sky
she’s a volcano wearing a swirling summer tunic in kite print
the birds chirp ceaselessly  as if to keep my hopes alive
forever on the cusp of peace
pining aggressively for sensations
i miss Your perfume on my skin
nothing fades in our world
not everything is serene in love’s universe; this is not the kind of pain that brightens
i love You from the depths of the sea to beyond the clouds
lips sweeter than honeydew melon
dreaming in black
"forbid me something, i’m feeling masochistic"
i know how it feels to kiss a dream
how gracefully these petals bear the burden of dew at night
the wind played with my hair all day
capture me in Your words
indecent urges  softly spoken
galaxies of desires frozen in time
i’m full of our memories
i remember every feeling
black morning coffee and lingering darkness
"good morning kisses, on the back of Your toes"
my darkness opens like a flower around You
wildflowers encircling walls
gazing skywards to make as much as possible  of the evening
"our every memory, a waft of roses"
shy eyes exuding quiet love
You smell divine
"my heart is a book, Your love is a reading lamp"
"no words, only touches and sounds"
a cosmic stillness only found in Your arms
watch my Sunday morning stretch and tell me how it feels
feel my seduction in the shape of the moon tonight
You are all colours of the night
mirrorlike moonlight
the chaos of passion
i feel my fingers  reach for the places  Yours would
scan the horizon for me and shield me if You have to
"kiss me under a lime tree, tasting its sap on my tongue"
i walked in the direction of a double rainbow wearing the smile that You so love
Your poetry is all over the walls of my heart
thinking of the sea sailing beneath the sky
"pervade, quietly"
Your needs first
thunder echoing need
"opium lips, but her heart lives on coffee"
i tasted the pain to learn about love
an urge to soar
thirsts of all sorts  on my mind
You make us last
all it takes is You calling me  my love
whirlwinds caused by her heartbeat
"the fullness of heart, the closeness of trees"
love bites as arcs of the moon
Your memory touches everything
Your touch is a deep ocean
maybe i’ll be the birdsong that wakes You tomorrow
high tides between our faces
i’m weary of watching a blank ceiling of clouds take me to the rooftop
she says she’s fine because there’s strength in her wine
i trust You with my body and dreams
"You’re the wind storm, i’m the mute desert"
virtual is essential
a deep-rooted unsinkable love
i feel a new pulse beating every time i think of You
Your eyes have the strength of the sun
a fresh start and morning coffee served with spring water
whisper implications
the moon rises to stroke the sensual beauty of the night
"shower her with flower petals, but some days with coffee beans"
You dominate the pace  of my crumbling
cuff these breaths that are constantly fuelling the fire of Your absence
a flame-walled heart and eyes the colour of ripe wheat
"anticipating, quietly"
i was blessed by heaven the day we met
i fade along with the sky’s colours
reliving the last reverberations
more survival tactic than smile
self isolation circa 2019
not jolly enough for sundresses
i see in Your eyes a sun-drenched sky
glowing like a dove in the moonlight
a lot in this world reminds us  of each other
our destinies  facing one another
i am the best gift You’ve given me
Your poetry reads like nothing has changed
my sanity has reached dizzying heights and is fading out
swerve the impossible
"head full of castles, heart full of rivers"
being away from You is death of art
there are waves of pleasure and there are waves of vertigo
You as air
"next time we meet, spank me for this"
shamefully envious of the roses flaming pink and red in the dawn light
moon high up sea far below  constant interplay
my yearning grows in torrents
carnal opulence
virtuoso hands
"Your sensual words rippling down my neck, softening my smile"
i‘d do things more erotic than simply leaving the perfume from my hair along Your collarbone
new hopes for new times
pleasing You is my greatest pleasure
love me down to the ground
a web of desire in my core
"she’ll catch Your eye ever so quietly, her beauty is eternal, like nature"
smelling fresh and fragrant enough to stir Your savagery
my confines were blown away by the extremity of the storm inside You
she’s a contortionist in the sheets
midnight rituals and starlit feelings
we’re deep  in every dimension
kissing is the alchemy of love
"vulnerable like a wildflower on the verge, i wait for You as the world goes by"
fingers glazed with freshly picked strawberries mildly tortured for You to slather on just baked warm scones; perhaps i smell like a tearoom but i hope You’ll want to indulge
a wonderful delight
a small wonder
bite my sass
an espresso kiss while the coffee brews
"she’s lightning, she’ll cause fires"
i often think about that time when a strand of my hair wound up in an intimate spiral and flirted with You for hours
our love is gold  and purity doesn’t ever rust
dormant nights  somersaulting thoughts
maybe one day i’ll tell You everything i dream
come to me like the thunderstorm drawn to the evening
dip into the illusion with me
Your minimalism leaves me hungry for more
some days life feels like living art; other days i’m surrounded by splinters of chaos
i had a moment with the moon and now my night smells feline
You keep my body warm and my senses shivering
crush me and emphasise Your love
her backbend exudes seduction
eyes that tempt You to read
fingers that scrape back the embers and reveal fire
i still feel the warmth of old times
weave silk from my sin
You’re the high i’ll always chase
mum just called me a good girl; how’s your Friday?
intercrural missings
a crescent moon glows and in it i see the contour of Your smile
"i sit watching the sunset, always imagining running into the sea with You"
thinking about You rests my mind; the heart is another story
"Your shadow, an animal silhouette"
growls and whimpers  a calming harmony
words starrify love
You’re the magic in my darkness
a mind rich with hallucinations
"earth tones in her eyes, sunbirds in her dreams"
striving to last until You take me
eyes can devour
may love be the only pain we ever feel
You define the upbeat rhythm within my heart
a carousel of sensations
"before You kiss me goodnight, promise to glide over me like the morning mist"
savage feelings grope my slender heart every night
numb the need before i sleep
just as much art as she is catastrophe
come settle in the valley between my dark words
a single thought   so many theatrical butterflies
"my new jersey dress has been shipped, we need to be together soon"
"drifted off to sleep reading Your poems, woke up with hidden bruises"
Unfinished
voice like swirling steel  turns sharp as blade if i don’t obey
my days are devoted to the end of Your nights
"i feel miserable, ruin the silk"
i was made to satiate  and be loved hard
when beauty shies away
intimacy without gestures
eyes that couldn’t rise as You spoke now boldly plead violence
You’ve been holding me in Your thoughts all day i know because i’ve been smiling all day
"You be my sky, i’ll be Your art"
the moon showed its heart tonight
midnight moonbow
everything reminds me of what i’m missing
You articulate my darkness beautifully
acquiescing  to Your charisma
sable eyes casting the perfect evening dimness
a universe for two
a flower with deep-rooted thirst and a rainstorm on the horizon
eating berries and thinking about You feeding on my flesh
a love like a war against the gods
a pantyline of lovebruises  bearing Your name
let’s begin to paint  new dreams
shallow waters and bare feet
birdsong simplifies everything
"in another world, at another time  i’d need You just as much"
"You say goodbye, i smile unhappily"
she’s the chaos beneath a blue sky
the sublime richness  of a right word
this is not pain it’s a reminiscence of love
a sexy sedative voice  says to me “Don’t fight it”
darkness is catharsis
a sky tremulously shimmering a sea dark as ink
i find little  that is quiet  about the sky
love a sunset lacking subtlety
a wayward passage of time
"a fierce wind, an errant blossom a captivating tussle"
You and i as one  just a moment longer
i love You  from sunrise to horizon
my lips quiver  knowing Your kisses will reveal my immodesty
quiet eyes eager to be read
making waves in Your world with my gracefully restrained sensuality
i crave a retreat
"the heart of a lover, a sunkissed world of memories"
"the moon is an excuse, i escaped into the night to breathe in the scent You left floating near the trees"
the nights when You caress  my dreams
let our kisses light the garden when dusk falls
my mood needs dismantling
"the sky deeply dark, a moon incredibly shy"
a summer dress in Your choice of colour
her heart is an open space full of quiet love
i love Your words and sense love in Your silences
You are an insurmountable prayer
just always feeling
feel the reverence in my seduction
got back from a run glistening as if i’ve spent hours in bed with You
our love has the perfection of a rose
You and i and bucolic bliss
mine
my jaw bones are weary of waiting for You
i want to hold You and Your everything
words with kisses before them and silences beyond
i was immortalised the day a writer touched me
"tucked deep inside, a dark mood"
i want sleep because my dreams want You
dusk dripping shades of pink and turquoise
sky high heels and nothing else
"Your absence has robbed me of my senses, just like Your presence would have"
You’re a part of every seascape
You are salvation mixed with tempest
i ache for You in every language
peel off the blades of grass as You kiss the back of my bare thighs
"felt masochistic, smelled a sharpie"
a summons to bend
a blue horizon awakens the graceful cadence of the sea
withering flowers sealed in moonlight
i came to You open-hearted and returned open-minded
aural healing
i want You like You’re my birthright
want
"tremors on my lips, from being bitten by Your smile"
kiss me into a new realm
colour my skin with Your feelings
today belongs to Tanqueray Ten
she’ll video your eccentricities unassumingly and smile about them all day long
come swim in the river of daisies all over my sundress
You and i and poems and haikus
"in her surrender, the divinity of a sunset"
"a wild scent rises as darkness falls, i know You can smell it too"
noiseless nights are a nuisance
lost in the loop of our memories
You leave a trail of sensations
the fleeting timelessness of passion
what am i to do with a glowing face that You can’t smear with sweat or the silken cascade of hair that can’t cover Your chest?
do kisses really taste sweeter on bridges?
wasn’t certain but i always feared that You’ll fall in love with me
choking silently learning endurance
our private universe would smell like an evergreen forest of oaks and conifers
smiles leading eyes to the soul
Your dirty words  prey on my nerves  and make my spine tingle
one look at You  ripples all around my heart
magnetism doesn’t understand two metres
"i want You, not sleep to kiss my tired eyes"
You keep using the word fucking before every compliment; i keep dying
"surrounded by reflections of infinite tree branches, missing Your arms around me"
woke up feeling like an edible flower
"let’s share the night, and dream alike, then wake together to a celestial sunrise"
"You burn inside me, until i smell of love"
arms like cocooning horizon
with the moon come the musings
bring forth the fire of autumn of You
You smile at me and i sink into bliss
i’ve loved chokers ever since You said i have a beautiful neck
being starts with You
"we sit among the trees listening for melodious birdsong, You say You hear a blackbird and some sparrows; i stay silent and hold Your gaze until an unmistakable growl in Your smile stirs my soul"
"next time we meet, wage a war on my body"
feeling miserable and secluded in this scented foam bath
feel me easing myself in Your arms
"everything seemed so bleak, so i put flowers in my hair"
just press Your breath against my neck
"You seem to be in kissing distance, but we can’t touch"
envious of the freckles that stud Your chest
love bites under a beach umbrella
force feed me my camisole   then stuff my existence with love
a feisty little damselfly
You’re the other side to my everything
let’s go say hello to the countryside
"look at you slipping off my shoulder quietly, leaf print chemise strap; whose attention are you trying to steal?"
a pulse-quickening stillness surrounds You
Your eyes take me in unceasingly
a broken heart is a book to take one’s time over
"come find me, i’m walking deeper into a hazy existence"
as the day  dissolves into night  let’s make our shadows  come alive
together  we’re unique
"the smell of love, headier than the aroma of sand on the seabed"
"in Your searing eyes, a possibility  of softness"
drowning in the dark ponds of her eyes is no subtle pleasure
a thriving darkness  with sun-kissed cheeks
You’re an impromptu monsoon
lovers with gravitas
find my skin hue in Your tan lines
i quite miss Your incisors
"hers is a chipped vase kind of heart, with a single flower in it adding so much beauty"
"a night so lonely, the moon resembles a dragon"
a girl like a cherry blossom frenzy
find in me everything You love
thoughts of You and a hypnotic calm
paradisiacal fantasies
talk to me about finding balance as we watch the seawaves crashing into each other
Chaos
"a walk along the pier, holding hands, consumed by the sun, chasing hurrying clouds"
Play
i am what You evoke
Reminiscences
strips of Your words  wrapped tight around my heart as armour
maybe we’re galaxies  triggering primal darkness with every kiss
a beautiful day to enter the cosmos
dream with me tonight
i revere Your wild
dying well without You
wind and rain creating silhouettes
"in the shimmer of her eyes, a hint of letting go"
a cliff face heart studded with swathes  of tulips
"in our mellow talk, the hidden hues of darkness"
"Flattered by your bio, @JazibWiki : ) Welcome to Twitter!"
"when the days are short and our shadows long,  surrounded by the scent of wet leaves,  we’ll kiss  and just imagine it’s spring"
love floats rather wonderfully
thinking about Your smile and levitating
"i’d cook You an Italian lunch, scantily dressed, swaying to death bed"
a deep love  defined by simplicity
the ache from fear  so sacred
maybe i love the pain because it keeps love alive
woody wisteria lying so close to moonshine
need bite injuries
the possibilities between us  are porous
the fragile strings keeping us apart
endearingly  the sea invites the wave  and all of its troubles
touch and go but come once
"heart like a still ocean, panoramically spread out"
think of me when You watch the twilight dropping away
"around You, silences are harmless"
a rock face with sexy carvings
feeding on anticipated pleasures
a contrail of dreams
You’re not just a passing thought..
"stretching lazily in the sun, feeling deliciously dark"
hunger rumblings in my bones
thoughts of You  moving around me like air
it will be a long first kiss
"Your arms, the only place quiet enough for my prayer"
shy eyes shining with darkness
"bare as a bloom, wishing i could wreathe You in my scent"
a riot of wild thoughts
reaching You by sighs
grasping at Your reflection in the night sky
where do You miss my lip print the most?
"Your voice in my ear, like a love song in the distance"
"You’re a biting storm, i’m the gentle rain"
a mountain hike until the moon is our home
i love You immeasurably
whirling around Your universe  is a dreamy eyed galaxy with stars studded in her ears
heart-bleeding longing
my face on Your mind  my name on Your tongue  pleasantly rolling
the kind of voice that will always call You back
can’t wait to smile at the sun on the day we meet
"most days, i live  just to feel"
lava spitting gaze making me burn
under an open sky  the sea turns soft pink
i’ve seen the depth  i’m not turning back
You in a crisp white shirt  me in a freshly made bed  and all these miles between us
"her voice, like a jam jar"
a day spent smelling You and greenness
just pull or press ffs
"skintight kisses, under a fruit tree  all around us, the smell of cut grass"
the magnetism of a summer romance
You’ll find me hiding  in Your heart
"evocative eyes, like glowing coals  leaving a whiff of smoke along Your collarbone"
Your hand nestling  on my inner thigh  making my heart  spiral
collecting more moments than ever
You’re the midnight craving that lasts until breakfast
"her smile, like a gust of marigolds"
"Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth, sway me now 🎵"
a feeling  was all it took
Your shadow etched into my heart walls
i’d bloom repeatedly  i’m tough like that
Your fiery eyes punctuate my rambles
mood: hulks of neck kisses under a leafy tree
a frazzled page  in a second hand book alive with mystery and magic
"smiles between lovers, like fireworks"
"dark coffee, full sun and flowers spilling out of the vase"
i need a lullaby of Your breaths
conversations across eclipses
"dreams are fool-proof, not hearts"
her heart is a full-time flower
have a sip of coffee liqueur for me
a full bloom with frilly petals stripped to essence  by hours of sun
periwinkle eyes  striking fire
"a hopeless, helpless yearning  like that of skin without ink"
pain keeps her beautiful
"she’s a coy little lamb with twilight eyes, a tropical heart and a thirsty bunch of lips"
severe caresses  in soft evening light
without love there would be no stories
kiss the swell soothe the ache
i take a million inbreaths each day i smell You and i don’t  it’s madness  it’s pain
You and i against the world
feelings above thoughts
"all night long, the naked moon overwhelmed an unadorned starless sky"
exceptionally wanton sun glinting everywhere
there’s not a cloud in the sky once You’ve kissed me goodnight
the ebb and flow of peace
thoughts of You  and covert violations
i love the sun above the horizon  and i love it sinking deep
grey silk thoughts and softly voiced perversions
countless reminiscences
i feel dull brown as a dead leaf  You say i’m a breath of fresh air
You don’t yet know all the ways i’ll say everything You already know
i often think about the train journey i couldn’t make in April
... is a million breaths away
"she is quietly sensual, deeply elegant  and destructively delusional"
pain is the brightest candle on the altar of love
You rolled down like a storm and i have been flowing with ether ever since
our love has become so tender
beyond the horizon  they can’t find us
let’s adopt a tree so life makes sense again
dream feed me a new world
not a firefly in sight
reflecting on everything precious
wrecked by a sense of fragility
Your silence feels like a grey sky is bearing down furiously
a reader like me can’t do without a writer like You
You and i  living in fewer moments  but powerfully
drink the bittersweet scent of smoke from my lips before i go home
it’s not summer until my skin is full of bluebell bruises
"poignantly, we survive"
we met when i had given up on love
i believe in wonders more than angels
more in love than pain
offering my heart to the first beam of Your smile is how i practice sun worship
finding calm in a ghostly dawn
kiss my yogi contours
"2020, year of the rat, typically represents new beginnings, optimism and kindness   i’m looking at you, follower count, but no longer with unease"
come please and untangle the diamond ribbons of moonlight in my hair
never felt so sensual   as when You called me a “fucking temptress”
raw salt urge
"underneath the floral, everything black"
i feel like tempting Your fury
i’m a slave to the arson in Your voice
"romancing You through the ivory eyelets in my dress, my saffron skin"
"high summer in Your smile, madness in my heart"
Your words  and my darkness are obsessed with nearness
fantasies have ripened
saw us in a dream You fed me love
i write darker with the music on
"in Your whispers, the sway of the seas"
"i’ll wear Your favourite summer dress on Friday, whether or not the sun shines"
envious of the wine You’ll sniff and swirl tonight
You’re the finest  and the final chapter of my life
come back for my glory 🎵
tell me about life  as it will be
bursting with flames
deeper think about me deeper
the blue sky You said looked lovely started brooding soon after we hung up
Your smile brings colour to my lips
changing seasons won’t stop me desiring You
kisses aren’t just for spring
"despite it all, we love without fluctuation"
i miss us having it easy
devotion bordering on sacrilege
"a fading sky above me, an undeniable fire within"
ripples from Your touch perfecting my curves
love is  the way the moon  keeps the darkness
"Your skin, a perfume library"
i’d suffer for Your art
Your pleasure is the rule i live by
in front of the ruins  lies the ocean
fill me with Your touch
"deeper You love, thirstier i feel"
You are my hiding place
"loved so hard, i left a scar  yet You didn’t deny me more  i admire that"
Your fever sweeps me  into peace
my idle heart hasn’t skipped a beat since we parted
a hungry voice  devours my name  in a way that i really love
pitiless whispers and quiet spills
the wind drifts a faint scent; i inhale tenaciously
You keep me inexhaustible
"poems, sometimes not of words"
"engaged with nature, it connected me to the universe"
i’d deep-sea dive for a taste of Your kiss
hair wet and dripping i let the towel drop then put my hand on the mirror and rubbed all over
"the grey void, softening"
smiling at the north star winking through the clouds
endless invitations in her quiet eyes
i see us when i look into the fire
Your touch fosters trust
tangled in yesterday’s sunset
my flaws are less than perfect
a crisp autumn walk beckons
"last night in my dream, we were breathing into each other’s faces"
dirty thoughts  sensitively dressed  in pretty words
i miss feeling tipsy from licking the sweat off Your chest
my wrap dresses miss the wilderness
"nothing broken, everything bruised   #Troublein4words"
a blissful future is beginning to stir
the alchemy  of our privacy
a carcass of red grapes on my tongue
maybe the dunes want to curl up and return to the sea
Your lips  moving from my neck to my heart
"not an emerald summer, for me it’s all about sapphire eyes"
overcast skies and oceanic sighs
scraping dust off fallen leaves
smiles that soar and hang  as silver linings
break this spell  of anticipation
"my heart is open, my desires corseted"
Your words tell my story
goodbyes bearing missiles
carve Your own share of my life
mock calm
i want to pucker between Your fingers
come  if only to find  inspiration
let Your hands be the bookends
"on my mind, pure folly"
the romance around a return
Your soft smile is my femininity lingering
You and i and a playlist
a calming tea and an exposed midriff
smiles that push boundaries
"how else could i give You more, except by dying?"
rub my skin
You are pure escapism
breaths as morsels
You make facing the unknown a joy
"sailing along a moonlit river, kissing as many times as the stars twinkle"
"to have and to hold, in light and shadow"
our untroubled past  leans heavily on me i am humbled
You are the breeze in my pulse
our fire has taken over the sky tonight
You  like the full moon have absolute power
with deeply calm eyes i welcome sleep; just because dreams are so precious   #haiku #haikuchallenge
"come pin in my hair, the last of the summer flowers"
wander through the air i breathe
eyes bearing constellations
"sometimes a happy memory is right there, when i need it"
she breaks  more beautifully  than dawn
thinking about You i can’t help but break into a smile
"on warm days such as today, i heartily wish i could smell Your neck"
i suffer either way
"in the darkest time of the night, i find myself seeking comfort in the sound of a fearless wind"
whisper to me in the rawest words
longing is only for the brave
You’re the storm  and the sunshine after it
every face is worth reading
lowering my eyes  to create intimacy across miles
split between a rise and fall
give or take a few thousand  kisses
You inspire daydreams
"lock me in Your arms, the skies are impossibly wide"
growing mild in wait
growing wild in wait
it’s beautiful to watch the leaves overlapping around sun-warmed trees but i want a stroll through Your darkness
a year in the mountains
"in every moment, Your echo"
some days her smile is an unlit candle
"in Your poems, we’re always together; teach me please, this art of not pining poetically"
"remote lovers, intimate memories"
"Beloved, You pen the finest words but this war inside me will only be settled with touch"
You are art and literature and everything defiantly timeless
"really, thoughts of You  scent my skin"
yes it’s a full moon night but You are the light  within my celestial core
this time lacks the rhythm of our quiet time
"leaning into Your chest, like a plant that grows on rock"
light dipping in and out of shadows
nothing stirs without You
still waiting   to lose myself
i miss the taste of exhaustion
shiuli lips
i love our harmony
i feel beautiful when You call me a temptress
ink-coloured eyes opening to a soft dawn
lust buried in words
exhale Dominance
i need months in Your arms
You and my heart  are inseparable
"in her smile, the grace of the ruined"
my body thinks about You tirelessly
“I miss you” that starts with the word fuck
Your love is more arousal than torment
"next time we meet, keep me"
darkness is a calm sea
i see our silhouettes floating in the night sky
You and i  wandering in a labyrinth  of cosmic desires
"amidst all this, wind chimes"
"beyond miles of thorns, a rose"
"some days, i find it easy  to believe"
thinking about us back in the old days
feeling so madly romantic that the gyrations of my hips will make Your head spin
our breaths that used to slow dance will battle for relief when we next kiss
i avert the sunset lest my dreams blur into the horizon
"those moments might have been art, the ones that feel like a dream now"
"quietly, the noise begins"
only calm  on the edge
brown eyes are most eloquent
maybe i’ll bleed on You  like ink on paper
please rest  heavy on me  let the quiet dawn watch
May 1 may i be one with the One this May
kiss me not once but once more
i value Your silence too
a virgin night awash in darkness
the striptease of clouds
the tenderness of rainbows
the cold tiles in Your shower are second skin to me
"come closer and i’ll kneel if You don’t, i’ll collapse"
not all my love is translatable
she’s a petal tucked inside the book of His life
caresses that bedeck the heart
dark daydreams in the pale sunshine
Your love pulls me skyward
a persistent carnal angst
intimidated by Your retweets
squeeze the plump sultanas ffs
wreckful fingers  crushing and sniffing
You’re my morning and the night before
a thickening thirst
i miss Your blustery kisses warming my skin
"breathing deep, like it’s penance"
living on drunkenness feeding on imagination
my world is tolerant of Your absence this is my love at its tenderest
thoughts of You more cathartic than yoga
"lie with me on the grass and smell on the back of my thighs, the scent of bruised daisies"
an amplifying ache
"on some days, she is deep black  on others, a neutral grey"
"You and i go together as fountains and gardens,  shallow waters and bare feet, woodland and silence"
disobedient urges
fuck alfresco
i love how You call me love
dying  to live
Your hand strangles the air i breathe and i’m more alive than ever
my heart is a believer  Your love is the chant
wish i could unsee the rafflesia
furious about the moonlight touching You
our rituals are still with me
the sacred smell of lovers
"around You, i am vulnerable  as a cherry blossom at the edge of the ocean"
i miss summer i miss Your heather whispers i miss You leaving my hair looking like wild grass
i want to taste a change
Infuckingsatiable ©
standing nude by Your writing desk  a smitten muse
envious of the stars soaking up the night
in our hearts a life  that doesn’t yet exist
a worthless Sunday made exciting by dusky brown hair now long enough to stroke my nipples
dark minds don’t date
thoughts of You pierce me with a slow burn
i think of You with eyes lowered
You are a timeless feeling
this incarnate feel of being  beside You
Your loving words  are floating lanterns  in these dark times
my fingerprints   in Your flowerbed
a heart bent on leaning
how ferally we eclipse the moonlight
tears inflame intimacy
can’t find my breath  kiss me
without You i run away  from darkness
all these words are whispers of my heart
i have endless words for these endless days
incense-bearing flashbacks
lips sewn  limbs like patchwork
being alive begins with You
You letting me kiss it made my day
smell is my first sense that feels at most loss without You
a restless journey  of dark thoughts
this pain isn’t pleasurable
the pulse rarely quickens nowadays
"a book of my dirty thoughts, and how You slide into every page"
submission drowns the chaos
she’s a roaring wind  forever teasing out thunder  from a grey sky
slow-paced healing
strap me to Your chest ffs
noiselessly servile heart
ask me if i miss You and i’ll tell You how my skin doesn’t respond to my touch anymore
riotous pain
"beautiful, dark, uncaring night"
"i’ll come to You, in autumn to come undone, like autumn"
i write to make You growl
i coloured my lips just to make You unzip
kiss me with fuck all grace
i try..
my love is homesick
black shadows dripping down a white wall
i want to grace Your wall
"a life so surreal, i forgot i could die"
we rise  above it all
Your absence is becoming my alter ego
i pick a book  and the world dissolves
Your every memory has such ferocious strength
death-defying love
telling time by lost sleeps
fever bearing arousal
i should be sore from Your games right now
twinkling eyes causing crime
the storm-shattering sensuality  of a woman’s back
"primrose lips, warm from the evening sun  eager to be kissed"
my toes  in Your bath
she is 20th-century literature
"You make up everything,  but everything put together isn’t as good as You"
covert craving is a howling wolf
"i’m a river, swollen after days of rain seeking the high sea with all my might"
my body wants to move to Your voice
the old moon and new  i want to behold it all with You
nakedness heals
thinking about how tempestuously Your breaths drape my neck
how simply You petrify me
envious of wind-blown blossoms
be cruel to me it’s freeing
this longing is everlasting  like dried flowers
layers of emotion on my soul
You be the ocean  i’ll be Your salinity
"breathing motionless inside a birdcage, eyes fixed on the wirework of promises"
a lover’s touch powerful as art
once this is all over..
my soul feels drowsy
You and i on the dark side of a fairytale
Your life-giving darkness  my flame-coloured eyes
possessed by a keeper
i want to be Your signature perfume
exaggerate my darkness
say we again
boozy kisses and hot touches
i worship the planet You live on
the agony of parting connects us
a fuck as a rockfest
breasts swollen like a heap  of fluffy meringue
potent drippings
been watching the hot wick bury itself into the melting wax
a halo of petals  embracing Your lips
there is promise in the shimmer of stars tonight
kiss me if only to fill me with more weaknesses
consensual ruination
come to me like summer’s inevitable rain
mood: kisses by the canals in Venice
she’s a starless night  that belongs to a beast
thinking about You and falling  into drunkenness
"i’ve observed dripping blood,  separation from You is far more grim"
she is chaos theory
i want to know what music You play when i’m on Your mind
meditating  with the moon
"darker the cravings, sweeter the flesh"
i miss our haven
"at the end of the road, a mountain track"
"Your mind, like a night sky  of dark and electric hues,  feeds my wanderlust"
hardy soul growing mild
all it’ll take  is a fingertip  for the briefest moment
of all the worlds You walked into mine
"lying alone in bed, trying to recall the feel of Your skin"
the drapes are clashing with the wind as i continue to embrace isolation
"let me be the candle You burn every evening, i’ll scent Your bedroom  and look beautiful for You"
think of me sprawled on the sheets  like silk
incurable hopefulness
"me, my bookshelf and i"
keep holding my hand or my life line may crack
"my skin wants blueness, not my heart; i want Your body feasting on me, not just Your eyes"
piercing eyes gazing at me as if engraving a heart on stone
hang around my neck the heavy rope of Your voice smeared with a fine mist  of dirty whispers
we suffer the same
natural love  is the perfect kind of love
i live for Your art
my imbecile heart broods in every season
gave You parts of me that i knew could break
Your words dominate darkness
closing my eyes looking to our future
"You and i, bonded by essence"
haven’t seen a more remorseless night sky
the abyss of my yearning  is one thousand sided
"wish i’d taken one more breath with You next to me, when i had the chance"
i hope to never use words to stifle feelings
i miss how the moon used to envy my body when You heated it to whiteness
swordplay of tongues
quickening Your pulse with unhurried stripping
blindfold and make me study heaven
the world inside me   is open to the sky in You
meeting place: tempest
Your darkness  is my naked truth
the turbulent heights and the murky depths i want it all
"touched by the light of every burning star, but the soul refuses to glow without You"
Your darkness  feeding on my sensations
make love to me in Your writing room
limping life
this love is maturing by leaps
waiting until You are  days to hours to seconds  away
love expands through love
the play of moon and clouds
come spasm in my throat
assert dominance with foretaste
Your axe head teeth my edible pastry lips
all wine is sour without You
You are the distance between me and my missing heart
a love worth storytelling about
i have desired You long before i started writing about it
spent the day frequenting our past
maybe our love belittles God
dreamy but wingless
You’re the quiver in my voice
read my thirst in my smile
You are an empire of words
"Your hand on my heart, like a painting upon stone"
eyes bearing soft earth
i’m full of You You’re full of words
let me take Your hands to the hills
there’s no limit to how much You can know me
i want my last sunset with You  in the middle of an ocean of tulips
spade-shaped heart
"this summer, i want a walk in the park, holding hands with You the walk that we didn’t get a chance to  take last summer"
thick-lipped hunger
Your beard causes more burn than pepper sauce
"homely days, comely nights"
harder  stare harder
i want to take You inside my body
You’re in so many places
heart-shaped origami bearing messages
extraterrestrial fears
could i feel Your loin muscle
let’s fill a bedroom corner
"even if we see the same star in the sky, it’s not enough and i want more"
waves choking sand kind of love
feather-shaped love
"a tumult of desires, like gravel in my lungs"
i’ll be the sunshine that keeps You warm as You spend the day doing blissfully little
trade the loneliness for the sunshine
days keep on coming one day You will too
i fear everything  except love
"be the sky, not the sea;  the sea leaves without warning"
make love to my mind make war on my body
i’m overflush with heat only You can bear
persuasion through dark ink
You study my eyes  like a goldsmith
observing flight of birds
finding words in clouds
missing You is a ritual
a tender soul easily moved
collecting images as i read
"the heart is a prayer book, it can’t be explained"
some memories arrive unexpectedly
takes some words over a week to find love around here
turned to face the moon
seeing all colour  as black
"same mood, many meanings"
i glazed Your poem
from above tree tops  the orange sunbeams awake an autumn forest  #haiku
an ocean  calmer than dusk
i know You’re starving by how the grey takes the blue from Your eyes
some days You’re a distant planet
You and i  in time lapse
smoothen my curves with thorns
You understand love
burning love is a sight to behold
a corner looms into view take my hand and let’s turn
blustery cherry blossoms slaying green spaces
an ocean walk  to the pink sun
sturdy elegance in a loose blue shirt
divination using kohl
some words stir inside endlessly
palms soft as cream lily pads near wilting in wait
come feed on the sighs i expel
love is darkness  wreathed in the light  of a full moon
nocturnal bloom  a soft pink moon
You make waves through art
meandering thoughts  flying towards the sunset beyond the mountain   #haiku
i love the sound of the softly hissing wick of a candle
would You rather  look at art or read
i wish for You to have a fire to light
"a lover’s breath, more intimate than perfume"
cuff my shins with soft breaths
eyes like diving birds
"kiss me please, i’ve got a writer’s cramp on my tongue"
maybe i could carve letters of Your name to make my soul look like art
we are  our own  constellation
brown eyes turning gold in dawn light
a full moon adds thrill to darkness
"a real piece of poetry, from me to You"
starry eyes against a lunar landscape
the heart of the sky is vibrant tonight
anything seems possible when you look up at the sky long enough
"marble moon, just like Your skin"
"the dazzling full moon, so intense  and infinitely marked"
"new explorations, new hopes"
"the full moon tonight, bright as our future"
wish You could see how the full moon is illuminating my jasmine skin
a river of kisses under a full moon
torn between wanting to doze off and to howl at the full moon
she is juvenile art
"Your love, my truth You, my chosen illusion"
You form the horizon
sleep prone sunshine
every heart is a long read
i could write a whole library on You
"the air is fresh from night, just as my longing"
i’m being kept awake by the sound of Your breathing that i can almost hear
You’re a grenade of warmth
write to me what You haven’t ever printed
You playing with my breaths is a haiku moment
honeycomb shards in chocolate soil
"You and i, in a floating home  connected to noone but nature"
i’d live on water with You
carry me into Your life for a day
i’m a closed book because You’re the every next chapter
obsessed with the pleasure of connecting with You
hours seem to be moving like weeks
bring my mind the calm of Your heartbeats
listen to my senses as they burn
i am  because You feel  me
"seldom the sun, always the blues find me"
a squirt of Your breath  and i am floating
Your tongue tastes of divine love
pour Your scent all over my skin
most days i’m happy to wake up simply because You like brown eyes
i want one of those nights You always paint
Your voice is naked flesh
wake me up with the tyranny of Your mouth
limitless anticipation will drown me
"in His jaw bone, the wrath of God"
i smell better than the damp night air
minds joined in unholy matrimony
"dark desires and rich, dark wine"
"You and i, at a mountain cafe, indulging in a simple meal and inhaling wholesomeness"
"You and i, under a hot sun, surrounded by heavy grass"
"do this for me, either give me a whiff of You or cleanse my blood of passion"
"i want to read but Your absence is sitting alongside, gnawing at me"
i want to read Your mind when You’re looking at me
"Your words, my prayer beads"
i want unlimited reality with You
my dreams seek diffusion
You’re my wildest thought
worship perfects love
"sometimes the memory dies, but the feeling lives"
You are the root  and the reward
offering You love until my eyes are dry as dust
drugs bouncing off words
soft walls torn down with untiring slowness
"You and i, often alone but together"
a book hauntingly neglected
profound remoteness
i’m partial perfection without You
happiness is now
darkness saved me from stumbling
kisses that make you whirl round the universe
vulnerable by will
"there is eternal compassion in stars, for they don’t set"
momentary bliss and other ethics of love
"oh to be forever lost in You, like a seaborne sand castle"
"on this day, two years ago, i was in an old town centre, at a former Mozart haunt dating back to 1703, having coffee and cake, and lost in thoughts of You   a lot has changed except the rhythm of my thoughts"
i want to be the home You never want to leave
Your aggressive absence won’t excuse me
stimulation by dandelion tea but i’d rather be gagging on blood
our love nurtures the utopia of darkness
some days love is a divine illusion
jasmine on my skin drawing You into a chasm of desire
a soul twice born
victim of flowering
Your voice echoes through my every pore many hours after we’ve spoken
oceans will flood the moment we touch
love defines itself
a sated smile on a face with cruel eyes is sexy af
the radiance in my soul is You
devotion is my force
thunderbolt love
love is holding indelicate thoughts together
Your absence is more savage than Your presence is tender
even the wind breathes slow tonight
only been five hundred years but already seems like ages since we met
the candle i burn every evening seeks Your shadow
my eyes are bloodshot from Your hot darkness
our hands are looking for each other
even silences get tired
a winged pixie with a long ponytail
i don’t need heartbeats to keep Your love alive
"write more, Your hand feels closer"
bite marks like red wine grapes dangling in my cleavage
i don’t need hours of meditation  i need You to be within smelling distance
touch me please and exorcise the fierce urges
every goodbye is a happy one because none of them is final
i imagine nobody is craving anyone as much as i am You at this precise moment
You have a serious hold on me
"swerving around Your mind, until i’m spinning so fast You breathe deeper"
Your absence reaches so deep
our lips are separated but You could still fill my senses
i’m windburn on the tree bark hungry for You
His is an eloquent mind and a dependable heart
"lie with me beneath a roof of stars, our eyes on the horizon, love floating on our hearts"
"i pause, You smile You speak, i listen in awe"
eyes and knees sunken lips in prayer
love shines  long after dark
"Beloved, there’s a book waiting to be swung open by You"
"dimness all around, something inside burns"
Your lips hush my mouth but the wind shrieks hard
the sky blushes with me   the moon rises with You
have used up so much energy just imagining our passionate wrestle
mountaintop huddling and ozonic kisses
without Your presence  there is no easing into  the blackness of night  #haiku
the heart refuses to disbelieve
i want our destinies to collide
"every time You look at me, a little something in me changes"
kill the parts of me You can’t keep
"no perfume, He warns"
a vast cobalt sky encircles the brown earth and all of her dirt
maybe i could be the dark coffee You start the day with or the melting salty butter on the warm crumpet that You relish in bed
shades of an amber dawn peer down through a soufflé of clouds
have me before summer arrives
i know love because i know You
Your eyes deepen the darkness
"in Your every filthy thought, a tinge of freshness"
cool moonlight and warm breaths
my lips miss staining Your palm
i miss Your compelling scent
drag down every layer
He won’t let my gaze move until i’ve named every place on my body where i touched myself
"You’re in every feeling, except the chaotic ones"
the brightness in my smile  is from Your presence in my heart
soft caresses and heady words conceived for intimate evenings
You dirty me again so quickly as if it’s intolerable to smell the rose clay i used on my skin in the shower
soft candlelight and intricate silhouettes
the hurricane that You find so attractive is in turmoil without You
i am charmed by how sensitively You lick my wounds
whisper the unknown
i hope immodestly
"Your words, always so elegantly violent"
my teeth miss unzipping You
the innocence i lost is still visible in old photographs
"thinking about You, and sketching lips shading texture, creating highlights and shadows, until they swell off the paper"
the waiting  keeps me going
i am knee deep in humility  from the love You’ve showered on me
promise me a warm April morning together
romantic Heaven on the other end of the line
lost in an infinite galaxy of felicific memories
You always make me feel
FaceTime coffee and everlasting smiles
"if i were a painting, You’d be the signature on it"
"every day apart, a lost era"
maybe i could have Your bare minimum
"heart like an empty wine bottle, yet the words don’t ever rest"
please comb my hair for me
"on my lips, a tireless ache"
flames bursting quietly after dark
"my face, pressed against Your reflection"
Your deep kisses ignited new desires
"You make me want to be read, to be looked at, to be complimented"
how neatly my hand sits in Yours
Your absence can not be ignored
You are my zen
i want a lion’s share of the Beast in You
my thoughts often turn to You driving me  up the wall
Your intentions pamper me
decorate my flesh however You want
love makes life habitable
escape is only a matter of time
perpetually thirsty  rain on me ffs
"everytime You pass through my mind,  i am soaked into a sense of calm"
You gave me a useful other life
her fear makes the most irresistible sound
a cornucopia of fine memories
a still volcano in my veins
You’re the perfect start and end to my days
You finish me so much more beautifully
priceless words go on skin not paper
"when this is all over, i’ll have a bookcase full of wish lists"
endlessly refilling daydreams
"sweep Your hands all over me, like ocean waves"
"only in Your arms, i feel safe to close my eyes"
my body craves You without discipline
i can hear  the wind of change
my heart knows no better than to leap
"when life stops being difficult, let’s tour the world together"
i need to grasp Your white shirt to beat the blues
"blessed with love, cursed with limitations"
"the dense fog has left the grass lush and damp, making it harder than ever to not fill with envy"
"desires, so fanatical"
"every night, dreamless as a closed book"
darkness has no accent
You say You’ll love me forever  i say kiss me again before i’m ash
i’m happy our eyes meet everyday
steeped in a feeling known only to us
"Beloved, my many kisses are en route"
i miss nuzzling Your close cropped hair
soul Dominant ©
You’re a constant high tide
i want You insanely and intensely
amid the noises of the world our background music softly plays
"sand dune eyes looking at You, seeking a blue sky escape"
the meditation of warming skin with skin
Your heart is a most beautiful bouquet
i feel naked
"every passing day, a celebration"
love is a most natural process
a dusting of happiness  to jolt reality
smiling through the countdown to the unknown
i’ll be Your messenger of summer
"with a shivering spine and outstretched wrists, i wait for You"
heady hearts
what a waste to have washed away all of the unravished natural scent and sleep smelling insignificantly fresh
be everything but transient
i only want to read and write stories about us
Your love made my heart less vulnerable
i move listlessly in bed until the moonshine embroiders Your name on my skin
dry spell tolerance limit reached
"dark lover, only You can bring me light"
breathing singly  is no feeble effort
maybe i could touch Your shadow
surviving on sighs
"each orgasm is different, and i want to collect more"
"read me for hours, but first we kiss"
i want to lose all my sighs to Your voracity
"soul on edge, heart in the right place"
nourish or i’ll crack
cravings float up  repeatedly
You have all my willingness
You’re painfully absent and profoundly everpresent  what sorcery? what madness?
Your softest focus leaves me smelling animalic
"the morning sun is thumbing my neck, and i’m filled with thoughts of Your heavy hands down my back"
overwintered af
my nights  have suffered enough
"You’ve listened so much, say something now in words that strip and crush"
"deep love, mad longing"
it isn’t spring until the tingling burgundy charms on my chest turn blue between Your teeth
say words i can smell
some days i glow in Your fire  some days Your love softens me
i spurn the dull night as a lotus repels water
"like silk, Your every whisper is full of cosiness and temptation"
"to cross Your mind, akin to walking on the moon"
"eyes full of love, echoing a starry sky"
👏 #clapforourcarers
"from here on, kiss me excessively"
the shackled energies of hearts in love
this eternal yearning
"her face, wet with a fallen constellation"
"solitude, rituals and thoughts of You make up my happy kingdom"
i want to escape just like the birds
"pacific eyes, hovering over ruin"
do You miss me as much as i care about serving You perfect coffee?
"just us, behind my shuttered eyes"
a thick book and a deep sofa
i’m happy for the blossoms on bare branches
Your lip print  behind my ear
i want our kiss to be the first to bloom in the spring garden
a feeling remains unpronounceable
"everything gloomy that i pen, i keep in the garden so it can rust"
rob my skin of all its perfume ffs
"the scented candle flickering near You, that can hear the sound of Your breathing, has a rival"
our harmony  is like a conversation
the gentle chorus of a fine tropical storm and a still evening   #haiku #haikuchallenge
a past full of buried treasure
we’re only a few syllables apart
You could invent a space for us
bathed in warm and soothing reminiscences
wish i’d never slipped out of Your hands
a little hope beyond malady
feel my depth through the unrest in my words
You float between thoughts and emotions
You’ll find smears on me only in the dark
hearts roaming without hassles
"can You hear my silence? tell me Beloved, do You envision the storm in my eyes?"
i anticipate a stampede of butterflies soon one day
a constellation of blurs on the mind
You intuit my every need
"the seascape in Your eyes, a rosy horizon on Your lips and in Your arms, the sunset in full swing"
eyes numbing from wait
"fulfilling my purpose, lying at a distance"
a quiet power soars into the city sky
no bruises to hold me together
muddy my mind a bit
the moonlight curling round the tree trunk in the dark broke all my chaos
i’d thrive on a fraction of Your scent
time adds beauty to love
looking for You in forest footsteps
i miss Your body punishing my body
"a little love, earned frequently"
i’ll know You are imminent when all corners of my heart are lit
i am only kept going by the stream of Your loving words that tightly corsets my delicate heart
my mind is full of You and mountain scenery
waiting is my greatest strength  and my biggest peeve
to be loved  is to feel no absence
silence can never hold enough meaning
You are catharsis
i’d kiss You from the feet up
shower upon me the riches of our history
You make love grow so easily
my face craves the warmth of Your hands
in You i seek the pain of love and the relief for pain
i’ll come to You famished
i bleed sanity but my love remains intact
my parched throat is screaming out for mercy
tomorrow will be beautiful  i say to myself every night
i smell like You’re thinking about me
i’ll sing karaoke if You play the guitar
maybe the wind ruffling my hair is You
"outside the window, a spring awakening"
myriad fantasies  becoming a touch impatient
a falling star looks up longingly at the naked sky
"many miles apart, we make love  by tasting wines together"
Your sinful whispers keep my chastity in check
the mild scent of salt reminds me of You so i smile and tease my tongue
You know my dreams
the mountains feel pulled towards us
"our dirty talk, a daily delight"
sometimes it takes a sharp perspective to realise the uniqueness of a special relationship
"it’s Your day always is, always will be   #WorldPoetryDay2020"
just here to read You
"the taste of You, like honey at its rawest"
"sitting open hearted on the bookshelf of Your mind, looking fabulous"
Your embrace feels like home
want me enough to touch me  love me enough to keep me
a night made of poured passions
You’re only violent  behind closed doors
"once the essence fades away, a flower is lost forever"
mood: dining out
Your absence is an illusion
stolen kisses are tastiest
no torrent like You
You’re the god of a woman’s world
thoughts clear as vodka
perhaps our sex soaked scent still lingers in the lift
"upon the spring air, a gentle whir of butterfly wings"
my body needs Your words
misread that as touching...
i want You at Your most expressive
love how You never tire of lifting my heart
could we just touch fingertips
"sink, as i open"
thinking about the sea and the horizon that meet every day gives me hope
look at me. smile.
"my lips long to burn from kissing Your chest, hot as a sunburnt rock"
the robust romance  of dark wood and candlelight  until early hours   #haikuchallenge #haiku
i think a lot about the scent of Your tasteful skin
"You’re like the moon in daytime, quietly watching over me from a distance"
each of my pauses  is saying something
the irrepressible feminine energy of a heart
"Your poems, on tape"
even mountains change over time this too shall pass
to live to love another day..
"being loved, i became love"
the patchy lives of great loves..
"Your heart, a powerhouse  of gentleness"
"Aldous Huxley was right, maybe this world is another planet's Hell"
i am but a speck of dust that the sunlight kisses every day
refill my darkness
my eyes need the landscape of Your body
envious of how intensely the lightening cracks on the horizon
hearts swapped without words
"our every moment, fire borne"
Your voice bends my knees
"every bruise, a war story"
words prettier than a timeless love song
You gave me a rainbow of reasons to love You
Your words are a muse to my words
a vineyard in those lips
the distant music  is my heart calling out
she’s the quietest raging fire
sigh coronavirus anagrams to carnivorous
a closed world cannot deprive cosmic love
envious of the soft cotton that crumples beneath You at night
You may ask my heart anything
lift me from the confines
i am the shoreline  waiting for a swathe of sea
Your anything is enough
"aside from darkness, everything is bleak"
"come back now, i haven’t breathed my longest breath yet"
You and i  have no need of words  but we’ll always love them  they found us each other
"lips once rose pink, now desiccated"
words spoken in the dark bring her closer to nirvana
dress my mundane bed
Your cloudless eyes delight me
does love drift or rest when the heart stills?
"no knots in my hair to untangle,  how miserably i miss You"
"i’ve held so many misdelivered letters in my hand over the years, pain is now a way of life"
put Your book down and read my face
can’t separate  butterflies and wildflowers they go together   #haiku
You flatter me as if i were a Goddess
freckles like stars irradiating on Your chest
the fires of flesh
be the pyramid to my reclined butterfly
"the Beast is real, the danger is not"
my mind is Your second home
she’s a docile animal
is love or am i  lunatic
couples i know are planning weddings and all i can think about is how much i want to feast upon Your soul
You are the warmest season
corners are my comfort zone
the grass we lie on stays green
i value Your words as something that lives
"unless You pull me close and kiss me hard, i’ll keep scattering shards of espresso chocolate truffles on my tongue until they stab my heart"
the beauty of Your savagery lies in the eternal possibility of softness
the day is dissolving into night while i am heaving against impenetrability
Your voiceprint is embedded in my mind
i miss You as much as the sky is open
"curtains drawn, windows open"
my mind is an aspiring diver
i’ll freeze if i don’t bear Your weight soon enough
the burden of rest in the journey is hard on my feet
i could talk all day about how i felt You momentarily in my sleep
even the clouds are lower than You are near
You stole what was already Yours
it’s always a good day to interact with flowers
keep warming my body for life
Your memories greet me like an old friend
fill Your mind with me
touch me with smiling lips
when feelings past echo in the heart
You put me together in such a different way
i will stomach all Your bites
such strict controls have made You even more irresistible
everyone heals late
"by the time You’re content with kissing my neck, face to face touch will be safe again"
"limiting the spread is the right thing to do, but bless my soft heart, it quivers to think how much the thrusting will hurt"
i coughed because You choked me
"binding my wrists with Your belt so i can’t touch my eyes and mouth is wise but i’ll need You please, to lick my tears and wet my lips every now and then"
face to face contact with You was never free from harm anyway
someone stole a thousand daffodils while everyone else was self isolating
Your kisses ignite such madness
"what You write, everyone can see what You say, only i revel in"
the natural scent of skin has its own language and Yours is pure poetry
every rock has a gem inside her
only organic love lasts
sculpt me a life
fire me up
not sure which bars have shut down in the neighbourhood but i sure know about the bookstore that has reopened
Your darkness is eye catching
i feel for the wistful brown earth that thirsts for a cloudburst
Your pleasure means more to me than it does to You
a constellation of tears navigating her night sky eyes
is it my voice or words that You find provocative
i hope You never finish writing me
tempting Your fingertips with exotic depths
i don’t want smiles that elude answers
my sanity lies in moments of connection
how many recipes for love have You got?
"some used to make my decisions hard, You make my hard decisions for me"
"in my heart, where dense trees used to be, there is now a flowerbed"
"mercy, in half measures"
sipping morning coffee on a rooftop with a view of the mountains in the distance
Your eyes reach everywhere  Your hands dip into everything
"grip until i burst, hold until i mend"
an army of desires has come to a screaming halt
You are home that’s not within reach
the restlessness tonight is akin to a hundred hearts beating in my chest
You give me the blues to cheer someone else up
"i love myself, because how can i not love what You’re a part of?"
"You’re everything i always felt drawn to, the romantic feeling i didn’t know really existed"
is animal friendly fuck cruelty free?
seducing You by switching languages
she’s hard to understand  but worth the effort
showing You all the places my hands have wandered thinking about You
drenched skins and huddled souls
our time is the silver hue of a thousand nights
limbs obsessed with movement
unfold my senses
open-air fuck  and more drinks after
exhausting myself as i rise
"like a blossom in the wind, i surrender"
she is sharp on heels but around Him always so very weak at knees   #haiku #haikulust
"our journey so far, so dark"
"hands held tight, until souls awake"
mood: pulses
love is the star that outshines planet sex
we think alike  but You write so much better
"until it hurts, it won’t change  and i want to change"
a heap of dreams in the web of existence
He’s warm but never too soft
feeling imaginary sensations
show me where i am in the sky while i kiss Your neck
"tides and stillness, in Your arms"
"i am as earth, parched from heat cracking everywhere a tree used to be"
i blossom because You’re rooted in me
sleep is always a compromise
don’t tell Your passion i am brittle
heart freer than breasts
"everything behind me, nothing beyond You"
let’s make paradise of the darkness
let Your troubles lean upon me
leaf Your filth through my thoughts
i want a seawater bath with You
You discovered the oldest part of my soul
You’ll find more space if You stay long enough
i inhale more around You
plunder my innocence and sow dark desires in me
"for Your eyes, i’m quite another story"
breeze by me
"those moments when you wonder, “Is this really happening?”"
"don’t get me flowers, take me to the airport"
no touch is casual
flower market walks are one of my favourite  pleasant diversions   #haikuchallenge #haiku
penetrate my consciousness
there are love stories hidden in the hills
"a body like a book, with pictures"
her mermaid skin is a riot of colours under  a threatening sky   #haiku #haikuchallenge
the false zip on the hip was just to confuse You and try Your patience
getting closer  to feeling perfect
there’s a lot more to love than I used to know
Your eyes do wonders for my face
Your words speak to me
i put away my guard for good
You capture what i think
i tell You so much when i’m thinking about You
"seeking You, in successive breaths"
my dream has a face
our coming together was not a strange twist of fate   we came together because we were meant to be
listening to You is like seeing trees come into leaf
words are our currency
a dirty martini  behind every story
"happy as a woman, starved as a lover"
You over the entirety
kiss again before the kisses dry
"without You in my life, i fear my blood won’t flow"
sweat out Your vices on me
my kosher heart lies with You
mistakes that could have been ties
every flower has a scent; some are even  blooming edible!  #haiku #haikuchallenge #writingprompt
Your whiskered face  my bare thighs a black art
explore beyond fingers
dreams not hearts lead astray
You and i we understand love  differently
women in men’s shirts barefoot all day long  upholding a quiet power
layer upon layer of thick shell and a flash of vulnerability
fold back Your sleeves
inner spaces  as empty as outer space
"if You watch how wildly i flip a pancake, You’ll want to crush me so bad"
i want to live the story You’re writing
belief is my religion
You have the me no one else has
"yet again, the brightness has erased the stars  my dawn, i miss Your light"
it’s hurting how the night has stopped on me
i want to be the only one who can feel Your touch
i want us holding hands beyond my twilight years
she’s the quietest spirit in a choir of angels
tufts of wet grass keep getting caught in my hair  so i rest my head on His chest
interlocked tongues writing swirling love notes and inking hearts
read me something from Your favourite book
the wind is scented with spring and so is her hair
"some new feelings, fulfilled old desires"
know my ache by feel
You showed me that i was ready to be loved
"i am rammed earth, unyielding to the firewall around Your heart"
meditation is divine but nothing compares to the journeys madness makes
"enveloped in Your shadow, a whole new me"
"she is a saga You’ll want to study, closely"
i feel connected to the universe when You touch me
"peace of mind, a fallacy"
write for me  until my heart melts away
"noiseless eyes, cacophonic heart"
take my hand and walk me through an oasis of green
carving our names into trees loving the wilderness back
"Your palm, my choker"
don’t look for the stars tonight  my sighs are dressed in clouds
it’ll be a meteoric night when i sleep in familiar arms
be the mirror to my future
"the sound of silence when i rest in Your arms, undiluted and primal"
no feeling is ever the same twice  make it count
tears worthy of passion
hearts opening  in the same breath
the fire ravaged me
"every thought, a possibility"
darkness is the real star
a kiss without stopping for breath would make a great conversation starter
stars couldn’t outshine the spark between us
her ordinariness  is unique
the way You write... the way You touch... there’s a storm in Your hands
"feelings have a way of finding a heart, but not always"
You were worth a detour
"if our love is a home, Your words are its heart"
sunrays like elegant fingers on my skin
the sun seems a stranger
miles from the ocean of Your breaths  floating on my lips
an overcast sky of morning kisses
find us a solitary spot under the sky  and life will be blissful
"in thoughts, we wed"
bottomless narcosis and fuck
the night gets darker and the darkness wilder
"savage lover,  soften Your intention just for a moment"
my thoughts flow  with Your words
whispers like a cache of drugs
Your voice could set spirits on fire
wondering if You know me or love me more
You set my heart at a different pulse
You drift from the clouded to the clear  spaces in my head
i hold Your hand to escape the fear
You pulled me under the shower of insatiable desires  and i am now drenched in madness
this thing You call love feels like war
craving painful pleasures
"know this, my bones will emit Your scent and perfume the sea they’re immersed in"
the pain  of being in love
immortal love and other intense discoveries
i didn’t have to let go of Your hand when You said goodbye   because we weren’t holding hands   it’s just one of the countless ways You save me heartbreak   i love that
"half breathless, half flying"
Notting Hill blossoms  emerging before springtime is what love feels like   #haiku #haikuchallenge #writingprompt
she spent all her days  simply watching the ocean  as he swam indoors   #haiku #haikuchallenge #writingprompt
a beacon in a blue check shirt
Your eyes turn a clearer blue as i cover the distance between us
"take me to bed, touch me to bits"
wipe my mascara tears and give me an encouraging nod
Your fingertips follow the scent of my skin in our silent moments  and i smile knowing You’re going to write about the feeling
You linger  in the most intimate places
a limitless stretch of words is all i have to reach You
i want love to never leave me unmarked
"anyhow, goodbye, someday and other acerbic words"
"loving You, all through my tough days"
"no postcard is pretty enough as the view of us that i imagine, staring at the ceiling in the dark"
"in a world of shimmering stars, she’s a quiet moonbeam"
lengthy dinners and ceaseless conversations
just had sex that’s left me shivering and euphoric   and by sex i mean chilled chia pudding with Alphonso mango and passion fruit coulis
touch me and undo my flaws
let the world isolate while our tongues make love
"canines shaped like toblerones, but she’ll win You with her pure and radiant smile"
"inside her heart, windows everywhere"
she is art You’ll want to take home
"how perfectly the crescent moon is spooning the darkness,  it’s beautiful and tormenting to watch"
nothing speaks so powerfully as a beating heart when it’s embracing love
turn our backs on the impossible and fuck
You got the real me
envious of the silk tie that gracefully hangs around Your neck
forgetting how to roll eyes and other pitfalls of being a good girl
a world of soft music and uncontainable passion
a bookmark in the shape of Your signature
stay long enough  to really be mine
"my every exhalation, Yours"
when hunger turns to honey
"You and i, bonding with every sleep"
Your eager tongue running along the lip of my mind teasing it open and reaching deep into my imagination
our love could be described as a muse
i fancy a Beast sharing my bed
sniffing the night air has become a ritual
"wet hair, dark eyes turning hot with steam, full lips wet and pink, foam strands trickling down my neck"
"ask me how dirty i feel and i’ll tell You that i watched myself in the little mirror on the bathroom wall cabinet, through the glass door of my shower"
listen to trip hop and fuck
You turn to look at me and i wonder if the world was always so gracious
i live for the moments of feeling the words You write for me
the only magic like Your poetry  is Your poetry
"onto the hard rocks and into the warm sea, let’s run away"
the muted roar of shy eyes
"pause, just a moment  longer  i want to feel You lengthen"
"beneath You, the warmth  of midday sun"
"skim, dip and settle"
"my eyes are a blank page, looking for a sign of You"
i want to kiss Your palms and beguile my senses with the scent of oud wood under the cuffs of Your white shirt
"we’ll create heat, whatever the weather"
"tears are human, not feminine"
keep coming
"my love is frail, my love is feisty  my love is imperfect but it holds  a lot of promise"
"those who don’t find anything special in me, revere the One who says i am treasure"
please tell Your idle hands to never forget i have curves
Body pump Saturday
bathe my lips in a red dawn of morning kisses
"languid wine, soft moonshine and Your poetry roaring by the fireplace"
the blissful calm cast by the dying sun    #zenverse
He’s fluent in the language of touch
You and i  and a mountain home
"can’t find words for kisses so pure and innocent, i’ll leave them oral"
the real glow of love  is on the inside
You pick up my vibes like they are snowflakes about to dissolve
Your voice calling my name tolls like a bell in my head
You kissed goodbye just as my body warmed up
beneath the surface a fatigued heart slamming  to share one more breath  with You  #zenverse
Your eyes stop conversation
the purpose of the journey is to misplace fears along the way   #zenverse
"before i could say the words, the feeling passed"
a sky of love too beautiful for sunsets
the blue of Your eyes is the hottest colour
pleasant thoughts of You leap through the chaos in my mind
her smile sings of brightness and hides no sorrows
i want to experience all of Your ideas
remember that first time You used my mouth? i’ve worn waterproof mascara ever since
darkness has a generous soul and an unspeakably soft voice
the half life of sensations
choking is believed to steady the nerves
"arching like a feline, smiling at You my breasts suspended over an ocean"
love is the scent of blossoms after the rain
You and i talk in words that mean the same thing in every language
will i ever make it past the fringe  of Your darkness?
there are clouds rushing across the evening sky  alas my inner thighs remain pale
come when the sun withdraws
a friend called nature
You’re a ray of sunshine amid errant clouds with fading linings
"Your skin, a spell"
"Your arms, a garland Your breath, a salve"
love the way You kiss my forehead and ask about my day  as i undo the buttons on Your shirt
mums are more beautiful than daughters
envious of the way the sun stripped the night
her eyes clamour prayers
"my lips are weary of hungering, and tired of saying it often"
the night air brings out innate desires
"tell me honestly, how brittle is my core?"
let me seduce You a moment longer before You break in
"slow, stealthy fuck"
clinging to You and scrawling pleas of mercy on Your marble back
You have only to say ‘come’  #123words
"touch every curve, waken every nerve"
i’d probably disintegrate if You pulled a chair out for me
You lick blood like it’s cherry gravy
the incense of nudity
the good things in life aren't collectible
"in Your absence, i’ve spent every moment  with You"
"if a woman is romantic, they say she's crazy"
the way her heart escapes into His embrace and other furies
remote access and fuck
could i live with You to feel better?
"misread word as world and it’s true, words are never just words"
who else thinks about You i wonder? whom else do You sometimes miss?
what else apart from tears will it take to say i love You deeply?
keep me on Your mind but not if it feels like treachery
i wonder if the heart would still be alive without memories
You hide in the dimples of my smile
thinking about You without skipping a beat
lay Your hands  on everything pink
i can’t turn pages of a book without thinking about Your eager hands
44 Mondays until Christmas
You fucked my mind at its tidiest
it’s easy to forget how much there is to say when You press mouth on me soon as we’re together
"part graffiti, part wound"
"living is best done with another soul beside You, not just a body"
without Your touch my wings disappear  #123words
the trouble with You is me
wearing a super soft kiss me quick black sleepshirt   Just thought You’d like to know
the rich colour of adulterated kisses on skin
in a cheeseboard frame of mind
tell me You had to look hard to find me
"a thong is also a strip of leather used for whipping, bet You already knew that"
"in a kiss, the heat of a full moon"
anything but this dull emptiness
torment  the silence   why don’t You?   #123words
left my heart in His care  across many miles
"solid heart, sensitive moods"
"there’s more heat, less light  in this universe of ours"
"my love strives without windows beneath a low ceiling, give it room to breathe i plead You"
kisses beside the Thames
"nurture my madness, ruin my thirst"
the way You look at me and smile i blend with the flowers
shall i be a lotus or a butterfly?
You know me better than i know You
from downward dog to firefly
from half moon to airplane
from warrior to wild thing
feelings are rarely misunderstood
"such a stalker, this longing"
show me how much love i deserve
i’m going to satisfy You endlessly
tears tell better stories than smiles
"i want violence, You want tears"
i’m out of even residual pain
You bring my world to life
"spank harder, i’m not dynamite"
coo and fuck
my detachable bra strap is Your leaving present
i’d rather touch You than a piece of the moon
the fire we make could turn winter back
come like the storm and carry me away
more comfortable talking about You than myself
a perfect kiss can take so many forms
my fortitude will be the thing You notice last
the dark romanticism  of brown kohl in brown eyes
"a high ponytail because, very wanton"
misread glamour as Gandhi
most my thoughts  defy my fragility   #123words
Zythology – study of beer
Sphygmology – study of the pulse
Sarcology – study of fleshy parts of the body
Philematology – act or study of kissing
Orthoepy – study of correct pronunciation
Nephology – study of clouds
Kalology – study of beauty
Irenology – study of peace
Dosiology – study of doses
this compelling need to go beyond   #123words
in Your arms a Sufi relief   #123words
sexily draped  in a fine pair of hands
You know me down to a fine art
mouth the words as You read them and taste my mind
a hug like seas meeting
the words You choose are clean  the sensations they evoke are sinful
got myself a souvenir mug of Your city just so i could imagine us having coffee together every morning
dressed  for You in everything black   #123words
take more space inside of me   #123words
how many acres is Your heart?
loneliness contaminates
a hip scarf of bruises looking like scarlet poppies
almost midnight and i’m still unwrecked what sorcery is this?
smiling at the unsmiling past
"beneath Your hands, once stood a temple"
"savage lover, i’m kneeling  down to my hips in need of You"
double bass and fuck
"on our first ever night, the darkness will be beautiful in its completeness"
"an ache gnaws at my heart, at all hours"
i’m full of love just waiting
what insanity is this? i stare at the blankest wall and find contours of my body lingering
love You can’t say what it is You can only say what it isn’t
have tea with me
i’d dance with You to a storm but i can’t bear the noise of Your goodbye
trimmed hair but left just enough for You to fist
spanks are an applause for being shameless
without You the stars pale
play with the clay i’m made of
"alone, breathing feels like losing"
let’s not blink and lose any more time
eyes that take me in whole
lucid eyes opaque intentions
love and You  are one
"do You see how i don’t care if it’s walking on the moon or being buried, as long as it’s with You?"
never knowingly flirting
wordless thoughts  thoughtfully expressed
i  need You more than breaths   #123words
come and gently stroke my wings   #123words
let’s sway this way and that to lazy lounge
caressing Your words through the glass screen in low light   like a lunatic
buried by a glance
still my mind with the click of fingers
You left me with no peace
flowers smiling in the dark  luring fireflies
wish i could immerse in Your presence
You reject my demands so gracefully
tonight i feel like the wind that got fed up of sighing and turned into an animal
can we not do without partings?
Your hands inflamed with vengeance
i yearn for You as sleep for a dream
"i say goodbye and turn away, then walk heavy as if against the wind"
snuggle up close  like sunrise over the ocean
i long to rest in Your fire
peered for a moment  before You caught me looking
bound in gratitude  and teary eyed
the harmony of breaths and rhythms
the night sky holds no charm if i can’t fall into Your arms as i look up at it
there are aspects of my womanhood You understand better than i do
does impatience deserve blame?
Your smile alarms me and it feels delicious
irretrievable moments.... unposted letters.... and other thoughts as i walk
stillness and darkness cannot coexist
soften me into succulence
the unique ways  You tough love
You’re the colour in my history
inhaling Your skin the morning after and other enduring obsessions
be the music that puts me to sleep every night
for You i’d cross the threshold  without a shiver of hesitation
i want a private garden of Your smiles
"the night has poured too much darkness, i can scarcely breathe without being held"
the bed felt warm as i lay in it maybe it is pitying me
spill Your wine from Your mouth into mine
there’s poetry in the way she walks barefoot on the grass
the pleasure of giving pleasure
"a simple beauty, like a photograph of us"
glimpses of You in the mirror that smiles back
let’s lace fingers
i never feel ready       to make the journey                 of walking away                                from You
my name on Your tongue softer than cashmere
my unwritten words are about You
predictive text changed sin to sunshine
love is the laureate of sin and it’s also the key to inner peace
spirit animating sex
Your absence stills my heart
sleep with me through flame and smoke
an endless stream of eloquent moans
"nibbles, not just whispers"
changing moods like the faces of the moon
slender neck delicately bent  right back
the ache heightens in the darkness
thinking about the same thing  in new ways
petulant lips always wanting more
my desires run to You and my love runs with them
"in Your smile, a promise  of an early summer"
thank you for gripping my hair and leaving sexy beachy waves tumbling from it
flamboyantly blossoming
miles away  from a desired feel
Your words always find a way to touch my lips
i keep thinking we’re kissing  but it’s just me reading Your words
my chaos is not so simple as it seems
i worship without using words or hands
i want to be the book that covers Your chest every night
the clatter darkness makes
i undress before Your eyes  without raising my eyes
grope me out of the blinding light of consciousness
flights of imagination to quiet places where lovers go
my libido is flickering   and it hurts
wasting in anticipation
just to touch the bedlinen You’ve slept on
a permanent bed of love in a temporary home of lust
confine me to Your bed and tell me about rest of the penalties
perverted beauty before morals
there are words on my timeline that complement thoughts i didn’t plan to write
Your dirty mind nurtures my every wanton thought
love that grows with every passing moment
do Your fingers miss playing with my hair?
a story of savorous skins
Your fingers become so expressive  as if making up for long spells of idleness
filled to overflowing  with animalism
"what You feel, i reflect"
wish my sighs could still Your feet when they walked away from me
You’re my hidden treasure
You keep looking at me as if there’s romantic literature written all over my face
feed me the forbidden fruit and put me to sweet use
inextinguishable craving
a mere thought of You  is one long orgasm
mental exertion and other sensual gratifications
exhaust Your fury upon me
without pain  lessons go unlearned
long intervals of sinfulness along a life of high morals
You held my gaze so intensely no one could tell how intimate we’d been
He finds my imperfections part of my charm
You reign in the heart of my darkness
tears are part of desire
bite and love me whole
"she’s got lips that woo, and a smile that seeps deep down inside"
kiss me with Your innate elegance  and purify my indecent tongue
a wild thing  mellowed by a heatwave  of caresses
my body is excited by Your tempest but my soul pants for Your tenderness
He observes her like one would a silent star
is innocence weakness?
my riches are always about You  everything else is needless
You’re no small influence
"i’m shy, not fearful"
can hearts love without minds connecting?
You showed me how to never dream in vain
L'Auberge rouge
You love in ways that can never be forgotten
i want You beside me in those peaceful days that follow the storm of our lovemaking
"it’s so tedious watching the night deepen i want You, an instant darkness"
all morality  gone awry
"Your love is hungry, mine is starving"
my heart wants no one else's hand prints
You left Your thirst on my lips
our romance in Your language  and other rare books
let me be Your light tonight
my words are my emotions
i’m always willing  but not always delicate
"thinking about You with fondness, passion and trembling"
You seem a breathless lifetime away
nothing is ugly for You  i love that
smiles that arrived  and never left
many healings have been pretended
i don’t love to be loved  i love for the pleasure of loving
Undeniable
i’d rather have an unhurried kiss than wish upon a shooting star
flesh is just play doh that’s intended to be tasted
toughen Your temperance i’m coming begging
do You want me  or just the best of me?
fuck the yell out of me
fuck-all-night love ©
the sensuality of solid things
You should’ve seen the way i fell in what i thought was love
"imagining Your rough hands on me, i used to instinctively crumple and tear the honeycomb foil from a box of cigarettes  i miss smoking"
said i’d give up cigarettes if i could smell of You endlessly  i now smell of no cigarettes and still no You
high tar cigarettes seemed to benumb the insufferable longing   i miss smoking
i used to blow endless curls of smoke and write You cursive messages of love in the darkness on the terrace   i miss smoking
cigarette smoke used to obscure the miles and stop me feeling intimidated by the distance between us  i miss smoking
i lie in wait with an outstretched heart  when You tell me You’re heading home
equable silence and other worthwhile conversations
i often imagine You writing or reading
You’re an untranslatable feeling
His taste never fluctuates
my love is an extension of my soul
may our ends touch
i love how Your poetry describes my body
the arch of her spine and other extremities
You kissed my heart at its weakest point
this slab of a body curves into decorative 𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒄𝒔 in Your hands
nights without You  i embolden with music
Sierra India Romeo
You elevate my humility
despite everything  i shine
i confess that i feel
what You see as bondage to me means freedom
pull aside  my silky scarf  to softly kiss  my warm neck
the fever on our skins  when we silently talk dirty  as i walk beside You  is called sex
servile lips  battered and bleeding  as minced mulberries
to live a life as large as a storm
"words flaming, every syllable weighed  voice deep, breath unchanging Your dark, dark whispers"
the happiness  and the pain  that You give me i’d die if it lasted  even a moment longer
stir my thoughts until they’re loose
a book of our conversations
this abysmal distance  keeps me from getting home  to You
Your domineering gaze  anchors the end of the tightrope  and i walk steadily towards You
kiss me again in Your biting way
You fill me with fear You relieve me of it
kisses feeding off breaths
whole of You  or just a little will do too
show me how to cover up and hide this love
more than half the heat is hidden
that feeling when i fall  into Your hands
our love pure and wild and natural  like a hot spring
facing each other across the sea
i’ll behave more interestingly than wine
"i misbehave, but only a little"
our conflicting hands  feeling so dense with need
i love You in limitless ways not all of them can be put into words
Carpe vinum  Seize the wine
i see Your fire in the sunset
glowing in the hue of Your words  feeling loved
sink...  ... somewhere
"freshly cut what shall i give You, my Beloved Valentine?"
You haven’t said You love me but i know You do
You filled my life with the colour of new beginnings
our love obscures every virtue
the pains of love grow stronger when we get together
let’s wrestle and get warm
inhaling You is all it’ll take  to ease the deep unrest within me
without You the night can’t grow any fuller
"love, once felt, immortalises you"
"our bond, so tender  and unbreakable"
You’re the soul of my heart
i see Your face at every summit
deny me fearlessness
You love so well
let’s just bleed into each other
kissing and loving as we sleep  off and on
one heartbreak  for every season
tears that didn’t run  vanished in the clouds
unforgiving eyes  scanning my every thought
bend my night any way You like
You see the invisible in me
an eternal soft mist of passion  in the bosom of our love
do Your hands feel the muffled murmurs of butterflies inside me?
i keep kissing  until He stops
my mind’s as immaculate as the linen shirt You take off after a long day
azure eyes and other celestial habitations
"i want to dress up in Your loving touch, and finish with a face veil of Your whispers telling me i look beautiful"
i swoon when people say ‘you’ and mean both of us
intimacy without blanks
"it is sufficient if You think about me, once, before You blink again"
lying on a park bench watching the drifting clouds calligraph our names in the sky
do You miss the blots my handwritten letters used to have?
one day  i hope You’ll give me Your arm  as we walk
what are breaths for  if not to recite the heart to a lover?
"what colour is Your need? (if You can see a colour, You’re not needing me enough)"
my mind’s been looking for You all day
silence attracts too much attention
nothing wrecks like hormones
echo of Your voice  and other mesmerisms
yellow as fire daffodils staying fresh forever are perhaps the contents Your soul is made of
a canopy.... of all the tweets that went over my head
the words have just been said the feeling goes way back
"i know You love to talk dirty but let me just say, that body of Yours is a zen garden"
tough little shapeshifter heart
happy for all the words here that keep discovering themselves in paraphrases
breasts al dente
You say i’m valuable and then play with me all the time
the garden is too full of colour the lake is too full of swans  all i want is You and darkness
i want a fatty slice of Your life
even Your curses are steeped in love
"leave Your aggression on my skin  then write for me, dove-soft poetry"
"brain of a bird, heart of a beluga"
i’ve been permissive a few times  but You overwhelmed the submissive in me
"if like happiness, grief could make you hum too, one could just lull the sadness away"
"when the soul shakes, that’s when the magic happens"
let’s go the distance  i’ll be brave
i want to claim all of Your darling words for myself
i trust Your storm enough to leave it in peace
Pre V Day TOTD
i’m the kind of collapsible You can’t leave alone
"words are flowing like i’ve drunk wine when in fact i’ve only just made up my mind about having it, tomorrow"
her soft purring and other spells
the stark madness  of her wildcat mind
some thoughts are unsinkable rascals
hush my hisses  by biting the thigh deeper
a painful verse in her every sigh
the sacred beauty of a mind fully undressed
there is no warmth in burning
love leaves without fanfare
the craving for primal pain is inescapable
i’d forsake molten gold for the taste of Your skin
i opened my hips for You
a string of servility   draped around her bowed neck
my limbs are numb from straddling winter
privacy with You is a luxury
asserting femininity with imperfections
poetry as embellishment  of love
"plant, don’t pluck flowers feed the bees this Valentines"
i like everything spoken in Your voice
"Beloved, those sensations deserve a second life"
Your every fond embrace  a reinvention of love
break gasps with kisses
"eating a very noisy salad, unapologetically"
inadvertently misreading words and smiling at the signs from the universe
a quick “i love You!” on a napkin in Your packed lunch
love could lead to accidental demolition
loving You  through distressed breaths
doesn’t make sense to be held by anybody else
the grandeur of pheromone-rich sex
come witness the horrors of hard core longing on soft linen
i’ve got infinite grace  steal my glory
"if You can get away, take me along"
only You will do
kisses full of meaning and passion
i’d rather have fewer kisses  but Your ones
i want one goodnight kiss  on each eye
a night dotted with flames
to vanish  inside Your kiss
kindness is...  pinning the tweet that got ignored
our skins are in love
no how or why not tonight
"Your flesh, my claws"
i repent no sin
i will challenge Your roughness  with my readiness
"even if there is no such thing as love, love me"
"if i knew i had less than a minute to live, i’d kiss You again"
how copiously You love
the waves are ecstatic from the horizon spilling over them  that’s how it feels to be loved
i miss Your sexy broad smile
"what i long for, lives in me"
a perfect lip cleavage  to say how happy i am to see You
the pendulum of pleasure rarely swings in my favour
Mother Earth is on heat tonight
You make me feel hopelessly naive and i fucking love that
"once upon a time, it was impossible to believe eyes could really sparkle simply from thinking about someone"
grateful for burdens lightened by Your touch
i want to read all the words You scratched out today
i’ll never ask more of You than what You give willingly  i’m tough like that
she’s dangerous in the wrong hands
"one might as well fall in love with the night, or the sky, or a tree  anything that bears no separateness"
no rest for those who love
Your facile touch lay bare a discreet spot
"there is no harmony in the universe without You, even the stars look like a mess in the sky"
thoughts of You made it easy to find my way in the dark
i’ve imagined being close to You ever since the earth and sky have been apart
love is no mild illness  it’ll make you forget to cry for help  even though it has no cure
our love is infinity-shaped
tear everything piece of clothing that clashes with Your teeth on my skin
my love knows no finish line
poised between innocence and kink
dewy eyes won’t distill the pain so i cry a river as i suffer
a voice that dimmed the lights
"i wear new heels, black and high then sit at His feet and wait to be scooped into an embrace"
a room of our own  in the sky
Amore et melle et felle es fecundissimus  Love is rich with honey and venom
a peck on Your heart through the buttonhole
be carefree with Your roughness
"let’s open our hearts, cross mountains, fly over skyscrapers and watch the sun go down before settling in a nest of intimacy"
"going to find words stronger than the pain, hoping You notice"
the hunger for You begins skin-deep
hope You’ve spotted atleast one sign of my love today
must feel lovely to keep warm with a lover’s sock around the neck
the scent of You in every room of my heart
i need to feel as much of You as possible
i breathe You in every still and silent moment
i’m worth cramming into Your day
knowing someone intimately is not love
i think enough to write a book
apologies are flawless
happily chaotic
"kisses, not words bites, not kisses"
my worries melted just as You kissed
never think about me without salivating
You’ve given me so much to look back to
i don’t have anywhere i yearn to be other than in Your arms
You find beauty in the simplest of words and here i am learning new languages for You
let every illusion become real
"no matter how different, i see our worlds as one"
"Your love is in my blood now, bringing to my skin a deep lustre"
forgive me for thinking i knew how deep Your love is
let’s walk hand in hand  and follow the moon
make me watch You unfold my shame
You break me as if mercy is tedious
irresistible invitations
You slip into my mind quicker than i slip into a floaty beach dress
get Your hands  back on me
the dirty play  of light and shade
love inspires freedom
lust awakens thoughts
hot whispers and icy breaths
i may not have the body Your wine does  but i will evoke ecstasy the moment thoughts of me touch Your mind
promise me the magic of healing
"All day and all night, 'til sunrise 🎵"
Your sexual heights make me dizzy
"lying with You under the sun, in the silent spaces between the trees"
"You take the winning, i’ll take the reward"
the sun is hollering but let’s stay in bed
leave marks plenty of them
i’ll serve You anywhere
the jewellery of new compliments
"think of me, peeling away layers"
You come and go and ebb and flow  like the contours  of my body
you won’t find her softness  until she loves you completely
"my cravings are not chic as cashmere  they’re boisterous, indelicate and lewd"
fears want blindfolding
"Sufis were right, satiation in love is temporal"
our reality  i hold within me
You are darker than i have the power to imagine
my sleep rests in the sway of Your breaths
without being Yours  i can’t cope with being at all
carry me through life
days that shine  through the years
"my heart leapt at You with such vigour,  scabs of old wounds got cast off"
there’s no getting away from my world
i feel more repulsed by Your absence than a pack of red quinoa and sesame ryvita slices
terrified of my own eagerness
"if you want to do something, the best way is to ask"
i came to You with nothing
come my way easily someday
keeping me away from the zephyr of Your presence  is same as poisoning me
only You can make me say  my prayers
perfume my bare heart with Your love
happy only in connectedness
lured by the taste of raw
hand holding and other salient traits
words open minds
when You started to talk i totally forgot about the music that was playing
unravel me till i feel no pain
Your tongue amplified my screams
"go where You have to, just don’t forget to return"
tirelessly sketching a new world
what am i to do with myself all night?
Your love could get me through the longest and loneliest of nights   But that’s not the point!
i’ve yet to read a book written about love such as ours
i love my bruises
soft breaths and quiet thinking
can Your tender heart withstand the roar of my inordinate desires?
Your hands become a tornado when they touch me
every kiss ends with hope
for You i’d kill every emotion
what once was shell  is now a woman  incandescently beautiful
"once a soul touches yours,  the wind never blows so cold again"
inner lives awaiting liberation
"bless my delicate heart, it carries the burden of bottomless desires"
saddest feelings buried in honest smiles
she’s so much more than that scar
pauses punish and torment like nothing else
"our naked selves, a fine spectacle of warring breaths"
lead me into the heart of Your existence
i want our yesterday
ruin me with Your healing hands
cradle me as i wake
nothing casts a glow like Your smile when our eyes meet
true love suffers and is silent  true love ruins and roars
i want kisses that last
intimate conversations are best made in nakedness
where would my orgasms be without Your filthy whispers
we’re the perfection many are still searching for
i’d rather have dreams of finer quality than sleep
alone  there’s no way  beyond the horizon
dreaming fantasies  in my sleep
the stars in the sky must envy the darkness that the moon is so eager to illuminate
"let go, You whispered  and i felt the journey coming to an end but then You loosened the hold around my neck"
the stillness could tear my veins
never fully dressed  without Your eyes on me  never dressed enough with Your eyes on me
everything about delirium has meaning
"i love the me You love, even though i seldom see her"
her supple fingers  constantly seek texture
an incredible release  as above so below
i’m really more at home away from home
read to me
Your love makes me brave
sink deeper  till i feel Your warmth  in my belly
peace exists  only in the moment
goodbyes leave me parched
kiss and rubify  my heart space
i seduced Him with the eroticism of a yogi
music brings You right back to me
what He wants is elemental what He wants is my life
will You still love me when i don’t feel the pain?
Your bare back a visual poem
vulnerability under a veil of black
the difference between saying a prayer  and worship
my yearning will lead You home to me
my tongue will leave  no freckles unconnected
plant me in a remote corner of Your heart and i’ll still take over
You’re my rock   now let me be the sleeping animal that crouches on it
You make me ouch out loud
You’re the distraction i carried down the aisle
i’m not here to quench a thirst  i’m here to get drunk
peeping seductively at heaven   from underneath You
i plead You to do what You so desperately want to
i didn’t mean to sext but ac changed face to cave
i didn’t mean to sink teeth in
love simplifies the feelings lust complicates
a thousand thoughts  but not the ones i like
i plunged into the dark  and found You
"cast to the side, my waking life and feel my love flow out, every night"
are Your nights mighty enough without me?
every smile i wore today was from remembering You
a deep voice with such an obvious fondness
please wear an unbuttoned white shirt to my dream tonight
i embrace You momentarily  like spring flowers festoon trees  before they quake and fall
think of what’s forever Yours
let’s spend the year sailing an island
Your caresses like fine rain
give me everything  except interruptions
"once bitten, not easily forgotten"
wall fuck ©
oh the silent exploits of Your inky smile
"i love old eyes and the graceful, great lines around them"
everyone had the good intention to dress up my wounds  nobody but You looked deeper than my heart   it was my soul that needed caring
one more day this month  for us to live as one
remind me to lock Your scent into my skin before we say goodbye
"the more i think about You the more my fantasies double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple..."
the chemistry of desires
let’s be all breaths and limbs
You lick my underlip i mess my underwear
we’re a marriage that wasn’t meant to be
i love the contrast we make
my stretchy and vibrant patterned knee length socks have such gripping cuffs   Just thought You’d like to know
a running hot shower viscerally takes you far down memory lane
hands on me let’s go
i came here to hide  and You found me
feel the spaces  then fill them
Your hand should be in mine right now
lionesses tire too
How beautifully our tongues proemiate
Conculate no feelings
Fromshapen morality
this mad love is above all my instincts
You have the right touch
writers chase perfection   poets simply make love  with words
i prefer maximalism
musing to the pinnacle
"for You, i’d try a chocolate truffle flavoured with Japanese vinegar  i’m tough like that"
eternity is always one more kiss away
find meanings  in my garbled pleas
He tells me all the ways He’ll hurt me then asks me if i’ll be brave  it’s on occasions like this that i find it easiest to express just how much i trust Him
Your escapism lies beyond my slender red lips
exposed my fears to a Beast i’m tough like that
i can never find the words  but i hope You’re pleased to see me trying
my darkness covets the glittery jewels of dirty whispers You scatter
a throng of voices in my ears none of them speaks to my heart the way Yours does
i know better than to tempt Him
ever fallen in love with a language not your own?
great music is a deterrent to unhealthy food  enjoying a song will stop you feeding yourself junk  science?
His tenderness a phenomenon
the spaces behind my knees and the hairs on the back of my neck always know when You’re near
the anticipation  is epic
i once wore a sari for You in my dream
i’m all caught up
i’d been so eager to devour You but my lips quivered when You pulled me closer
"just like Your presence, Your absence is momentous too"
a heart full of longing feels like a heavy sea  leaning into the ocean
we wear the same darkness  we bear the same depravity
Your words have my heart
defeat me by loving me
i’d never lift my chin off Your chest  if i could watch You sleep
wary of Your softness
would love still be as beautiful without words?
the sweet inferno  of impulse
come closer  go where You want to
how powerful does this love make You feel?
our love story is bookmarkless
"lie still dear heart, breathing space is just a few more sleeps away"
caress and create  stillness
the only way to reach me is through my flaws
it's way too easy to make me cry  no one knows it but You
grab my hand and change direction
"if only i could roll Your fingers around my tongue like wine, i would write the poetry of love a deeper red"
these words flow only to escape into Your heart
imagining You raging inside me
"like a storm, You’re always impending"
commit Your feelings to me
carrot batons fall like dominoes inside my mouth when the mind’s hard at work
"soften a little, please  let me brace"
i drink Your sated smile  as You lie in bed watching me piece myself back together
You say things i want to tell everyone about
beyond limits  all is possible
reach for me till You feel me the most
do what feels good
"my eyes, closed  my heart, open my hereafter, Yours"
i want to ease into the night curled inside You
feel me wherever You are
You left me a little sore  but healed
i feel dizzy when i hear Your voice  and when You’re silent
my heart beats violently when You’re close  and when You’re gone
Your fierce love takes me hostage
Your questions are more revealing than my answers
i imagine the ‘she’ in Your words to be me
thank you for waiting for me  to become willing and fearless
"You know, don’t You, that our togetherness is an illusion until You come shatter it and pull me in Your arms?"
whom does Your hunger remind You of?
carry me into Your faraway future
i’ve exhausted myself dreaming of living in another world
homeward You thrust  and i smile till i weep
"You’re so elegant, i keep thinking"
be more mine
"You’re quiet, but ever present"
i’m overdue Your warmth
desires are powerful  like a prayer
haven’t yet accepted that turning in bed will not suddenly bring You in it
share with me my mayhem
i’d break nowhere but here
urgent goodbye kisses that leave skins groaning defiantly
i’d be much more alive if i could see You right now
it’s unsafe how curious i am
i seem to have a satanic thirst for severe agony and suffering at the hands of love
let’s take a walk a little way out of our lives
only You can fill the cracks in the darkness
how tirelessly You play
"lucid eyes, dark intent"
thoughts trigger taste
it’s no accident that a mouth left unkissed for long will spout obscenities
my thighs tremble when Your eyes take a dive
i feel the surge of yearning  over and over again
come to me in my solitude
dusk is on the horizon  let me please  hand my night over  to You
her draw lies in her emotional openness
Your chosen muse  i become eternal in Your poems
experiencing and embracing new intimacies
i’d give so much of my love  it’d fill Your heart so vast  and still spill out
use Your darkness to cut through my sweetness
to entwine until we meld and sink into the depths of decadence
grow dark on me
let’s hide anywhere but here
come over here and admire the brooch of teeth marks on my breast
the consoling power of sunshine
You’re the dream  between my awakenings
i struggle to take one full breath without wanting You
Your smile makes me feel great to be alive
i’m just on the other side of everything
i love to hear You describe Your understanding of my mind
the heaven within You is my home
“each inhalation a new beginning  each exhalation a new ending”
desiring You is a daily ritual
let’s relive those covert passions
let’s put life on hold and enjoy the luxury of being lost in each other
i have weaknesses You will enjoy
You’re everywhere but here
earth so dark the moon had to find it
smudge the boundaries  as You kiss my darkness
surreal to think how surprisingly tender Your kiss was
together we dream  of a new universe
our words made love inside the postbox  Your letter arrived all crumpled
it’s 4 am in London 🎵
i will assert my fragility  by clinging to You
kiss and make up with these petulant nipples that won’t stop pouting at You
aren’t You just a little bit envious to think how the night always gets to pierce my calm and leave me breathless?
sit me in Your lap and i’ll tell You everything the night did to me in Your absence
our love will defy mortality do You agree?
whatever did i do to draw Your steely attention to my mouth?
on the edge of tears yet there’s nothing i fear
You’re a cache of drugs
panty lace peeping through clenched teeth
in Your arms i have known  all emotions of love
making love  to night-long percussions
torment until You taste bliss
rest Your cane  between my knees
Your love unraveled the labyrinth in me
hard willed soft hearted
may our destinies cross paths
"visiting mum is great except that there are so many teatime treats, i always forget to drink the tea"
more than half of what i unloaded from the dishwasher were beverage mugs
hashtag fuck me now
"fuck painkillers, bring me You"
do Your art books have the provocation i excite You with?
"the night we sleep together, a million secretions will develop into pearls in the ocean"
my heart seats one and there’s no standing room either
what colour is Your world? i’d smear it all over myself
such a tough whiff of Dominance in all Your words
the right kind of kiss can change your world
it’s still January  it’s still winter  i still remain in wait
"when You say You love my scent, could You be a bit more specific? my lips, skin, hair and panties all smell different"
chilly morning sobering thoughts not a word from You
Your eyes  an oasis of seduction
"there’s still more of me to be read, fixed, cared for"
Your musings are reflecting on my face
i said i lost You  You heard i love You but that’s okay
breasts like fudgy fennels flowering
she’s a tangible ray of sunshine
look at all our words mingling
i dreamed i saw You sitting beside me
fingercomb my hair for a while
bereft of kisses  like a night sky shorn of stars
was it the blues on the kitchen radio or was i lost in thoughts of You  i ended up cooking everything in twos
i don’t need the trappings of promises  just Your love
say no to everything  then tell me You love me
do You dream? do Your dreams have as much mystery and surprise as my body when it’s next to You?
is the bed You lie on delightfully voluptuous?
does the candlelit evening seduce You tirelessly?
does the blank canvas of Your days miss me?
do Your nights have the darkness You crave?
inhale my feelings to warm Yourself up
i’ll need rest before we go to bed
a love simply expressed  but special
a mouthful of You  for my pains
let the fire of Your words haul me out of the winter  of Your absence
please tell me to come
And an autumn bouquet
breaths want tensing
neck wants smelling
a smile like a first sign of spring
done writing about lust not done lusting
what might i expect tonight?
always bring a bottle
some flowers are called such brazen names  this may even be a metaphor
smiling uniformly through thoughts tender and hostile
sense me in the immediacy of sunset
forsake the horrid heart that forgot someone in their absence
TOTD
lend me Your scent for the night
ripples of want in an avalanche of need
give me a pen and paper and watch my graceful restraint vanish
capture my every mood
so many perversions  for us to embrace
blessed and cursed with a hyperactive mind  sometimes i read what isn’t written
sucked some poetry off His tongue to accentuate my femininity
i want to greet Your every morning with an offering of my naked bashfulness
i smile thinking about Your hand in my tresses  like a huntsman in a quagmire
take me to the realm of oneness  where time stands still
smiles curved into neverending circles
You took over my night entirely have You slept well away from me?
everything cast off we sleep
Won't you tell me who sings to you like me 🎵
"i want a beaker full of those grapes, fermented"
a prim pattern on my cheek  from the perforations in Your shoe
Your fingers pluck the strings and make my moans sing
put Your arms around me we’ve a long way to go
the moment You thought of me i became forever Yours
tears glistening inside her thighs  fragrant as humility
deny me tenderness
that pleasing waft of air  is my lashes fanning Your sweaty chest
tempered by eternal love
lusty honeysuckle eyes  that let You know i’m prepared for anything
the intoxicating scent of her inner riches
i wonder if blossoms understand our passion
the pleasures of battling Your fury
kiss me raw  under cascades of peonies
a single thought pierces all consciousness
the need shears  as the night swells
the ebb and flow of struggle
look at my love floating off bounds
there’s no good at all in the sea  unless a storm rolls down from it
pore over and pour into me
but i don’t feel empty inside at all just where hides this inscrutable hunger
stressed by Your silence
need no pleasantries for i’m no stranger  fist hair and growl in my ear soon as You lay eyes on me
devoured a pile of wild arugula in blissful absentmindedness
my heart lies content and sedated by Your love it’s this lecherous flesh that needs a forceful reminder of Your ownership
no matter where You’re going  i’ll come along
But using a safeword will leave no room for miracles
the need to feel
every kiss  a special occasion
i have a soft spot for everything that lingers
fuller the heart easier it’s lost to words
Your hands fondle me  like hooves of a warmblooded horse hitting the forest floor
always optimistic the sky will clear
sleeplessness has decided to stay the night
spot me cosying by the roaring fire
just say it  and i’ll drop everything
let my fierce heat bring You light
i’m a subtle flower  place me meticulously
And thanks to you i want to move 🎵
You are  my grandest reward
i don’t think they’re all valuable  but He likes to read all my thoughts
kiss back hard
every touch a soul connection
the most beautiful feelings are nameless
stub the bruises
it’s no coincidence that You can never smell the roses when i’m afar Just a bit of harmless sorcery
let me burn and perfume Your bedroom
every ensuing echo a new plea
liberated by a flurry of murmurs
cornered by punishing extremes
i’m lying in a bed on fresh cotton sheets  Just thought You’d like to know
i even crave the coffee You sip
what we need is another lifetime
ensnared by desires  at the strangest of hours
lying in an unmade bed mired in filth
what shall i sacrifice to hold You?
Your grip tightens and i know i’m doing something right
"If someone said, “You have to give your mind rest,” I’d say, “Fine, but for how long? How long before I can think about Him again?"
the only thing i bared was a smile  how did You end up looking into my heart?
words can shred
smiles are criminal a dainty curve effortlessly blots out a ruptured heart
a smile on the lips does not imply happiness in the heart  there is no positive correlation between the two
breathtaking  and moving moments
whiling away this lonely night thinking about the soothing pendulum motions of Your tongue
death is not an incident
heartbreak is difficult loss is lasting
darkest when He’s silent
the night is both  an ending and a beginning
more filth than flesh
He trusts my instincts more than i do
savage love. without question.
the palpable romance  of Your words and my charm
ethereally soft spaces inside me crave to pull You in
i feel keenly Your pangs of hunger
i enrage Him as if i’m invincible
i can almost feel the aftermath
i found the meaning of love  in the colloquy of our eyes
i miss You most  when i’m surrounded
coy little dark angel  she was crawling before she could even walk
let’s get warm
is it miles or galaxies that separate us?
take my hand bring it to Your lips
bleeding need and losing sleep
softly breathing through soft folds of darkness
come just a little  deeper
anything You say becomes sublime
nothing hurts  until You fade from sight
i’d rather have my heart broken  than break Yours
quiet down restless flesh
too much of me needs looking after
my eyes run when i smile  thoughts of You kept me smiling all night long
come and have a drink with me maybe You’ll stay maybe we’ll live
i remember the pattern of freckles on Your chest
i wish memories were savorous
You've seen the side of me  that has the most cracks
the stories stray feathers tell
caress me into doing better
perhaps love is humbling because happiness is fleeting
tongues clashing till we create the word love
You twist my nerves so callously
"when our kisses don’t speak the same language, i end up with a lip bleed"
Your memory is a magnet
simplest words are most honest too
Your touch unearthed long forgotten maidenly humility
with a deep belief in our love i lay my innocent heart  in the line of fire
real life begins in my dreams
blessed be my name that tastes Your voice every day
i could list places i’d like Your lips on but You’ve kissed me in so many more
there’s so much to devour in Your words
darkness is essential  i’d feel naked without it
blindfolded  then turned on
like a road i curve up  the slope of Your body  to the summit  where You gather me in Your arms
You whisper in my ear  and my toes curl
i’ve stopped trusting myself without You
faces want hiding
flowers want choosing
pour Yourself into my every thought
never the same punishment twice  is why it’s so exciting to misbehave
while the eyes rest i feel so alive
i’m surviving on the spirit of our times past
i lost several breaths and beats as You loved me
i’m impossible to understand  carry on loving me in silence
my words are no poetry  but they tell our story and that humbles all manner of art
accused of being the lesser of the two evils we are
hour after hour Your fiendish sweat penetrates my skin
every day i seek asylum here
the thoughts here revive my thoughts
what do words want You ask  my every word wants You
pet wants teaching
angels want diving
limbs want burning
shame wants tearing
fantasies want mingling
my mind’s a dank pool of dirt today
Sir wants darkness
submissive wants Sir
cheeks want reddening
heart wants warming
smiles want stealing
soul wants soul
hands want holding
voice wants barring
mind wants reading
skin wants soaking
if only my blues could stretch up to the wild and brooding purple sky
fighting in vain the spasms inside that are desperate to keep me alive
i’m the autumnal leaf turned gold from green over time
i dared to lose control once  and everything else fell in place i never want it back
in my dream last night we kissed until my lips swell
You’re absent yet visible
what use is it to keep beautifying my need with elegant words  when the air around me is spiked with the scent of my arousal
silhouettes marrying moonlight
the magnificent rusticity  of our passion
it’s a crime how my orgasms have never lived to see daylight
this lust for You haunts me
spend the evening quietly reading my palm
innocence is best explored in the dark
"to finish, music and fine wine"
there is no language of smell and so I devour You in silence
as many loves as there are eyes to see it
a farewell that left me without anything to hang onto
heated skin looking for respite
life's too short  more so when we’re together
come and quieten my mind
i’m in no mood for mild
just to be Yours is sufficient satisfaction
You left me holding half a heart
i want to see You the next time i lift my lids
every wish i make i hear Your name in the same breath
forever unprepared for what You have in mind
i smell delicious but feel so filthy
i’m a wilting weed in need of Your obsessive care
Your touch dictates my moves
You sum up for me the finer things in life
You’ve changed the landscape of pleasure for me
lay Your eyes on me and peel away this dullness
the warmth of Your silence feels soothing
oh the hangover  of Your words
i promise You hours worth making time for
the candle flickers as i throw my robe open
fire-eating kisses
fingertip tracing a figure eight  You know where
the more You look at me  the darker i shine
no one has the magic of Your presence
touch me and grace my pale skin with the beauty of colour
this perpetual missing is a permanent fever
sometimes i strip just to feel You close
infinite emotions can touch the heart  but only soul touches the soul
sometimes fleeting moments linger in the heart
i fantasise about ruin as an escape
You own my senses  and my madness
take me every way i can’t think of
"You pour the wine, i’ll set the mood"
You need my scarf to alleviate the screaming
my spanked bottom   tanned the same colour as Your dirty mind
satisfying first  insatiable for second and more   shots of caffeine
You and i  we’re united by a passion  for extremities
wake me up with the graze of bristles around my mouth
love is planting a fruit tree together
"it’s the taste, of course, but it’s also the carafe i drink out of"
i owe my calm to You
are You moved to kiss  or keen on biting?
the raspiness of a hollow mouth
the marriage of seed to skin
i’m the dusting of seashore sand on Your solid back and between Your toes  i will cling and You’ll simply have to let me
bite where i ache kiss where i hurt
"anyway, hands on me"
how deep is Your need today?
how long can You make this night?
the spellbinding power of Your observation
why aren’t You moments away?
"people love, we blaze"
"i hurt easily too, but that is a secret i’m intent on hiding"
look at the naked dancing flame of the candle You light up this evening and remember the way my body moved to pleasure You
when i’m missing You deeply my hands start to tell me a story
You’ve taken over my thoughts and now my every feeling has Your initial on it
"as an offering tonight, i’ll write You words of love then burn them as incense"
do You miss me when i leave? do You smell the cushion of Your palm that rested between my thighs? do You feel me close then?
every time i exhale  go a little further
"my skin has more of an effect than a scent, don’t You agree?  look how wildly You breathe me all over before i’ve worn perfume"
i‘d like new rituals
not what has happened or what might be just this moment just us
i love the sweet ache and the soft sound of ‘need’
my need was so simple  You made it so wild
this whisper thin birdsong is the sound of my bare skin tingling in anticipation
Your darkness is my purest perception of the colour white
"He just threw me back together, nonchalantly"
i may look hauntingly beautiful now  but that’s because i had a troubled soul once
Your bare chest on my back  delightful as crisp cotton against sweaty skin
You’re the edge to my elegance
You’re more than just a part of life
obsessed with the appeal of suffering for You
i know You love feeding let me taste Your generosity
the hunger never quite stays away
i need downtime on my knees
bone aching rush of want
i kneel  to feel more stable
it’s a little early for bed and a lot late for foreplay
this talkativeness  is my disquiet dissolving
haven’t i deserved You for too long?
i’d like to go to sleep in Your bed
savage lover You’re the rightful upholder of the divine wrath of my devotion
i relish Your constantly changing moods through the night
Your love of art led You to me
the rough embrace of Your stare
over a thousand pairs of eyes on me including Yours  but it won’t stop me being bold enough to say  i love You
You take my hand and the future no longer seems a mystery
on Your mind i frolic in Your heart  i rest
i’m only here for a glimpse of You
Your mouth is easily attracted to the gravity of my neck
i’m the mysterious dark energy in Your universe
our love is an escape  from the conventional
the urge to worship  in blissful stillness  of dawn
"by midnight, i’m a tight knit sensory bundle of restlessness  and little else"
the parasol of Your darkness  to keep secret my filthy fantasies
i trust You to write our story with no end
the dangerous odyssey Your hands make
Your presence is an ephemeral blessing
finding love is not the end of the journey
i don’t seek to change Your intention  i simply want to flow along
my favourite indulgence is dark chocolate or kissing  depending on whether or not we’re together
the biting cold wind feels like it wants lovers to huddle
using words i paint my nudes  for Your mental decor
in every conversation a new discovery
she’s fearless as a smoker
fuck weakness  i have a dependency of You
unmerciful hands shred to a pulp  the heavy blooms near my heart
i wrote the last tweet biting my underlip  Just thought You’d like to know
do not hold back every inch is precious
her freshly bathed bare body   veiled in a cascade of roses
Your touch makes me feel open in my soul
You smell sexiest when i’m on Your mind
thinking about all of Your smiles i haven’t revelled in today
decide how messy You want to find me  and make the whispering voice deep suitably
"You lit up my dim heart and made me a lover, a sun lover, a life lover"
strip everything off my mind
her pale inner thighs overtaken by belated bruises
You’re with me far beyond the time that we’re together
i took a step back  to feel that powerful pull again
spank that pout  then bite hard
maybe try slap my need away?
the irresistible attraction of the beauty of the Male form
let there always be a next time
i meditate best when You’re playing with my breaths
Your mind where is it right now?
my hair smells lovely right now the sensual lightness of its scent would cling to Your edgy collarbones and linger around You all day   Just thought You’d like to know
pesky morning cravings
"eyes, smile or body words or voice or is it my undying obedience  and devotion to sinfulness  tell me Beloved what best expresses my love?"
allow me to rest my head in Your lap and recount all that i’m willing to let go of
hold me  i want to let go
at Your feet  my world abounds in peace
Nothin' feels better than this 🎵
lie above and lengthen within  how far can You reach? how long can You stay?
sighs grown husky with the weight of wishes
i am aching to meet Your edge
do You feel my heart surrender  when i kneel?
but You’re only here when i close my eyes
a kiss so long and gentle i could feel Your breaths flow  along the arches of my spine
fold around me  one more time
this natural need to inhale You
kiss me and take the burden out of breathing
release the rage  and disappear into me
don’t just stop at doing what feels good also do what feels better
held in Your arms my body naturally wants to move
look at Your hands  now think of my hips  and be in this moment  with me
hollowing my belly and folding over my thighs  hoping this hunger will fade  but it ends up choking me
a late afternoon like a night scene
we shared breaths and it all became real doesn’t mean You’re not still a dream
all i wish on this cold winter morning is to sail the summer sky in Your eyes then gravitate toward Your soul and lie still
the dictionary doesn’t identify the word Dominant as a noun such sacrilege!
i will thrive with minimal pampering i’m tough like that
nothing lovelier than the slow-release sweetness  of Your lingering lost in love gaze
You were destined to look a little deeper below the surface  to find me and keep me
night falls and striking thoughts come to the fore
Your eyes on my bare body  gracing me with a necklace of turquoise gems
reminiscences  of Your body  akin to stargazing
sometimes the span of love is but the size of a treasure chest of infinite passing looks   and yet every love is irreplaceable
every pulsation in me  feels a devout love for You
i breathed that air in the garden  near where the bushes have still to unfurl new roses  and that is just how fresh our love is to this day
there’s something very pure and raw in  savouring a lover’s saliva
do something curious
the deep pleasure  of dressing up for You
"years later, You still say  “show me your body”  and i still blush"
the slow dance  of warm skins and breathlessness
the uneasy beauty of 999
make the finish dynamic
to serve and to stimulate
Your aura conceals my scruffiness
each word  every smile every feeling  tells a story
my cleavage cuddling Your tongue
skinned my lips hoping for a last taste of You
the love affair  of black panties  with wetness
happy in anticipation
elegant and ladylike except at night
succinct kisses  on lips numb from bites
the honest beauty of insolence
Your heart is as tender as Your hands are soft
the more You frighten me the more i like it
my passion lies in satisfying Your dirtiest demands
keep kissing  until Your hands have felt me  everywhere
breathtaking inner brilliance
familiar touch  unusual moves
my nails scrawled stories  under Your waistband  for You to read in the bath
perhaps You’ve become one with the raging violent all enveloping storm tonight
oceans aflame  in her slender neck
speak to me  the language of romance
You inch closer  and my knees strike the ground like lightning
maddened by Your old school charisma
pain is a privilege and a pleasure
my audacities run like sand through Your fingers
i’m in love with the sexy intemperate freckles  in the flesh of Your meaningful words
i blind taste Your presence days after You’ve left my city
the afterglow of salvage in her kohl rimmed eyes
"dear me, my scent is Your mistress  but take heed Beloved Your presence will be reined in by my taste"
Your hearts do my words justice  do my words do Your heart justice?
lasting rain and unhurried goodbyes
Your words are drifting down inside me and making me tingle
kink is the twirl  of Your tongue  along the curve  of my breast
sleep depends on where the night is spent
the ornate bond of our love like the exquisite silver chain around my neck
come find secluded calm  in the exotic terrain of my body
pull the edges closer
"my eyes hold their breath,  for any moment You may turn back"
show me with Your hands how deep are Your words
choked by  Your  shh
bless the rain that sates the earth  oblige me so
life as an unfinished short story
by night the heat spirals
i find myself becoming more and more Yours everyday
the wilderness of Your eyes
i’ve said goodbye but my footsteps waver
feelings are seldom untranslatable
love is never lost in translation
grateful for the darkness
fearlessly i follow  Your intricate ways
there’s a look i wear for His private pleasure
Your influence is the axis my world shifts on
she’s best seen  with dark intent
O dear Sir Your hands are panning for gold  in the soil
You really ought to be doing the things You talk about and not torment my senses
a couple kisses  for when i can’t find the right words
i keep feeling You
i smell You in my daydream
tender loving spooning  and neck bites turn by turn
dizzying hues of passion lie in unstretched corners of my mind
coping with the raw energy of emotions after midnight
words at their rawest  they stroke my neck until it burns
the quiet music of warm and sweaty bodies
Your shadow  my paradise
pin my wrists and hush my fingers
yes the wind is fierce  but i still need You
get in my bed and slip into my silk
once we’re in bed my mind is completely bare
dark thoughts fire me up
i see endless reflections of You in the mirror
they say i don’t give my hair much thought they’ve no idea how i love it so messy because it reminds me of Your hands
Your impulses create little quakes inside me
descend into the ease of my mouth
nearness that molests my calm
i flower beneath You You grow above me
You marvel at the night sky and i kiss the ground we lie on
i miss You like an overcast sky misses the moon
the infinite shades of decency
You kiss a little and i live a lot
tear apart this insolent attitude
the gentle narcosis  that is Your whispering voice
a sophisticated mind loves in marvellously simple ways
i really just write for You and about us  You know that already  and now You’re smiling  so am i
i’d meditate before You for hundreds of hours  impelling You to dream up new poems
an armour called darkness nothing but darkness  can penetrate it
there’s everything blameless about a past that led to this precious present life of mine
every drop counts
a persistent need  to go beyond
the interplay  of power and passion
the mind twists  deeper with every  thought of You
promises so breakable they’re never made
her still face glistens with tears
where on Earth were You when my first kiss went wrong and my heart was heavy with severed fantasies?
what’s Your earliest memory of our lovemaking? mine is of that high summer afternoon when our fingertips touched just before You shook my hand and said hello
speak to me of malignant truths  tell me what i can’t do that excites You
we both catch the pitch dark vibe  alike
You’re the answer to the prayers i never said  You’re the reason i believe in the peaks and depths
it’s not dawn until i feel the warmth of  Your breath upon my lips
she’s charming  unique and covered in black
in my fictional future all my sleepless nights are spent with You
i crave the tougher feel of You
i have my roots in You and i still want more
i love how You never let me think
perhaps some places were just always meant to seem far away
the steam beneath  Your fingertips
could we all just hope for a little more of Him in my life?
the clouds keep rolling over  the garden keeps getting drenched and is almost blown to bits i am so envious
i love You in a thousand less than perfect but deep ways
i’m always interested to observe who (and for how many) has my personal favourite tweet of the day resonated for Some ramblings get so much more attention than the deserving one (that’ll sometimes even go unnoticed)  Wonders never cease..
such pure love we are so ruined
i love darkness  way beyond reason
the heavy horrid silence  of a pensive mood
"i want You in my forties, fifties, sixties and seventies and then to call on my grave with tulips"
i reread Your words to rejuvenate
nothing but love matters
i have marks all over are Your fingers ink-stained too?
an outline of my lips weightless and warm   in Your palm
my petulant skin wants as many bruises as You have freckles
slivers of deliciousness  from lips bitten bare
tie me up  so You can go further
dream me up
the air is drained of Your scent  i struggle to breathe
let the edges blur
in Your shadow i’d survive the harshest of winters
pick up a pen and mark my flesh as Yours
my heart resting on the ground my lips warming Your toes  is how our love bears fruit
slower isn’t always easier  to bear
Your poetry  and Your love are the same shade of dark
Your eager hands in my fishnet tights
i’m the fount to Your fire
i awaken to annihilation  and watch the stars come out
“Amœbas at the start Were not complex; They tore themselves apart And started Sex.  And Sex has ruled the earth”
i want to be the one You’d run and save if the house burns down
when You think about me which part of me do Your hands feel first?
i ache to feel You  resting heavy upon me
my devious lips quietly place cherry blossom kisses  that rouse violent desires in Your chest
tell them You are mine
i provoke Your thoughts as You read my mind
a feeling  turned day into night
bliss is our kisses  overlapping
feeling Your lips touch mine is as enchanting as seeing a vase light up when a flower is placed in it
the illusion of You lying with me in bed keeps coming loose
and when there’s nothing left  for me to let go of  i breathe again
You blindfold me  so i can let go  completely
i find You in every new breath i take
will this heart ever lack temptations?
discreetly  we escape  into madness
a sweaty chest is a thing of beauty
You’re forever sinning through those eyes
evening drinks served in a candlelit bathroom dinner on the balcony among soft cushions
it’s time to start thinking about summer
feeling stiff as a stone inside and they say i look radiant
hard kisses in soft light
too much is made of the night  don’t save Your tempest until then
i love all Your words for the word love  but i love to hear You say You love me
does the soul have one colour or does its colour reflect the mood of the heart?
i find fragments of You in unexpected places
come home and make a fire
kissing under trees that survived wars
i look forward to our conversations with a passion
bless the devil sentenced to the abyss for our salacious sin
You touch and there’s a void no more
the sound of Your breathing is magical when You’re silent and just gazing at me as i undress
i run deep into Your heart leaving no footprints
i always look my vulnerable best for You
in the hush of night all her caution melts away  desires and feelings overflow her spirit runs free
Your voracious appetite  creates amoral troubles
skins and souls locked in oneness
Your name is written all over my existence
is this to be the pattern of our days? where all i get is fleeting moments and slumbering memories? endless possibilities cackling through a long swell of silence?
i shine for hours every night  waiting for You to come burn with me
we make love blossom
extend my arms behind me and make me fly
i would happily spend the night calming the beast inside You
a voice led me in a direction i might never have thought of going
every fantasy a different shade of black
as we look at my reflection He traces the curve  of my smile  then pushes me against the cold mirror
deeper the love darker the shadows
i surrender to win Your heart
You read me unmistakably
how honest her surrender  how naked her desires
dark and twisty is where my brain likes to settle
i lose myself one deep breath at a time
writing works up a thirst
i feel miserable in this elegant dress  i want Your hands on me
she’s vain about her toes they’re strikingly petite  He likes to bite them
“stab of delight”
i’d take separation over longing every time
our every tryst    my coming of age
tears give love another dimension
a glass of wine mulled in Your mouth sipped from Your lips
how is it that we start hungry and finish hungrier?
skipping through Your footprints in the sand running into the sea to be one with You
the paradise inside Your mind thrills me
i understand love and i can show that i do but i exert every violent effort   when the Beloved wants me to write about it too
been ages since my cheekbones felt sore  i need either to serve You or think about us and smile a lot more
a scar on my skin from Your every fulfilled desire
love is the black key on a piano love is accidental  love is sharp love is flat
absently He wriggles fingers in my hair  instantly all seems right with the world
Your palm prints  on my ankles
i could hear Your groin muscles flickering  see Your knuckles turn white from impatience  and feel the militating heat in the elevator
discomfort means love doesn’t it?
Your words sin-soaked Your voice scented with incense
only us  and potent solitude
You and i  we’re two halves of one heart
don’t You pity  this sheltered sweetness  confined for days and nights  drowning in its richness?
i’ll say no more explore me without my words
my limbs have suffered enough passivity
‘Do i look beautiful?’  “You are beautiful!”
a moonlight picnic  and our pooled darkness
You never want to leave maybe one day You won’t
the graphic strength of Your words  always makes me uncross my legs
running through Your mind  like wandering silk
one person is unkind and the whole world seems ugly don’t be that person   hopefully no one here needed to hear that
deeply i bend my knees and fall all the way down
move a fraction closer i’ll find space i’ll always make space
i’m feeling  everything You’re feeling
tell Your sexy mouth  first a morning walk along my body  then coffee
the wind is a breath of hope  i feel Your caresses in it
keep writing  i want to smell Your scent  and Your intent  on paper
"in all seriousness, the bitter taste of Your absence hasn’t left my mouth"
close Your eyes when You think about me You’ll see me mouthing Your words and touching this body that belongs to You
there is richness of saffron in Your love-etched words
in fleeting moments  a liberation
words become powerful when whispered
i find my escape  in worship
rituals are vital
i will slay You  with the subtle flavour  of my narcotic skin
Your silk tie Your leather belt loosen both for me
gently He rests a hand over my heart
a strand of my hair set deep into Your collarbone   before it runs freely along Your bare back
i want to walk around bathed in Your scent
i love Your smooth i love Your rough
give us a night
He kisses my navel and my spine curves
bodies in love wrestling with urges
rip off my blouse  and listen to my heart
You always keep me warm and dirty
to be broken by an Artist
curled up like a wretch on dark doorsteps  writhing in hunger pains  pleading You not to rush  to leave
"i listen quietly as You keenly count the days until we meet  but tell me Beloved, how to measure the pain of longing by the calendar"
"without You, my secrets wouldn’t amount to anything"
i lean into You and take the fullest breath of the day
i feel surges of warmth shoot up my trembling thighs as Your touch saturates me with insanity
memories of the divine aftertaste of You  linger thick and syrupy in my mouth  and sink to line the walls of my heart
You have long been loved  ever since You were faceless
feeling polluted looking polished
journeying the unknown  together
i’m aroused by the cosmos in You
sometimes  everlasting love is only possible  without words
"morning kisses in bed  raw, uncontrollable and impervious to light"
the moonlight feels like sandpaper on my skin there’s only restlessness no beauty without You
"did i really feel You stroking my soul, but forgot because i was in so much pain?"
the things i can get away with  just with a wounded earthy look in my eyes
longing has a generous soul and loves me enough to stay
anchor me to Your darkness
"i lie bare in bed feeling beautiful, as Your muse wearing a brooch on my heart set with black diamonds of Your poetry"
i want to know how Your arms spend their evenings without nestling in my warmth
serendipitously rescued
i kissed my captor’s feet  just before He pierced me with an outpouring of savagery
sated Him through the beating
i feel the tension i love You through it
Your chest is my altar
fill my dreams for the rest of my nights
"as time passed, she got bolder"
my heart  open my spine  nicely arched  our kiss  sublime
Your hands wherever You want them
the sense of smell is greatly underrated
coming into Your life changed everything in me
give me new bruises to express new urges
i love looking to the future because i always find You in it
Your absence doesn’t quite know how to torment me  teach it or tell it to give up trying
take my hand in Yours and tell me how long You can make this journey for i never want to know rest  not in any of my lifetimes to come
eat out of my hands  let my fingertips kiss Your hunger
i want to believe in everything that You believe in i want to believe that i’m beautiful
so many pockets of wildness in Your mind that i could escape to
our love is the ultimate eternal
my face glows  between Your palms
i wouldn’t lift my chin off Your chest the whole night
soften my mouth a lot
open Your chest squeeze me in  now hug tight
kiss a little slower  i want to feel every moment
go for it again
You strip me and i feel my shame rolling off too
my head leans back and my neck throbs for Your kiss
tuck Your tongue behind my ear
scissor those fingers  one inch further  finish what You started
before saying goodbye  maybe touch  one more time  and settle
the bones in my hips miss our connection
lift these thighs and press them on to my chest  and then fold until our lips meet
put Your hands back on me
i’d breathe all my love in all the spaces inside Your heart
my wanderer heart wants to travel with Your breaths
shift Your weight on me how does it feel?
let me be Your focus tonight
lovers of intense riot we just love intense don’t we
the unholy trinity beckons
so graceful and sinless when she kneels
soon enough  i wish i’d not been so sassy
pain for pleasure  Your eyes say to me
surrender is powerful  and therefore difficult
i crave the secluded calm of being wrapped in the warm towel of Your sweaty chest
lulled by the sound of clouds mating
have a slice of my stress  before You digest my desires
the sort of evening that greets you like a frozen lake would a diver every evening without You feels like that
spanks like snowflakes and hailstones
intimacy unfolds in soft waves
sailed skyward   to be at home
it’s not about being at the top of a mountain  but in the mountains
everything seems to be dosed with impressions of God or Godliness   this makes me queasy and i need to breathe in the air around You
the tumult slowly churns inside and i wonder if i’ll get through this waiting alive
i wear the charm of Your fidelity with great élan
solo walks are my therapy
the illusion of being swathed in burning welts from Your leather belt makes winter evenings seem warmer
do You think of me when You pull and twist the taut silk knot on Your cuff?
stay just a moment longer  than You really want to
the scent of my lipstick  lingering in Your mouth
i lean in  just a little more and let go completely
we pause to kiss and we sway
take my hand  and lead with Your heart
Your eyes reflect a thousand layers inside me
"You turn, i smile"
our reality is not only an impression  neither is it a spell that can be broken
but what of my bare neck? my loose wrists? my relaxed ankles? my untaped mouth? this pale darkness?
i still remember the taste of our first kiss
my shameless hand feels innocent in Yours
penning thoughts You absolutely own and wondering if i should mention Your name here already
i’m sobbing softly and You ask if i remember the safe word  i give a sure nod and You wipe my cheek as if flicking ash off a cigarette
one moment we’re in bed  and the next You disappear into a veil of smoke
soaring effortlessly on the wings of Your words watching complexities clapping around me
my knees are unused to so much idleness
when You cross my mind  my coffee goes darker
it is hypnotising to watch the breaths spill lusciously from Your mouth as You gently blow out the candle flame
her eyes are always asking something
so tell me what purpose do tears serve unless they’re from pleasing You and suffering for You?
i always want a poem in reply
wrest from me  the heat i hold
my sense of mundane reality is lost around You
we blur the final moments of separation with hands and mouths and breakable silence
watch how tirelessly the fire dances in the arms of darkness  all night long from spark to ash  such is the madness of love
if i could  i’d sing for You every time i nuzzled Your neck as we lay together
quietly i place on His bed a full blown list of misdemeanours
my sighs are raspy from the live coals that fill my throat  You spill just enough to make it sizzle  leaving me crying for more
there’s poetry behind the combination of darkness and touch
laced with fear i tread the untamed wilderness of Your world
only here because i’m camera shy
my potential depends on Your permission
be as close to me as tomorrow
virgin breasts aching in stillness
tell them You are mine
i see You didn’t forget to take the old craft of cryptic lovemaking into 2020
sweeping hands across my body feeling for traces of Your scent
window panes shiver  as You wreck  moonbeams filter through as You salvage
i exposed my heart so You could name these feelings
touch and tear
"a sharp biting sting  Yes, i like that kind of thing"
bodies like a fireplace
i’ve got everything You’ll want to hear
let’s continue to explore colour in the darkness
the seamless relationship between soft whispers and sharp relief
hands that wear fire for gloves  and make a porcelain body sway
splayed like embroidery in the moonlight  kiss me everywhere
lovers think with hearts
i can almost feel the crunch of Your teeth
You lick Your lips like i can be tasted with Your eyes
verse for verse the best kind of foreplay
tonight again i carry  thermal shards of Your poetry into my bed
hearts without walls
don’t mind me blushing furiously  just keep talking
fracture my fragility with Your soft mouth
sensuality is easy to wear darkness is inbuilt
polarities unite us
You seem to know what’s on my mind  before i start thinking
lips like frozen roses  that need soaking   in Your dewy breath
You take my breath away with each rip of my tights
my flesh feels stiff with futility
being inside Your heart is everything
persistently hungry love
my wind swept hair reminds me of You
her words come from the world of primal chaos
feel my breath moving  and Your shoulder blades slice it
dragged through filth but still beautiful
a confetti of lost breaths  sifting through the air
quietly contemplating how it’s the stars that give out light and the moon simply drinks it
i close my eyes to feel what You’re doing
missing You  through marrow and bone
there’s no finer way to dream than with Your arms around me
whole and broken with thoughts of You
eyes that invite You to lead
warm skins breathing in stillness
not too long ago i had no roots or wings
come to bed when Your eyes tire  of looking at my tropical sunset face
"I’m a committed library goer and book quote gatherer. I don’t defile books, but constantly pause reading to (digitally) scribble quotes I love. My camera roll is full of snapshots of passages that have made me feel fully enveloped. A haul from my collection &gt; @fullyenveloped"
Your hands are curious  Your tongue is a sinner
rest Your heart wherever it feels right
the sweet release  of all effort
can’t read enough of You
a word takes a thought a long way
romanced by gestures of fire
my delicate lips will bewitch Your tongue into a crater of molten lava
facing fears  and quivering from within
the sea freed me today
shame the world doesn’t know about our love
never change this avi  You said that day and i’ve smiled at myself in the mirror ever since
the loveliness of being desired not just for being a woman
memorable sensations and salty cravings
"She may not have believed in God, but I’m pretty certain God believed in her.  - Rosamunde Pilcher"
a symphony of ripeness  trickling through Your fingers
"there are never any extreme jasmines in the scent of our lovemaking  just simply a natural musk of tired skin, savoury sweat, vibrant tears and hot blood"
Less than 20 hours into 2020 i met a real...
take over my flesh start with my lips
i see nothing beyond You that’s how far You are from me
one day more this year to love You and be loved
arrive in my world  make the beginning truly new
our scents married five summers ago
all this brightness  is bitter as rind  without You
tear with kisses before You slaughter
she’s a handful  when meltingly tender
a hundred knots in my hair like a tangle of wisteria
sexy dimples on my lower back  where Your hand pressed me into bed
home is a feeling of belonging
do You inhale  when You think of me?
i’d totally forgotten that you can find zen using an oven to reheat pastries
arouse me He said so i strangled myself
love louder tonight
that paperback i got You take it to bed tonight  so it may kiss Your chest while You sleep peacefully
"thick socks, tea and Danish and NYE"
i’ll always make room  for new memories
You speak the language of the heart  all else is noise
my sickly sweet tongue craves the salt of Your love
"sigh, tease me no more what’s so charming about an empty mouth?"
spit the citrus mist of Your insults all over my face
i receive graciously  and i grow
touching You  through every word
i’ll always meet You with an open mind
show me first your reading list
i love how words build trust
press into my skin Your fragrant darkness
breathing has little to do with loving You forever
know that the wind shackles me for You
deliciously savage  and barely there
i want to pin more than one tweet   make it happen @Twitter
lips like the champagne of roses
a small but irresistible concoction
the elegant grace of hand holding in the soft silver moonlight
let’s spend a day dipping in and out of coffee houses
delightful unrealities abound
replete yet unspoilt   like Paris  at night
poetry so deep  it feeds my soul
"so tough, so charming  how He said “You’re my woman”"
vulnerable  but completely committed
You’re every next chapter of my life
promise me the cashmere of Your hands around my throat
enjoyed a great knight in
the fruit of His rhubarb lips hangs heavy on the vine of my neck
when i touch You i burn  when You don’t touch me i burn
i write to seek You i also write because the heart needs to respire
"of all self discoveries, my indecency has been least surprising"
the air of separation feels very heavy  so don’t be upset if every letter of my every word is benumbed by stillness
the lucky ones are headed to a shared bed
i misread that as caress. do You hear?
maybe we can be together till my ache is healed?
Where do you dare me to 🎵
bound in uninvited longing
He’s so gentle i feel like art
every book in the bookstall trembles with life  but one within the hoard  quietly beckons His soft focus her every honey-hued page filled with bleak stories awaiting a writer’s finishing touch
she’s blessed with so much dignity  it excites Him irrepressibly
the night is dense with extra darkness You must really miss me wildly
i’m missing a lot about You and i’m not done yet
provoking You by rolling endlessly  in dirty words
"O, but even the sun goes down every evening"
Your eyes and hands keep returning into my dreams
there can’t be words without thinking about romance
drown me in love
You’re mine  when i write for You  i’m Yours when You read me
word to word we sway
tight hugs and softest of kisses later  we plunge into darkness
and if You send an army of love my way  i will relent
stir passions that linger
Your scent disrobes me
quietly go  just a little deeper
elegant curses
i want my words to look their best for Your hungry eyes
tirelessly  i invoke Your scent from memory
as if there isn’t enough pain in longing  i lie here on crushed Christmas baubles  come and drive sense into me  or tell me that i understand love
only been centuries since we touched  but it already feels like a million years
there’s intoxication at the heart of all Your words
words here are for adult collectors only
our most loving kiss  is always the next one
Loved
i love how we always escape the crowd
leave less often
write more often
this tweet isn’t relevant
Show fewer follows twitter! I enjoy the adventure of discovery
eyes that illuminate ruins
the candle flickers as our shadows crash
breathe words into me  i’m finding it a little hard to write
i need You on my back
tell me what to do with all the dreams i can’t live
words as beautiful as promises
i’d renounce heaven with You
lying beneath You my blood flows better
laying bare for You my wounded heart  in the pink twilight skies
Your kisses trail down my thighs  and all i can do is wish  that my legs were longer
"when in doubt, bite my tongue"
the discreet charm of a poker face
"""let echoes end, and voices begin."" Antonio Machado"
dirty minded hands  scandalous mouth
a chime of petal soft moans  replaces her reticence
never thought coffee could taste less like love
what am i to taste if not the wine of the words You write?
the afterburn of kisses
“I fucking like you!” is how You told me You love me the very first time
there are moments when i simply want to run in Your direction
forever chose us
lust is purer than innocence
unzip Your body and keep me in there
"i miss Your smile, nod, peck, grip, voice, bite, growl, groans, freckles, feet, hands, eyes, smell... i could go on"
my skin blushes rosily  while it’s waiting
voice notes as tokens of love
salty bodies  savouring the night
raw lust scented with love
a jewel of a mouth
i can resist anything but You
tear me apart if You want to taste  the sublime flavour of my skin
"“Everything in moderation, including moderation.”"
wine and prose evenings
give me a foretaste
for You i’d look after myself all my life
eyes never lie
it’s all so different around You
You weave the softest tapestry of poems  and i lie upon it under open skies
i’m not a museum make me dirty
gaze sharp enough to cut glass  and the knowingness with which You look at me
You unzip and i realise how empty i’ve been
saturate my soul with the serum of Your words
leave not an inch of air between our breaths when You kiss me goodbye
Your magic eludes poetry
sins tasty enough for breakfast
where there’s darkness  there’s potential
rib by rib  i cling
there’s a bit of our secret in all my words
knotty is nice
what good is this fire  if i can't use it  to warm the One i love?
i find myself in every reflection in the mirrored room of Your heart
warming spontaneously  to Your fearsome inclinations
serendipity reverberates amid the Christmas mayhem
You matter   You make it matter
vulgar excesses  against the light
You’re so far but i never imagine You without me
i want a bluesome with those eyes
Your kiss makes my lips feel fuller
we exist in a world far away from everyday life
imagine Christmas Day together
let me hear You say
if there’s one thing she knows about it’s loving quietly from a distance
how lonely is Your night? how deep the darkness?
i long to feel Your quiet power
come back i’m hooked
restraints calm somewhat Your touch stills
think lips  immersed in sensitivity and beyond burned out
in love with the way Your fingertips punctuate the quiet moments
can’t think of white linen without imagining it crumpled
never rule anything out
use my quiff to warm Your hands
strike me again with that lancet gaze
infuse my skin with Your scent  and exorcise the hysteria building up in my chest
my body aches without You
with gratitude  i descend
thighs and calves draping and narrowing  into one silhouette
wearing all black waiting patiently
You own this feeling that is in the air
a most violent year
His whirlwind poetry  moulds and permeates  my soft curves
i’m wild about Your tempest
reign from my throat
unzip and give me everything i love
the incalculable value of innocence
love me to one of those very ruined bits
my heart needs You in every corner
waiting atiptoe
some thoughts swivel all night long
i need scoopfuls of Your love
we’re so much more  as a whole
let’s put fetishes we love together
memories you want to hug
the fantasy goes on getting darker
prettiest when she’s drowning  in deep sensation
life seems to like an imbalance
silence is a shade that hovers between dove white of our intimacy and the void of Your absence
somewhere in the cove  is the sweet spot
my idea of misery is orgasms that i can count on two hands
in scorching agony could do with a Satan cold lick
trapped by Your old world charm
You’re gone and i’m rolling again  in the forsaken sea of heavy restlessness
Your belt like a leather wreath around my thighs
nobody else  thinks  writes  loves like You
i love the art You make
the softening effect of Your roar
Your love echoes endlessly
“There is nothing like desire for preventing the things one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one's mind.” - Plum Sykes
the beautiful shape of Your heart
Your scent would be a dream to wear the whole time
dissenting legs make a brute effort  of walking away  from where i belong
You make me completely alive 🎵
without You i’d starve
i won’t sacrifice pain for pleasure
steadily He leads me  over the threshold
bitten lips  like bruised autumn leaves
passion conceived as love
she’s the softness  behind His eyes
You’ll find scented tranquility  in unholy places
“I am the fire that strikes the stone.”
our passion an explosion of highs
her body is an unorthodox temple
my sinfully soft soul hankering after  the garment  of Your barbaric flesh
in countless original ways  You rewrite our love story
You’re a perpetual rediscovery
scared stiff  i shut eyes sigh softly  and give in
this gloomy silence feels like a glass dome over my head
so achingly untouched  my breasts feel stuffed  with a heatwave
make every hug end with a squeeze
to love with your everything is formidable but to live  without the one you love is no less a feat
the fog of depravity  quietly obscures  my mind
how many sins are too many?
can’t bear darkness without You so i burn
keep going dear heart  He’s not near yet  why must you skip beats now
if only desires shaped destinies
one knock and You were residing in my heart
my heart doesn’t need any other companion than Yours
i’ll desire You long after my heart stops beating
You’re always on my mind but i think about You more when You’ve been brutal
are we in our universe yet?
lying beneath You i dig my nails into Your back  because words of gratitude  are best penned by hands
throw me on the bed  and let’s explore
moans and cries come by turns  just as He likes
so many deviances  in need of correction
are You for real  i asked Him once
everything about You is timeless
pleasure is the original sin
Your taste seduces me long after i’ve been drunk
Your sweat  sticks resolutely  to my skin
the dream needs to become a blessing
wine doesn’t delight quite as well as kisses and conversation
rock and rose
i peek deliberately  as He licks the flames
His chest like a bold canvas  smeared with red lip prints
the perversity inside me  responds instinctively  to the beauty of Your darkness
that feeling of completeness  when you’re tempted to say nothing
there’s profoundly stirring poetry woven into Your gentlest touch
sin is an expression of love
pull me back into Your arms or thrust a skewer in my heart
Your soul-dominating charisma my all-embracing surrender
You’re the Center of my gravity
i’d sink treasures  into the creases  of His elusive smile
Your face buried in my neck  my hair wrenched in Your grip  an immersive love
hold down  and never release
there is so much breath left in my lungs  press Your skin close so i may sniff You more
this hunger makes me less human and more animal  is that weakness or strength  is a wonder to me
adventures are made in
my tongue  curling its way  round Your fullness  my senses succumbing  to the scent of worship  wafting from Your flesh
smelling You matters
i always link the scent of the wind with Your soul wanting to touch me
You do more than make my world better
this fascination  with finding godliness in love
this madness overrules the harmony of words
my heart lives in Your part of the world
coy little sweetheart eyes  dripping throughout the suffering
kiss where i pulse
so many ways to love  without saying anything
#storyin12
His hand gliding like a sickle over her arched back  chiseling stillness
His every glance  unfolds a new soft spot
He has traversed every narrow pike to my heart
glean the shadows in my spirit from my words
the way her neck takes a bow  is an expression of desire
the wind intently roars a flame blatantly burns
i’ve kissed His feet long enough  to merge with the scent of His shadow
white on You makes me blush
choked on my humility
spraying rosewood in intimate places
wish i was on my way to dinner  with You
He made a dive for my heart as if to hack the deepest riches on the planet
i’m not mine if i can’t be Yours
i am incapable of dressing up my sorry plight  sensually  perhaps Your heart  will still unravel  my wanton thoughts
the head needs to give the heart free rein sometimes
minds making love  as rivals in word games
forever unprepared  for new sensations
be mindful a crushed bloom  will leave a permanent scent
the scent of my lipstick in Your palm
“a welter of anxious faces”
Your mouth  my neck  a hushed conversation
my thighs wide apart Your touch determined
pain is its own reward
the human need  for more intensity
His eyes  like reflective lakes  unspoilt by anything ordinary
the rummage that follows the hello
"Maybe it's the wintertime, maybe it's the cold Maybe I'm just here alone 🎵"
#storyin12
#storyin12
always present seldom near
every night a new flight
can’t do much on my own anymore  i’m hungry and i need You
the phenomenal power of cosiness
when hearts are fated to bond lives just simply twine
every movement  mirrors the memories
His obliging hands  gracing my wrists  in reverse prayer
i swoon over the ink that belongs to Your words
Beloved You’re a fugitive cloud taming the bereft earth evoking her docility with promises of an embrace
supine bodies and lengthening shadows
i’d wake You with murmurs at dawn
the heavy wind  turns the autumn leaf  over and over  and it whirls like a spark of fire  scenting the dry air
share a Christmas tree with me
draw not the curtain  back from Your heart  for my name lies safely engraved  on the walls of Your soul
the wetness behind the words
bodies humming by the fireplace
i’m envious of the sodden autumn leaf that offered itself to the rain
His hand curls like smoke  around my neck  and i’ve never breathed more calmly
#storyin12
"Who knows, maybe the steps to heaven are made of Your poems"
in thinking of You  i grow beautiful
His kisses so passionate it makes me wonder  if i’ve grown new skin
love deeper than faith
some days she appears to be lit from within
an orgy of concealed desires
i belong to carnality
with poise i sashay into Your every thought
how well You read my wordless thoughts
You heal my soul a little every day
the beautiful feeling  of being understood  from the heart
counting floors  before You lead me  through the bedroom door
counting feet  until our eyes meet
counting sighs  and how i’ll get a kiss  with every goodbye
counting days  and all the ways  that You’ll have me
spent my night  counting sleeps  until You’re next to me
He starts where most others would end
we’re the fire before the chill
i’d want to find You at the end of my rainbow
"The ""rose of temperaments"""
looks so rough they hurt so good
Your saber thrusts  like floodlights at night
hurt that enslaves
this animal magnetism between us
away from You i’m a poem without words
make my fantasies Your own
mood makes my breasts swell
bring that beast out a little
Your teeth-bared mouth  on the back of my thighs
i’m on my own too often
i’d hike up Your solid chest loop around the neck  and inhale the balmy scent  then swim nude  in those sunlit sea eyes
i pride myself on Your love
i need the cosiness from being caught between Your jaws
priceless memories  invisibly woven  into the fabric of my being
my delicate soul  is filled with longing  far past its limits
shocks of violet  on pale inner thighs
the way You grasp my mind
nothing is out of the question
so many words battling for dominance  hush them all with Your free verse
"rise, fall, and recovery"
an extreme fondness  for force
heart a haven of peace
i’d love to go through Your collection of rarely spoken truths
handprints on windows kind of intimate
flowering weeds
You have more hold on my reality than i do
in Your thoughts  or up close  just hold me
speak to me about love in the widest sense
Your words are vandals
the clitoris reels
only You see the depravity i reflect unintentionally
between soothing caresses  i acutely ache for violence
this rebel of a heart  it’ll come to a rest  but not cease to love
i selflessly sacrifice breaths  and carry on living  for the day we’ll be together
the candle is spent  i’m still burning
sets me on fire then calls me calamity
“she bombarded him with telegrams..”
i noticed Your collarbone soften as i wiped my tears of suffering
bless my gentle heart  it feels every mile hammer
the pleasure i seek is not only of the flesh
the escapism of an autumn leaf  lying deliberately on the ground getting away from it all
i put on black because of joy
i perfume His palm as dewy flower petals often do
skin too hot to sleep in
found feral traces  in Your “hello baby”
tongues defeating thirst
warm tea room kisses
soft candlelight  seeking shadows  to throw on the wall
Your arm around me  changes how my wine tastes
in one breath
i look for You in every skyline
flagrant lover  i’ve exhausted myself needing You charm me with vulgar words no more
what does Your night smell like?
Your absence ebbs and flows
i do not protest  as He disappears  into my mouth
i need the pain You call pain
“She is trying to awaken by falling into bed..”
sometimes the lust is me
terrorised by some thoughts
perhaps i’ll find You before midnight
sucker for humiliation
desire devours like no other
seeking the glowing embers of Your poetry in the darkness to play with
such a crafty solid white shirt  it robbed my lips of deepest red
a throng of cobwebs  in my comfort zone
we’re the best of both worlds
think i smell like dessert
so tough yet so very feminine
You’re softer than i am tough
slut for Your scent
i love how darkness never conceals anything
Your smile brings magic to my eyes
my words may not be pretty but they’re full of personal meaning and truth
it’s the texture that gives Your words such flavour
such graphic shadows we make
i feel You looking out for me from afar
Je t’aime
love is human  love is animal love is divinity
these precious things i have of You make me feel looked after
"“Fucking is an art”, Anais wrote"
i thread love snugly through my every word  and string out a rosary  in Your name
i dance in the rain that’s drenching You
i can feel You breathing  sometimes it’s imagination that fills in the gaps
give it to me to sleep on tonight
perhaps contentment is a chimera
"if it’s a small world, then why don’t we overlap?"
“Now” with a word  He causes a rash of serious heat
the torments of life
looking around my bed and seeing space that’s not yet filled
Black
no i won’t not again self destruction  is never as sweet
time and again i end up alone at night  doing mundane things like touching myself
He’s a dream I’ve kissed
begin with tyrannies
leave nothing undone
"“Fuck Dancing, Let’s Fuck”"
my crooning pleas to suffer more  are born from  an unconscious longing to connect with Your soul
obedient to the point of death
we are love  the world has lovers galore
with You there are always unpredictables lurking in the depths
that ephemeral kiss left Your thirst on my lips
she’s the ruby the one without a rival
this is what love looks like  i think to myself  rubbing ice over teeth marks
the rapture of Your tight grip  still hangs strong from the tangle of my hair
every thought seems  brilliant but brutal
reward me with a last look back
penetrate the clamour of my mind
I wanna know what gets you all fired up  🎵
what we have is special  say You feel it too
the virgin glow that only comes from intimacy
oh to be where i belong  at the top of Your mind
i feel like the happiest tormented muse ever
"sometimes, it’s like we never parted"
kiss me and find Your happiness
i’m the sea bashing on the rocks  heaving skywards in prayer  beckoning the dark clouds  ready to accept
my raging moans are in tune  with the rhythm of the pushing
Your dark stare  makes me nervous
her buzzing anticipation His deep hush
under the noise  He bites  until i fade into stillness
You said goodbye  and i was lost  back into randomness
it’s mesmerising  watching Him writing on my skin
a soul like a beautiful stained glass
my unflinching vulnerability  will shake Your heart  and ease the knots  tied by dangerous impulses
is it my imagination or are we making love  through words
He’s blessed with the beauty of knowing exactly what to do
have i told You about the nights i’ve spent sitting in my bed?
sometimes just feeling  is enough to make me happy
i close my eyes to feel You just a little bit more
"“Even when you curse in despair Saying it’s cruel and vile Love forgives you everything Because love, my dear, is I”"
the evening is quietly elegant You’re on my mind
the more You love me the more i become myself
soft kisses  full of quiet love running the length  of Your bare back
i love these moments as late evening drifts into night  blanketing itself in darkness
she’s a devil in a black dress  with a mind to match
nights long  moon dazzling  love obsessive
the exhilaration of being caught  in a storm of long low whispers
unerring in my immodesty sounding extremely vulgar  i tell Him i’m hungry
"“In this the greatest trouble lies, That both be willing at the same time.”"
kiss i mean curse me goodnight  like it’s perfectly decent of You to be beyond reach
with the ebb of every unused moan  i feel a pang
passion doesn’t grow old
every shared moment  verging on the surreal
love is to ask nothing  and give / get everything
all I want  is to look into Your eyes and feel pleasurepain twirl around my limbs
can’t say if i was struck dead or rendered immortal  to hear that i inspire the writer in Him
come if only to devour all the smiles You left me
candlelit suppers at home and the heady warmth  of Your hunger
one would think such overripe longing would show signs of decay
i aspire to overwhelm You
wallow in the dark with me in my waking hours  and my sleeping ones
fiercely whole  yet so far apart
call me a writer if You will but it was the only way  i could get under Your skin
His grave growls breach my barriers and draw my senses
simple thoughts  penned colourfully   He doesn’t complicate beauty
tickled by  the rocky crevices  on Your chest
“Trees are always missing some leaves. They sweep the air looking for them. Nothing distracts them. Nothing.”
my submission is the spring  that holds the promise of summer
the words You’ve chosen for me such a beautiful keepsake
sounds so wrong feels so right
she’s full of small deviances  even her hair is unafraid to stay wild
the heat sweetens as You roll sleeves up
You and i  we’re Heaven and earth  swivelling around our evils
protect whom You’ve created  because she’s fragile
i exhale relief  under the comfort blanket  of Your palm
behind a smoke screen  of familiarity  the whiff of danger
i miss Your warmth in dark corners
His pressure  soft my tension  consistent  a shared frenzy coursing through our bodies
the pain of separation  is the heritage of lovers
You bring the darkness i’ll bring the nervousness
i drop at Your feet all the melancholy I’ve been holding onto
with abandon  i bare my fears
every dawn  a new promise  to seek each other  in the depths
frozen petals cast a spell too
in every mouthful  that taste of the sea
“I prefer to knock on wood.”
"“I prefer light eyes, since mine are dark.”"
“I prefer leaves without flowers to flowers without leaves.”
“I prefer the absurdity of writing poems to the absurdity of not writing poems.”
"“When I pronounce the word Future, the first syllable already belongs to the past.”"
i cry for mercy  till my lungs are bursting  and then the screams are a murmur
craving the fire  of that first stroke  of tongue
Your hands take all liberties possible
peace never lasts
"the fork in the road we’re on,  perpetually pierces my heart"
i love life for all its riddles that knock my brain up
could You maybe admire the ultra romantic sound  of the word  marry
my newfound temptations  might make You stay
roll on top and crush the elusive feline that incites You
the way His eyes play off the contours  on my body
love creates warmth longing bites and numbs
the night sky is starless  as though tired  of looking beautiful
i want to be Yours even after my scent has faded. Not just from Your skin.
You’ve made my mind so bendy
submissive in everything  except her choice  or liking  of words
in a heart  marred by many He made home
say it for me  write it for me  do me for me
anesthetize my heart
linger a while  there are more twinges of suffering  eager to pique You
write please  so i become a part  of You
my trembling lips make eloquent pleas to be forced open
around my neck the scented caress  of wine kisses  and velvet whispers
some feelings shake you  like waves in a storm
if You let me loose  i would never stop clinging
all that glistens  is Your doing
He does everything i’ve anticipated  but nothing same as i’ve ever felt
i am rich with pieces of You
He loves reading  as much as i love exposing my mind
this private world  of devotion  is heaven to me
take nothing less than everything
no playing safe  on this carpet of goosebumps  it’s untouched but dirty
You touch  and i am molten art
obscene thoughts  that i have no words for  find them in translation  of the blank canvas  that i become in Your hands
new desires are born every day
i press to my heart the naively slaving words  that You pertly send  to kiss me goodnight
i know more of myself  every time we’re together
each kiss is adorned with  a wealth of possibilities
there’s never enough room for excesses
without You   the darkness  is just a gaping void
turn me into a garden  that smells of You
You only ever feed me with cravings
His magic transcends poetry
We're far from the shallow now 🎵
contemplation  nostalgia anticipation  fulfil my life
I’m a chapter in His story  He’s my anthology
it takes courage to survive on tomorrow
love knows no boundaries  why then are we confined to different sides?
His gaze lingers  and i feel submission segue into my nerves
i curse sleep like it’s bad weather  i indulge desire like it’s sunshine
i spend fruitless hours  in the winter darkness  feeling blue
Passionate from miles away 🎵
oblivious aren’t You of the venom of incompleteness  that’s paralysing me?
hovering tauntingly  above my hungry mouth  is assault
if it’s just my soul You want to dwell in might as well deprive me of skin
how mad can i go i wonder
are the silk beads  in the heart of my breasts  the riches You desire?
a spell binds us  to a dreamlike world
waves of wildness   forever uprising
His voice dresses me down His hands  do the storytelling
i’ve been a smouldering bonfire  glistening in shades of amber  undone until i’ve been the soot silky and charred  inking the fine linen of Your skin
i have a weakness for the temptations chilly winter evenings bring
the yin of my fevered lips  in deep reverence  of the yang  of Your plunging breaths
beauty lies in the details
honey laden kisses  that left me thirsty
the immediate delight and danger  as our palms kiss
love is no healer  not when You’re afar
precious Beloved  i offer You  the gift of giving
burning slow  and squirming  in a restless mass
we whirl like dervishes when my hungered flesh  and Your contagious passion  collide
You feel softer the nearer i get to the core
Your words  summon my whole body  to surrender to Your mastery
the fire wants to embrace me
the blissful slumber  of burned out bodies
i’d fly into Your arms but it’s a long haul back to the hollow
soon  every thrust hurts
chasing Your scent with every inhalation
pitilessly He pollutes  my craven mind
filth so intimate only He can see it
i hope to never relapse into the life i lived before You
tell me how much wretchedness would make me worthy of Your graceful presence
as dusk approaches  i seek You restlessly
not a tinge of violet anywhere on my flesh  it’ll be spring only when You kiss me
reflections of my undoing cradle  in those opulent deep blue eyes
i love the romance of Your quest
the road less travelled  leads straight to her heart
i entrust to Your love a ravaged heart
sweet dreams   will always end in tears
i pleasure You in my head everyday
You and i worth a frame
You fondle  like You’re foraging  but i’ve left nothing undisclosed
tear out of me  the stubborn virtues that You want to tweak
"write without intoxicating, i implore You"
tongues juddering  until our spirits glow
let’s pour into one another  and spin with the waves
my soul has Your name on it
His ruthlessness and my resolve flirt equally
i crave the extreme comfort of that aftertaste
where else is there relief except at Your feet
the weight of bridled depravity
His poetry is not sublime  it rasps my heart  and etches lust into my skin
i beg to be overthrown
her aggressive beauty  provokes His calm
be it the first  or the last a kiss cannot be hurried
wish You’d dominate the silence  with Your torrid whispers
i want to  read what You’re reading  dream what You’re dreaming need what You’re craving kiss You when You’re speaking
i think about those precious hours  an infinite number of times
i’ll stay in ways You won’t know
sensual sandalwood on my neck on my wrists  in my cleavage effusing carnage
the melancholy  of unsated sexual appetite
think burning bodies  on winter nights  think thirsty mouths stuck together
gone too far  too deep  into the sea of love an infernal storm  is all i can cling to now
i promise to be brave  when the whip of Your absence relentlessly beats my pulse down
the protective power  of naked truth
the tone of Your voice shapes every movement of my body
my eyes only seem to find You close in dreams how then do i wake up in skin that smells of Your scent?
leaving my innocence  in the tavern of Your personal desires
how sure that hand is  to mine jewels  every time You touch me
perhaps love is spared its trial  in a galaxy beyond the stars  #StoryIn12
like chandelier candles  these fingers flame and drip i smell and then douse them  in my mouth
the rich addictive scent of my femininity  smeared on Your tastebuds  on Your warm breath
i want Your voice to be the light that bathes me at dawn
my weary head needs the soothing balm of Your poetry
to love with boldness   and immense purity  to love like You do
i’m all about that vice
gather me in Your arms  my sumptuous curves need tending
the stormy sighs of my longing will transcend lifetimes
His hands have a way of killing softly
“You’re my little bit of exotic”
we’re unique  when we’re one
come slaughter these urges that are left unfinished
Your words are caresses i say
it’s so easy to get caught in Your web of passion  so easy to bruise
soft lips savage kisses
the lingering high  after a crushing defeat
i’m a hooligan without You
i have a special love for the way Your embrace dismantles me
the hours in my days have become menacingly long  time bullies me in Your absence
11:11 and the craving is now sinful
my heart is finally in the right place
can You tell how desperate i am when i kneel quietly and feign decency?
stripped and soaked  her body exudes  the essence of autumn
i’m tired from upholding so much dignity      bolt the bedroom door and watch it slip down a treat
don’t leave me stricken by desires  pull me into Your breathing space
the devastating ache of longing
just breathe  and let it happen
the graceful drape  of Your aura  guards my beauty
slapped by tender memories
it’ll take no less  than infinite licks  to tidy the frayed edges  of my vulgar mouth
He’s a vision in crisp white
the pearls around my neck yearn to feel Your tender touch
i see a fine spectacle  in Your eyes  as they float gently down  this sketchbook of a body
delicate wrists  wreathed in rope
love slow we have a lifetime
a ribbon of bite marks  tied around her breasts
bed like a battleground  and a sexy beast lying on a kill
warm strands of happiness  ripple down my throat  and i taste heaven
pressing my palm close to my ear hoping to sense again the rhythm of Your beating heart
give me more while the soreness lasts
i am  because You are
no i don’t remember how long we kissed  or how firmly You held me  all i can recall is the sound and sight  of goodbye
the tension around my jaw has eased and that feels like the worst kind of abandon
her coal black eyes try and fail to eclipse the fragility of her soul
my pheromones are slowly dying in Your absence
how elegantly  our cursive tongues  spell love
the meaning of His words  runs much deeper  than language
why is it that it’s easier to feel empty than full
i miss You most when dusk closes in and it’s time for candles
saying no is never easy hardest when You’re holding my gaze
waiting for love like it’s a season
kisses the taste of   sprouting flowers
i cling to His broad back feeling indecently playful  and fearless
sometimes He’s dirtier  than very dirty
You inch closer and the ache becomes  a heavy burden  for my limbs to bear
eyes like bandits  that take hold of my innermost thoughts
lying in bed wearing the soft flush  of a rose  that’s just finished  blooming
hours of contentment  a lifetime of want
conjuring up debaucheries
love is lovely
You can’t  stoke the fire  spark a rebellion and say goodnight
toss my drunken limbs  over Your shoulders  and rush right in
when we’re not holding hands what am i to do  with these spaces  between my fingers
savouring the sound  of Your words  i read between the lines  and find myself a cocooning space
just breathe deeply through this divine madness  that binds us
let me do all the giving tonight
haven’t met my demons since I’ve known You
You’re the urge i strive to satisfy
unravel for me  all the fantasies  i haven’t yet thought of
teach me the worth  of letting go
in Your darkness i found my escape
the tender strength  of His chest
whether it’s parting  or meeting  each leaves ruin in its wake
when words fail me He reads my silences
tonight get perilously close in my dream
this love  and its brutality  is most painful
my intimate desires dip freely into  His parted lips
my love is very courageous
succulent petals  close in reverently  around His bone shaking hunger
dynamite lips  that scrawl raw desires  all over my skin
i can’t tell You enough about the insatiable need i have for Your body
how softly our bodies rest on a pinnacle of silence  while Your heart  reads mine
supple breasts  huddled like gems in His metal hands
thieving whispers  that steal all my senses
intent on tasting  He licks without mercy
long after You’ve left  i savour  the slow burning power  of Your scent and touch upon my skin
every night i bear a nagging chill  from the absence  of Your hands
drips of wax  like kisses floating
"""Touch my skin so I can be myself. Let me feel you enter each limb bone by bone, that what died last night can be whole today"" #Rumi"
to wreak pain  that revives   is a fine art
i’m a cluster of sins  His embrace  calmly succumbs to
stomp a little slower dear heart  He’s here just in reminiscence
i need You far beyond hunger
“meticulously unshaven”
too roused to hold back tears
will please You till my knees wear out
never let me  get away
"""I’m nothing you can catch now. I am black powder, I am singe, I am the bomb that bursts the night."" A.M. Homes"
she’s best loved violently
talk to me about  Your intentions
the pricelessness  of moments past
fury in His touch tempest on His mind
“come into the bathtub” He says
there’s nothing quite like surrender
seeing the future  through His promises
satiety seldom lingers
the first thing He wants is taste
stray thoughts  trail from my mind  and settle here gently  for You to devour
without conviction i protest as He does everything i did not imagine
Your tenderness  puts me on guard
in another life all my musings  would be reality
get up close and look  just how intensively Your love  runs through my veins
i seek my world in You
pinned to the wall like art  thrown on the bed like possession
let the night  blur or create  what it will
the stark smoothness  of tongues draping
she’s never without vulnerability
i only had to be Yours to be beautiful
there is something enduringly hard about decisions
His growls echo calamity
deceptively simple darkly provocative
all i want is all of Your time
eyes like  soul swooping  magic mirrors
she’s the one  His words come home to
His smile  evokes summer
penetrate more than skin deep
i will always struggle to resist the allure of darkness
my spirit is obsessed by  thoughts of being soaked  in Your essence
we make paradise
tears well up as i collapse in a heap at Your feet  and feel my burdens draining away
heartbeat whirring breath muffled  i lay still beneath You
seductive yet submissive
that exquisite moment when torment tips over  into pleasure
You always find more of me to burn
His eyes soften my sassiness
in another world  all our nights  start with depth
i look at myself in the mirror  and there You are
luscious breasts  trimmed with a lace  of teeth marks
every little memory lives on as if beating with a heart of its own
there’s an intimacy to the humiliation
mighty hands  like iron cuffs  around my calves  that drag me like a storm to the edge of the bed
what i love to hear  never needs saying
You’d battle to get the intense scent of our bingeing   off Your skin
when the going gets tough the screams become silent
why wouldn’t You hunt out the pleasure  bounded and blinded by all this pain?
our musings have the same root
glowing seductively  she nods an honest yes
as the evening grows i crave Your delicious  familiar touch
warm Your hands over my heat
words voice mouth scent soul and other things to love
perhaps it’s separation  that reshapes seasons
i miss the impulsive pursuits  of Your hand  on the back of my dress
His dangerous eyes  stir up the inferno  beneath my unmarked skin
You break the clutter
tasteful dark amber bruises   scattered beneath  my black polka dot tights
i woke up  and embraced chaos
wild impulses  seething deep within
i think about  the sound of Your voice and my name  is a word that comes to mind
raze my skin with a mouth  it has made so hungry
perhaps there’s a special place in heaven where repressed love  can finally beam and be itself
don’t turn me on  and walk away #psa
depths belong to lovers
a lingering trail of lust glancing off His eyes causes a collision  of innocence  and perversion
in our galaxy  there will never be an incuriosity of words
give me indefinite evenings  of pining in agony for one night of coming together
a lifetime spent cradling desires a lifetime prevails  resisting urges
the magnitude of this pain compels me to keep breathing
i restrain my fragility  and say no to nothing
Your simplicity marries really well with my beauty
memories and moments making me beautiful
capture my world  even if just to leave an imprint
arrestingly cruel hands  that push my boundaries
featherweight kisses  along a feral collarbone
blue eyes  like the sea kissing me on the lips
all my freedom lies  in one divine corner of Your bedroom
hazel skin embellished with  a rope bracelet
His poetry is no less  than an act of violence
why sweep eyes  over the shore  and not forever float  in the ocean of love?
such a soft heart  yet how fiercely  it beats for You
needing Your  rich as butter  seductive whispers   to feed my imagination
we exist to indulge
gloriously spread  and fucked to a finish
a harsh lesson  learned hard  doesn’t mean  i don’t need  more lessons
oh the joy of wildness  unleashed
my sensuality  lies in Your touch
a love  destined to echo through the darkness
reflecting on memories  i know will live forever
savage hands  that destroy sweeping arms  that put me back together
He loves the accent  she purrs in
rush it or don’t  just do it
slick as sex our fantasies meld  to perfection
please don’t  be so ruthlessly gentle  i have longed without end to fall to ruin
pain nurtures  like nothing else
“Are you afraid of the dark?”  His eyes seem to ask
words like a whirlpool  of romance
bruised  but not enough
infinite teeth marks  blooming on my skin
my mouth  is forever dreaming of Your lips
the ache of womanhood
where do i take this intense craving nestling in my being?
read me  behind a locked door
teasing fingers foster the heat    of a log fire between my legs
my urges  lay quietly  at the root of Your intentions
they’re simple desires  that stir my core
every kiss deepens the hunger
sweet memories flood back and reverse the chill of winter
He surprises  with perversions  beyond the ordinary
He smells like love
my heart swells when His fiery  wine soaked tongue  strokes the arc  of my breast
i kiss every crease  of His palm as it tapes my mouth  before running out  of breaths
love commands love obeys
my love  doesn't know the meaning  of enough
bare and burning  for Your touch
lured into Your excesses
there are no hands  to caress my curves
"Pain so sharp, I didn't feel a thing..."
this eternity is fleeting  i blink and You’re far away again
i’m in love with an active volcano
fascinated with depths  of decadence
obsessed with secrets
Your whispers feed my thighs   a steady trickle
thinking about all the words the sea inspires
it all starts  as i settle in the dark beneath a wild  and drunken beast
a hot haze whips me into a frenzy as You hold me  under  a searing gaze
savage touch merciful spirit
without You i feel like a forgotten grave
How do you fight a war called need?
i love our imaginary walks
hug me tight  until musk smells floral
sumptuous spread  in your bed
she’s a chapter from history
beneath You I’m a kite in the sky
bruises like polka
surviving on faith
she sits across the mirror displeased with the absence beside her
when love finds a way
isn’t it tragic how the melancholy sky glorifies  a wound called Sun
does the moon ever wonder where it would shine its light if the earth didn’t reflect it
endless curls of cigarette smoke writing You cursive messages of love
all the feels but not a bit of You around
she’s vodka in human form
she makes it impossible  to decide between fierce and tender
live a little kiss a lot
it’s cathartic  to be fucked
abandon everything but books
there’s nothing grey about her
abundant love  and not a speck  of mercy
My regime
My extravagance
You are  my current state of mind
the quiet beauty  of being in the moment
make me useful make me feel
lip bites are the highest form of kisses
real is rare
You turn i smile
"""Nothing’s villainous if it causes an erection."""
when i see You all i see is bliss
forever savouring elapsed moments
the flowing softness  of wine tinged kisses
hands like thunder  on my skin
whisper again  the words i haven’t forgotten
fading into smoothness
reciprocity is sexy
late night cravings and music
You pulse within me
rum cum sunset concoction
let our futures mingle
You always know what I’m thinking
darkest of reds  almost black
breaths that whisper moans that talk
the way His scent lingers on my skin
“Cherry petal mouth”
some roses don’t smell conventional
the way His breath  feeds my spirit
He liked it He licked it
it’s the purity more than the intensity that draws her in
my lips miss the colour  Your bites leave
a modern girl with old fashioned desires
Love is not what we do Love is what we are
plants a morning kiss  in the hollow of Your palm
a wring drifts all over my back  perhaps He’s still watching me walk away
filling my lungs in memory  with the essence of Your flesh
delicate and powerful as jasmine at nightfall
a heart that’s braver than backbone
I pine for sin
the stories sighs tell
on the verge  of calamity is the only way i feel alive
there’s night.. and stars...and dreams.. even a lullaby  But no sleep
His gallant breath  like a warm wind  blowing over my skin
hold my hand  as we journey  through a new world
when we finally hug just linger
longing holds me captive
“Every kiss a war”
come closer and whisper
such covert savagery  to not quench my thirstiness  but just stand me in a corner and stare  delaying the unfastening of belt
You like parts of me i can’t see
violent hands and the vibrations of satin
every sigh a serenade
her dark mind  is never far  from waves of pleasure
the lingering bliss  of quiet whispers
i could live forever  in that fine margin of space  between our fantasies  and the rest of my life
“He’s holding my hand but I follow his scent”.
bound by love liberated by love
the many faces  of darkness
I’ll take Your every mood
indecently thirsty
where there’s skin there’s lust
a delicate flower hidden in the shadows
wine makes me feel  almost beside You
she’s naked sensuality  in a white cotton dress
imagining a vulgar mouth  made very wet
old school tenderness
she’s no weakling when it comes to seduction
i want to bathe in the scent of Your after sex skin
bodies like a fireplace
Your words are my story
from her neck flow His breaths and kisses
the healing power  of companionship
someone needs to disinvent distance
You give me no time to whimper
violence that toughens her willingness
suffering that softens His heart
disarmingly tender hugs
when the body is alive with consent
I’ve had the best of my firsts with You
Your enigmatic demands
that moment before the first kiss
He loves the smell of me  stuck to His fingers
fantasies seek me out endlessly
i could just go on imagining
i envy the sweat that bathes Your skin
His eyes say i am loved
He likes the quavers in my voice
if voice was a scented candle..
“I’m mad about you.”  He said
when nothing is everything
You are a wish
born to play
He meets my depravity  and exceeds it
the more You love me the sexier i become
wrapped in whippy cotton   and trembling with naked want
the longing to be loved  deeply and darkly
tonight again i count on the memory of our kisses
she revels  in the pain of her devotion
longing for an escape
the elemental fear of heartbreak
He never stops  looking at me
i love His watching
I’m wearing a satin robe that gently opens when I move
tonight again it’s just wine that lingers
safe word: smear
soil is full of life
my body and life belong to You
kisses like balm for my soul
soft flowing  dirty thoughts
His mouth soothes me enough  to not discern the beard burns  left on the inside of my thighs
come read in my bed or smoke
desires unravelled  yet needs unmet  all i do is wait
her mind is full of  intimate perversions
go further open that belt
imagining the release
fist my hair hold my head in place  and give my hungry mouth full rein
thinking about Your manhood
at night her pulse deepens
the sensual scent of reserved sweetness
i want that  quiet and heady lovemaking  all over again
the torture of living  without You
You are my wealth
His touch ties my core into knots
i want no freedom  from Your fury
love till i’m a wreck
a heartbreak paved the way  for her every breath to roll in bliss
You’re the tavern and i’m the tainted
You’re an elixir  Your essence is infinite
You make truth seem pleasing
is it a sin to want more?
it’s the savageries  that drive love  to the depths of purity
thirst is a blessing gratification must be so depleting
another lorn night  remedy this evil
in every kiss  i savour Your soul
all i could do was plead
not just desirous I’m demonical with want
unsettled without Your touch every bruise on my flesh  grows dim
her heart is forever hopeful
there are no shadows   down the memory lane
restrained by miles  not limits
redefine the rules
i know from the tension in His collarbone just how fiercely He wants to take me
the irresistible charm  of subdual
the sensual rise  of her shy eyes
i only feel sexy when You undress me
awaken my senses at midnight
let Your tongue  paint on my skin
delicate whispers  desperate warnings
supple breasts  edged with teeth prints
my night doesn’t begin  until You wrap me up in an embrace
elegant body filthy mind
the memories we keep..
glazed secrets lie  between lace  and iridescent skin
a captive of love  there’s no pith  in her prayers
He disapproved my pleas  for savagery with indulgent caresses
imploring sighs  that keep His fire  burning
all of my senses  are in love with You
the breathless romance  of our smiles
her every desire carries an extremity
how sinfully Your eyes  burst upon me and strike my face
soft moans  and mild shivers
she is His dark and dusky secret
He showered me  with everything worthy
i need ferocity
come closer I’m dying to live
His mouth knows no laws
wetter than You think
the insanity of moderation
fingerprints in holes
You and i  all day Sunday
go deeper there remain moans unheard
You and i  and verbs
say You want to be mine
running tongue  along my underlip ‘You were here’ i think to myself
she is sensual opium
of warm winter sunshine and intimacy
You make the world seem right
hold my hand through the mad rush of sensation
this urgency to shed and spill  self consciousness
when love is felt in every breath
Your absence eclipses  the lustre of my nights
lovingly He lets her struggle
love led her astray
she was unaware  of her own need for abandon
when mercifulness disarms
eyes like a kiss of twilight
seek her through her words
I believe in saying it. There are enough mysteries.
there are two kinds of lovers  those who do not have time to undress  and those who are yet to find love
she is all curves
in the dark  He takes my hand
“It is impossible to describe her eyes except by saying that they were the eyes of an orgasm.”
from cracking my bones
love me till i bleed
the beauty of beginnings
“All other women were cancelled by her voice.”
“plantlike fragility”
“royal audacity”
"be brave, you are with me He said"
tears like black liquorice
dark brown eyes and quiet charm
bodies like a pinwheel
pink lips crimson with lovebruises
heavy hands on thick thighs
Your white shirt  my black panties  oh the mess  that fusion whips out
“odorous moisture”
cornered and overwhelmed
just like solitude  You’re always with me
break this spell of my patience
motto: faithfulness
every inch of me craves Your touch
some dreams make her sway
it’s a hungry soul
He’s a wanderer  she the wilderness
“Her name is synonymous with nostalgia.”
in His own darkness  He discovered me
caught up by nightfall and blinded by daydreams
overcome by  a leaden thirst  audaciously she kneels
He loved her mind first
if it wasn’t for Your shadow i would not have become me
some things  will always be possible like making a wish  and so i do
when cravings make home
i am more Yours  when i am without You
"“She desires, hopes and fears, all abundantly and all at the same time.”"
nights full of everything  but sleep
“I’m fond of catching myself red-handed.”
He looks at me with eyes that mirror eternity
wholly  and without mercy
grace my skin Beloved
unburdened by possibility  she nurtures hope
if only  every moment of parting was mercurial as the hours that slip away  when we’re together
being in love  makes me believe  more easily
We look in the mirror  ‘Fading’ i argue “Rose” He asserts
Effortlessly  His words  pin mine
“controlled impatience”
I’ll never give You a reason for saying goodbye
everyday i dare to put this love into words and every day  i struggle
the sound of His voice casts a spell
His smile is the shape of love
my heart throbs where You touched it
back arched hips raised knees apart she presses her agony against His mouth
“guileless longing”
“innocent eagerness”
“You’re transparent to me.”
to bear remembrances of You is why my heart beats
Love is doing what it takes
my sins made me worthy
one heartbreak  makes a poet
You changed the way i look when i wake up each morning
such dynamite cries of pleasure   is it sex  or death  she’s revelling in?
You and i  and walls and floors
the memory of throbs
in losing myself  i found You
beneath unravaged black tights my limbs ache from longing
make me shy
what a pair we make
Your tongue  draws a map  to my madness
love hold fuck me in the now
i express myself best  with goosebumps
a lap like the house of God
like the stars You too are beyond my grasp
it’s not in me to give up trying
You make me feel
He misses her breasts
fantasies have such beautiful faces
i am  Your Venus
every kiss ends  with hope
in what world could we possibly be by ourselves?
You’d always find me wanting
burden me with love
next stop on my knees
thanks to the magic  in a glass of wine
marks more indelible than memories
keep me on Your want to read list
I’m ready for goosebumps
i won’t put us into words...  only You have the exceptional finesse for it
i am seduced by His mingled breath of cum and whiskey
my best kisses  messiest panties  and darkest fantasies are just for You
it’s curiosity  that makes her fearless
kisses soft as smoke
lust is a tenacious weakness
i feel Your hug  closing around me
how violently You indulge
she sleeps for the dreams
for a Sadist no darkness is impenetrable
"Danny Tyran — 'When it comes to wine and buttocks, the redder, the better.'"
He made my dreams  His own
at Your feet  all becomes freed
His mouth suppresses my moans  and His fingers my senses
mind like a landfill  of unspeakable fantasies  and wordless thoughts
He bites as if to dethorn
i want Your belt
the first strike excites  the fourteenth numbs
how i want to take my panties off  and give them to You to sniff
i want to show You more
so weak with want
“ruthless wolf pack of one”
“constantly naive”
she glows when He calls her treasure
their dream cottage  in the mountains  is her pornography
submissive survivor
“French-vanilla curves”
i took perverse thoughts of You with me on a walk in the gardens
You’re a dream i know that won’t ever end
nip my neck and wrap me in rubies
I’m not limited addiction
take me island hopping
bare with me
supple lips  like crushed petals
You’re so far away my cunt is full of tears
“a luxurious free fall into velvet blackness”
old lovers trying new things
in the dark He reads my mind
“She would have been prettier if she knew how to relax.”
I’d give up cigarettes and perfume if I could smell of You endlessly
a heart like a fire marshall
chain me to Your chest
fanatic about commitment
the lethal beauty  of true love
“ecstasies of nostalgia”
try calligraphy  with the tongue
to put it mildly He is wild
i am His  kitten and cat and perversion
feverish fantasies
His voice  the comfort of late evenings
i crave annihilating torment
“Rubik’s cube of grit and edges”
split me apart and sink into me
the way her hips  spread out beneath Him
her lips  the colour of a dirty rose
a stash of You inside my mind
welts like an array of long stemmed red roses set on the back of her thighs
every lick an explosion
feral passion and torrid eroticism
He is love in all its manifestations
a penetrating exploration
effortlessly He conquers the realm of my senses
pulled in tight pushed to excess
i need absolute confinement to feel safe
Rock and rose
memories of a night we never spent
Your touch makes me smell different
“Spiced sophistication”
“a flame of ache”
she sobs  and she sucks
wear me to bed tonight
how His tongue clings to my cleavage
the joy of being  Your darling
nothing is absolute except desire
in anticipation of pain she trembles  while her panties  smell of arousal
with mighty tenderness  He runs a tongue  between my ribs
she’s antique pornography
“zen in their oneness”
You leave me no choice but to swivel around in Heaven
she has a knack for ruin
the fleeting romance  of moonshine
open and facedown she lies waiting like a book  ready to be devoured
You and i  just like a dream
when dreams become a way of living
unless we’re kissing  all air is tasteless in my mouth
His tumultuous passion  rumples my wings of desire
she’s a dainty little butterfly  with a heady spirit
my mind is full of ravings  over the memories we’ve made
deep growls  and muffled moans
tiffany blue eyes  full of dark intent  lying beneath Him feels like sailing under a night sky
i see no other world  beyond You
i want torment that’s the stuff of heaven
what do You think about  when You remember my suffering?
“She was always loyal to a fault.”
invisible darkness
teeth marks  like a chastity belt  on her cunt
i yearn and i burn
hide and peek
“How old do you get before black doesn’t bite you with long teeth?”
even her heels were nude
i want whore delights
dangerous caresses  and how they tear off satin bows
she hears resounding moans  in the whistle of the wind
thinking about Your hungry mouth  on my wet skin
thinking about You  fills me with such rapture
do You taste the sweetness  of my lust   when we kiss?
her arousal glides calmly  like a string of pearls
Your librating tongue makes my quivering lips feel so so sensitive
carry me over the threshold
let’s invent sins
i fall into pieces  in the desire  to please You
this persistent want...
from the depths  of tenderness  her sighs implore  the violence of His love
carnal fury versus futile protests
"“Bodies cannot penetrate each other any more than hands, in spite of all the audacities of thought”"
to share a dream is to be utterly together
i want Your nakedness
the epitome of sublimity  is that space  between Your thighs where i kneel
love me until my lips bleed from kissing
His eyes possess
His eyes violate
imagination lights up her face so well
the dancing eroticism  of part sigh and part moan
You are my hunger
when the body becomes a canvas
His lap is an island of comfort
tug and crush
there’s a stash of urges  buried under my skin
loneliness so cacophonous language can’t interpret it
a smile like the first light
show me the ropes Beloved teach me love  break in   infuse it into my mouth
lick me into shape
every night seizes me  in its loneliness  like a bandit
You’re the One i lack  and the only One i befit
“untender mercies”
“demonic red glow”
she loves to fight hurt with provocation
"when He looks at her and says, “you look good”"
do You see hues of rich red knots peeking through my white blouse?
plump lips swollen from bites
when hiding scars  doesn’t feel right any more
there’s a lot of romance  to surrendering wholly
her sighs of longing  made the wind burn
wantonness is a bitch it makes the night go slowly
i miss You so much it hurts to unbutton
away from You  i’m not myself
“pain is a variety of pleasure”
dirty thoughts of You evolve on my skin
His hand  under my skirt  a quiet revolution
the blush of darkness
growl if You can smell my demands
i desire commands
whisper in loving detail all the filthy things You’re going to do
pleasure begins when the pain is felt
these lascivious needs will devour me
every evening is the kind i wish we were spending together
i suffered  and found what lies  beyond suffering
soft soles against soft lips
dragged through filth but still beautiful
i pine for arduous experiences
my insides yearn for You
the flesh never stops craving
the longing is clawing at my lungs
He loves me more than i love pain
violent kisses  from expert lips
“She is off limits to herself.”
allow me to sink to my knees
beyond the fence
His sea blue eyes lure me  into undressing
“arduously achieved perfection”
He torments me into calmness
she glows from being loved
i want You next to my skin
satiny and sultry  i lie in wait  like sand  along the seashore
His eyes unfold intentions deeper   than i can grasp
He made a virtue of my insanity
a simple whiff a subtle fire  is what i long for
the ache of desire
when ruin becomes ritual
whispers too graphic
voluptuous lips  full of devoutness  open to worship
love doesn’t always fear the fragility of the heart
Memories of You always corner me to a dirty thought
darkness that dazzles
You are  in every deep sensation moving through my body
how effortlessly our thoughts  become intimate
i miss the raw power of Your touch
“I go on loving you after we are asleep.”
how He subdues  her restraint
i hate that my white blouse is still uncreased
bitten lips  like bruised autumn leaves
in His heart i made home
a girl daytime diamonds  kind of sassy
a caress  in every glance
i love You imperfectly but faithfully
Your fingers  in my mouth calm me
every word  an emotion
the exertion   of ceaselessly desiring
invisible romance  the best kind
soft breaths burdened by throaty whispers
laceless panties kind of lonely
make every hug end with a squeeze
i won’t taint this divine love  by sulking that it isn’t Your first  or pondering if it’s Your last
can You tell how much i love myself just because i belong to You?
aggressively He enters my mind
He unzips and i lose all discipline
i crave the kind of touch that tears
devour me more than literature
i miss You  over my tongue  and in my throat
first steps don't always falter
how her nipples burn  for His mouth
like an angel she falls at His feet
fierce lovers  they kiss as one
i find it sublime when He takes my hand and brings it to His lips
i devour Him with insolence
i nurture depravity  in duplicate dreams
i find the subtle unmistakable traces of perversity in Your eyes   overwhelming
speak to me of love in silent gestures
i’m greedy for a glimpse of You
sophistication is erotic
i am hypnotised by Your gentility
discipline everything but my thoughts
fearsomely passionate fucking
she is the flickering lamplight in the darkest corners of His mind
how pertly His possessive hands dishevel my sleek hair
just like Him His pleasures too are unpredictable
arching my back and thinking dirty thoughts
lust hurts love endures
in fantasy if not in flesh
i have learned to long for suffering
Beloved Tormentor  how You make me  love You more  everyday
every goosebump  asks for a caress
i’m weary of words all i can say is i miss You
the calming power  of torment
oh this thirst  in my blood
slower the whisper darker the word
my suffering  is insufficient  to His savagery  and that’s what makes my submission beautiful
except an innocent smile all her virtues have strayed
blindfolded and pinned in bed with her mind left free to wander
“word made flesh”
i get by using my nimble fingers  and hunger greatly  for Your hard  and insistent touch
His tender fingers  reward my pain
sometimes His eyes  make me swallow  my words
when patience becomes a battle
His hunger  is infectious
allow me all sins
a lasting harmony   like that of black panties and dampness
my skin longs to breathe   the feral scent of You
weigh on me like night descending
fill my mouth  and hollow out the whimpers
i hunger  for Your wet warmth
when You’re on my mind my hands refuse to remain idle
a growl like a prelude  to ruination
my mind is full of Your presence
i arch until my soft lips  skim Your shoulder blades
there’s everything beautiful  about her struggle
beneath Him she’s all consent
"feed my unblessed mouth, Beloved"
on my knees  i plead
alone in a bed for two  i feel as dim as winter
if You must take leave leave welts on my flesh
bruises like rosebuds  across her pale throat
suffering lays her love bare
with Your every whisper my sobriety softens
don’t You think it’s a sacrilege  making me wanton  and leaving me waiting?
the sound of her sated sighs  like God showered heaven’s beauty on her
with lingering traces of wildness  His arms close in around me  spooning before surmounting
douse upon me every last drop like i’m a sinner
bites like beauty marks along her thighs
the virtues of belonging
there is summer’s worth of heat in His every kiss
choose wildness over words tonight
her only ornament  is His silver collar  at her throat
spiralling  at first lick
a bedtime story  told with breaths alone
He makes my stresses invisible
dainty little darling  but she smells of licorice
the place I’ve loved the best  lies at His feet
loving You makes the pulse of my life  buzz with inebriety
“juvenile audacity”
use teeth for my nipples itch
thinking savage thoughts of You and doing tender things to myself
hearts that love  unconditionally  last unbroken
i love the unseen You
i trust Your unsaid words
winter nights and aching hearts
come delight  in my glazed secrets
pining  to be devoured
His Dominance  is a blessing
i am conquered  by a sole glance
some wild desires just won’t wear
fuck her aristocracy away
hungry as a hunter yet He waits for her to beg
scandalised  and aroused all at once
when the writer becomes part of the story
never been so severely loved  never loved with heart spliced open
one hearty kiss  and I’m overcome
fulfilment through suffering
i need the sound of Your voice  to learn how to keep still
i long to feel Your warmth
my lips tingle as if they’d like to be bitten
i like His intimate  and strong words
“I want to take you to bed.”
cut loose my G string  and You’ll know how much i think about You
my hunger for You keeps reappearing
correct my errors  unbuckle that belt
i arch my back and reach for another violent thrust
never winning but never giving up
tether my mouth  to the twitch
Your scent  keeps me unsated
old book for cold weather kind of read
love is most beautiful  when suffered for
Beloved unite my desires with Yours  let’s leave nothing untried
inside His arms there is love  that resembles endlessness
she’s nothing extraordinary  and yet He can not take His eyes off her face
i want new fears
sublimely His lips skim the crimson welts  inside my thighs  and then my wet cheeks
to burn and to melt is bliss
He’s a tireless beast
violently conflicting feelings whirl within me and i find myself wet with arousal  craving Your violations
have i even lived before You? have i loved?
with such taste He charts bite marks on my inner thighs
her vulnerable breaths  wander amid a throng of unfurled desires that  grips her heart
the magnificence that is  Your ensured presence in my dreams
Beloved i trust You not to count my needs  as mere desires
tell me how to indemnify  for being allowed  in Your every thought
love has filled me with poetry
simply and fully  i belong to my Beloved
all i want is Your present moment
beaming with relief  i curl up inside His embrace  inner thighs still warm and trembling
once again tonight  i fill my bed  with the incense  of wantonness
on my knees  and hands  i crawl and allure Him with a wild scent like that of moist jungle air
Your hands on my body bring me home
i need an assertive dose of Dominance
disobedient desires ruffle the blissful tranquility of the night
wild and wilful dreams are part of the charm
between words we infuse long and meaningful silences as natural as our breathing
You mean more to me than books
"unzip, play"
Only You  have the valor  to bear  my untiring devotion
“pits of love”
she’s prettiest on her knees
without words  they rave all night
demand all my love and then some more
Beloved You breathe in me
“Your absence is inconspicuous  Nobody can tell what I lack”  #plath
“My hours are married to shadow”
“His is an iron mood”
lick clean  my filthy mouth
one thing  is supposed to lead to another
a heart so full of love it sprinkles colour into her cheeks
a lifetime spent  desiring or forbearing
thoughts of You run piously through my head  if not as forethought then as flashback i’ve kissed my sleep goodbye
He chastises  like He cares tirelessly
the more i get the more i want such enslaving love
total abandon  and other intimacies
a secret makes her glow
His bites on my thighs punish my silence
“I am red meat”
make me feel good i plead crying
a love worth suffering for
pearly white gusset  darkened grey with wetness
He calls me vulgar names yet i hear the love in each
longings smoulder inside me  primal and infinite
just four walls and very dark inside
i only want what i deserve
the pain is unbearable  but i have more to give
relentlessly the night goes on hoping I’d embrace sleep
are you even a lover if you’ve never felt like being at war?
intimately quiet and shrouded in need i lie in wait
there are unimaginable delights  in the depths of decadence
chocolate rich words  deliciously dark
breasts like blooming lilies  nipples that taste of burnt coffee
be generously vulgar  when You whisper
simply desire
nights don’t ever dazzle me they are just empty days  that are unworthy of You
longingly i drift into the world of dreams
thinking about our joined mouths
i skip bedtime to think about You
i long to feel Your love sticky on my thighs
pin and thrust hard until  i’m a martyr to bruises
on my knees  and hungry with delight i lean closer  my mouth inches away from being fucked
this ache born of lust  and Your absence  i envy them each other
the bristles on His beard gleam Silver  from the tears His kisses wiped off my face
He stills me with a growl long enough to strangle me
the sanctuary of hands
i grip His finger and it all becomes easier to cope
He kisses my breast and i can feel the horizon curving around me
i do not lade my every desire  with a plea for fulfilment  because that’s not what lovers do
“The mark of love is that vice seems like skill.”
if You wish make me suffer
You are the throb of my desire  without You  all there is is nothingness
You are with me even when I’m with someone else
He gives me marks that evoke my depravity
You are within  But i want You with me. In me.
I’m the goblet  He’s the patron with a thirsty soul
He takes my lips  between His open lips  and i simply let go
these bruises  are the colour of smoke  but ache like a riot
i shiver at Your slightest ingress
let the chill of the night insistently expose my lament  at being away from You
none of my spells is good enough if i can’t sleep in Your arms every night
can’t escape the miserable without You
how many sensations do i have to feel to make up for Your absence?
can a woman in love ever remain decent?
i stretch languorously in an empty bed  and cannot resist debauchery
"“I’m home now!” He says  “Yes, You are home.” i reply. “And always will be.”"
trembling lips  reminiscent of a thirst unquenched
You remind me of Your absence
with a single glance  He makes me who i am
be one with me  overpower my spirit
being in love made me understand fire
warm me with Your breaths
He loves me in my grace  and my ugliness
the moon rises  to awaken the world of lovers
He is everything  and the opposite of everything
i can hear Your every whisper in the wind tonight
so eager and hungry  i could eat up the hours that separate us
there is a hint of crimson in her cheeks  just from anticipation
i would leave paradise  to return to You
i hope Your hands never wear of reading my body
searching for ecstasy  i lean into Him
“Museum of Englishness”
"“The kind of fear that doesn't separate you from your desire, but instead arouses you, gives you wings”"
in coalescing breaths  i say i love Him as He caresses my throat  purposefully
did night fall after she evoked evil?
"“For me, freedom is to enter your cage.”"
my endless worship of the depth of Your heart  makes our love eternal
stormed with thoughts of You i shut my eyes
i want to live forever  in the shadow of Your writing
expose my beauty to Your words
do not undress me  so slowly Beloved  the sun will want to leer and come shining
my thoughts need the rigor of Your words
our intimacy burns brighter  than the night is dark
salvation is  the sound of  Your voice
hush  then hurt
i want Your blessing on my tongue
is it not an art  to agonise beyond the bounds of fleshly desires?
take my hand let’s surpass fantasy
lonely nights and forgotten promises
my lips will never forsake  tempestuous moans of Your name
i lean into Him for kisses  on every bruise He fed into my skin
does the craving never end or do i not admit satiety?
behold my depleted dignity  and dote on His mastery
read His words  and marvel at my beauty
this love is conditional  on parting
part whisper  part warning
it aches to  cross my legs so tight
strong and silent she’s beautiful to Him
let’s try everything once  so we know what You like
He spins out conversations  just to relish my windsong voice
out of restlessness  she sleeps entangled  with moonbeams
going the distance with You felt like i nosedived within myself
some old stories  found a new meaning
some new feelings  fulfilled old desires
they applaud  when i suffer in wait and call it a sin  when i fantasise
i confessed  figmental crimes  and kept our secret  unsuspected
a lattice of brown fringes  lurks on her face  like black magic
like a scattering of leaves  under the weight of autumn  her story bears a melange of crises   in a sordid life spent unloved
Your arousal hurts my core
my mouth hurts  wanting You
seize it then give me back my kiss
we know each other   without looking
i like it dark
“He is not afraid of the stink of love.”
He’s not merciless  but sometimes He shows no mercy
I don’t want to sleep because then You wouldn’t torment me anymore
His eyes turn me to sodden pulp
she let the tears flow so her barren soul wouldn’t show
our journey is my mecca  i don’t seek the ultimate
a cache of unspoken desires  shades her lips ruinous red
“What’s wrong with needing?”
this feu de joie  of our emotions burning with intimacy  shall i call it love?
is the scenery more vivid to a free bird in the sky? or does a caged one see every rose a deeper red?
when misleading illusions won’t charm anymore
there is an innate familiarity  in watching the warmth  of the setting sun  unfrock the sea
when possibilities won’t pacify anymore
my sleep lies settled along the crescent of an old moon
there is tremendous comfort  just in thinking about You
my trust in You  cultivates self love  and elegant  fearlessness
my restless limbs won’t tire of squirming in need of You
He spanks and caresses  all at once
i have lain in bed alone  needing You  and died many nights
just as night falls lust rises
bring me the delight of tears
i breathe on His skin the scent dreams are made of
almost fearlessly i reach and feel for  His hardness
"spill on me, Beloved"
we have our love  to keep us warm
until we met   i barely realised  just how little  i’ve been loved
she let her heart  make up her mind
sometimes the best stories  are true
imagine wanting only me
discoveries are fun
the night is sultry enough  to keep me awake
i hearken Your scent  when You’re gone
“I just want you.”
her tears shame the stars
like a torrent kisses flow from His lips
I’m a slave to desires   not sins
love is patient desire is restless
flesh so drippy and desiring  even Your breath on it hurts
there’s a lot to love about dreams
You know so well how to hurt
i want Your mouth  on the bruises You can’t see
weave me a jalousie of growls  between the spread of my thighs
tell her you love her say it with gold
a million dreams lit by the fever of longing throng the darkness
every time we walk hand in hand i feel like humming a tune
“privileged yet servile”
You’re the white marble mantel  i’m the fire blazing beneath
maybe my dress is the colour of the sunset where You are
this lasciviousness is maddening
“Each kiss is a kiss of immediacy.”
endearingly short conversations
incurable love
lost love
virginal love
unrequited love
platonic love
illicit love
erotic love
nostalgic love
ours is the most special and complete type of love
if only i could find in Your words  traces of Your scent
smear filthy whispers all over my marble body
neither direction nor destination matters as long as my  companion is You
my unbounded humility  will make me starve i fear
“lashings of sex”
“I have been thinking about the girl I met last night in the mirror.”
they got devoured by bashful murmurs  all the words i wanted to say
He keeps lavishing me with excesses  i keep hungering irresistibly
my skin  misses the succour  of Your breaths
the misery of illusion
submissively  she knelt and opened herself  and there and then  He decided  to love her
rip off my blouse  and listen to my heart
be gently rough
all night long  I’ll purr for You
musings  hold me captive  and how
He looked  He touched  He felt
“isolated ecstasies also possess charms”
her reticent eyes  put a bridle on the tears  and shimmer tremulously  to say how much she wants  to suffer the violence  of His love
“charms so fresh and appetising”
tormented by an ache  that only Your fire can temper
together we waft  to a world where desires do not bear the burden  of innocence
“perpetually submissive”
this tireless yearning i speak of is not a romantic saga of heroism
loneliness over patience
“stained by barbarities”
“consoled by caresses”
long and hard  is how i want You  to think about me
thoughts of You  sling a cascade of  glistening trickles along my thighs
Your kiss  poured inside me   kindred passions
i’m lost in reverie  no more  now that You  are reality
my dreams have no shame
lapses limitations  lonesomeness   c’est la vie
Your imperfections do not intimidate me for my own flaws are glorious
kneeling or collapsing is all i know
her wilfulness continues to amaze Him
those bites drained the scent from my skin
the night is flat without You
Pervading
Mocha
an intercourse of emotions
it hurts to miss You
measure my love by how much i hurt for You
"“You’re mine”, He says  etching a thick collar  of heel prints  to gird my throat"
weep on my lips  as i beg You to cum
imposing silhouettes of You make my mind blossom
there is no limit to the brutality she could crave
can You hear the flames?
the tussle of kissing
“thick with humiliation”
Your scent on my skin  fills me with a wild sensation  and makes me hungry for You
Your love is the heart of my life
exceptionally gentle gaze and yet i shiver
i can almost feel Your tongue curling inside my mouth
do to me what i cannot do enough for myself
fuck the ladylike vanities out of me
she loves how He loves  taking care of her
grateful for winter  and how it snips my sultriness
a love spell called Sir
His lips on mine  playing as violins
with darkness comes urgency
i desire mercilessness
His voice makes it impossible  to disobey
menaced by wantonness
hogtie me  i hate to leave
i crave hurtful touching
indulging in solitary infamies
you’re meant to find her wandering the museum shop
sangria tinged lips  forming a perfect O
“riotous awkwardness”
i am slain  by the arresting tactility  of Your words
He talks dirty  in the most elegant phrases
the auroral glow of satiety
i love You with a depth only You can sense
this dark night is making a starlet out of me
I’ll please You with all I’ve got and then we’ll sleep together
intuitively He affirms  the sapid stickiness  of my panties
I’ll happily do all the wanting
His words echo  a sense of infinity
a fatal powertrain  of sleek whispers
"this wanton feeling without a name, I’d call it after a volcano"
let's be demons by fire
my perfume makes me think of a vineyard in the south of France
wholeheartedly i accede  to Your will
the line between love  and pain is hard to see
His voice heartily deep yet soft to hear
words that shimmer
this immortal illusion  of You close to me
the sense of You never leaves me
pull me closer  before worries take hold
all Your words are mine
spanked for being on His mind on a hectic day
Love is rarely tender
saved by Your love of me
He makes me feel small then tells me I'm beautiful
fuck me until an indomitable ache  echoes throughout
all that glistens
voice breaks  tears endure
piece together  all my lost smiles
desperate for a million kisses
this never-ending war  on loneliness
ordinary girl  ferocious musings
put me on Your reading list
simply dressed but bruised everywhere
she smokes a cigarette  making whirlpools in His coffee
skin on skin depravity against darkness
the way the sea breaks against a warm rock  is how i want to feel whole again
His hand rests  against my chest and everything  falls in place
overwhelmed by new perspectives
"""thong steeped in brandy"""
"""infatuated with evil"""
Yes Sir i proclaim in gasps  when He asks if i am a brave girl
just before i soar i come apart
steal a kiss as i moan
fucking without giving a fuck  that
vulgarly exposing and then piercing  this tender flesh  that belongs to You is how i sin
i convoke desires waiting  for You
i lie in wait for You
the kind of destruction  that feels alive
and so i bury all my fancies   in words
in my fantasy  Saturday afternoons are spent  making love endlessly
her pleas don't seem to exhaust Him and that's fucking sexy
countless orgasms wait  to be howled out
let Your thoughts run wild  until Your hands find my flesh
i am transfixed by His eyes  just as He is by my smell
it's not enough that Your words reach everywhere  my flesh craves You
i need respite from these unceasing lonely nights
You underestimate my eagerness for intimacy
i get high on the names You call me behind closed doors
the drop-dead  gorgeous stillness of spent passion
touch me and undo  my flaws
all it takes  is one wonderful thought and my toes curl in servility
Your love makes me brave
can You feel me  stirring inside You?
i can feel You on me
obsessively  she ruminates
there is impiety  in His hands  but those moonlit eyes  radiate mercy
this undefiled passion could tear my veins
devotion above all other virtues
i've never known a dark as dark as You
i want to know all that You know about me
"""yells of lust"""
with the most  blatantly insolent smile  i arouse  His savagery
silence as meaningful as dampness
spreadeagled in bed she lies motionless twitching her pink lips
"""She was the exception that proved the rule."""
You're my Storm God
feelings too deep for words
this love is my only cure
a girl like an autumn leaf with her blouse sleeves rolled up
i am Yours  for life  forever
it's delightful  how the fear struggles out of her mind
her breaths  are lost  in the murmur  of His whispers
harder He swats  more fleshy her breasts become
"let there be no departure tonight, Beloved"
her body sways  just as His hand settles
I'm out of breath thinking about how You love to bite my lip and make it bleed
He bites my lip  then blots the bleed with His tongue
swathe me in filth   then tell me what is pleasure for You
irate desires flood the night
the pleasure of defeat
my skin insists for more everywhere You've kissed it before
the fury of need
take me to bed and start again
maybe the magic cannot exist  without absence
an ache to be ruined stays with me beneath the fragility
hands that strip me to my blood
do You like how intimidated  my skin smells?
surviving on opium dreams
spooned to sleep fucked awake loved into fragments
the way His eyes steep in grey when He's hungry for me
wondering what You've done with my black bikini
"""I'm in love with you."""
she sweetens  at the slightest touch
the agony  of restraint
inch inside me sleek and slow
how uncontrollably  her thighs weep
splayed open on Your chest  like a story close to Your heart
His fingers find me flickering with need
so many ways to be wild
i long to be soaked in the refinement  of Your scent
"""His blue eyes were the only colour in the room."""
lips like frozen roses  that need soaking   in Your dewy breath
eyes so blue  they dominate the seascape
words so striking  they envelope me  with their roar
eager and unwilling  to wait i run my tongue along the teeth of Your zip
"""He comes to her daily, slipping into her mind between breaths."""
the touch of His hand  graceless as carnage
the way He kisses  with infamy on mind
the weightlessness    lies heavy on my tongue and i feel starved
miles cut apart  closeness lingers
my choicest hedonic pleasure is to share a mind  with You
Your hot breath  along my neck kindles a storm of sighs
the night is an anchor of our darkness
with impatience  i obey
love me tender  with the touch of verse
there is incessant endurance   on the other side of my whimpers
kisses so deep  He shut my throat
the thunder of Your growl  causes a million tiny goosebumps  to tremble across my flesh
quiet brown eyes  full of blank sweetness scour His gaze  and find it rife  with assault
contentment  is blissful  but the hunger  is bottomless
pull me close  carry me off  i'm a flimsy jailbird
be it walking up to You lilting beside   or lingering behind  i feel worthy  as a bride
You are  the tinsel  in my heart  and the void  in my bed
rip my caution  to shreds
"in terms of withstanding incredible amounts of pleasure through suffering, i don't think there's anything better than unfading servitude"
i am too unchaste  to be without You right now
rough me up Your way
sext: invade
take this filth off the streets  and onto Your sheets
i muse over  Your taste whorling  nut butter  on my tongue
my duskiness  loves Your darkness
ruby lips bronzed from ravaging
panting into His chest like the wind against the barn
desire like a fever
the night aches with possibility
a hug  like an inferno drawn close
my excessive need  Your ravenous appetite  perfect
violently His tongue seeks mine
nip this sultriness off the silk of my panties
"still harder, if possible.."
prayerfully  i kneel and hold Him snugly in my mouth
tickles self intimately and obsessively
in Your embrace i return to reality
my mind is brimming with daydreams
i want You before night falls
wash this thirst off me
sobs answering roars
those hours of closeness i want them to be long and never ending
“The mirrors covering all the walls multiply their reflections...
"""malicious reflections"""
anticipation as ecstasy
we kiss hard  as each tastes  the breath of life
sips like a lady swallows like an exorcist
her blush darkens  with fear  and pleasure
what is for You satiation  is for me  emancipation
find me through Your fingers
feel at home  as i suck all unease  out of You
i feel a dangerous impulse to devour Your heart
how i cherish  those blessed moments of feeling secure  as i kneel before You
first a trickle then a torrent
the lure of Your sadism
"""Spoilage is part of life."""
in Your arms lies  the best of all possible worlds
i hold on to the pain  until my suffering  begins to startle Him
once an orchard  allowed to go wild now
"""What is wrong with hunger? What are our appetites for if not to tell us what we need?"""
my sublimity needs a sin like You
His merciless fingers  pierce a hole in my tights allowing all grace to trickle out
i persist until my soul starts to heal from the pain
"""Hush! listen to the throb of my heart""    He says pressing a palm tight  at my throat"
my need of You is menacing
He satiates me by promising  happiness
He delights in seeing how i stir inside
at first  i squirm but then i yield
"""Always on the brink between caresses and lashings."""
“I was in a state of intoxication that cloaked me as if it were a fireproof suit.”
aching for pleasure  i reread Your words
breaths and skin meld  and our souls sink  into blissful harmony
her fervent sighs break through the sulky silence
i need to touch myself or this lull might shatter me
make me suffer  deeply
the avid thirst in Your eyes  impelled the rupture of spring in me
He coaxed me to blossom
i struggle violently  as He devours me with risqué murmurs
wound me to Your whim
i'm torn between poise and perversity
what do i have to do  to suscitate You?
she implores  undoing   more intense  than the night
how i love  those cathartic moments  when You drench me  in debauched passion
Your pleasure  my pledge
Your touch my riches
Your scent  my provocation
Your words  my dope
Your arms  my hideaway
Your heart  my home
Your eyes  my abyss
imaginary whispers  reverberate through me and i shiver  with a compelling need
i feel You and yet i miss You
blushing pink  with thoughts of indulging  in Your dark charm
of all my weaknesses my passion is the most dangerous
i am unfinished  without You
i love You imperfectly but faithfully
He tells me to hush in a tone that allows no fuss
Look at how a single candle can both defy and define the darkness. ~ Anne Frank
fuck force me into the light
"""unaffected by revolutions"""
the way He calls us a perfect match
You're on my mind  and suddenly everything  is a temptation
i assume nothing until You fill me
"""Insatiable nostalgia for chastity."""
i have a memory of the night we haven't spent yet
a wind of lustful thoughts  has ruffled my longing terribly
wanna be the song You play on loop
You are my darker half
i find myself aroused  and drunken with craving  watching Him  place my food order for me
my eyes  hunt for  the beast  in You
intimate caresses and obscure boundaries
His mind is full  of dark corners
blindfolded  and wide awake  i put my faith in good hands
with absolute fervency He touches my soul
He likes the way my torment sounds
He enjoys  the violence  of her wild thirst
the insatiable desire of feeling wanted
how freely  His imagination penetrates  my fantasies
then He pinches savagely far up my thigh
He smells of cut grass  and dark musks  and i kiss Him everywhere
i want us in bed longer than life
i gave Him intimate exposure   to my pain
if You allow me to blow Your mind  i will
what a shame  that my black lace thong  in tantalising satin with little rear coverage  isn't sodden and sticky
ecstasy  disguised as suffering
why don't You whip my weaknesses?
weary of being so wanton
come closer  and turn off my ordinary
His damnably soft whispers  molest my calm and make me soaking wet
musings betrayed  i lie in bed needing You
alive with eroticism
distracted by desires
our intimacy emptied me of all shame
possessed by the passion  to be annihilated
the secret bond  between love and pain
the lingering pleasure  of memories
dazed into silence  i lower my eyes  and open my mouth
ours are among those invigorating lives  that are nourished by love
"""she makes love without mistrust"""
You hold the key  to my darkness
she is pure will
His weighty gaze  shoots holes  in my seductive power
how gratifying  it is  to suffer  dutifully
caress a little  just a few words
tempestuous kisses  from Your hungry mouth rubricate my inner thighs
Our sentient hearts feel this love being blown away by winds of eternity  and know we are forever
"""i am utterly Yours""  i say to myself  as You sniff me"
i miss You devastatingly  as the hours linger with a ghostly tenacity
the pervasive scent of sensual liberation
Just like the world comes a full circle my wishful heart  unfolds a lifetime  of happy memories  that make me whole
her dark desires masquerade along the line between impulse and caution
i become overwhelmed  He becomes observant
"Oh, to be in company with You"
"""Desire lies just under the frosting of good manners."""
"""To heal is to torture."""
the thrill of fear
how impartially He reads  the thoughts i haven't put into words yet
"""It's not that I hope for it, it's a necessity."""
sarcous spells of stillness seize me in Your absence bringing life to a screaming halt You're the violent windstorm that can ruffle my wings
i taste like home  You say why then are my lips devoid of Your kisses
i am chained to You impalpably
this feeling of decadence  only grows
there is depravity always lurking in the shadows
the blessedness that is the warmth from Your hands
would You like a honey break?
the weight of so many lonely nights tortures me
"""indulgent with a hint of arrogance"""
make me struggle  and suffer  for You
how blithely my taut nipples  become tender in Your mouth
how skilfully You find ways  to make me beautiful
buried in Your sturdy embrace  i feel at peace nowhere else
i puff out a grim mess  of heavy smoke  trying to hold back and lull deep cries of Your name
tardily my body shrivels up like a parched bloom  waiting for a rainstorm
Your memories are lashing into my mind and intensifying my need
I'm fantasising about the exquisite and insufferable pain separating my limbs as i come apart in a throng of spasms
He places no limit  on how long  she ought to seduce
the kind of pain that makes it impossible to think
been touched before but never in the heart
I'm overwhelmed  by my own need to be perfect  for You
"""in his robust blood I floated, drying on my tears."""
this unkissed and hungry mouth can be such an insolent burden
provoking You with a heavy scent of pleasure  i shudder in delicious anticipation
"""Ask the books that i read why I changed."""
"""only the unloving feel pain.."""
she suffers at the mercy  of her own dark desires
growls so deep  they whip at my nerve
the weight of my longing will choke me
my body aches for acquiescence
not all gold is buried  there is also sunken gold
without You my face is like  a cloudy sky  my eyes like  a dreary room with the lights put out
my lips miss frolicking around the edges  of the grey suede that frames Your face before settling in a cozy nook where i plant a tender kiss
slake my turmoils  with Your thumb in my mouth
"""She was like an animal that had exposed itself to the magnificent fury of the seasons, the suns, the rains and the harsh dry winds..."""
bestow upon my simplicity  crimson bruises and sooty scars
the soberness  of my striptease tempts Him to claim my vulnerability with wild kisses  that trace a brooch along the whorl of my bare breast
kiss me like You're forgiving a sinner
this obsession with suffering  will be my undoing
her sighs resemble the crinkling of ale on hot charcoal
seized by desire  i leap into His arms
His orgiastic whispers  make me part  with my morals
love is a sin worth holding on to
He feeds me love  with words
Your voice mysteriously smooth   Your words  rich and scandalous
Your skin smells of incense soaked wood
You smell incomparable
His words  get under my skin rasp love upon my heart and inflame my spirit
"dear me, His words supple as silk  yet set a match to my soul"
free of make up i suit His sophistication  wearing all black
undressed and on edge  i quiver impatiently  into being  Your slut
cradle me long enough for my woes to melt away
my body can't tell the difference between fear and arousal
threadbare and consumed i latch on to You in bed like Your favourite nighttime read
comely thighs and fleeting sighs
You lay hands on me and i blaze in every colour
You're on my mind and my skin is on fire
"""illicit lipstick besmearing"""
i stretch taut my neck  in readiness to be victim
You wouldn't believe how savorous my panties are
"""What's nurtured slowly grows well."""
i could write about You endlessly
cave in and etch ballads  on my nape
throughout the silent night  i feel Your hunger  like percussion
i imagine Your fevered caresses  and feel sensations  spurt through my limbs
wet with heat  and thirsting for You
how salaciously  my name writhes on His tongue
an onslaught  is necessary  because  she's fearless
i miss the scent of us wish You'd left a mere whiff  for me to survive
shamelessly  she squirts
You're never too far  for comfort
one ruminative look  and i know You want me
bite my smile
i'm so breakable it's delightful
scars that were meant to be kisses
they met by her lure of the forbidden
not just yes oh yes!
so envious of the way the Sun dips into the sea
with a sigh she melts into His arms
Cunt lips like figs  dipped in honey gel
"""there's a dark side to beauty, as with poisonous butterflies."" Atwood"
wakeful nights  full of wants
i want Your lips on me
she walks up to Him  and He thinks about how lovely she would look crawling
i want to be violated by Your instincts
a long bar full of men  and all i can think about  is You
i want to lose myself  in the awe of the unknown
out of devotion she suffers then pleads for pity
forlorn soul besmirched by hunger
"""The dream was so vivid that it did not fade with waking."""
supple nipples twisted to torture
with savage hands  He nips the bud in bloom
He bites my lip as if to scorch my mouth for idleness
i roll my eyes He rolls cuffs
sacrilegious timepiece
slowly  we walk deeply we kiss reluctantly  i say goodbye
each pulse  an absurdity
my flesh  perfumed with Your scent  as sole adornment
whet appetite
a lace choker at her throat  like a specimen of His fingerprints
i feel Your love to the lowest ebb of mercilessness
when fantasy blossoms into a passion
bite me and find pleasure
"""Love reduces the complexity of living."""
heavens opened  when You touched  my heart
from threat to arousal to pain to pleasure
Satan needed feeding
i won't beg You to stop
luckily  He wants  what she has
presumptuous little slut
"""Letters are commonplace enough, yet what splendid things they are... like an elixir of life!"""
she wears colours that don't make her look younger
lifting the folds of her skirt she looked up at Him and smiled
"""A lover's visit is the most delightful thing in the world."""
a bed to myself makes for a painful night
her servile body blushes like beaten silk
"""One's attachment to a man depends largely on the elegance of his leave-taking."""
"""elegant pastimes"""
tell me when to come
"""Nothing less than passion can satisfy me now."""
"""I am so hungry for the little intimacies."""
i wait with grace  and in torment
"God, what kisses"
"""He carries the power to destroy and create suffering."""
i crave climaxes
"""They don't understand how spoiled i am. He gives me the world."""
tighten the corners  of my mouth fill me  with Your searing toughness
how His tenderness wells up  as we spoon
write more letters than tweets
nothing hurt me until You said goodbye
a daydream so riveting  i forgot to drink my coffee
with such innate ferocity  He inhales me
these desires  are a necessity
in forsaken moments  of late nights  i find You  in myself
in Your arms  my weaknesses waver
"""The hours I have spent in cafes are the only ones I call living, apart from writing."""
how's being sober?
all that this infernal night needs  is Your deep husky voice
a happy soul is the highest kite that can fly
"in a word, holyshit"
to be loved once  is to feel loved forever
shh  such a tiny word so much mess it makes in her panties
She is destruction
the bruises are beginning  to hurt less  and i feel enslaved  by the sensibility
He is violence
my berserk heart  needs to be laid bare
reading You till my eyes water
it hurts a lot when the bruises heal
shimmering lace like paper craft clings to her in the dark
thinking of You  makes me glisten
"""In a corner of my soul, I discovered someone worthy of worship."""
iris lips press soft kisses  on toes that have stubbed cigarettes all day
dripping with allure  she's licked all over
quivering with hunger  she's a perfect picture of feral fortitude
how the tenderness  of Your touch  collapses in the folds  of my chestnut hair
eyes that caress  smile that kisses   from a distance
wildness that comes with maturity   that
an absolute defeat is what i need
observe how hungry i am
i believe in the persistence  of Your touch
"""The flesh sins, the flesh atones for sin"""
she rests her head  on His chest  and dreams
effortlessly  He puts me in my place  and i brace myself  for spoiling
He has a weakness for everything that's easily broken
He knows  when my no means yes
a girl like a forgotten classic
need it   now
i take You in quietly and feel You deeply
she enjoys the pleasures of gardening too the girl who has a liking for violence
He put me on a pedestal then swooped me up to the sky
i still feel the glowing embers of Your touch  ascend the curve of my hips
swirls of shimmering sweetness  cradle in my thighs
You put my universe  on a magic carpet
in the middle of the night He takes my soul
hard kisses  like rain on lashes
warm kisses  like the skin of sun
how a single embrace  binds spirits
lips like petals gently parting
"""I had perverted tendencies: I believed everything I read."""
His groans scatter salty clouds on my tongue
she's a feline prowl of a woman
tempted  to provoke  and be made powerless
caress me  with words
every touch as if for eternity
violent desires and fiery fantasies   live in the darkest depths of my mind
it's powerful and everlasting  this feeling of fragility
feverishly breathless  yet i arch to meet  Your repeated thrusts
the drug of masochism
her sense of woman is unique
"'My motif. My God... well, so long as you can't see my motives.'"
“Invigorated by the reckless blooms of spring she took to the street like a blossom on the breeze.”  -Lenora Blumberg
open me up to the idea of escape
my sticky fingers smell of something You'd have loved on Your hand and sniffed
she blooms like a fairytale
the kind of love that reminds you of the simpler joys in life
i do not fear my vulnerabilities
i long to feel Your intensity
You are the obsessive thirst    of all my nights
my whimpers  against Your skin
You give my soul a whirl
Love has no slang
i'm guessing You're craving me right now
"Beloved, i plead oneness tonight"
fleshy lips  or an offensive mouth  what is it that seduced you?
empty into my mouth  until i choke
gauge her mood  by the length of her mascaraed lashes  the depth of her kohl  and the height of her block heels
open the abyss then pull me closer
i hold Your love in my heart like flames in a fireplace
she's the woman He dreams about
without a care she fell in love
she hurts like a slut should yet smiles like a weary princess
grab me by the hair and shake off my tenderness
i miss the feel of Your palm warm against my hip
she soaks the inside of her wrist  with daubs of cognac cologne to hide the vulnerabilities that quiver on her skin
this madness might lead somewhere
what would become of me without Your love?
pin my wrists  before my hand goes astray
the pain feels good  where You've kissed it
wearing black and holding back so much decadence
gently He strokes  my scars
hold my wandering gaze  and weigh me down to my place
too many sighs  not much of You
such savagery  i muse  as we spoon
all my nights in exchange for intimacy with You
Your glance is enough  to make me surrender
let's get greedy
lips too red thoughts too dark and my guard down
touch my luminous body with Your dirty mind
because of You i know how to be loved
love me despite my obsessions
bonding by kneeling  miles away
for now just hold me in Your mind
i am always wondering about our fate
sit me in Your lap and i'll tell You all about my day
sexual restlessness  not just a craving
He's the Man
to be tame or to be wanton
i feel You but i miss the feel of You
i've been knotty
as her mind wandered  her words flowed on paper
my skin wants Your scent
my fucking soul wants taking
wrists want rope burns
ears want growls
lips want bleeding
seducing You  with absolute stillness
He saves me from orderliness
my head is full of memories
the sharpness of hunger
maybe I'll just tickle my cunt to sleep
tonight have me all
He gropes desperately  and i am warm
are You proud of my singed soul?
i like the idea of a realm  where limits are plundered
fancying ferocious perversions  and why not?
You are the one  in complete control
a few flails stroke her supple breasts and hot tears streak  her young cheeks
what could be more evocative  than You breathing life into me
it's so good to be alive  because i have Your love
He's obsessed with her exotic neck
i want to step into the world of Your imagination
this love is too intense  to be measurable
kiss me and taste my longing   read me and see my soul  love me and feel my hurt
my fingers trace the rings  around the nipple Your mouth might have left sore
how complacently  our darkness mingles
love me till after the candle blows out
pull me closer  and kiss my impatient mouth
teeth marks like pearls beneath her laces
all that love  went to my heart  and saved my soul
there's no worshipper like her
they saw her armour  He looked through the cracks in it
"thinking of the loveliness of You calling me ""my love"""
this lingering ache  is very calming
the kind of love that keeps you away from self harm
don't get her flowers  take her for a walk in the gardens
screams want rising
tears want floating
fears want hushing
tights want ripping
mouth wants gagging
hair wants fisting
inner thighs want biting
nipples want twisting
goosebumps want poking
a night to be loved and to love
take me where we  have the end of the horizon to ourselves
she loved because she wanted a friend
her lips taste like bruised plums
with her soft tongue  she licks His shoes
i am immorally and immortally Yours
my vulnerabilities  need the safety of Your passion
no pleasure too long
a kind of love  that deserves the brave
lying in bed lulled to quiet by thoughts of You pinning me down
force Yourself upon my audacities
drenched in pleasure  shivering with longing
feel my peace for it is all Yours just as i am
bar red lips  blowing raw sugar kisses
It's meant to hurt  He says
"""With you I might return from the abysses in which I have lived."" Antonin Artaud to Anaïs Nin"
"“I felt imperfect again moving away from you"" Elizabeth J. Colen"
put me to sleep the havocked way
they are precious moments  when my doing nothing  makes Him go hard on me
feed me happy
You hugged me and it felt like the first time i ever felt whole
You own our kisses
He roars like an animal and bites like one and i love it
i'm alive with provocations  and need Your love grip
unruly and intense  is what i gravitate towards
hold on tight  and enjoy the ride
even her lipstick is espresso
the sensuality of her mouth pierced with slutty cues will shock you
with downcast eyes  and in absolute stillness  she signals obedience
to be looked after  is such an experience
this melting sweetness  demands Your tongue
i kneel before Him feeling resolutely adored
Your voice in my ear  makes everything okay
Your eyes paint me with sensuality
i think about You  and feel saturated  with cravings
there just aren't many shooting stars i could wish upon
every single night  i lie in bed as warder of a body  decked with hellacious heat
He clutches my breasts  like they're blood oranges
i pity the bleak beauty of my body  when it's not clinging to Yours
ruin me anew
a slave to His touch  she's an art whirlwind  full of rare revelations
she's everything He is passionate about
come closer Beloved put a finishing touch to my day
i'd sleep peacefully  tucked beneath You
His smile  left tasteful traces  of happiness in my heart
she's worth making time to get to know
i feel safe from harm  this sucks and i miss You
hold me close while still pushing boundaries
words will never say what it does to me to miss You
it feels freeing  to hurt for You
Yours is the voice  my knees bow to
"""some say love it is a hunger"""
a different girl  in an indifferent world
wish You'd spank  firmly  and repeatedly
poor little needy slut shivering and hungry
"""Let me paint a picture for you then I’ll have to teach you to see it"""
His hungry kisses  sweep through me like wildfire
feelings that are hard to name  are the most exciting
holding His hand feels like finding treasure
the innate pleasure  of pain that lasts
there is everything feminine about the way she chooses to be wild
i want to feast  on the infinity of Your love  for as long as i can
elegance that confounds
so much laying bare  remains to be filled
a dark and desperate mind  drawn open like curtains
show me just half the mercy
exhausted  i cling  just before  i collapse
in Your possession i live my fantasies
she's a mess that's worthy  of caring for
how simply i become beautiful with use
how satisfyingly  my throat rests  in Your hand
woke up smiling about how much You love to explore a shipwreck
she's a magpie that longs to be devoured
In my head I have a map of places I want us to visit  my favourite one is a cottage in the woodland surrounded by towering mountains
allow my mouth  just one more  savoury stroke
You could say this daring is a new hobby
how snugly Your hands fit  over my taut breasts
quiet down restless flesh
You helped me understand  just what my soul needed
i met You and earned my wings into heaven
it's painfully hard  to wait
hearts have eyes
just to be on Your mind  is a blessing
the more insight i get  the more mysterious You become
give me back my bruises
what I'd give for wet kisses in a hot bath
go out and find her  the one you want for the rest of your life
she's not just a flimsy overnight treat
it's time  turn the heat on
she's the unknowing stimulus  of a deep growl
spoken in Your voice my name gets a meaning
i'm going to be the last one to leave the party
ruminating until  You are sublimely touchable
Your every growl leaves me  with one less demon to fight
faithful souls  will overcome  anything
what good are my nights if You don't make them shine?
no one's better  or more Sadist  than You
He's very fond of whispering
His raring kisses  like thunder on my lips
her mystery  is her essence
all the chaos inside me  is disheveled by Your intimate whispers
deep sighs of anticipation  expose her penchant  for the decadent
You adorn me like a veil of moonlight  causing rainbows of handprints across the wall
i want to wear Your marks to death
she's brittle  yet delights  in destruction
i'd write to You a lot more if it wasn't so difficult to choose words
how incessantly the relationship blossoms  becoming ever so dense with symbolism
this irresistible passion  for peeling just perfectly   and lose all sophistication
i want You permanently  just like this cigarette
my mind is constantly full of dark thoughts it's how i know You're in charge
a mere lick of Your cool tongue soothes the autumnal bonfire between my legs
i seduce myself  with memories of You
we're miles apart  yet i never lack Your touch
His lips leave  a ruddy hue  all over my skin
gagged till i smudged my mascara
He teaches remarkable lessons through deceptively simple tasks
tyrannous hands  wrapped in cashmere
if you see fear in her eyes  she must really love you
she looks at Him like she's telling a story
when she's not wandering  the street with her lover  she's stood at the balcony thinking about the times  and dripping ash
His promises of infinity  vindicate my fears
just a handful of encounters  sketching chapters in history
ours is a story without an end
my maddened cries  impel His  rhythmic yet relentless  ravishment
the toughness of His voice  leaves nothing misunderstood
dirty little slut  urged on by dark intentions
the sheer relief of knowing  that You're watching over me
the intolerable weight of obsessions
take me to bed but keep me from sleeping  until dawn
i bleed possession through lacerate petals    nurtured on the touch  of Your violative fingers
i love You for the ambitions You have for me
this assertive dose of gin   resonates with my need of You
He pinned me by the hair  and freed up my soul a bit
i could gag on that generosity
unholy  yet never  ungodly
tighten my collar
loosen Your tie
You give me reasons  to stay aroused
Every love story calls for special admiration
when she leans in  it's not because she's powerless
leap at me  like a streak of lightning  then settle  and satisfy an urge
slake my turmoils  with Your thumb in my mouth
His hands can't resist  withholding care
my lips miss frolicking around the edges of the grey suede that frames Your face before settling in a cozy nook where i plant a tender kiss
kiss my mouth and let Your breaths  dance like ember flames inside me
the only fear i don't have  is that of being forgotten
annihilation by enrapture
the mesmerising pleasure  is worth every fiery lash
there's more that unnerves her   than meets the eye
get me home to Your lap where the only sounds are the whimper from unceasing spanks
this habitual wilting  in the heat of craving  has become a ritual
how fiercely Your arms guard my insanities
when kisses are longer than miles that separate
if possibilities do not exist  let's create some
her seduction is all about restraint
there's more passion in me  if You're determined to find it
my body aches from the chill of aloofness
you know she's looking for trouble when she routinely forgets her manners
collar harnessed  leash swinging  and i'm suavely dressed  for crawling
He takes my hand and lays it in His lap and i can feel my heart  rattling my ribs
my rebellious demons deserve cruelties
i miss Your skin avidly scenting mine
kneeling at Your feet  is my special place in heaven
how i miss our mouths meeting Your teeth cleaving and tongue dabbing freshly cut blooms
thoughts of walking with You hand in hand on the sunny side of the street
I tried to find You  in so many others
how clemently You trigger  an adrenaline rush in me
these butterflies sure like to hang around
hand pour love into my mouth  from Your boozy fingers
from miles apart we savour  a climax of the senses  amidst the silence of the heavens
moments  dreams fantasies  life  they were all made for sharing
i won't be satisfied  until You have used all of my mind
every night  my fingers  are soaking snd sticky  from saying rosary
You're the one i always wanted to admire me
escapism is an innate talent
hurt me a little  explore who i am
"He mentioned the word ""Mine"" and i was taken"
pleading by pouting
be all here Beloved
do You remember me for my quiet abandon or the fits of laughter?
think of me  and You'll hear  gasps of longing
devour my every breath before i collapse  under the weight of separation
retell my story  tactile storyteller  and polish my nakedness
i suffer in the torment  of self restraint
“A man who has killed is a man who knows passion.”  -Devante Valéreo
passion is crucifixion enough
"when love tickles you so, you want to cry"
you can't see the fireworks unless it's dark
dark is exciting
the more You play  the sexier i'll sound
without the imposing growls  it's not the same arousal
i used to wait for You without thinking it was possible
"""This shaking keeps me steady. I learn by going where I have to go."""
cadenced murmurs of sinfulness  melt and waft  through her veiled innocence
she knows what she wants  it's her superpower
leaned so i could drown
fiercely  a bud is crushed and she blooms in His mouth
He's fallen under a spell i conjured
a riot of mouths  isn't just desirable  it's necessary
it feels like i am on the cusp of healing  as You move in me
the history of a new me begins with You
be hard  on me  and for me
stab with Your fingertips  these frantic goosebumps that pine for touch
how savagely Your kisses  bite on the sighs i heave
break my spell  but only with a blessing  of Your breath lining my mouth
there's an immodest  conferring of defeat  even in the way  You undress me
dinner is served  she says coyly  dipping finger in mouth and wiggles till her panties  melt down to her ankles
fearlessly  she sins
punish now  ask what i did wrong later
get Your hands on me
hands on my shoulders  that gently trail down  as if stroking my wings  before tucking them in  and my wrists are caged  in a steely blanket
i won't unclamp mouth  till You growl
spank me back to summer
a Victorinox tongue sliced me open and made me scream for more
my perverse fascination with  a freshly made bed   is as much to blame as the dark night
some nights i wish the longing would go easy on me
i'll die if i have to but i'll wait
when it comes to fantasy more is better
in a private little corner  of His heart my love has made  our own paradise  where secret longings   wrest unashamed
a craving for wholesomeness compels me to kneel
i'd grab our past with both hands
i line up the shots  and run a finger along the edges as i flash back to a perfect reward
I'm ready to plunge  knowing I'll find You in the dark
just keep me sheltered  and I'll be fine
You take everything  and i mean that positively
"to Him, she is unpolished gold"
i nuzzle the palms that often leave prints on my skin and love how they always bear kindness
there's no darkness like Yours
so much unreasonable happiness caught me off guard
my thighs wear the marks  of Your dark intentions
slide gently  thrust hard  cum deep
i hear warnings  beyond the whispers
Your words rest  on my mind  and keep my heart  at peace
being put in my place  is a homecoming like no other
watch my back  as i follow my heart
His intimate kisses  keep me on the brink of depravity
this jungle is beautiful
the rhythm of wanting You is honest than a heartbeat
it's not hard enough till the pleas are incomprehensible
He is simple not easy
most nights  i simply persist
i need You more than words
hungry to be fed  i drag all shame under my crawl
her thighs fall apart  at His slightest touch
in profound suffering  lies infinite relief
a fragile body  covered in marks and surrender
His quest for the forbidden  is undeniable
high on feelings  low on suffering
her splitting heartbeats  are what endurance sounds like
far too much remains untried
once she's pinned against the wall nothing remains inviolable
she's a delightful mess waiting to happen
i am driven  not by my fortitude  but by the desire to please You
Your love defines the horizon for me
the allure of the wild  impels her through a labyrinth  of inescapable tears
i renew myself  through our rituals
how effortlessly she wears  sassy stripes on the back of her thighs  yet her indecencies are understated
rub Your tongue over my goosebumps
the night smells of inception
there's incense in the wind tonight
"with grace, i let Him slip and wish time would freeze"
You and i  we own dreams
she's a good girl  with errant thoughts
nothing so bright as the future we walk into
i demand a realignment of stars
leaves a persistent craving wherever He kisses
It's marvellous what You  being on my mind  can do to my days  and nights
Body and mind: stolen
not all emotions have a name
You make me hope
no matter how admirable or arduous it might seem i give in
respectful in defeat
there's a thin line i find between loving and sinning
show me who i am
do and let do
some thoughts push feelings to the breaking point
It would be the perfect love story  if it weren't for the sense of right and wrong
"""Do you understand the sadness of geography?""  Michael Ondaatje, The English Patient"
look this way  and set a new mood
Your contour on my bedside  is unusually lifelike tonight
she's a wild cat  worthy of caring for
trembling i turn over
wrap Your arms tightly around me and feel the violent desires that beat in my heart
she spreads slowly  and makes the darkness shine the night when it falls across the sky
That feeling when He tells me how i *need* it
a chair is for kneeling on  the desk for lying
"""All the doors must have their way"""
an intent gaze of blue eyes  stands out secerned among a sea of suits
our night  Your way
Your words revive my desperation
i envisioned a life with You  and look where that got me
a little intrigue can go a long way
she didn't just conjure up so much passion  she was born with it
Your letters are my library now
it would be rebellion if i clung to You but it is our love that keeps me unselfish and openhearted
shadows as reality
i sunk standing up
all i need are Your arms  to fall back into
i want to look into Your eyes and forget everything else
do things i haven't imagined yet
if nothing else  this yearning atleast keeps me warm
will i ever see what You do in me?
and my mind won't sit still
rip this insane garb of innocence off me
my eyes are hungry for tears
i'm done walking in heels put me on my knees
come back so i may start the night
i'm all for struggle
i cherish all of the times i've fallen for You
give me love as big as that of gin
she's brave because she does things that scare her
"""And what will come of white nights, journeys never taken, this sorry waste of passion?"""
my lust never lets me settle
can You feel  strings of unspent passion  leaping out from my heart?
she's an arsenic of her own kind
evolved to perfection
I'm forever in lust  come at me again
they went hours  before she cried happily to sleep
do You feel the scorch in me?
all she wanted was a brush of His hand
sometimes she would strip just to feel Him close enough
I feel worthy  under torture
breasts pressed against thighs head over knees i rise back for You
a kiss on the forehead followed by a dominating thrust
there's a gentle rain coming down  in streams of blazing red  yet He seems charged with intent  like a roaring bonfire
You make me soar and scream like an eagle
i feel all the suffering in my heart grinding away beneath Him
worshipped till my knees turned soft pink
i am trying to sleep but my imagination is racing with what it will be like to lie next to You
i crave the cosiness of a spanking
open to daylight dear heart
love doesn't compromise subtleties
her smile is full of impetuous innocence that spurts scandals
my throat needs another slug
my soul cannot escape the gravity  of Your eyes on my face  and Your finger under my chin
open up to me His smile says
it's hard for my eyes to hold that gaze
I am thinking about You  and my pulse is like we're together
twist and seek the ultimate
Your beard donning my sweet smell is what tenderness is all about
You'll never know how far i can go unless You take me farther
my goosebumps  are Your wearable words
"Not a word passes between us, not because we have nothing to say, but because we don’t have to say anything Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner"
when You hold my hand i want to guide it to touch me where it hurts
hug till i die hug so i don't
touched smelled smiled
need to lay off this habit of eating words..
my love is wilder than a mythical animal
this sense of feeling You is as if i'm born anew
"it satisfies me to hear You say ""we"""
embrace the mess
traipsing the tide of time  i leap into the fulsome sky  and thrive on freedom
"""happiness, when it’s done right, is a kind of holiness"" - Mary Oliver"
i have compulsions
"""To be desired totally changes me.""-Anne Sexton"
hopes as real as the sky
us versus destiny
not the sinner she thinks she is
demand from me what i can't do
fuck until the crying stops
tease and torture  just please never deny
our sentient hearts  feel this love being blown away  by winds of eternity
when an obsession becomes a reality poetry happens
spank me for resisting impulses
feeling loved keeps me going
she's lucky He loves devils
all my days are starved for happy endings
i need the warmth from the light in Your eyes  the air from the perfume of Your skin  and a life with the nearness of You
i love how much i hurt everywhere  because You feel so close still
in the afterglow of salvage quiescent tears flow  from her kohl rimmed eyes
He speaks of torture   as an art form
stay on my skin
the fascination of masochism  appeals to the little girl inside me
a smile sealed with kisses
thinking about You from the waist down
so many words are unaware of their richness
i surrendered for the sake of love
forgive my heart  its insistent throbbing  as it prepares to be stolen
i want all Your moods
a persistent and unshatterable riot flares in my heart  i am reckless and tormented  by Your absence
Your savagery  delights me
love sobers you
destined for craving
"He wants to know how i am ""weary of waiting"", i say"
i am pinned to the wall but my scent strays
"""Tonight who will you call by my name?"""
obsessed with memories of You
"""Being alive is a trespass without you."" - Rumi"
i want a life full of moments i spend being watched over by You
"you see a thousand dangers yet you take a leap because, love"
drag me far beyond the familiar
the joyous ride  from mildly indulgent  to filthy and illicit
all pleasure  no guilt
heartbeats that tell a story
thoughts of revelling  in the intensity  of Your love
the hot and comforting  unfurling of desires
gonna love You till my jaw twitches with pain
Your whispers move over my body  like eager feathers  that scrape and rip my caution
brutal is beautiful
sensations impossible to anticipate
indefinable fondness
come and kill  this unhealthy habit i have of looking for new bruises  and not finding any
desperate for humiliation  i lie in His bed waiting
He rolls up sleeves  and my feistiness fades
she's delicate as spider's silk and formidable as rusted metal
with quivering fingers  i trace the arching forms  of ink-dark bite marks  like full moons on my flesh
eyes like a curving blue sky  that leap out at me  embracing with their power
hers are endurances to be impressed by
when you serve  you don't mess about
i enjoy the spanking not just because i like pain  but because of the lessons i learn that make me a better submissive
outrageously sophisticated  just like the white sheets until ravished with wildness  and made dirty
"""Be a lit candle to what blows you."""
i'd be faithless if i ever disobeyed You
my mouth is full of stifled moans  touch me and You'll see
it isn't until our sweat mingles that our souls become one
the agony of silent nights
it's so sexy how we race one another down our nakedness
and sometimes  You blur my mind to nothing
He fears for her on her own
You fill my mind  and make this world a place i can trust
You're too far from me and i think about You so hard my heartstrings cry tears that run down my inner thighs
i miss Your voice
every time's a charm
i take it as an exceptional ideology  Your every word
her smile is loaded with provocation
i need Your grip to keep my hand in control
this longing is hurting me almost
Had we never met  where would all these beautiful moments go?
A dominant hand  on a delicate throat  seeking out hot tears  and sensual whimpers
when i kiss the silver cirque of my collar  i always imagine Your lips ensuing it
He makes me feel very human  despite all my little imperfections
unfailingly needy  but hideously shy to say so
this love is really all about starvation
a dream so beautiful wish I could go back and do over that night again
put that cigarette out  and into my mouth already
the things You said impulsively in the heat of the moment  are what i remember the most
Your hard and throbbing flesh is a universe of intoxication  and i am obscenely thirsty
there's a fire in His blue eyes  and she knows just how to redden its embers
i still feel the warmth  of Your touch  like a winter sunshine  that lingers
moonlight picnics beside the fireplace
I'd fill Your bedroom  with a sweet smelling rhapsody
esoteric love
exhaust with attacks
"""Once I enjoy a person, that joy knows no bounds."" - Franz Kafka"
He smells like love
I light up just hearing You call my name
moonlight where You are sleeplessness where I am
strands of hearts  woven together  by the relentless grip  of Love
as long as i'm Yours i'm the prettiest of 'em all
craving to be  in the grip  of those hands
He's wishing  she's willing
the more power she loses  the more graceful she looks
of all my weaknesses my passion is the most dangerous
she dresses for seduction  and undresses for love
i undress silently  and place my destiny  in His care
under a fluffy white duvet  there is a tiger  lying on a kill
pleasingly long and weighty  conversations
is my smile bright enough  to show how deep I hold You  in my heart?
true love  is more tumultuous  than first love
echoes of her moans  hug the ceiling
may Your whispers  burden my breaths  everyday
my spine is still tingling  remembering things You said days ago
every scrape on my knee  is a reminder of where i belong
my words enjoy the intrepidity  to touch You
coffee isn't the only thing she likes dark
that's too much verve  for one Man to have
strikingly bowed  so He can see  the power of my love
my demure eyes meet Your gaze when i don't have the words to say what's on my mind
"""To be desired totally changes me."" - Anne Sexton"
wear me on Your lips
craving exhaustion
"devotee, not an addict"
You're my slice of the wild
You fill my heart with rare emotions
unconditional nurturing
You made us
i'm a whole lot dirtier than when we first met
He moves closer and i brace myself  for plunging into darkness
under the sway  of Your decadence  i find my grit in Your companionship  my grace
i terribly miss the scent and feel of Your face  and how Your conspicuous lips claim succinct kisses  gnawing away at my morality
His forbearance is a tremendous turn on
thoughts of kneeling  between Your legs and leaning into  Your bare chest  then talking  my heart out
"""Another kiss"" He said  humbling me"
i appeased Your hunger yet You made me convulse  with sensation wanting to taste some more
"""Let go!"" He says and i stretch my palm  disinclined to stop stroking and He pins my wrist"
skip the foreplay prolong the violence
i can forefeel my undoing
i almost crumble  in that fleeting pause  before we kiss   and then cling to You like a wave crashes  on to the shore
nights spent without You are such a waste of my spirit
it's not how i look it's the way You see me
she crawls to beg for more  in stilettos
You have the power to make me smile
without pain  the pleasure wouldn't endure
this lust  for fulfilment..
longing for You i add gin  to my evening
Life is wonderful Now I'm in safe hands
it's as if You infused  an inexhaustible appetite  in every fragment of the love You showered on me i seem to always want more of it
i want to breathe the air You've slept in
keeping silent not calm
my cheeks sting and sizzle shovelling fire from Your palm
lean hard onto me and bring rain to my lips
"passionate, intense and brutal love  is not for the squeamish"
the exasperation  is worth it
His eyes make intangible but true promises
the insatiable desire to write vs the profound beauty of indescribable feelings
my restlessness will suffocate me
love is all it takes
He's unfailingly placid whatever the provocation
sometimes  the fervid desire  to waste away just won't let go
i can't wait until Your eyes are back on me
the bruises have faded  but i still feel You
He's always the first to kiss  she always wants it to be that way
His smile never leaves her
a mere reflection of the Sun  secures and nursles a dewdrop  until it succumbs such is our love  utterly undeniable
what does Your journal say about me?
"He leaves me smelling as if i've been swept across a surly fireplace, singed until lush and bursting with flair"
she makes a fierce effort to evoke a storm and dresses for Him  in all black everything
my dreams are what my days with You reflect
"""I want a howling hurt."""
this persistent impulsion to be overcome wholly  will not be exhausted
Your words resound  over the cacophony of my soul
an arousal  so phenomenal i'd try anything for You
what i most crave  is all the dirty talk
she's happiest when nostalgic
His eyes paint me  in sumptuous lustre
an embrace like the sea's surf breaks me into waves of pleasure and i'm flooded with wantonness
powerful  not prejudiced  vulnerable not weak
i tiptoed as far afield as heaven  following hallucinatory flashes of You
the starkness of our intimate conversations
the sweet scent  of release
erotica that haunts
peel back the honey  until i zing on Your tongue
my mind is a confusion  Your hands have seen to that
there are echoes of Your name in my every sigh
lying in bed together  swapping fantasies
a kind of love that keeps the night alive
licking You everywhere  getting high on Your lemon spiked skin
a different than usual kind of love
rub Your lips on mine till i spew flames
the moment You crossed my mind  i started losing control of myself
I don't know how I should be feeling
Your touch it maddens
wish You'd tease no more  and dip the tongue  deeper
"""I put on music but don't always listen."""
what once was shell  is now a woman  incandescently beautiful  and free from inhibition
whisper the rules  louder
faultlessly deserving
assertively wet
cinch me in Your embrace  lest this night drag too long
overused nipples like faded cranberries
coming to my senses  over Your knee
it'll hurt less  if i struggle less
the glory of being finished
imagining beyond horizons
blossoming of night
how do i stop my mind from entangling ingenuous absurdities with intellect?
love me an ocean of constancy
any man can love  but not like You
Your breath penetrates my skin  with the mischief of an autumn zephyr
"depths of buried feelings vs hearts brimmed with love, suspended above the clouds"
hearts like gardens without boundary
Your heart can intuit all the lonely spaces in mine
give her the freedom to sin  and You will see heroism like never before
have a restful sleep tonight Beloved and pardon my sighs if they invoke lightning
simply beautiful  there's no other way to describe us
i'm out of breath trying to catch up with You
the smell of Your skin  inspires lust in me
i'm thinking unrepentantly dirty about You
pull me in Your arms  i'm ready for a meltdown
You complete me  in more than one sense
You saw me through an eclipse
He bites into my cocoa butter breasts like they're studded with hazelnuts
her sluttiness in the sheets  resonates on the streets
this compelling need for more warmth
You're forever creating a longing
her tongue feels like sumptuous silk looped round a metallic wand beaded with stardust
His tongue feels like crushed velvet
finely laced up  and fetchingly pearl strewn
the tactile softness of Your mouth on me takes me high above the dark clouds
You poured passion  into the farthest corners  but this thirst is unquenchable
i feast my eyes  on Your swarthy words  full of innocuous fire
You rephrased my prosaic life  in the language of poetry
it would thunder aloud and You would think it was the flutter of her lashes that startled the sky
wish i could just implode in Your lap
her imploring screams    tore down  the canopy of elegance
the quietness of walls
the sensual spectacle  that is You  on my mind
my madness will destroy my melancholy
the sorcery of reality
because i burn for You
claws pelting petals
in her very demure eyes  speckles of darkness  shine through
my virtues  and vices  You've seen all
no creases in my linen  this night lays bare  like a desert where footprints made a retreat
You gave me  words and that's my  eternity
they didn't flee wander  or beckon yet our hearts  rendezvoused
name this feeling
sublime meditation
thoughts that echo
"love, passion, pain, faith   You gave me all"
words of love  spoken in an immortal voice
tears that doused her smouldering lonely nights   tears that inflamed their sultry intimate nights
unwavering glimpses
Your love left me inebriated  why then are my nights sleepless?
thinking about the moon that's shining where You are
a brush with raspy whispers  gently reduced me to ashes
hold me  like i'm dwindling  kiss me like You're starving
the tyranny of memories
taste my suffering  and tell me You're charmed
chisel into the bite mark  then kiss my mouth as i gasp
the whiff that tempts You is my hormones
the raw romance  of delicate petals being  macerated by hand
You left indelible traces and i feel You everywhere
she rebels cautiously but in vain
He inhales  and growls  then fucks me  senseless
You say i am bounteous as the ocean  why then does separation sear my skin?
starvation caused by excess
loosen the belt  never the rules
a loving memory   unfastened a string of tears  and shadows of despair got buried  by an avalanche
everything i want make it forbidden
smiles that never wilt
i surfeit myself  on a deep drag of You
You're just too far away and I'm afraid of my own shadow
a kiss so rapacious  He forgot to bite my lip
she finds herself  basking in the afterglow  of intense pleasure  and at the crest  of longing such a dichotomy
the echo of Your perversive whispers  lingers and haunts
To us i raise a toast  of forevermore
His love cruised her through a carrefour
You're just too far and my mind's out of its temper
You fondled me  and traced Your hands  onto my heart
there is a soirée of feral urges  in my heart tonight
these arms  around Your neck  they are a garland of  my sincere gratitude  for Your passionate love
to bear remembrances of You is why my heart beats
eyes rifted by  unfulfilled desires  she writes Him effusive love notes
deep as dark  red
i think about You every time i colour my nails red
in loving You and by becoming Yours  i have glorified drunkenness
my fatuous heart trusts Your eternal love  yet is easily shaken  by fear of losing You
gentle insistence
spare me mercy Beloved not Your tyranny
i taste honeyed tobacco  when You lick my lips
recognisable love in a fleeting smile
kneeling before You upraises my senses but never my eyes
in Your arms  i have died a million times it's a benign meltdown i always used to imagine
if it's just me  who is worthy of my love  what use is that?
savage hands  on sinuous curves
dreams of You shine through my eyes
they chime perfectly  she knows how to start fires  He knows how to strike them down
the night fades away  but the longing is here to stay
take the plunge for the treasures  of the ocean  may never curl up  alongshore
i have wanted You long enough  to be a part  of You
thirsting for an indecently lush  moment of privacy
His growl causes  a cinch in my waist  before i'm pulled  into the deep haven  of His arms
make me a part  of all Your adventures
You left me morsels of love between folds of linen
i'm half ripe  because my bed is cold on one side
captured in Your words  i become powerful
i could make Your tongue   seem warmer
i feel You filling me
the heady warmth  of the memory of Your voice   makes my nights bearable
enveloping kisses  like an overcast morning  leaving me wet and wanting
warm little red hearts amid conversation  evoking dewy petals
hold my hand tight as You can
"""the wolf of want is howling"""
the night is colder than the moon can tell
into palms soft as sunset  i heave  a medley of cries and surrender  to Your incessant tempest
too many feelings  not enough words
He spanks away  as if in meditation
the fork between possibility and reality
stir my lust  until it's molten  inside Your tongue
so do not doubt that i will do all it takes
a parched bloom thrives through the frosty night  longing to shine for the rising sun
nothing is more pleasurable than the way Your stinging kisses  simmer down my feverish breaths
love is ordered chaos
open my mind beyond the darkness
Your love in my life is like the flower that lights up the vase its placed into
let's drink tonight to fantasies dreamed anew
to sleep in Your arms every night as the lush scent of our love fills the bedroom
i'll capture Your night with my moans
her mouth is loaded with words that taste of sin
He knows just how not to show mercy
the spectacle of scars  being adored and kissed
turn the key  lead me inside
we kiss like a language
"who knows more of humility  than i, Your submissive?"
"""hold it grail-like"""
intemperate passions smoulder under the depth of silk she drapes
this ever faithful longing  remains eager to outlast the night
the creamy allure  of soft dark whispers
deeply hued desires tangled permanently
the splashes  and streaks  on my body  is Your artistry  revealed
You haven't even pulled me in bed yet and my body has caught the fragility fever
i read Your words  and find a deeper meaning of love
in Your absence  it's my fantasies that dominate
a detour is part of making the woods happy
a heart turned purple from being overlooked
a heart like a jewel box she rarely opens
the art of decorating heartache
her greatest treasure  is a haul of memories  cleaved to her heart  forever
little black yes
You're the drug that had me wild and hysterical
half angel half whore all Yours
blue bruises and red teeth marks   gussied up in a lacy black dress
i love the beauty i feel  when You crush me
love that makes dying easy
run Your hands all over me and feel the lightness within
moans as dessert talk
He writes poetry that goes beyond words
cold sunny mornings make me want to write
Your kisses float over my body like happiness
i break for the One who wants me all
whoever else i am i am Yours first
it's as if my fingers are just like Your own
fully sedated  and ready for ravaging
unsafe and happiest  beneath You
to stay together  for survival
insanity i trust
"""assaulted by poetry"""
head over my knees  breasts pressed against my thighs  i hope that is how You're thinking about me
it's going to be a long night  before we meet again
only for You i'd go far  out of my mind
Your love  is my weapon
tell me a secret  make it dark
give me all i want then tell me there is more
knees on the ground  eyes on the stars
there's just something  about His mouth on her chest
raising demons  from the shadows   #bookspinepoetry
give what spills over
tepid mercy
He is the man i had always wanted  and He knows it
feeling bereft of Your heartbeat against my cheek
"“The stunning curve of language, the curious way it seems to turn out that “love” means “need””"
conversations made up of beginnings
colour my dimming smile   with Your lips
she's a salty mess of nectar   sitting pretty at His feet  invading the night
You're wearing blue  and deftly rolling Your sleeves up which is already more than i could ever wish for
"her mouth says ""No""  but her body says ""Don't stop"""
she is loved sufficiently  to express herself openly
my grateful heart  swirls with love as my mouth worships You
i journey  from struggle to eventual freedom  and taste serenity
fired by lust subdued by love
needful things make up this body and they are perishing cold without You
He possessed her  before she felt the danger  that lies in losing control
some moments we spend together  are a lot like gentle narcosis
rest Your might  at the back of my throat
"""From tiny experiences we build cathedrals.” Orhan Pamuk"
smoky eyes casting a spell eager mouth  quickening a swell
His contentment commands  my gruelling endurance
tussle in paradise
violated  beyond limits  loved beyond doubt
that extraordinary moment  when desire triumphs over reason
let's while away hours until sunrise
exhausted  i go back to reading  Your words
say You love me  in every language
put something in the diary to look forward to
make love that hurts
"""the flogging the fucking the holding"""
Your aura makes me flower
once she's bent over  He's spoilt for choice
shuddering  i think about  Your discretions
deaf to the sound of erratic shivers never having felt a butterfly rest in hand they talk of tenderness and romance
i inhale Your scent urgently then lick You off  my sunburnt lips
take me into Your arms or this sandbag of longing will bury me alive
i am revived by Your passion  like an unlimited forest  pinched by dappled sunlight
carve us a life
bite before the bruising eases
the way Your eyes meet mine  i feel a torrent of caresses wash over me
before You cast eyes on me i'd never felt so sensual
feed my heart  Your love
her lashes are drenched  but she doesn't crumble  or let tears move withholding comes to her naturally
come and tear away the silence
the weight  of wait
i am parched  and frantic  for the taste  of You
"words like a wood fire  warm, comforting and profound"
i could part with life  not words
just us amid mountains and the clouds watching us
it has to hurt if it's to heal
always elsewhere
"first, take a fistful of hair"
sometimes the ocean doesn't want you thinking about the troubles that lie beneath
she melts into His arms like a curl of beach  between sheltering rocks
ravenous hands  scraping dignity  off a fallen Angel
finding discreet resonances  of wild desires  in Your words  soft as velvet
"""...that when you found me at last, your age-long desire  found utter peace in my gentle speech and my eyes and lips and flowing hair?"""
"""Is it true, that your love  travelled alone through ages and worlds in search of me?"""
tenderness is sabotage
i know what's good for me You know what's best
there may not be such a thing as a perfect life but there is such a thing as a  perfect moment
"""You're beautiful"" sounds meaningful when You say it"
i discovered You  in myself
unquestionably overexposed  to Your hungry fingers
unsettling sensuality
He sees what no one else does  He overlooks what everyone chooses to see
there are paper cuts in my heart and it won't stop bleeding until i finish writing everything that i want to say
"beauty isn’t seen, it is discovered"
it's as if Your hands were made  to rip off my caution
she awakened in Him the desire to love
He awakened in her  the desire to be loved
no rules for soulmates
i belong  in every corner  of Your bedroom
all You you need to do to make me moan  is to tap lightly and invite me to bed
i want to build a fence around You and have You all to myself
You're a dream that's real
lashes louder than my moans thrusts   quicker than my breaths
You have my devotion for it was You who awoke it in me
all the freedom  that follows all that obedience
the way Your tongue licks my troubles away smoothening out the rough edges  of my life
desire hurts... and how
easy to love  hard to please
You and I  and a tight corner
although they're blind hearts never lead you astray
"i want Your ""I'm so proud of you"" hug"
dewy panties warmed by  a sweetly inviting scent  is how my body responds  to Your affection
i'm at my most vulnerable when I'm on Your mind
so glad love found us
the unaddicted shouldn't blame the addicted
kiss my smile  with the mouth it has made so hungry
i'll be everything You like including myself
they can tell about You  from the way I look at myself  in the mirror
through ruin i become blissful
time freezes when You're away
she dresses for seduction  and undresses for love
my nights taste of nothing without You
turn into a wolf and claim what's Yours
my love lies  in my resolve to suffer
You're harsh but brilliant
velvety smooth breasts  lavished with a veil  of Your palm prints
to find the love that brings you home
remarkably mutable and sitting pretty like a rain soaked violet
turn this goddamn mind off
the kind of chest you'd want to call home
He has an absolute obsession  of watching her bright smile  play with long ribbons  of dark whispers
get overly close  and a notch deeper
an unannounced storm  in a crisp white shirt
the joy of poetry lies in its softness
anticipating better nights to come
i will always be willing to go the distance  on my knees
an ocean of sensitivities  steeped in overdose
madly acquiescent
unusually impassioned
she's the flower that weaves calmness into His skin when crushed
hazel skin embellished with  a rope bracelet
ruin at will
breathless and freshly wrecked she drifts into a dream
my marks are the art i inspired in You
let my honeyed mouth carry Your musky tempest long into the night
all of my sass vanishes  in a clutch of His hand
supper under the stars and midnight wishes
bitten lips like overblown roses
she's safe until they're safely inside
she buzzes around His feet  full of unabashed lust
energetic chaos
i am docile and reliable until You unzip
what is love if not the infinite promise  of devotion?
thoughts of me on the tip of His brain
all that's left is patience
she's noone's weakness  there's nothing weak about her
touch me so i can calm down
overwhelm me by Your enduring presence
bite and torture  fondle and nurture
i hold back a carnal riot  as we walk in an agreeable silence
sometimes i murmur an urge  sometimes You gently assent
draped in darkness  i do my best to refrain from  sinfulness
in Your arms i have found  everything  and i no longer wish  to chance it
"i pine and fade  and reduce to beggary yet there is  the insistence  on ""not yet"""
hurting singly  because i love You
He plucked a smile from a dying bloom
let my thighs be Your leg warmers
edgy black dress  vibrant red lips  chin up gin up
fuck me till Your fingers bleed
her heart it flickered till it singed
i've known pleasure  that starts as a whimper  rises to abysmal moans  and erupts into tears
hazy head  flaming heart  let the games begin
sending You sensuous nuzzles   through the wind
the deeper i think the more i have to say the fewer words i find
soft shivery butterflies  cinched at my waist with  Your black leather belt
so bring me to ruin Beloved i want You to see what happens to slain heroes
fiery and forever on the brink
"""You're going to beg for it."""
there's no repressing a heart that's afraid
all around me  i see blankness  a dark pit and inside me an inadequacy  a stark need  wish You'd just fill me up or finish me off
hold me close  hold everything
He's so old school that we just relate innately
her mind's obsessed with being controlled
put limitations on the way that i think about things
His voice is like sex  on hardwood
hurry before i starve and die
touch me where You think god lives
His smile  tells me anything's possible
i suffered  and found what lies  beyond suffering
smoking is bad  feelings are worse
our love is real all else is clouds
the soul remembers the beauty it used to know
Your words tug at my heart echoing such a symphony
one's too many  and a million's not enough
all pain is desire
what's the distinction between faith and love?
love that challenges disbeliefs
what right do i have to be so far from You?
words from You confer on me more than a touch  of magic
ours is not the easiest journey  but it's the right one
a sweeping glance  and i was taken
dreams dirtier than dirt
who said thoughts were supposed to be easy to say?
i do not wish to be alive if love dies
i could say that i'm capable of looking after myself  but that wouldn't be true
i pray to god You save me always
how can i show how far i'd go for You until i'm really asked?
He smiles  when i insist  and when i implore  He smiles
we stand united  by the desire for paradise
only black ink dominates
when a decadent encounter turns into an adventurous night
feelings hovering in the stillness
words lost and found
i know i'm not perfect  but i never wonder  if i'm perfect for You
the time for words is over
do that thing where i can't look at the ceiling all night
deliciously devious  deceptively wise
You inspire me to maraud myself  for pleasure
nipples like cherries steeped in red wine
she's a demon at provocation
romancing possibilities is a state i will never tire of
L̶i̶m̶i̶t̶s̶
my body lives in sin without You
He foretells the sexiest absurdities about me
His virility  plays havoc with my clothes
it might be shameless   but it would be very fulfilling
there's nothing wrong with me that several punitive spanks won't cure
she can merely seduce not swing
her eyes have that special way to ask
she begs like her life depends on it
an obsession pervades  to feel pleasurepain
molten flesh  bruised in poetry
He tells me everything that's permissible  in a voice so sexy it all sounds felonious
in a modest way being loved and owned  has been life changing
His words glorify her simplicity
In displeasure of Your absence..
Sunday
You are  the kindhearted saviour  of a feline soul
the moonshine on my empty bed is like a layer of ice  upon a deep ocean of wanton darkness
i'd vie with Aphrodite for You
let's go offend some landscapes
one curse  decency one cure  darkness
when it's time for me to go stay with me
so how do You plan to soften me today?
beneath Your body is a kingdom which is not of this world
i was never a fate fan until finding You got me thinking about it
Your mouth and all its kisses and bites belongs on my skin
Your whispers will hypnotise me to death
i forget to blink  as His piercing stare  counts my endless nods
i want to be a part of Your memoirs
You deepen the intimacy  and reduce me to tears
Your rapture  becomes my voice
"suffering is a choice  smudges, smears, pain, torment and tears aren't"
unpredictability courses through His veins
more island than ocean kind of calm
some days she's the fragile girl tiptoeing on sunbaked sand other days she's the bullfighter
every facet of our love  is laden with symbolism
souls deeply enmeshed  in subtly different ways
i lay long and dewy beneath Him  and He loved me unreservedly
release not escape
tearing her way through a chasm she soars fearlessly
such fleeting   almost illusory moments they flow away like molten pearls
painstakingly dreamy  and compulsively absorbed  in thoughts of You
so what exactly defines nirvana  other than bingeing on raw carnal potion?
a tempest touched me to my core and left me aching and intoxicated
kneeling at His feet  she looks scintillant  as the night  awash with shimmer  from the sky
lips savagely bitten for being so kissable
this isn't about having a mere craving
being in love is the most sensational merry-go-round feeling ever
obnoxious lust
unbridled brutality
tonight's a knockout cocktail  of painful longing  and immoral self-indulgence
violence anticipated
how i feel about You  could never be put in a few characters
this urgent need  to satisfy You
kiss my eyes   share my dreams
"""rare, erratic impulses"""
there are better reasons to love her than her love for dirty things
our smiles kiss  while a piano tinkles in the background
my silk scarf  brushing against Your tweed jacket
we're always together  when i'm asleep
once ridden
feelings that languish alongside words unspoken
their hands entwine holding the promise of forever
permission to pulverize?
i've known happy love that's perhaps my only sin
lying awake at night  dreaming You're asleep beside me
in Your absence  i teach myself  to hit the spot
i used to find it unfamiliar  but now  i'm smiling more than ever
the scent of You sways with the air i breathe
i ride on my knees  shamelessly  and feel at home
why define and delimit love?
acquiescing to You is the only way i feel free
damn this longing  it knows no seasons
wide awake  wide open
let's do things
i sense adventures in the wind tonight
Your definition of dirty  is delectable
knees aching thighs shaking grab those ankles already
i draw You inside with my whole core
growl some orders
i am somewhat in awe of Your strength
mouth like a dirt ring
He takes me in His arms and the world's clamour fades
push compassion into my mouth
think about me bum on heels
i seek no escape  from Your strict gaping not even a momentary one
beautiful  because  she is flawed
she owns the beauty that comes with age
she's a black-clad assassin
stretch my horizons
a starry night is what this sultry day has been building up to
my stomach did a few flips as i walked towards You
why don't i own this sleeplessness?
"📷 framboisedorleac: Françoise Dorléac photographed by Raymond Cauchetier on the set of La Peau Douce,..."
"“For man sometimes loves suffering terribly much, to the point of passion, and that is a fact.” - Fyodor..."
exhaustive whimpers
leather-bound wrists clipped to the pedestal
dirty deeds  bathed in moonlight
i love the complexity  of Your perversions
fascinating imperfections
meld both our worlds  i know You can
infinite dark fantasies hover at the edge of my consciousness
weaving-loom: something about her edginess just says “let’s slather the night with sin”
📷 pdbates: - PD Bates
📷
pdbates: i break you with the delicate touch of love PD Bates
she's the exception  that proves Your rule
You're the beating heart of my libido
sometimes she'll suffer more  as a way of just saying thank you
never before have i been  more prepared  to let my guard down
pin me against Your bookshelf
delicate curves and tiered lace
no woman is ordinary
ballerinas are no ordinary women
bonding over wounds and bruises
kisses that make me feel i'm riding on waves
the thought of pleasure  makes me ache
it's hard to imagine any part of my life when You weren't with me
my soul feels knotty
you can make magic out of anything if you work hard enough at it
what’s not to love about sacrilege?
i like to envision Your eyes lingering delicately at photos of me
can You hear spring buds bursting too?
i wish memories were savorous
musings powerful enough to rivet me to the bed
"slick and sneaky mornings that start with ""Describe your panties"""
if only  my destiny followed the path You take
sanity is exhausting
in the game of love winner loses all
i can feel Your eyes on me
"in so many words, yes"
we're so meaningful together like breathing in and out
orgasm not screams
everything You touch  unfolds instinctively
freshly bathed  and sashaying around naked  like an on-heat cat
after-dark cuddles  on a lonely park bench
my mind's so wide open  You could imbed all of Your imagination into it
"""Is it proper to  Give one single name  To the little human being  Who knows so many types of fun?"""
"""What a fight she picks up With her torrent of words"""
"""The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails"""
"""shy buds of enchantment"""
write me a poem  for each night i survive without You
i am now twice the woman and it is Your magic
Your patience will be my undoing
i give You a heart that's ruled out wearing a veil
never knew i was such a romantic at heart
keep it surreal
want is need  before i know it
tuck me into woods thick with oaks
the story is everything
He said i was welcome to His crotch   He told me later in bed He'd said scotch
Your pleasure  eases my pain
is that how i am to while away eternity... stargazing?
i don't know which way the wind will blow for me but i know that i'm along for the ride
He is poetic romantic artistic and  everything unique
stepping over the threshold  one less fear at a time
my humility for You is how i measure myself
is there gin in paradise?
little girl  if you are so innocent   why do you smolder in the dark hmm?
wonder how much i've yet to grow
"""I’m a wretch, but I love."""
"""The nights are clear, but suffused with sloth and sullen expectation."""
"""So drunk on light that his heart shows through."""
"""Let it be known: I did not fall from grace. I leapt to freedom."""
she makes lingerie taste good
He exposes me to danger  and i accept it gratefully
lust is love  without the subtlety
solid hands little neck
the ones that You stole were breaths well spent
everything i've got within myself belongs to You
i'm not quite alive  until You touch
reward me  with Your time
i am incapable of doing things without You telling me
extreme eagerness everywhere
i deserved to be saved  then broken right
wearing Your shirt and nothing under it
most my thoughts are of that one day
latch onto my love  and sink Your teeth into it
i'd jump at any chance to kneel before You
thinking about You is like drinking a bottle of aged rum
oh what i'd give to sleep to the rhythm  of Your heartbeat
i miss those kisses  the ones that are stolen they force my senses to crash
simple smile vivid confidence
dressed in black she's full of colourful sensuality
kisses as unsparing rain no words spoken nothing contrived
i become beautiful  when You write about me
meltingly supple and warm thighs like they're holding on to summer
lay me to rest in Your bed as a freshly cut garden rose
orgasm like a piece of music crooning from my soul
neckline on waiting
forgive my nocturnal weaknesses
i've been very rough on what's Yours
i'd love being a part of Your nights
You incite my dirty
guilt-trip me into heaven
let's get in bed and share ideas about loving
she's the dirty secret  in His moleskine
turn me bluish purple
knot so bad
her vulnerability and noxiousness  are impossible to tell apart
i want to get blind drunk on Your stiffness
without You darkness exhausts me
words as the unifying thread
there is comfort in watching the stars twinkle  like another heartbeat in the night
His voice surmounts her beautiful and difficult mind
scoop me up  and hold me close in Your arms
we knew each other  even when we were new together
there is worship in her sin
traipsing through empty sheets  getting thoroughly wet
fierce is fun
passionate about pain
You are my once in a lifetime
we make the best magic
oh this intense tickle in my lips  how will i last until we kiss?
i found love  and love found me
submission fears nothing
"those who survive, heal"
calamities of lust
she's a whole lot more worthy than pretty
my soft heart struggles  to cushion the impact of separation
day in day out every night You hold me silently and invisbly
His bright smile put my burdens in the shade
You make dirty thoughts  slip into my unadorned mind
once upon a sultry night  a riot rocked my world
His love prevails  from night time combat  to hearing the first birds sing
i want love that runs deep like a fistfight
ours is a life daydreams are made of
His words speak the language of God
paint me a new fantasy
"""Tell me how to endure ardour."""
this talent for smiling through the disquieting ache of Your absence
bitten thoroughly  not shy
deferential courtesy
vulnerose heart
viniferous kisses
"""We are close. An inhuman closeness."""
my words are incapable  of expressing such ethereal longing
hush me hurt me  hold me
life is filled with goodbye kisses  and it hurts every time
one day i'll join You for breakfast
my fear is less of pain  and more of refrain
these aches hold no power to stop me wanting to suffer more
at Your mercy with pleasure
i'd feel it when You're thinking about me
longing for You i smile absently  and forget to rue
when love is not a mere dream
in silence  i plead to hurt more
i love You  to excess
the sweet torment  of our colliding worlds
i serve You and seek more words of love
without sinning i repent
i still quiver but i no longer fear
my worship of You will never have an ending
i need to suffer  to survive
have a little faith  in my fortitude
the smaller she feels  the more she grows
i didn't slack He spanked because He wanted to
bruises all over her chest  peppered like spice
the scent of her wild  goes beyond that of honeysuckle
love her silences
girly giggles  that tune her right into  His heartbeat
forbid me  it's intoxicating
the butterflies seek perpetuity
You are always  in all my fervent prayers
He feels what she doesn't say
i'm addicted to Your warmth
He smothers my neck in kisses as i inhale the hypnotic and heady scent of dark orchids
i yelp and wiggle  but His rope-work stays put
Your love is a therapy
it's flattering to know that You think i'm dirty
not afraid to ask
she's a hoarder of moments in which they touch  notice how her hand is always free to hold
He growls His way through my blood
Your dominion is talismanic to our love
dirtied to her very essence  she twerks blissfully in the shower
do my words speak enough of our love?
You make every shade of blue sexy
"“Breathing in, I calm my body Breathing out, I smile Dwelling in the present moment,   ... a wonderful moment"""
"""I sit up in the dark drenched in longing. I am carrying over a thousand names for blue that I didn’t have at dusk."""
where would You like me to hurt tonight?
i'm lucky my lips don't bleed from all the kisses i miss
moisten   heighten  crush
her fantasies are not a pastime they are a place of refuge
thirsty little self-watering cunt
He times the flick of tongue  to perfection
her tongue tastes of malted barley
i heed Your every word  without blinking
a problem kitten  with searing vermillion lips
bruises  freckles blood You  live under my skin
her subservience compliments who He is
give my flesh texture  not just colour
you need lust to take the fear out of loving
promise me intensity
love her right and you're in control
a mind like a minefield of contradictions
lost myself in thoughts of You  on a heady summer night
pain so sweet  it sent me into a frenzy
thankfully  time's passing away
she's a scar fest
love me till I'm beginning to break away
His feet is where I'm at tonight
only Your kisses can rob me of words
born again by the magic of love
Your kiss was hypnotic
she seized Him with her softness
give me back  fire for fire
stronger the tree  sweeter its fruit
His whiff  comes up my guard  goes down
hands coupled  they follow the moon
in You i found all my fantasies
my dreams start and finish on murmurous moans of Your name
i look for glimpses of myself in Your words
no amount of rose blossoms will ever understand my passion
it's not for me to decide where my mouth belongs on Him
Your absence is doing me no good
i'd love Your town at night
the butterflies are seeking dynamite thrills
i need torment  and i need it in larger doses
just drown me
inclined  to collapse
happiness is  the way He finger combs my hair until i drift off to sleep
Your bedsheet is clean my mouth isn't
let me explain myself  against the nearest wall
let Your big hands do me a small favour
sighing rn
breathing around You is a let go
exposed  then caged
glowing coal eyes  shine like diamonds when she smiles
You always knew what i could become
she doesn't feel fulfilled  unless in pain
she named it love before it was born
make me powerless  i love it
can't help but love the One who makes decisions for me
nurturing through discipline
shush me already
threaten me with temptations
i write You letters and say things that i would to my diary
You are the unthinkable that happened to me
always on my best behaviour  until it gets dark
they ask me if it's the blush of love   and i smile and blush again
breathtaking caresses   literally
come scent my night
sweet whispers in bed  the only ornamentation i need tonight
she's a thirsty flower  that loves a spring rainstorm
there's nothing like the sweet smell  of soaked panties
how i enjoy dirt
i barely survive when i'm not in the wild
killing time with patience
she's powerful in her humility
there is devotion in my suffering
i'd meet You at the sharp end of the edge
me  - a cause He cares about
He always gets it done
rich in melody poor in words
it's a turn on because it's real
if You'd only be able to get me dirty everyday
i don't even know when You got me so wet
"""We are love"""
all it takes  is a fingertip
shiver of pleasure
on my knees i burst into bloom
misuse over disuse
i need raw and limitless exposure  to Your warmth
i get hurt  He gets hard
You're the reason i'm satisfied with life
He's a peaceful slayer
torture as a way to tranquility
"little by little, the moon devours her sighs"
don't just tuck  strap me into bed
the exhilaration of being caught  in a storm of long low whispers
laved with Your love  i'm a throbbing mess of exuberance
she's most alive  when bitten
using memories  as drugs
magnetic healing
chokes over knives
in You i seek relapse  and reversal
down with need up for love
why be so distant?
Your love so rare it's a gift beyond compare
deep into the night  a dark desire spreads  through my heart
such a soft heart  yet how fiercely it beats for her
it is hard to think of another wish than You
she likes to write but she's not a poet
what she's good at  isn't measurable
You are a part of my heart
living is not everything  loving is
i can't take a whole night on my own
sultry breaths  slice rhythmically  through the silence speaking volumes
the power of magical realism
taste me liberally
heat spikes  down my spine  as Your eyes cruise my curves
my sighs  in Your palms
I gravitate towards His simplicity
the more I fear  the more I dare
the kind of orgasm that vents morals
let's make love for night's sake
You've got what it takes to save me
she's the spark to His fire
i lie in bed  slain by  unrestrained desire
He holds my hand  then tweaks His fingers  into a knot
to hear my beauty  in Your words
i'm wine-starved for Your romance tongue
red over heels
masquerading as beauty
heroic flaws
crushed by hand
i would rearrange His bookshelf if He asked me to
where's the fun in my lipstick remaining flawless?
even my thighs tingle
her wish list is simple  yet thoroughly bold
i am hardly disciplined
breathless beneath You what a beautiful place to die
pull me closer and mirror everything that's going on inside Your head
penned my love on the collar of Your crisp white shirt in an acid shade of pink
so many sins  remain undressed
"""there never will appear a chivalry that doesn't spring from love."""
longing is an impure art
if only loneliness could cut holes in time
my mind owes its free flight to You
I stir You You consume me  gently
teeth marks round the bend
come closer and exhale some Dominance
He writes to make me dream
He blows kisses  on candied petals  and they clap in delight
how poignantly she crumbles
she has a natural affinity with Him
she's tartness in darkness
i'm missing You even when i'm smiling about You in the shower
You make my eyes shimmer
the cashmere wrap  of her soft warm mouth  toughens Him
the voluptuous taste  of quiet passions
nothing more zen than You fucking me senseless
overpowered by  arresting surrealism
every time is unique
kisses that are never without bite
*fills up ashtray with crushed peppercorns  how i love to provoke Him
ever wonder what the moon smells like?
i'm a slave  to Your scent
let's flee into the night
I feel much more grateful than worthy
His soft smile  gears me for slaying
we bid goodnight  and my thoughts return to You
within moments  her surrender  takes hold
the alchemy of nurturing
i take a leap knowing You'll be watching over me
show me where i belong tonight 🎶
soften  and tighten  until  either broken  or glowing
soothed by a voice firmer than a back rub
melt my morals away
there are pent-up fires waiting on us
make my nights darker
we're better than great together
lonely nights like pins and needles
we've been crossing lines long before we met
wiping sticky smears  off my fingers  and missing You
there are knots of abandon twisting inside me
everything You do  is something I've never fantasised before
overfeed me
heavy hearts and gracious departures
my lips will leave  no freckles unconnected
can't think of You without burning
barely avoiding edges
deliberately defying danger
I complied  I came
love that feels like a safety blanket
smother me with morsels of You
profoundly unsettled  but I won't tire of waiting for You
there's nothing You're not to me
playful by the rules
it's me You want  and I love myself for that
from tickling my neck with a feather  to piercing His name on my bare chest with its quill
the powerful appeal  of understatements
lust is like a little black dress  the fascination never quite goes away
there's an offhand deviance about Him that has me needing Him unreasonably
with an open mind  she ushers in each new calamity
only really kept going  by her love of suffering
criminally wanton
spasms that sing of passionate love
carnal discoveries await...
He knew her before they'd even met
there's a wonderful stillness in her face  she's honest beauty
turn me loose
it's a dangerous game if you don't follow orders
kisses that drench lips
He's the moon  she's the tide
a sense of remoteness  and other arcane complications
gentle forewarnings &gt; hard rules
sublimely silken eyes  doing clever things
infinitely more delicate than she seems
He fondles as if colouring a blank canvas
hope Your hands are full while dreaming at night
warmly rustic
i'm seduced by the aura that surrounds Your voice
too tingly to sleep
it's the imperfections that He finds enchanting
knots  edging relief
the joy of loving without compromise
debauched dainty Angel  loosely rolling  over His lap
smirking insolently and risking a lot of attitude being torn apart
with lucid tiffany eyes  He watches me  and thinks filthy
He holds me still  with just a few words
they love like their breaths are at war
the words You wrote for me  I'm tangled in them at the moment
touched by Him she's a work of art
are You mannerly in bed? i'm not
there's nothing like the feeling that is You
have me if You can keep me if You do
sometimes i meet Him in my dreams  sometimes His memory keeps me up at night
from dreams of becoming Yours  to the hope of remaining Yours
crippling memory
interval sickness
inexhaustible yearning
dependable solitude
I harbour desires   over and above  the confines of one night
i make Him violent
"""there is something I can't remember about the clouds"""
a shadow wavers in the heat  as if hunting for a companion
i see love when i look at how the sea pools deep around the lighthouse
#bronte
"8, 16, 20, 21"
open-mouthed  she implores
to be immersed  in Your pursuit  of ecstasy
privately pulsing vulnerability  through my veins
I'm honey glazed and sticky   just strew me on a plank of wood  and Your supper's ready
when i leave  i am bereft  of rebellion  and turmoil
the power she thrives off  is worthy of her docility
a moment's rest  before sexual incontinence takes over again
the muse in her  is a rarity He discovered
authoritative sext
a shudder goes  down my spine  when I think of  the depths  of Your touch
I wish we could touch more often
the thrilling dialogue  between two pairs of eyes
I'll tell You so much about my past  You could write many new stories
train me to be caged
Your second glance  blew me into oblivion
from spooning to slow rocking to sleep
she doesn't need stilettos for empowerment
think of me wearing  the panties You like around my ankles
You've made me a sexual snob
fuck my mind shut!
darkness is coming  why aren't You?
it makes me viscerally breathless  to think about soaking You up
would You sweat to hurt me?
violence is my fit
the pleasure of unimpeded slamming
never quite past the point of satiation
brutalise  then look after me
the dizzying cycle  of my need and Your touch
finding chemistry through language..
advancing footsteps  jangling nerves
quivering cunt lips  beaded with anticipation
she dreams like anything is possible
women can't what?
born an era and miles apart  yet made for each other
I'm strong enough to hurt myself  but incapable of healing alone
extravagant dreams versus exciting realities
it's His heart that I love most
"He's a warm, kind-hearted, loving, generous, intellectual genius"
clues are revealed along the way  until the whole tale unfolds
find me in the dark hold me up to the light and play
He has touched every aspect of my life
choked till I cried till I slept
"for some, vodka is always the answer"
I've got just the wonders for You
she can make a plea sound like an indecent proposal
when reality becomes more surreal than the imagined
of fetishistic desires  and sumptuous excesses
a head  full of fancies  a mouth eerily empty
"hypnotic tonic, I call it"
moans and groans  they talk the same language
never knowingly underdressed
making rules is easy how about making exceptions for me?
beauty that incites absolute not just reasonable  control
a virtuous girl with vagabond eyes
pain so exquisite it made my tears quiver
do You like the way my lips make love  to Your chest?
I glow from the heat  of the love You feel for me
no better emblem than a handwritten poem
kiss the mouth that coaxes more power out of You
she wears black like armour
You are yet to dream of me
pleasure  but businesslike
"flying, she looks to the moon"
You made me discover  new possibilities
the world needs more lovers like us
You are  the scent of ink  on verses that talk  of eternal love
me and You like caramel wrapped in liquor
let's live together in the land of long nights
mirror mirror on the wall who blew the cobwebs away?
the art of annihilation
forcefulness vs finesse
flavour the words in my mouth with Your smoky tongue
He slows down  so I can think about what I'm feeling
steeped in knee-deep humility
do it  all the time
memories that straddle
these love bruises remind me  of my frailty and beauty
maybe I'll just whimper and let the inexpressible out
because of You I have a fondness for blue
His tongue squiggles sonnets  between my legs
dirty or classic  any martini will do
pretty little fucktoy waiting to be snapped up
roughness vs readiness
His warm chest broad as a sail
I like how wrathful He seems
His friendly and wicked eyes are what I like
His face is what I like
His voice is what I like
His soft whispers make my heart beat  like the pound of the sea
heard Him growl  so I moved closer
every time You favourite my tweet it feels like You stroked my lap
His fingers tousle my hair His knuckles tickle the wall
kiss me and find the poems You like
*strips to the limit before the champagne cork pops
pull the drawstring tie front  on my daisy white blouse  and please Yourself  with a tantalising glimpse  of my soul
remind me how good I am
silence is the enemy
the closer I am to nihility  the more alive I feel it's a wonderful way to live
polite as a straight vodka
I will disarm You with my honesty
burning like a candle  mad to be saved
I'm ready beyond belief  to be all You want
severity vs sensuality
we even think together
dirty deeds  against cream walls
watch how my skin shouts Your presence
permit me depravity
she's fearless as a smoker and writes boisterous prose
how is it that You fill me up  and leave me hungry?
the twinges of discomfort felt incredible
peaks and troughs of satiety and starvation
overcome in shades of blue
my body misbehaves when You're on my mind
He ushered my reality into the realm of fantasy
clamouring for a fall
her voice adds music to His poetry
a mouth that tastes  of wild honey  torments my nipples  with fiery pinches
tenderised  then finished off
my heart is cracking  yet I wave a cheerful goodbye  as if the sun's shining just to see me smiling
till my skin feels tender
He touches I surrender
repeatedly interpreting Your words  drawing more pleasure every time
I want slaps that bruise
behind the shipshape lipstick  and the champagne  there is a lilting voice  pleading for mercy  as if reading  delectable poetry
He's a powerhouse  of untiring amour
what could I answer but yes? #sixwords
the only superpower worth having is where you could force time to flow backwards
whispers that blew me out  to a sea of sensation
coffee nirvana beckons
beneath Your hands  I spring to life like a wildflower
carefully chosen words are lost on her
Unmistakable sophistication
we share a very different power dynamic but the same feelings
the weariness from  our immoderate passions could get me back into sleeping better
shivers that tickle
fascinate her with the diversity of the books you choose to read
seeking a kick  of coffee
I'd never be fully clothed around You if given the chance
resting on her knees  she looks up at Him like she's going to blow His world away
reading Your words in bed  is like enjoying the sunset without seeing the sun  it's mystical
as unusual as she's timeless
Sunday evening is our time
He's built me an archive of smiles
I can feel You waiting for me
she soared high enough  to fill the emptiness of the sky
force me to relax
words no longer confined to the heart
You're all around me  there's no escaping this madness
undress me enough to reveal the calibre
undisciplined mind  unable to stop
I crave adventure
there's a keen mouth behind her every sigh
happy tears  and a sated smile  tempt Him to slow down
temper my imagination  dominate my reality
His touch is powerful  because His love is pure
can You smell the scent of my longing in the night air?
showering in rainwater
I couldn't survive long distance cravings  even if I was bursting with patience
in the grip of a yearning  for long drops
everything pivots  on Your word
this charred flesh is of my own devising
me or sobriety?
ruin me for no other reason than You can
when nips of gin take hold  I find myself walking on the wild side
calming several butterflies  in every exhalation
the night doesn't need to end at the bar
He can read my thirsts perfectly
with You  it just feels right  to let go
*tiptoes to meet Your greeting kiss*
Your aura makes me dizzy
weak knees  and a hungry mouth  pull me joyfully down
the torture is worth it  for it always shows me  a glimpse of Eden
the sinful art  of dark and illicit  pleasures
"play voyeur to my seduction, Beloved"
I am His  absolute woman
He adores  the intimidating beauty of her body sparkling with  splashes of candle wax
her mind is a trove of buried treasure
one step forward  changed my life
He never tires of looking at me  my eyes must have intriguing tales to tell
and so  with the night  comes the torture  of being without You
"""It’s not my fault I rave. You did this. Do you approve of my love-madness?""  - Rumi"
swap Your dirty martini for me
how she yearns  for hardcore
turn off the lamp  light me up
bring on the fight  I'm ready to surrender
I've decided He's a demigod
passionate amateur
slow dance   in a candlelit barn  followed by ruination
yoga in a hammock  and other ways to push the limits
I'll write to Your heart's content
blow me a barely-away kiss
respect bordering on reverence
draped in a web  of intensely dirty looks
Your fireplace isn't big enough to fit in all my letters
passively smoking a whole pack  will be my undoing
fill the graveyard  with deeply indulgent filth
maybe she lives in heels
He uses few words  but they make phenomenal waves
she's the definition of  deliciously decadent and edible art
You are the sensation I have in dreams
adorned to melt  and crumble
my skin breathes lustrously  beneath Your hands
cries of pleasure  sewn up with moans
pearly tears You haven't licked   ashen skin You haven't bruised
very fine hair You're not twisting
it's a sexy mouth You haven't duct taped yet
I can't remember not wanting to suffer for love
all I need  is nothing  but love
swathed in moonlit darkness I touched myself just how You would
hidden depths and innate flaws overlooked  and unloved no more
double gin because she likes it harsh
violate my stern taboos
come to stay I'm eager to live another day
she's an ecstasy  subtle enough to linger
I quite fancy a curve hugging tight squeeze right now
"abandon, recklessly"
we're a double rainbow
rich with hallucinations
she slays with smiles that talk
if You loved how I touched Your heart can I own it?
You are the memory the thunderous sky evokes
knowing she's loved she sleeps well
my angelic innocence is a perfect match  for His powerful simplicity
Thinking about You
if life hadn't turned out the way it did we wouldn't be together today
she's opium with a heart of coffee
her manner is solemn  but she hides a whimsical soul
never lacking temptations
consume me to distraction
my heart doesn't have a way of adjusting around Your absence
her mind  in its lonely moments  is a tumbling sea  of love and romanticism
His kisses leave her looking like a little girl who's stolen some jam
You have the right to look at me any way You like
sat in front of her writing desk  she's an exhibitionist at heart
she revels in the exposures of her emotions
in the love of one Man I found everything
she's a good girl  on the outside
I wonder if I'll ever be able to say aloud all the things that I write
You are my church  and tavern at once
I cannot help but be a part of You
a smile that not only invites  but forces a desirous pursuit
make of me  what You desire
her eyes are like mirrors that echo intimate truths
*adjusts lipstick in the tiled surface of Your belt buckle*
my naked bottom  pert and marble  compels His hands  to simply grapple with it
it's a winsome defeat  if you've got a man like Him to lose to
moans before pleas before moans
if You see it it exists in me
the passionate art  of violence
solemn promises  with no fine print
all of my desires  are imbued with  a sheer blanket of infinite humility
I have spent hours  collecting desires  come  discover a handful
drunk enough on thoughts of You I'll just spend Friday evening with coffee and notebook in hand
infinite subtlety is what makes romance magical
the art of unconditionally touching a heart
give my mouth a chance to be of use
flow across my salivating tongue
the delightfully irreverent things  You did in the churchyard  immortalised me
I can never breathe responsibly around You
punish me so I can feel You for days
I crave the intimacy we share  when You pull aside  the scarf to softly kiss  my warm neck
"this weakness for You, it seems, is forever"
I mindlessly pour myself  a healthy measure of gin  and everything in the world is right
remind me to look after myself
written by You they're more than just words
bruising blue is how she resists forgetfulness  and is never in doubt about who's in charge
carve Your feat  into my neck
glorious bottom a tiny waist collared neck  drunk mouth   all crave You
You've seen everything I can do now show me everything You can do
His eyes make me feel oh so crushable
dive deeper until I come to life
He has the instinctive elegance of a Man who knows how special He is
when the night promises warmth
rough versus ready
shy on the streets  noisy and lively in the sheets
I'm not a breakfast person  unless You'll discuss sex
strands of her smooth hair  like fragrant orange peels  dipped in dark chocolate
blooming beneath Your loving hands my breasts are orbs of positivity
suffering her grief soothes Him
devotion begets loyalty
Your attention makes me feel vulnerable and I love it
it's bedtime  and I want lessons
not all my love is translatable feel what You can't hear
Your words dress me up as a whore
her giggles uncover hidden desires
my earliest memory  of our love  is longing
because she would always dare to ask  He was utterly won over
feel away  peel away
You're in love with a sadistic writer
forever craving Sir
sillyheart sweetheart
simple things rouse her  like when she's told to keep her shoes on
burning because blushing
if I could just bite into this fat chunk of time barricading our lips
I picked a reverence for love  the day I first knelt before You
place Your palm under my chin   and make me stay  until there's a whole red ring  below Your waist
a romantic gypsy kind of lover
she's like one of those shooting stars that crash and burn around a moon that's forever
don't leave the lights on  I might get ideas
eternal love was conceived amid mountains at sunset
is the only way we can sleep together is to dream it?
I'm drowning in this love so deeply  there's no swimming back
You're the miracle  my world was waiting for
let's keep this going
'Every great day begins the night before'
I've always been after Your heart
a mild mannered little girl who could fight wars with her facial expressions
she's chaotic  but blessed
tell me You love me using body language
I see sex in all Your poems
could I ever say enough I love You's for being loved so much?
it's hard to imagine myself without the inner life You've given me
her high ponytail is a prod sharp enough to get Him to take control
we're destined for further voyages
this inescapable rapture  of turbulent nights
hurt me but not enough I may enjoy it too much
"If I could, I'd consume all Your thoughts"
I miss Your reassuring physical presence
I have got rather used to being loved
her pale body  lies expertly bound  in black silk ribbons
dreams never deny pleasures
do my eyes urge You enough?
His palms are my favourite ankle adornments
she becomes beautiful as the days pass by
wipe away the tears  and play on
force my inhibitions into intimacy
she is a torturer's art
my bones ache in the trance of wantonness
He has that rare gift of simplicity
how the violence lingers...
fondle as if rummaging through my soul
*says hello to You with my woo lipstick on*
spend with me a summer of love
His words always leave me  with something to think about
I feel naked without You
she's coy about how much it hurt
dreams of You play  with my perception of reality
the delicate play  of undulating shadows  as we walk together
the more strength He finds in her  the lesser she knows herself
I can't remember what made me smile  before You
"""disciplined dreaming"""
mending a damaged heart used to be a fantasy
You decide when I'm most needed
shameless little slut  tirelessly assaulting herself
candy lips poised between her elegant fingers
play havoc  with my senses
I glimpse fleetingly  lest I drown in that gaze
yet again the sky beholds the earth at rest  yet again I lie alone in bed comfortless
her pretty little young face  reflects confidence beyond her years
super-strength coffee   high-tar cigarettes and insufferable longing
I have an implausibly modest desire  of feeling the cushion of Your palms  under my hips  as I arch in bed to meet Your mouth
pleas half said  half whimpered
it was harsh  but it was brilliant
I've held You in my heart long enough for it to wholly heal
discreetly behold  what is subtly visible
balance my restraint  with Your intensity
the bliss of being warmed
give me Your  quiet contemplation
do something so I won't feel claustrophobic in my comfort zone
intuition conquers fears
she's all the rage in a retro accent
His hands have a charge that lingers
kiss me and taste Your torment
thick skinned enough  to stay put
most things I do now are a first
You are breathtaking  in everything
the sultry night fits my current mood
some day let's begin with coffee and scrambled eggs
it was nothing like it should've been so I imagined it to be
she has a weakness for looking after dead things
I feel there is a burlesquer in me
You're in love with a reverence addict
You are  my calm day
destinations waiting
immerse me in sonnets
from licks  to little bites
the inside of my thighs  bears the scrawl of Your mouth
Your goodness dribbles from my glossy lips
teach me the art of giving back
for You I'll try anything once
prettify me as You want
lying in bed doing one of my least favourite things   warming Your side of the bed too
You are  a fix for my senses  and the balm for my soul
facing Him she sways  like a skittle about to go down
the kitten is poised to pounce
sometimes pleading for mercy  seems like asking for trouble
end up staying the night goddammit
she's the honeycomb foil  in His crumpled box of cigarettes
calamity is me
Your chest where I rest my head  is what I now call home
come lie in my hammock  and read Your poems to me
put everything aside  and let's just dance
a soft vanilla silk blouse  over a black satin halter   is her equivalent of cleavage
Voice
tornados have taste  I know because  I've kissed You
He revels in the abundance of  her imposing sensuality
ruby bite marks  like summer blooms  dotted around my breasts
pin in place  then pierce through
drag Your palms  across my neck
sensuously sexy words   wearing scarlet lips
think vulgar till it begins to feel right
clutch me tight like a bundle of belongings
drenched to the skin  and down at my heels in need
"""...she is what’s immense about the night."""
"""I thought I would be understood without words."""
"""Givers need to set limits because takers seldom do."""
His clear blue eyes  reflect the clouds passing   And not just metaphorically
her love is all consuming like a halo of gleamy petals  around a wolfish mouth
kiss and ignite
each tender kiss  offers a foretaste  of His violent love for me
I am habituated to flirting with death
toying with a cigarette in bed
before I met You impatience was never my strong suit
my fireball of a heart is drawn to Your rhythm
the palpable romance  of moonlight and roses
"sadly, they find a rose dyed blue more evocative"
"with You, I do not disguise myself in armour. You see me as I am."
she's a sapphire that He polished like a diamond
the sun fires in me a burning desire  that echoes the pleasures of the night
a hug like a zen escape
her kneeling brings calm  to His destructive path
there's a discreet doorway to her mind and He routinely enjoys a night walk
You breathe life into my thoughts
alas she's like an author without a book
thousands of words flow effortlessly
when she feels like  being loudmouthed and blatant  she puts pen to paper
I'd sit at Your feet  as You wrote poetry for me
carry me away from this grounding abnormality
she's like a wildflower grabbing at His ankles  wanting to be delivered to the edge of infinity
pearly white driblets trickle down her chin on her black velvet choker
#rumi
"""My hand can't touch your distant sky,  And so I bow full low and kiss the land."""
fist my hair tighter  or there'll be no holding me back
if only I could spend my nights in Your lingual cocoon
longing is burdensome  like tears that don't roll
my coquette pink lips will soon have You nibbling away
He's the magic an emancipated woman's dreams are made of
a woman kissed when blushing from corruptive whispers  tastes like heaven
imagine a girl raised on princess fairy tales  who experiences being the muse a writer obsesses about   I am she
do this for me Beloved  put all Your gentle words  between hard covers
I know now what I'm about
He falls in love again watching her sashay with overgrazed knees
she has a voracious appetite for breaking unknown boundaries
I'm addicted to the emotions Your love fires in me
their bare bodies entwine and ignite  sparks of animal urgency and primal tension
no one will know me  in precisely the same way as You do
you think you've earned all the love  then you're doused with more
"endless cross questioning  and too many incomplete answers later I finally hear Him say  ""That's better."""
make me rich with Your liquid lust
vivid daydreams continue to intervene
her eyes have something of the night about them
"""holding a book but reading the empty spaces."""
"thinking cigarettes, gin and Rumi"
the compatible pairing  of kisses and breaths
the touch of Your tongue  sounds like the clang of blade  on heated folds of clamped skin
I have no religious beliefs  and reserve my blind faith  to abide by Your decisions
You linger on my skin  My heart is sated and my smile reflects the snugness of our love   But... my rowdy soul is screaming for more
one fine high summer afternoon  He pulls me into a low key street corner  and kisses me like there's no tomorrow
"“Even if no salvation should come, I want to be worthy of it at every moment.” —Franz Kafka"
I didn't flinch or scream  I'd never disturb the peace
You've made me feel dirtier than I thought imaginable
lie back and let my silky hands   do wonders for Your weary feet
inaudible gasps
kiss my eyelids shut  and lead me to a calmer world
I want You warm hot steamy
strip and revive me
clean living sucks
put me  under Your spell  I want real  freedom
come scent my bed
He has the most extraordinarily soft smile
no matter how much I hunger for You I'd never rush rituals
the power of possibility
I don't know myself in the moments without You
"""ferocious is the truth which manifests itself solely in the lie of the poem."""
always a submissive I woke up one day owned
You have to be insane to live within limits
I'm no doll
the odder the better
"rolled stockings and cigarettes  versus  sharing the bed with You, naked"
so eager to reach You I forgot to adjust my lipstick
"He is seduced just by the way she says ""please"""
never devoid of desire
"""She wanted a storm to match her rage."""
lawless desires
my skin wants no one else's lip prints
You're a moon too far
I remember those blood tingling lip bites as I absently colour my lips striking red
I am uncommonly eager  to serve You
alcoholic impatience
eyes like smoke
I'm not unaware of Your ferocity   but it'll always hurt more to not suffer for You
she's the drama behind His smile
weaker than she's perceived
I haven't yet begun to be sorry  it'll take a lot more torture
my nerves can handle this chaos
the romance of falling for someone you know nothing about
a damnably perfect and lusciously earthy concoction
craving a potion
"dry wine, fresh roses  and testosterone overdose"
give me real over radical
this love is more intense than the pleasure it gives us
why isn't midnight soon enough?
He emplaced me in the abode of the muses  what more could I wish for?
show me who's delicate
even Your silences are noteworthy
smiles lost  in a miasma  of spotty memories
hush my mind and make space for dreaming
lying on a large enveloping sofa that's punishingly cold without You
you can't belong without  a sense of intimacy
I revel in Your pleasure
I kept dreaming  and the impossible came my way
tell me I'm good at being Yours
I would relish leftovers on Your plate if You asked me to
the dream doesn't know it isn't real
His eyes kiss me no fewer than countless times before our lips touch
He never lets me say never
leapt as I crawled
touched and used  and turned from pink and red  to blue and purple
beautifully overthrown
the reality of You  is beyond my sweetest dreams
she sounds beautiful loose
my toes tickle and I just want to run to You
soaked until undone
He uses no more words  yet makes it compelling
polite requests  coyly turning  into urgent demands
let me remain firmly in Your lap
after all what use is my servility  if it's not worthy of Your power?
crack the whip  simmer me down
my thirst for You is insatiable
my desire to please You is irresistible
teacher's pet
I have yet to love myself  as much as You do
a bedside book is the kind of lover that's always within reach
do You remember that summer?
wickedness vs winsomeness
vodka martini smoked and chilled
nipples like stones  the colour of honey
sat in the corner of the bar  she hums sublimely  and causes a stir  in His cocktail
living as part of Your world I wonder if I'll ever be able to come back down to earth
Andrea Gibson
maybe I never had innocence
one smile can say so much..
it's fleeting and impermanent  this beauty of hers they're all allured by
layers of a rosebud  veiled by ripples of black lace  open as she moves
a heart like a marble mansion
least comfortable when uncaged
I trust words You haven't spoken yet
without You my heart feels empty
residual thirst
I see myself clearer in Your words than my own
respectful defiance
"""tuneful protests"""
she's youthful but there's nothing contemporary about her desires
she bids Him goodnight like she's saying a night prayer
a rosy glow dawns on her lips  as she kisses His chest that smells of mown grass
her pale beauty runs deep  as if rebelling against everything wild
an all-pervading bondage and a spirit awash with blossom
how you experience love depends on who you are
unbraided hair like strands of jasmine and heady eyes still rimmed with kohl   the mirror smiles at her the morning after
Your tongue-lash  is sweet to me
I long for You because I cannot help loving You
crush me in a hug
when asked about an indulgence You'd never forgo tell them how much You love taking a dip in the dead sea
"""poetic pains"""
"""May I write words more naked than flesh, stronger than bone, more resilient than sinew, sensitive than nerve."""
wishes gone wild
sext: Insist
dare I touch You with love?
there's always need for the symbolic
force me to choose
when I read You I feel I'm flying when I write to You I feel naked
with You  I'm at my most open yet most intimate
how effortlessly  You possess me
suggestive smiles  to honeyed words  to intimate conversations  to peaceful silences
now blindfold me before I roll my eyes
You see right through me read my debauched mind raw  and then wonder why I'm so shy
telepathic tenderness
intoxication is reading Your poetry  in nocturnal silence  under the glow of the moon
there must be a lot missing from my life  but all I can feel is Your absence
It's almost midnight  and I long to be with You under a sky that's already blue
Your absence is only an illusion
she brings Him the joy He imagined He would feel only once in His life
I took a carnal leap and met a new part of myself
"""I write to feel alone."""
"""faithful but modern"""
hug me endlessly if You understand my love
Your cane  strokes my spine as my hands  hug Your feet
I can see my annihilation  in the cleft of Your chin
I tear the filter off  I light the cigarette I continue to wait
He's a romance fan She likes action
two pairs of hungry eyes interlocked  under a flock of cotton white clouds
the coolness of Your shirt against my skin  is any day better than the warmth of the sun on my back
to Your delight  I refuse nothing
the woods make us wild  we're animals after all
butterflies and wildflowers were meant to be together
love keeps roses looking perfect
You make me dream as much as I should
each cheek  each breast each inner thigh  misses the feel of Your palm
the air is damp and still  and vines of sensual sighs  are reaching up to the roof
the bed's hotter than a glasshouse  and You're not even here yet
He loves doing the less obvious
we only talk  through Your poetry  and it's magical
put delicate scrolls  of virile breath  from my neck to waist
You're a glimmer of dawn upon the bleak horizon of my heart
floating on the crest of a wave  all it'll take  is one more lick
give a little  take it all
the days are at their longest  yet my nights know no respite
break this cycle of nightly cravings
there are bruises under my eveningwear
formidable as gunmetal  she's no piece of cake
conflict free and far removed from any war zone
a girl like a decommissioned AK47
He calls me an angel  and using His hands  captures the grace  of my flight
Your words  they retain the warmth  of Your mouth
Your mouth my neck  a hushed conversation
once asleep  she fades into her exquisite self
dip Your toe into my whisky mouth
destroy me because I'm worth it
get hungry already
It takes a lot to be a good girl
You satisfy my need to fantasise
He loves me more than I could understand
spank me with my curling iron
three crosses to negative thoughts  three cheers to moving forward
this longing will immortalise me
I started the journey  with no end in mind
Your lips  on my pulse
ours is a love that's  myth turned reality
sleekly nude
the fickleness of drugs  except You
she provokes smiles
Happy birthday to the delicately dreamy @laperleexquise 🎈
high on whimsy not just heels
hauntingly beautiful
she loves to talk  but as a means to listen to Him
she whistles in her lighter moments
define her by her words  not her waist
she eats sunflower seeds for breakfast
moonstruck by those turquoise eyes
"overwhelmed  by the zealous conviction  with which You call me  ""Mine"""
strip instead of undress kind of night
You and I  we're in a different timezone emotionally
that dark wanton need is upon me again
limbs entangled affectionately  across acres of Egyptian cotton
You are privy to everything hidden behind the facade
I've dropped all my defense
overcome by Your vibes
love the way You're visibly forgiving
shock and awe that was some wet dream
tune Your growl  with my soft cries
leap on and weld me into the bed
her mind is a sexual busybody
I find my strength  in keepsakes
You are a feeling I know well
exhausted  I collapse  and sleep  in His arms
*deep belly breathes*
my moans speak my mind
"""Ouch!""  the princess cried"
all those fetishes  when really what does the trick  is a good pair of hands
addictive pursuits
the pain is short lived  the pleasure isn't
flying in bed
the road less travelled  hides no demons
bone-shaking spanks
steep thrills
slumbering lovers and dozing pets
not a speck of subtlety  yet she's anything but inelegant
You gave me the gift of beauty
I blow swirls of smoke  hoping for a crackle of magic that would bring You to me
restrain my paranoia
watch how my shame stumbles  on the hem of my cotton dress
love hurts and kills
love is life or death
avoiding boundaries
His words are full of images
Your edge on me is permanent
I seek through Your words  for something that would reform me
"""love-struck god"""
pleasurepain is the old friend I've been missing
"""To hurt is a way to love..."""
"""She knows that she can always trust her paper wings and halo”"
Your scent makes me feel vulnerable
love me while we dance
while You're away  just handcuff me to the trouser rail
dominate me by  Your voracious appetite  for preying
wrestle and tease out my demons
tell me something that's never been said
Your mesmerising whispers  make my heart beat faster
the sea of love in Your eyes   is the infinite blue backdrop  to my dreams
the innate balance  between elegance  and masculinity
living walls and hanging gardens
thinking about You as I watch snow turn to rain
Your mouth  plays havoc  with my lipstick
"“I should be yelling I love you, but I’m hardly speaking a word”"
His gaze is a wonder to behold
supple cheeks  warmly caressing  a leather-topped desk
distant commingling
dominated  almost hypnotised  by noticeable fragments  of brutal tenderness
sentimentally charged
damaged but protected
spit and sweat need not be wasted
bleeding lips and tantrums versus  growls and bites
broken but well loved
"""I am exiled even from the definition of exile."""
darker thoughts are more virtuous
make me crawl  in confined spaces
"""Books are the best means - private, discreet, reliable - of overcoming reality."""
suspend the kindliness  for hours
I remain unshaken by the cracks between the paving stones
all I do is wait
there's joy in pain
You are the treasure in my abyss
patience is a demanding ghost
there remains an abyss  and it makes me weightless  or sometimes overloaded
give me pain Beloved but not of physical detachment
if kisses could leave you twinkling  I'd be a firefly
in Your bed  all my senses  are at play
any opportunity to serve You is a blessing
baking for You calms my mind
kiss me until I'm sailing on clouds
a smile like a tidal pull
I'm an unguided missile without You
I desired a life change  and here we are
she's an incurable weakness
bruised morality
eminent in red
Your poetry is the mirror I delight in holding up to myself
my mind's drifting into a fanciful Eden
her: would You trust me with a firearm? Him: Yes  her: unzip then
she's beautiful when she's angry
wear me on Your fingers
silky brown hair  entangled in curls  by ruthless caresses
to see her as an Angel  is to miss the point
slip Your every heady breath into my capacious mouth
neither too bold  not too tame
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that 🎶
thinking about  Your whiskered face  between my bare thighs
I'm obsessed with Your extravagant beard
You are miles away  but I'm never quite alone
have You realised how long we've been talking in my mind?
inviting You closer with the mesmeric scent  of my submission
.
#truth
soft strokes of His hand  smoothen the bulge in my throat
say a few words  weave a few knots
the smouldering sensuality  of a warm first hello
and now every bone in my body craves beauty
the sophisticated chemistry of love
pretty little girl  coated in tart scent
a longing so compulsive  I almost occupy space in Your bed
wholesomely dirty
in the mood to lap up absinthe
striving to bloom
our telepathy  is perfect
overwhelmed by  the suppleness  of Your touch
my thoughts centre around the past because it always feels relevant
I want to lose some hours tonight
reenter
being Yours  is one of the most  refined pleasures I'll ever know
tug at the strings  from all corners  then keep my heart  safe with You
sensual perversions lost to humanity
my devotion  goes beyond  attraction
when You look at me  I feel more imperfect  and beautiful  than ever
pleasure has no limits
love that filled in all the blank spaces
she remains  much misunderstood  for they think she is  too simple
because I miss You
wish You were here
my weaknesses You see  are a sign of love
a writing desk will always invoke  an urgency to vent
as the gentle dusk settles  I unveil my powers  of seduction
Your dark intensity satisfies me
perfectly tended  under Your care
the trees bow and whisper  sensationally retelling our story  to the lovers who course the same path
Your fingers release  my sweet flavour
I am always my delicious version  with You
"deeply mystic, like the fog"
wondering about the kind of things that must remind You of me
why does my imperfection attract You?
"""She considered herself imperfect, like the first draft of a book."""
eat her art out
allow me  to die a little
I'm always verged on the silver lining
the little details  seem like delicious indulgence
hollows left in bed  by lovemaking
if only I close my eyes and try get sleep
traces of hope  hovering in the gloom
blind but sincere faith
In spite of the humiliation  I continue
a simple but stubborn need  for deprivation
a mysterious impulse  to explore an otherworldly new territory
I seek relief  in Your fierce heat
there are spaces where I wander  and forget I'm lost
quietly earning  a place in Your heart
the embossed buttons  on His white twill shirt  leave impressions  on my bare back
I prefer the shadows
You and I  in a roomful of candles
Your gaze  could just swallow me
raving welts spring up on her pale skin beneath strings of black leather tassels
*sinuously allures You into my humble world*
the diffident charm   of vanished innocence
on my knees I stride into the midst of Your world
keep me in the corner
"leaves me with a raging hangover, every time"
His tongue in my mouth like a slice of heaven
I feel a bond  with every word You write
"""He represents a moment of transition."""
kiss like You're gathering words I won't say
I am in love  and I want to live forever
a yearning  that is obsessive yet relaxing
incomplete  without torture
the state of mind where you feel both exhausted and ready for more   that
Your words will always  be more beautiful  than Your muse
I collect treasures  yet every vivid memory of You is something immaterial
there is still  everything to discover
You would hurt me  and I would cum
Him: you're mine forever  her: could I be Yours for longer?
I love the One with whom I don't feel embarrassed to struggle and fail
my first crawl is in the dark
limitations arouse
less sex bomb  more elegant mess
Your words lend me the beauty I lack
the muse  is devoted  obsessed  and in love but the poetry  will never need  the muse
"""After a crossing, the known shore becomes the opposite side."""
I accept  a well deserved  spanking with grace
I don't care if You  strip me of flavour  so lick away
the fierce pleasure  of hearing You say No adamantly
watching a grey cloud spit warm rain  puts me in the perfect mood
the dark art  of relishing infinite pains
cerebral sensuality
"predictable is boring  routine however, is agreeable"
the raw beauty of a breakable heart
wild dreams that pave the way for alternative realities
delicate lace underwear  abundantly touching the floor
I'd abandon principles for You
my insanity groans under Your weight
the endless pursuit of aphrodisiac
if You fancy tormenting me I'm very game indeed
ain't no safeword tempting enough
lace my tongue  with white diamonds
that navy blue suit of Yours  heightens my appetite
she writes like there's autumn in her hands
eyes like dramatic chandeliers
sense my immediate need
the first touch of their lips  is worth a million flowers
come closer  and bring me into being
this untiring urge  to surprise You by my fearlessness
Your dark  entangled with  my sultry
bites like rosettes for endurance
Your love gave me the strength  to bare my soul
always only just going along the edge
the impulsive need  to be protected
there are risks one feels inspired to take
and how they create complexity out of simplicity
all things beautiful and papery
I may be beautiful  but I'm not a painting  so please do touch
are You really undressing me  or am I alone in bed turning pages of the book of poems You wrote?
Your marks on my skin are an antidote to the scars  I no longer need to hide
I fell under a spell  before You even said anything
deep in the dark lies a firestone
the sun is weak  but I'm alive with words
darkly twisted angel married to her white bed
purr
heart like a treasure chest  of romantic ruins
"my lucky, lucky heart that's with You right now"
reckless maybe foolish never
seize pleasure to the point of addiction
biting sensuality
smiles that kiss
spiral into my mouth
refreshing decadence
toffee sweet petals  in dramatic pink
"if everything I ever wished for hadn't come my way, I'd be an atheist today"
the seductive mix  of night-sky and silver
*uses the swizzle stick from Your cocktail to tie my hair up in a lazy bun*
speak to me in flesh slang
You are the attractive stranger they all want to covertly behold
"retain this fascination forever, Beloved"
His cool tongue soaked in her intoxicating heat
gentle sensuality
the lingering scent  of her warm skin  flushed from sex
insistently erotic
seductively daring
poetry that could make stones crumble
You create  chaotic knots in my belly  with such playful ease
the zest  for shreds of myself
Yours is a higher love
hold my hand  and take me upstairs
we share the same hopes
fill to overflowing
I choke for Your delectation
compulsively wanton
words splattered all over the paper  there is unrest everywhere without You
be a softcore Sadist for me today
the sweetly raunchy feeling  of wearing each other out in bed
imprint a kiss on my mouth forcefully
Your skin has  an incomparable scent  and I am possessed by it
Don't retweet just to pair with me
she takes pride in the act of filth
wish I could slip in Your bed and melt into the sheets
the road to my undoing is a picturesque one
entwined bodies lit like works of art
You and I  in the spotlight  amid an audience of butterflies
unashamedly single minded
her eyes are dirty when they look up
express that love extravagantly
dreaming of endless sands and the cerulean blue of Your eyes
she's shy except when she's very needy
nurture until after the rose finishes blooming
weakness and strength cannot do without each other
I know of nowhere else quite like Your lap
I'll go wherever You wish
rugged with a rusty edge  He's more battlefield than Man
I have a weakness for reviving kisses
her bravado fades behind a closed door
flying me is simple
graceful mess
distracted by my lack of tutelage
do You have to make me wait for it?
with thoughts of You in my head  I am willing to entertain the existence of God
my groin is numb from wrestling urges
blow the candle out  I'll happily burn and perfume Your bedroom
"extremes, sensual, bouquet, veil, beneath, startling, cigar, interlude, haunting, today, unfold, journey, unsafe, nowhere #stunningwords"
"mood, memorable, skin, delicate, freesia, paired, different, shore, natural, icy, calligraphy, vital, book, wisp, gunpowder #stunningwords"
"whole, first, escape, stir, blossom, smile, narcotic, bitter, immensity, bud, between, poem, earthy, silver, drifting #stunningwords"
"necklace, smoky, rapturous, darling, mesmeric, infinite, midnight, pulse, kindle, robust, impulse, ivory #stunningwords"
You get my rhythm
a leashed wildcat  swathed in a decadent little black dress
a frock and a hard place
we met in a room surrounded by tempest
reinterpreting dreams
"a leather doll, scotch taped"
I bleed a dark need  under this cloak of innocence
He holds my gaze and before I know it I'm in an interrogation chamber
how I survive beyond unflinching cravings
my poise and how I am undoubtedly complacent
You have to admire my reserve and moderation
when You are  on the route to another world  pull me in
there's something sad about woods  even something dead
a silent volcano  at Your feet
You said I'm beautiful and now I don't want to put any clothes on
read my eyes  but not before we've kissed
I light another cigarette instead
a lung-busting fuck is what I need
lock and dispose
superhuman moments
too fanatical to fail
"""You’ve been thinking too much. A solemn answer: yes."""
some of the best bedroom moments are spent off the bed
spank until served
playful by the rules
my skin  and Your hands  have a deep connection
her naked body is a canvas for His ideas
I have  been touched  by magic
You can't just walk by her without being drawn all in
eyes filled with glimmers of revelation
there's a shiny silver lining  on the sides of my weariness
He squeezed magic out of my ordinary life
she finds her comfort  in His truth
that sultry look on her face  radiates all manner of sins
her mind's a cabinet of curiosities
Your palm pressed onto my mouth  Your mouth biting into my lips
Hello.
after You're finished  may I please sit on a bed of ice?
my lips leave decadent red moons on the fringe of Your toes
the sounds of her cries  dominate the room
my heart feels a special openness and breathes differently around You
if I were to cluster our memories in tiers I'd have a castle ready for us
won't rouse until it hurts
no matter how elusive  You pin down my prejudices
You have my soul  but I want to share more than that
get me in the mood You're in
I've been smiling  and it's not without reason
His smile is the very essence of tenderness
that delicious concoction awakened my senses
her femininity will win Your heart
priceless moments  as if stolen from eternity
pull me closer as I wake up
I love unexpected intimacy  like being silenced and pushed to the wall  as You kiss my neck and then break me
sexy salty sweaty  Sir
"simple, not simplistic"
this exquisite sensation  of bruises flaring up on my skin
hours into play  yet the fierceness persists
assuaged by name calling
say more as I inhale and listen
shivering as I blossom
one of those nights when I don't have to just imagine Your scent on me
losing no time sobbing  I start to suck
see me in the elegantly curling smoke  blowing from Your mouth
see me in elegantly curling smoke  blowing from Your mouth
she's soft yet tenacious to the touch
smitten by the comfort  I find in Your arms
my convulsive gasps  bring Him calm
enjoy my screams  as You watch me burn
tasting You  tranquillises me
Your scent lingers on my skin  in the most enticing way
neck sniffing is permitted  and for that I am ever grateful
I meet Your magnetic gaze  and fall into place  knees first
being brutally self-critical I quite like how carefree I am with You
You're the ocean I'm the ruins lying in front
He found inspiration in her unpracticed mouth
hurt until I'm tender
tinge my skin violet  and remind me spring is here
it's surreal to see myself like You do
toenails matching nipples
desires don't wear out tastes do
this love is truer than life itself
I put my world  at Your feet
hold me responsible for Your torrential adrenaline rush
growls and whimpers  in equal measure
I'm feeling fuck-all-night love for You
who says you can't have it all?
whisk me away
let my suffering  feed Your soul
give more than just escape
on the cusp of dreaming
kiss me like it's my birthday
she loved dark fairytales
I love the containment
we haven't met yet and I'm already looking forward to the next time I'll see You
"His touch, a realm of sensations"
"her skin, a sanctuary of the scent of sex"
bite every unglazed spot
this bond of our love  is free of beginning or end
the infinite nature of love..
the smell from falling petals how deceptively simple  yet kindling a tempest
supple breasts  ribboned in deep teeth marks
hands so finely textured   You must enjoy pouring love from them
you'd look into those innocent eyes and find her charming  He looked into them and knew how untamed she was
I could gaze at You for hours when You're not looking
tears and shame  on the verge of being spilled  along the floor
You elevate my ordinary
whisper on my mouth and give me a taste of things to come
intimacy through interaction
inexpressibly needy
the seductive darkness  of a blank canvas body
an obsessive longing  to simply converse
there's a part of Him that wants her all
she looks shy out of disguise
I discovered nirvana in You
He always wanted a slave like her
write for the one you're with
too wild for a kitten
something wild kept me awake all night
get some rope and give my wings a rest
harmonious dynamic
she leaves the room with  an exhausted stagger of a jaded slut
friction feels fabulous
clitoral happiness
each of my nerve endings   has Your initial on it
her G spot  needs tough love
the best way to fall in love  is with no preconceptions
head resting on birch leaves  mind full of slothful fantasies
the unbearable weight of countdown
a confetti of lost breaths  sifting through the air
the grid of limbs
I part my lips and make way  for Your need
she wears audacity like a wetsuit
pin down my fears  with Your love
the swell of the night  is beginning to subside  make me come alive for there is no time to lose
I won't let screams take my mind off the pain
she's adorable  and that provokes Him
I'm dirtier than what You have in mind
the sound of a fire alarm has new meaning
granny at heart
closeted princess
fuck me if You want to know  what my soul feels like
incidental tenderness
His kisses  they all feel like  the very first one
teach me new things
blindfolded so as to protect
sharp on heels  weak at knees
the relief from Your heat is heaven
I fall into Your arms  with twinges of inferno hidden behind  my unmarked skin
will I be safe in a towel around You?
lick my smile
the rustic radiance of  silky pearl shingles swirling over scarlet lips
I'll keep writing poetry  until You're in the mood  to give me a caning
be far  from being  off limits
tough but infectious
tenderness is my enemy
can't keep my knees off the floor
I got lips like a profusion of petals  come embrace my intensity
sometimes at midnight she craves the exhilaration of the espresso
only asking for crumbs..
the gentle scent of cigarettes  and kisses that taste of burnt wood
they are all poets  and she's the drug of choice
let my name  pass Your lips
who'd have thought she could stir so much excitement?
first steps don't always falter
bring out the personality You want in me
borderline fatalistic
feeling unimportant in isolation..
fuck me like You're burying me
what if we try to be different kinds of people for one night?
living the joys of adulthood  despite the tension and heat
luscious tangled ringlets of brown hair  cascading down her flawless face
He's always looking for depth in her devotion  and she never disappoints
the kind of night when mere imagination is powerless to stimulate me
I love to see how keen You are to break me
"""Do you have any idea how wild I could grow in the flowerpot beside your desk?"" - Andrea Gibson"
when is a smile not a yes?
in Your arms  I've felt  the best of all  possible worlds
life without You would be like a book  with pages missing
I unashamedly entwine my slender tongue  like a silk thread around a metal strip
come smoke for free
tongue like a rolled tube of tobacco leaves
love sans frills
I tasted thunder on my lips
pleasingly long and weighty  conversations
the strength of His voice  cuts through my fears and inhibitions
steal me after midnight
Sundays are best spent contemplating life on the church porch
I wince lovingly as He traces  the rug burns on my cheeks with the pin in His belt buckle
the intrusion of unsolicited memories
the pain is unspeakable  yet the only way I will learn
*tiptoes under the radar*
devoured and threadbare  yet surprisingly graceful
eccentric thoughts worth reading
she's sass tempered with imperfection
read to me and take me on a journey
she's full of the subtle force of nuance
meander  before You go south
more minx than she thinks
more holy book than heart
more layers of steel than bosom
more fireplace than mouth
more dawning than crawl
more strip tease than smile
more silk than hair
more remedy than touch
more gospel truth than words
more sea of flames than heart
more chasm than eyes
more opium than kiss
more blade than tongue
more knives than teeth
a few words  that feel like a thousand kisses
I've gone shamefully long without having come alive
don't shake it  don't stir it  just pour it from Your mouth
how greedily my skin absorbs Your heat
After You've finished I ache in muscles  I never knew I had
I smile when I hear  Your sated sighs
a mind too chaotic to be worthy of study
hungover until kissed
lofty intentions
she smoothes with her red claws  the baby hairs that frame her face and accentuate her soft features
I like tweets that fuel my impulse
eyes like brush pots with a colour so exceptionally azure  you could paint swirling skies
some days Your writing looks like crystalline sea waves to me
pull tug repeat
this is a new and strange  kind of in-between there is an unsettling need  and a feeling of completeness
together we could  bring the wonders  of the forest alive
the birds woke to the sound of her moans
under a fluffy white duvet  there is a tiger  lying on a kill
I was made to be Yours why must I have to pine for You?
the rite of servility
a near mythical  physical love
do it all over again at dawn
my honey dipped nipples versus Your wine-scented toes
floating on transparent love
feline persuasion  quick yet thorough
let the rules forbid permission seeking
show me how much lower I can go
Your teeth deserve  the softness of my curves
can we get back to not discussing how pretty I am?
not just a few hours  I need a whole goddamn life  alone with You
because You care
teach me to be afraid
love's gonna help me live longer
promise not to be gentle
she's the lucky charm to the devil in Him
to the slut belong the spills
He loved her till she had nothing to hide
a message that her choices are her own that she doesn't want to change and that she knows you're a mistake
her red lipstick  is a message
there are choices she's not old enough to make
"I feel pretty strongly about You, immorally"
silken pyjamas  laid upon worn wood
I owe my survival  to Your touch
sensuous traces of her inner beauty  etched on the glass door
I will  suffer for You until effort  becomes effortless
expect nothing less  than the unreasonable
take an age  while You kiss me
she blows misty swirls of smoke  while her unspoken words retreat to a cloudy haven
smiles are never imperfect
it's little wonder He was born in the year of the Dragon
He will  not be denied
palms like leather poppies  that hurt me and soothe me
I salvage innocence
wholesome sexual liaisons
desires blend  senses blur
Him: you're never sober  her: because You're always on my mind
a smile so smug it can only lead to pleas for mercy
brash and bold fantasies  cradled by an imaginative reality
fuck me like a speed addict
I settle before You at knee height and offer  my hungry mouth
a quiet but undeniable  need of You  continues to build  inside me
together with Him at last  her eyes are like the night sky  enrobed in sparkles
on the thousandth time every day wish Your avi would really come alive when I zoomed it in
take me down the road of romance  I want to smell the flowers
Your sweat caresses my skin as our bodies meld  with uncontrollable ferocity
I am decidedly Yours
it is rather special  this supernaturally potent dynamic we have
kisses that leave you with an aftertaste reminiscent of red velvet truffles
her: no Him: Now
still remember my first taste of brutal and how much I loved it
gag my tender mouth
allowed or encouraged?
kiss me into the room  love me into Your life
the parade of interesting experiences
I love the nearness of dawn  and to wake up to You
grappled by roots
because You want me  I have it all
there's a rustling little package in bed  waiting to be unwrapped
the girl with a Sufi soul
spank me till Your palm twitches from overuse
spend all the power in Your arms  in that first hug
this unending wait for You is a torturous penance
as long as there are old walls smothered in greenery  I will live in hope
I heave on a rasped throat  yet open my mouth for more
I lie in Your bed like a starfish  with jelly legs and arms
"I crawl, exhausted and stinging"
slap.. slap.. slap  His love really is merciless
roll me over  and feel the swell of my chest on Yours
sweep me forward  against the brick wall
get closer  I want to bury my face in Your chest
shadow me
woke up to a sense of impending solitude
her magically calm  spreadeagled body comes alive with  shocks of pleasurepain
fill me to bursting
living life to the fullest after dark is one of the pleasures of dreaming
there are moments when I perceive us as living together
I want to smell my sweetness on Your fingers and offer my mouth ready to taste myself
I want to leap out of bed and live the day that we meet
I want to breathe Your heated skin as we sip wine beside a burning log fire
His poems for me  add to the pleasures  of the life we share
strictly ritualised foreplay
a smile like sunshine  and how it rules my day
let me burn deep underneath You
You own my mind
came till I cried
cane till I cry
come and collect kisses  under this canopy of blooms
spills and splashes  all around my slutty mouth
some scars are soothing to live with
His middle name is grey
she's the guilty pleasure in His library
I can have You for as long as I imagine
I crave the love  that tears me apart limb from limb
fragile beauty  broken open  with discipline and grace
"tears they've seen, noises they've heard"
imagine the stories these bruises would tell if they could talk
the only thing I can never be is unfussy
ready and willing  to be broken to pieces
lack of need may be hugely attractive  but I'm tossing and turning on the edge and I need You
I'd like to believe as much of myself as possible
she's the girl with a disturbingly seductive smile
she smokes to breathe
kiss me long and hard  and You will taste lesser-known wines
slave to savagery
pause to think about me
His sadism is thought-provoking
she has a weakness for conjuring pleasures
wind down the hours between us
I can sense the fog rolling away
no one loves  or leads like You
mouth filling love
"us, nothing else"
endlessly fascinated  with being shushed
rosy lips like delicate fruits  stewed with spices
subtly provocative  like a mermaid's sigh
the cult of silence..
psychological wholeness
an embrace like a sanctuary for perfect moments
being worn out has its own charm
even her cat is black
"call me ""Mine"" one more time"
I crave torment
provoke my arrogance  then put me in my place
You set me apart
You are a blessing
He does things more interesting than sin
now pet the animal You've turned me into
He's an all consuming paradise
love me for the rest of my life
struggling to get by without You loving me violently
I'd lick You wet and hard  as You sun dried
turn me over  dress me down  and You're set to go
a gemstone will only sparkle  if cut cleverly
always aware of possibilities
blindfold and  lay me to rest
the voice of her heart is small enough to get lost in the noise of her head
it's the words that are the sexiest part of us
words connect us
drawn to danger
hell to me is not waiting long enough
gonna howl the night away
the satisfying fusion  of darkness and sin
it's quiet all around and I don't feel safe
clean yet sexy
not without thinking about You
nearly naked
dive and crash into my bed
where to cast my carnal ache?
not easily blown away
I love the adrenaline
as wounded as they come
the prey is wild
pining slut
You approach  I scatter
all Yours  in light  and shadow
thanks to these cigarettes  it's a smoky distance and the miles don't intimidate me
those moments when I'm a breath away from collapse   priceless!
pretty as a ruined fortress
sometimes dreams become a breathing part of daily life
"devotee, not an addict"
twitching for exhaustion
arousal that made my limbs wobble
imagining my lips being gnawed upon
confessions at the bar don't count
caution: may cling
"the hold of the powerfully simple word, ""No"""
my soul chimes with His smile
Yours is the hot name on my plush lips
these are the years of my life I'll wish to hug one day
few heart-quickening glances at Him and every part of me quivers
whip my precious sensibilities
alone in bed  my nudity is as ordinary as the night is long
I'd suffer endlessly to earn the privilege  of slipping into Your calming embrace
her mindless words come from a head full of confused cocktails
feet bare ankles cuffed toes painted red
the night found Him in my dreams
He's my idea of a perfect storm
I only look fragile
Your heart is where my heart belongs
early riser  late bloomer
the thought of Your skin  makes me hungry
got thrilled  and spilled
no ordinary lovers  no ordinary love
an embrace like homecoming
dawn is not the end
love and the blues seem to be soulmates
the bliss that is my emotions stripped bare
a persistent scent drifts in with the wind and I am forever lost in the memory of You
reinforce the poetry with wine
it's not a game but sometimes i win
no longer allergic to undressing in a public toilet
ruined but no longer doomed
tell me how much You want to ravage me it's warming to know
loving Him is like learning to enjoy whiskey
her passion lies in satisfying Him
she infuses audacity to beautiful words  with the delicacy of a watercolour
I close my eyes but You're still far away
I learned to love the colour red the day You first bruised me
the reveal took place in the basement
hypnotised to believe
can't maintain my resolve around You
wear me on Your lips
work Your fingers to the bone  because I'm nowhere near done being fucked
"first orgasm, a beautiful thing"
shall we stay here forever?
so little peaceful
I love You more than my wayward ways
I'd follow Your instincts unconditionally
I'd steal You without a qualm
a life full of chance meetings
buzzing with aggressive desires
what do I want?  calmness
I want to escape the night
reading my future through Your words
It's not like these boxes of chocolates are enough to keep me company tonight
fuck me till I look haunted
the knees just gravitate
leather lashing is my favourite weather
just be by my side when I cry
I'll never miss being curious  because He's too unpredictable
my dreams are ludicrous  unless You add reality to them
this urge to write..
going through waves of perplexity
uncontrollable heartache
a love with lasting power
even my own sanity  isn't under my control
You see my hopelessness. All of it.
dates are good for you
pick while still wet with dew
slap me with Your cock until I stop biting my lip
I feel deeply silly to begin a sunny day  without being able to touch You
indulging in hibernation until we meet again
He is everything I could look for in a Man
sitting in my dressing gown  looking pretty  but feeling sickly  without You
loving is believing
mood of the moment: You and me spending after hours in a library
I want Your fingertips  aggressively studded into my skin
I have a special love for the crook of His neck
thoughts of You rippling down my neck
"all of a sudden, You feel so far away"
His hand fits my neck like a glove
she's simple yet sumptuous
a touch like black gold
snuggly breasts wreathed in wooden pegs
when pure pleasure collides with fragility
I feel Your love  right on my collarbone
you get yourself into trouble  and so are adventures made
You inch closer   and butterflies run inside me like dervishes
show me what I can do
roughed out all night long
I relish challenges
harbouring desires
life's easy when you feel loved
it'd be a nightmare to find nothing difficult
nibble until You're hungry again
this love ain't no victim of time
she's pleasant to behold  and pleasurable to use
her smile is bright as a ripened lemon  her lips taste wickedly salty
I love to learn
the dark beauty of her body hungering beneath a swathe of silk ribbons
I long to be armoured  by the tough solidity  of Your hand on my throat
Your voice makes all my foul names soft to wear
He stares intently  as if to inspirit me  with a dose of dark romance
the lust in her veins  makes the most irresistible sounds
press Your lips on my neck  and see my wings unfurl
fresh and naked
sex like a fire dance
wept and wailed  until He picked the cane back up
not an adventurer  until You've discovered her
when I think of You I always picture myself kneeling
left me nosing my palm long after He held my hand
the past is but an aged bird buried under fallen autumn leaves  so don't let me lose my way lest I wander and bear down on it
hurt me as hard as You want it being hard on me is on me
with us things can never begin quietly
He just keeps getting more handsome
curl a slender strand of my hair around Your finger as we kiss and then grab it in fistfuls and drag me down the bed
Only   That Illumined  One   Who keeps  Seducing the formless into form   Had the charm to win my  Heart.   #hafiz
chain me to Your writing table
the outrageously full moon reflects my heart that's heavy with longing
my abstinence hangs heavy...
He's too much of everything  yet I constantly crave more of Him
make time to nail me down
flash my vulgarity  on Your fingers
too feverish  to be touched anymore
loosen that tie and pull me closer
I string together  words from Your poems  and let the world hear them as moans of pleasure
invigorate me with illicit cum shots
exhaust me with Your intensity
lying in bed watching the grey of the sky merge with the darkness we're made of
it's hot and dirty in bed and she's like a bloom pushing through the soil
I long to feel Your heat sink deep into my skin
bear-hug me
rituals performed to the beat of raindrops
sucked till my tongue was puckered with cuts
thrust till You feel the core  of my extreme desire
her veil is black but her smile is vivid
these butterflies  keep me alive
growls of intent
reverse everything that's normal
I'm His personal everything
no one can seduce her easily  she used to think
He showed me how to deal with fear better
my heart is locked up in Your vibe
something to take?
shower some more deviance on me
can't wait to be burned
denial is good training
her hair smells musky  His hands smell floral
I lost myself  on an alluring trail of soft whispers
He runs hands over me like I'm a sculpture
supple breasts dotted with teeth marks
her hands are a favourite of butterflies
rock loving hardy little leaf
let Your kisses explode in my face
thinking about how easy it is to exhaust myself pining
hoping love continues to come my way
grab a hammer  and build me a bookshelf
a sea of blue bruises
You must love to save me
two wanderers  one way
to want  and to be wanted
who knew there'd be comfort in knowing someone knows you
since our first kiss I've believed in heaven
You are my emotional home
"inseparable lovers, aren't we?"
getting skilled at not getting nervous
rosy coral lip prints  on a winter white chest
You're near now and I can do the right sort of breathing
and so to bed..
limit me to reality
addicted as opposed to sated
liquid obsession
Your kisses taste like molten gold
wastefully expensive roses and vinous evenings
please wait while I undress for dinner
sex is an act  sensuality is so much more
I'd kill myself to do what You love
tear out my reserve by whispering in Your velvet voice
Mr Sex
lead me to another discovery
*runs a tongue along each of Your tan lines*
"connoisseur, not a drinker"
the remarkable simplicity  of basic rituals
satisfyingly fierce
believing is never a mistake
every time lovers fall apart  there appears a dent in the universe
time is a menace
fragments of co existence
I revel in the excitement  of making a sheer rock  rise deep inside me
is my smile bright enough  to show how deep I hold You in my heart?
waves of reach
never look away..
survival despite no fire
dreams of You  rescue me from sleeplessness
live fearlessly  love recklessly
not enough time for enough mischief
this love is way beyond sweet pain
cover me at the bar while I kneel
His eyes  can read my mind
you can't go wrong with the dark
inviolable commitment
unconditional nurturing
she's a lover of the absurd and the unknown
You light the fire  I'll pour the brandy
gleaming sweet spot  cradling in Your palm like a pearl
braving heat induced delirium
overnight journeys  through treacherous rocks
to truly feel  and to know how to show it
when the interpretation of life is truer than life itself
anything for  saving a promise
overwhelmed with restlessness
come closer  and hear  the voices  You like
throw me off balance a little
she's tough  He's in love
smear anything
fall into my mouth
never too snug
every scrape on my knee a reminder of where I belong
her cleavage ain't no cushion
long drinks and askance glances
give me a map of routes for my mouth to follow
better half higher hopes
my spine is still tingling from remembering things You said weeks ago
barely drunk enough to stay warm
come twist and shift my stubborn
it'll cost you a woman to be a dick
bury me into Your side  of the bed
I share His taste for filth
she's a curious observer
let's hold hands and flee the grey skies
guard my lippy mouth
burden my breaths
I'd like to be bedroom-bound
one drink too many  and I'm not quite sure what to do with myself
sounds of my own moans  fill my dreams
the poetry  of memory
carnal scavenger
scent sorceress
bruised brown sand
a vodka called Mediterranean holiday
tangled desires
I want a summer dress with a cigar pocket
it feels deep yet of another world too
eclipsed scars
He's contemporary sophistication personified
I become softer with every growl
wish these drinks would turn to dinner
decadent night-in
so much desire  spilling extravagantly
fill my nights with no-sleep luxury
He showers me with boundless love  as if the horizon were spilling over the waves
echoes of her moans  hug the ceiling
if only  this lonely night  was no more than a murmur
embrace the clash
"so tainted, I can only get sensationally divine"
the secret to my secrets is listening
cigarette in my mouth  and a haze of impure thoughts in my head
overflowing with unusually embarrassing bravery
He wants to fucking destroy me and says it like it's true
diction domination
she's obsessed   and great at hiding it
killing machines fall apart too
I find my mystery deeply uncool
I can handle crossing lines
the scent of You  as if it's flavour
good girls are always more fun
permission over forgiveness
whispers that act like a drug
intoxicate me with Your seriously tender sleep-inducing kisses
how I'd love a You-perfumed morning
the word 'home' has medicinal properties
sometimes life takes you to India
mental vandalism
always suspicious of history creeping up
stay until after  the candle has burned away
everything You feel  grows on me
she's revolution in the making
on a table with a notepad and a pen  there must always be coffee too
compelled to be naughty
some words seem to come out of nowhere yet catch fire instantly
give is a strong word
the moon in the dark night sky looks like rebellion has broken out
unique among snowdrops
out of the tears comes forth love
the strength of His dominance  lies in the pleasure she earns
resolutely old school
honouring impossible demands
it started  with one hand  in another
possess me as many times as You want
bite marks like ruby beads around her neck
whisking kisses on the wind
He captures my heart   before I even feel it beating
when it felt like I was perching at the very edge of an abyss  that's exactly when I let go
she'd never meet halfway until she went the distance
being really helpless  feels so good
all my shame is spent
burn me
I love clothes You struggle to strip off me
claiming my right  by unbuttoning Your shirt
her words ooze innocence
she writes well about messed up things
true love is more tumultuous than first love
truths found in translation
sink Your smile into my flow of words
reduce me to traces  I deserve Your best
the kind of lust upon which leaps are made
His aura dominates the room
His cage holds a pearl
my corset needs a smooth fall
prettify my bare face
run Your tongue  over the smooth  and reflective glaze  on my pink lips
tastefully displaying  all my filthy moves
shake the wand  break the spell
under the sheets  I look the exact way  You want me to
You're far away and once again  I'm devoid of moments worth living
kill me  with repetitive movements  of Your index finger
You play beautifully
can't complain  for I am sufficiently  bruised up
fresh out of the shower  covered in desirable scratches
how can something be wrong when it feels so right?
it's Your hands that come to mind  when I feel a chill
the appeal of redefining life
look at me  with every intention of devouring
I've tasted the surreal
she's the most formidable nicotine junkie on the G&amp;T circuit
she's like a shooting star  that makes journeys through the night
the intensity of feeling  that comes from silently lying in Your arms
stay a little longer while I run more hot water in the bath
knelt and found  my deserved place
weigh me down by pleasures
two sides to every thought
addicted to the incense of a bookstore aisle
I breathed what I love
I found what feels good
the art of waking up
drawn to storytelling
eternal promises made by  words lovingly handwritten
under Your warmth I reveal every bit of myself
imagining being loved exclusively
been wondering how I ever got by without You
she will only show absolute vulnerability once in a lifetime  are you tough enough to withhold it?
I don't mind the french please keep talking
Your hand between my legs  and I'm full of firepower
All I want to do is close my eyes and think of You
Heaven and earth collided today  don't You think?
one night is too minimal for my thirst
I've lacked You long enough
I want to spend a night with Your soft side
keep a firm grip  on everything that's delicate about me
fuck me under a starry sky  as I kiss the ground we lie on
it's like He's heaven scent
thoughts of You light up my nights
move into my heart
rely on me for everything
light touch  so much pleasure
I yearn to feel  Your breath on my face
anti-barbie kind of girl
sex-screaming smile
look at me that way again and add some alcohol to my gin
words that sing of summer
remembering moments and savouring the feeling
bet that flogger of Yours is now oud scented
indulge me    with whisky    and loyalty
caress my psyche
pretend You didn't choke me  and do it all over again
wine makes me want to learn lessons
and I don't want to sleep
I wanted You so much  just once would've been enough
You and I  we're magic  and I love it
my dreams have a life
please take all that is rightfully Yours
what a lousy lover I'd be without You
dare You not to fall for me
she's not the kind one would want to share
there's happiness within me  like it found a home
I plant a kiss  and I say a wish  in that perfect place  between Your feet
I'm always wondering  if I'm doing as much as I can do for You
from casual conversation  to serious fun
a heart like a cocoon of loveliness
make me a collage of Your handwritten thoughts
His words  so delicate in essence  they wrap me in swaths of silk
Gosh the way He  constricts the jaw  and glares at me  with intent
this life of mine  simplify it for me
He always asks the right questions
battles of wits are priceless
it's not a competition but by all means beat me to the finish
You are filthy and so am I
like me for my uniqueness  love me for my flaws
You're a longing  I said
you're a constant He said
suspended fascination
I'd make my bed  if I didn't have to sleep in it alone
persuading You with poetry
let's talk about my weaknesses
not a pretty face until  it's surrounded by  a halo of cum drops
Your fingers  and my taste  inside my mouth
Your palms  full of my lip stains
never pity a devotee
our minds met today and it was lovely
myriad experiments
all I need  is to be finished off
she glows in His protective warmth
destruct with care
around You the pearly buttons on my blouse just fall apart
do I serve well for gazing?
not eye rolling  but definitely clashing
her femininity echoes preciousness
make me good enough for You
the pleasures of  feathers and chains
He demands sophistication
bruising kisses  throughout the afternoon
I can't be me  without You
being undressed is overrated
smooth ass  splashed with graffiti
all of me  is for Your  private pleasure
what my heart needs for protection  is a hard shell
love wounds  proudly worn
carve me into a rose
my fantasies  would lack an edge  without You
shouty eyes  full of eagerness  like a begging kitty
there is such power in His pull
I poured my soul in when You hugged me
"more than this, nothing"
fuck me with love
I'd spend all night  scorching my throat
too lonely in here  it makes me want to open the window
hunt &gt; kill
put the music on as I undress
right thing  at the wrong time  in the wrong place  because  why not
the delicious slow burn of anticipation
perhaps my mouth was destined to always run dry
explore me beyond Your hands and mouth
love me till You're short of places to mark
I discovered myself by accident
the necessity of devotion
hurt me with Your fire
one tequila shot away from meeting sleep
guilty of being thorough
feeling intense pleasurepain  using only my mind
infinite soft kisses
a kiss changes everything
a pout that deserves a drink
we could make each other  a whole lot noisier
impossibly ambitious  like a fox
I got dreams  under my pillow
take away all my gasps
bad words  make me  feel good
wearing Your favourite  underwear of me  and I feel great
warming to Your greed
there's nothing  more fulfilling than having You see who I am
if only I could lose this numbness I feel without You
ask for all or not at all
enjoy the contrast
becoming ever more  a part of You
it doesn't end  at tears
naked yet left without  You
harder the fuck more the mind clarity
"hunger pangs, of the soul"
wish I'd wake up  to a thumping You
tell me No adamantly
scavenge me
lay Your head on my stomach  as I lie back and meditate
my fragility  collapsed into  His arms
the night is wreaking havoc on my hormones
charmed by Your roughness
prolong my suffering already
"a heady cocktail, of both our secrets"
revelling in Your spoils
some loves are intensely rare
come back for more
stumbled upon a new beginning..
hold back time..
His words create a mood
leave my mouth with a hearty tonic
force me into subspace
old enough to remember..
I may not know much  but I know what I need and whom I love
I am gripped by the storm in You
fill my mouth with Your grunts
won't speak until squeezed
Your love for me is the only truth worth knowing
needing restorative hugs
get so close  they can't put a pin between our mouths
Wish I could feel  the warmth of Your chest on my back
His old school elegance  reignites my obsession with the glorious past
half living in another era
tonight could make me self destruct
lovely and liquid
hurt repeatedly  for I want more pleasure
I want nothing to change
each time is new and different
*breathes silent thank you*
*licks You off my lips*
means of escape irk me
for the rest of the world I remain unknown
struggling to be still long after dark
leave me scattered  along the edge
pristine pair of blue eyes  that undress me lewdly
glamour on the streets  greed in the sheets
dribble down my chin   and beautify my vulgarity
the shackles of uniqueness
like the small linen napkin You'd crush gently
let me rest on Your lap
how I miss the hum  of Your throaty roar
rush home for me
the night ends with a drink
every time we part why can't it be the last?
allow me fuel  if not feast
sinking my feet  into Your footprints  wishing You'd lingered a while
a darling face  lit by a sprinkling  of a love offering
fuck me so I won't have to walk home
intoxicated by weariness
seeing nothing I do nothing
the taste  of my exotic skin  is dangerously compelling
there's a photo of me  lying in His gun safe
yank the chain  hear me sigh
grab my neck between Your knees
to cocoon in Your fierceness
forever willing and brave
a sexy little kitten  needs You
why won't You hurt me enough?
the key to my collar dangles  from the leather strip around His wrist
she likes her relationships like her cigars spiced up and illicit
she's unpretentious but her hair rustles like black silk
welt is too tame a word
His cane grazed my bones
we're hyper-perfect for each other
He bites my lips like they're a scoop of strawberries
I could marry You for smelling so good
He can see past my angelic face
bless my mouth
forever being entranced
I long for the relief  of life's chance discoveries
wishing I was in a cafe with You talking about the new book You'd just published
contemporary in body  classic in spirit
I think we have the same defects
talking is one of her least favourite things
what's on Your must-do list?
maybe You find my mouth pretty  because of all the ungodly swearwords it holds
emotionally potent  spine tingling  life enriching  love
infusing sheets with  the delicate scent of longing
the appeal of longevity
I'd grace the corners of Your heart
the heavenly tension between perfection  and imperfection
strong as the last snowdrop of May that brings an end to a long winter
dying of self discipline
soft panties  swept aside  fiercely
the art of life is to appreciate all of the pleasures in one's daily routine
lighting church candles in the fireplace  and humming cabaret songs
"in a word, touch"
kisses  and nothing but  breathless kisses
a smile is the easiest way of saying I love you
keep the spanks coming
not tonight
subtweet me if it's easier
it gets easier  as it hurts more
fuck me hard  slow me down
no music  I want to hear You as I sway
Your scent is everywhere
dive beneath her beauty
just to share breathing space with You is a relationship fulfilling enough
ankle weights  to keep me grounded
mood: minimal
moving towards excess deja vu
shots of purposeful comfort seeking
so touchable  yet so alone
all I want is You and not just on my mind
perky and ready to be broken
feed my desires
He's a dream but I haven't just dreamed Him up
use that mouth to warm me up
no such thing as ugly
wrap that leather over my eyes
a body like a long neglected exhibition space
kiss me hard and take the edge off the pain
an epic ride that made me feel I was walking on water
when being thoroughly loved feels like you're cheating the Gods
left with a Sir hangover
patience is exhausting
power back into my mouth
such a relief not having to plan what to wear  because it's not for me to decide
the way He talks of it destruction seems aspirational
"He has a gift for posing questions as ""Who owns you?"""
assailed by thoughts of my own ruin
idle thoughts that get out of hand
slumbering memories barging uninvited
slide into the pages of my diary
take me to Your garden
she carries so much weight of expectation on her twinkle toes
linger if You see teardrops
turn off the lights  let me show You some art
anything but confined  within four walls
take me in Your arms  before the moon has fully risen
despite my body's aches  I want more
I do now
kiss me before I say hello
He has an eye for the unusual
contemplating leaping
time's slipping away  but not fast enough
His calm demeanour  rattles the butterflies inside me
His hand  knows the ropes and rakes more orgasms  than the fingers on it
all hot and flushed  in anticipation of Your taste
tears of gratitude can't be invisible
such a luxury to be Yours
my submission  is not a philosophy  or a psychology  it's my reality
Your words give me the feel I crave
left me untidy in the best sort of way
Your fingers  intertwined at my nape  and my face  bundled into Your lap
beautiful hollow  steeped in perversity
He tests my devotion  to unbelievable depths
change the pace  of the nights we share
it was almost impossible for me to spot my beauty on my own
Your lips  on my pulse
violent screams  elegantly muted
I am ready to burn for this love And You?
"she: 'I'm scarred.' He: ""Not unattractively."""
I sing the blues under a hot shower  and fine tune my most seductive moan
I can't growl but I'm just as hungry
You are a soul closer to me  than my own flesh
"she fits most definitions of ""certain women"""
maturity over perfection
no longer out of control  and it feels like I've ceased to exist
You can call me by any name  any time You want
post submission yoga stretches
the bed looks like enemies shared it
the very first thing He strips off  is my innocence
I love who I become when I'm with You
let Your fire shine on my face
the deep pleasure  of being warmed  by Your mouth
I tingle with pleasure  every time I flex my neck  and feel the bequest  of Your teeth
I can never tell  if it's tender loving  or raging assault  that will follow  once we spoon
does it cause a twitch in Your pants when You pull and twist the taut silk knot on Your cuff?
this ache  that's tearing me steadily  is so lovely
the charm of my dark thoughts about You lingers in the midnight air
He spanks me fiercely  before I sober up from an orgasm
pouting away  beneath Your palm
"""Strip."""
Your heart is my dream den
stay with me for a lifetime
magical realism
we both smile
the reflection in the mirror doesn't confront me anymore
the inside of my duvet smells like sauna
any contact with You is uplifting
hold me to the countdown
arches and erections
loosen the hinges of my mind
jellied thighs beneath a stinging mouth
smile because of how hard I tried
choked then dozed
eventually I subside
completely soaked yet screaming  for more
yank all the sanity out from underneath my feet
am I crumbling  or barely moving at all?
I see unlimited wildness in You
He makes me feel like a warrior  when I become tearful
He entertains  no compromises
addicted to thoughts of You
how is it that I'm always underprepared?
there's so much warmth under the leather tongue of Your crop
it's so tricky to look You in the eye  and not lose some dignity and poise
the art of living in a shell
it's a gun with a silk glove  until He chokes me with it
the gentle art of  being laden in black  yet looking innocent
inspired by a spinning top
00:00
You own me  but I need reminding
her silences are worth pausing over
just thinking about You inspires arousal
her eyes weave a web of stories
adore animals  but marry wisely
creamy pearls all over my face  like chandeliers dropping from the sky
she's unexploited art
once under a warm duvet my fingers behave out of character
carve with Your hands  polish with Your mouth
wearing the smile You put on me  and I've turned into an eye catcher
our love is gravity defying
dreamily decorated  with bite marks
give me life already
His veins are brimming  with very indulgent poems
appreciate the possibilities
perhaps it was in the stars  that we would become a couple
humbleness-obsessed
our eyes meet  and I'm at once  cosy
"one bite too few, Beloved"
I must be the keenest of suckers You ever met right?
fuck red roses and candlelit dinners  I love the feel and smell of the parking garage
*licks the spit of ash from Your cigarette*
wrap me in the warm blanket of Your arms and let's together enjoy the striptease of clouds
too unruly for Dom Perignon
they are more prayers than moans
while it's still hot from Your cum
dip Your toes into my mouth
yet You give me more each day
this contentment will last a lifetime
my breathing feels unnatural  and I'm more than ready  to lose myself
His tongue dipped in honey and my body strewn with waves
snuggling down to meet Your feet
at the end of a long private road  is where life begins
the sheer serendipity of You looking my way and my dreams that came true
I want tough love with just a breath of tenderness
"""I fucking love you.""  'I love You Sir.'"
the satisfying stillness  of mouth on mouth
You make me want to live better  and not worry how long for
You perfected my callow fantasies
You keep my belly butterflies in springing form
I can sense how well You understand me
soon
sex so good I look as though I've slept for days
bite my lips  as You cradle my face
let Your fingers probe  till I feel more nimble
there are moments of pain  but she smiles through them
with Your tie pin
autograph my inner wrists
and so to bed..
it all begins with fate
ceaselessly needing You...
I could kneel  a lot longer
smoke-tinged kisses that leave her burning for more
some words trigger a taste
ones that make Your eyes twinkle  and heart race  those are the things I want to discover
my tears are pros at hiding
try to restrain Yourself  or not
let our lips touch  under a summer moon
unbalance this fragility  once and for all
she's no man's burden
she lives by instinct
intentions of sex
crawling to You in dance floor heels
she's a disaster for being played around by less skilled hands
the most interesting places are accessed via dirt roads
I've been up all night  to see You awaken at dawn
hold me firmer than the night is dark
sins lie in wait  in the corners  of Your mouth and smile at me  through Your beard
I want my life to look like You
why on earth are we in different cities?
every time You leave  the rain pours down on me as if to recreate Your touch
You always make me dream
nothing will lift my spirits as much as a heavenly mouthful of You
alas  sips of wine  aren't kisses
tell me all that will happen in the real world
crush me  just for fun
You make me feel like too much of a goddess
sway  and then  slay me
ever think about someone so hard you forget to cry while peeling onions?
innocent doubts
her needs remain the same  the proportions constantly change
this sense of eternal hypnosis is part of the adventure
come closer  it's time  and I'm ready
I could undo the knot in Your tie using my tongue
longing for a summer like this
I like the exposure and I cannot lie
I dared to lose complete control
You found parts of me  that were still surviving
expect more
depravity compels me  to crease the sumptuous bedlinen without You
the lace trim on my panties matches the colour of His lips
He allows me more with a grin
You always said I'd learn to love myself and now I do
the kind of romance that lacks nothing  fucking that
there's just nothing imperfect about You
I'd sit at the foot of Your bed so You see me every morning  and begin the day on adrenaline
I'd cream Your shoes   between my legs  then brush and polish them  using my stockings
what she lacks in intuition  she makes up for in belief
I know You're missing me  why else would I feel tingles of pleasure?
one life  a thousand chances and more to get it right
if only I could murder loneliness
He didn't mean to hurt  It didn't hurt  I screamed anyway
high on heels  low on morals
wish I had bigger hands  I could do crazier things
be warned  I got chaos on my mind
stared at the sun  survived and smiled
overwhelm me to death
there are endless fantasies I'm yet to live
the more You break me the more I'm set free
be generous  when saying You love me say it again  say it often
guide my willing mouth to the unlikeliest spots
I feel content
rebellious as the rain that batters the tin roof
what did You feel for me before You loved me?
why do You let me rest so much?
a part of every woman  however small  is a sinner
I'd do anything for You in a heartbeat  and blindly
look how my bared heart sways  to Your rhythmic words
poor little girl poorly understood
He's the wild equivalent  of a feather plucker in a slaughterhouse
living on allowance
the priceless sensation  of sizzling from our first kiss
my pangs of necessity have increased
I am rarely more contented than when tasting You
drips of hot wax and a calmness unchanged
imploring with permission  at Your doorstep take me a step further
is it ever too early to start thinking dirty?
when I write  it's as if  Your inner beast  dwells inside me
teach me everything I've forgotten since I fell for You
I've loved connecting with You how about we touch now?
wish You'd kill me now I mean fuck me now
"""All these things happen in one second and last for ever."" - Virginia Woolf"
one day  when Gods favour us You will cast  Your dynamite hands  upon me
satisfying You before our coffee is served
damp from my bubble bath
Your prey  Beloved  is wild
You make me want to heal
use Your tongue  to aggravate my screams
gift me a tree on my birthday
show me Your love but not too softly
Pour all of Yourself into my universe
such is the joy of living
some days she thinks with an irrational heart  and on others she searches for a meaning in everything
there's a need to be intimately subdued rooted in her defiance
our love is uniquely intense and remarkably deep
such tactile softness.. who needs words?
pretty little girl  wrapped in oversized joy
how well I remember our first time..
begin to tear me apart  slowly
when every suffering bone  groans with gratification
the taste of impact lingers..
she's a sensation seeking daredevil
reduce my focus
fell in love and forgot everything normal
life doesn't feel so painful  when my body takes in Your rhythm
retrace my steps along the track  till the forest closes around us
fancy touching the void?
I fear gravity not heights
be my fate
"speaking of stunning brick walls shimmering in the sunlight, I miss You"
You're the reason my fantasies thrive
cracking
burning
aching
ebbing at sunrise
hit me with the magic bullet that's Your stare
orgasmed to meditative levels
I can always smell You in the air on an early morning walk
unspoken arguments
tiptoeing barefoot around ruins
You're on a loop in my mind
there is nowhere  I would draw the line
an urge to sin  is showing in Your mood
reduce the glint in my eyes to tears
a plump cigarette dangles loosely  from her wanton mouth
never knew I had need of such sweet pain  until I got it
I'm always looking out for You
pervasive influence
my soul is shrinking from wanting You
eager seeker  of eternal love
"my lust is infectious, Beloved"
can't seem to work out what makes me so valuable to You
so many new thoughts  that You need to read
give me a smile  and keep the summer going
He's much more than very dependable
turn Your mind  to my bed
my heart is in full song
I thrive on the level of openness  I have with You
the delusion of being in control..
I expose myself in the choices I make
You have the power to change my day
if You know what I'm thinking  keep it to Yourself
every woman in the world wishes to be loved like I am
the devil is so seductive
I'm good at more things  just give me a chance
I love instinctively
sometimes I like not knowing what He's thinking
let's provoke each other
there is so much comfort  in the infinite moments of weakness  I feel around You
my dream kiss has already happened
bittersweet  but mostly sweet
"""It's only words — unless they're true"""
You're on top of the mountain of sophistication
history is repeating itself  I'm needing You all over again
so near yet so far away...
sometimes I bump into invisible walls
I'm a blank canvas
whisper-thin pleas of mercy  dripping from my mouth
let's start by You making me melt
a girl with a heart  soft as backbone
I'm ill in bed  ill mannered
You seem to be in a burying mood
peek and be addicted
a heart like an advent calendar  whose windows have been opened all at once
make me Your personal passion
You've turned me into a nostalgia enthusiast
force me back into comfort
care to chew some brown petals?
You feel right
fill my empty coffee cup with golden rum
leave me looking happy
been a while since You kissed me tipsy
I struggle to breathe  never to cope
I'm so much happier on days I dress up for You
been sleeping on the wrong side of bed for years
kill me once I have all Your love in me
Love. that's what everyone calls this feeling that I can't put into words
I put the kettle on  and invariably wait for the postman to bring Your letter
lock me inside the walls  that surround You
disgrace me behind every  heavy red curtain in town
You are lifeblood now
she savours dark wine  with the sturdy elegance of a whisky lover
focus on my mouth
bind tight
Your silky aftertaste  on my tongue  goes on and on
may Your shadow always linger around me
every day with You is a day of firsts
echoes of Your footsteps roar in every hushed corner of my room and I never feel alone
she likes her men like her crisp new bedsheet stiff to the touch and softening with use
blushed so hard  my eyes got teary
when you lose the irreplaceable...
come lay on my skin I want the feel of Your valor
invisible crossroads
I face the fear  because You say it won't hurt
how much of You do I deserve?
the only thing that separates us  is experience
my mind just cannot abide  being idle
caring isn't difficult  once you're familiar with her needs
divine as the sunset
perfect as a rose
talking of dirty...  come shake some dirt off
*stubs cigarette inside a tulip bulb*
take the edge off the muse
"favourited, because prejudiced"
not afraid  to be daring  but only to  speak the truth
sipping gin and tonic  while cooking with four different cheeses
wish the night would die down..
my biggest fear is You thinking I'm weak
thought I had a soft voice  never knew I could scream so loudly
my high self esteem tells the world  a great deal about You
supper's at the pizzeria
our love  is beyond comparison  just like Your marks that are such a difficult shade of red
I drink slowly...  a habit of mine
stroke my fanny  as I hang upside down
she licks His sweat because it embodies love
You're all the sunny days  in the life of a woman
dominate  my attention
capture me  in Your words
please know  what You find beautiful  can't be improved upon
it's very easy to love Him but so hard to beat
I want to smell the deeply relieving air  around leafless trees
hand tied hair
dead leaf skin
meadow brown eyes
they feed on nectar to fly not to grow
butterflies do not make a home
petals and stalks
catch all my unwary thoughts
how quickly You take me from being elegant to edgy
kissing Him goodbye  is like savouring the last day of summer
it's tongue burning warm between my legs
I want to light Your world on fire
the power of Your love saved me from myself
tuck in here
lick my wounds first
If you're innocent  there's nothing here to like
come discover my love for You
I wonder if everyone who writes such overwhelmingly penetrating and unreserved poetry also loves the same way
I'm talkative not poetic
never mind birthday or anniversary  but You ought to remember when my period is due  when planning a surprise getaway
But  I am looking for You  and lost without You
not everyone on Twitter is lost  or looking for something
is this life or heaven  because it's perfect
tell me about  the dangers of decency
inhale and consume
don't withdraw  if You're so inclined
the deafening blows of His belt on my flesh is what hunger sounds like
choke me and thaw me out
love doesn't wait for the heart to forgive first
cane until the spell is broken
dip and slide  noisily
this unfathomable eagerness  to obey You
they ask me to describe You and I get breathless
with His way of thinking  there are always possibilities
simplicity isn't my only weapon
I'd make You break old habits
spend more time with me.. maybe even a summer
sex as a replacement for cigarettes
I'm hurting  without You
I was born  the day I lay  beneath You
penned such sensational fantasies  no wonder I got a paper cut
the way You look at me  makes me want to risk everything
my imperfections  are far from noticeable
love me if only for the color of my skin
tell me something only You know about Yourself
imagination over possibility
no more yearning my heart.. enough of it exists
Your feet are just what my soft palms deserve
summon my flesh and blood for Your every carnal want
dedicated to thrill
I seek more than pleasure
He hides a softer heart inside
responsible rebellion
how expertly You grip my weakness and remind me of my vulnerability
ever wonder what a diamond smells like?
Your words trigger a strong physical reaction that links us across miles don't You think?
why do You bite so much?
does Your pillow remember my cheek?
I'd strip faster than You can rip
destroy me at Your own pace I'm in no rush
peck or kick I like both
I won't share secrets come closer and find Your own
punish the rioter in me and make it obey
outrun my mind
in Your arms I learned to love
"aim lower, Beloved"
the knots You tied in the pit of my stomach have come free
He whispers in my ear and my toes curl
my spirit deserves Your shadow
come back to never leave again
fill me or kill me
all or nothing
tortured  oh so sweetly  by dichotomies
Your love gives me  a halo of shimmer
I hear no more echoes
if only I could  fold the smell of Your cum into incense
scraped my own flesh  and the scent of woods ran through me
tweak both these buds on my chest until they taste of purple grapes
wrists bound and held over my head  as if balanced on a pyramid of electric blue streaks
my sultry skin  wrapped in Your musk
beads of my essence  all over Your mouth
her simplicity challenges Him
either He's a mind reader  or my fantasies are pervasive
unless you're lucky to leave together
stand up  as she leaves  the dinner table
You creep up I'll trickle down
she had a heart studded with skyscrapers  yet He hiked onto the top and reigned over it
seducing You effortlessly  with my small-town politeness
His eyes  are heinous His touch  reassuringly human
I see signs
she's a spotlight stealer
"Twitter says ""does not exist"" but Your presence is all over my timeline I feel You in almost every verse"
all anything takes is getting dirty
You'll need to kiss me longer to shut me up
everybody's running even the ones who are chasing
tell me exactly what it is You're looking for in me (don't say flaws)
all You have to do is ruin me like I always hoped You would
let's live differently
every woman wants a romantic brute
every man needs a whore
passionately reeling  from the fire in Your hands
I want love  but only the dependable kind
a personal library  an oversized chair  and endless scrawls  on each other's skin
not the eyes  or even the body  but if  you've seen her spirit  you're done for
when pain becomes the drug..
not many women can match  the determination of His submissive
His first lesson for me was about how to love life  every lesson after that has been about living on the edge
love is one of life's understudies
I caught  Your darkness  so very naturally
mark me well
may I always be  in Your thoughts
I hope I look how I feel
You're so much more important  than my chastity
the controlled madness  that is my thirsty soul
I'll commit sins they wouldn't have a punishment for
I love too much
getting what you want versus  loving what you get  versus best of both worlds
what would I do  if I couldn't have You
think about me hard  and feel me melt into You
"tower over me, Beloved"
it's great to see that most of my feelings mean something here
I imagine Your teeth  tugging at my earlobes  I shiver and smile
He tempts me to sin then forgives me for it
just  say No loudly
I used to talk to the moon It talks back now
I'm the last of Your kind
blew You a kiss  has it reached yet?
I have this whole other life  and I can hear soulful music playing in it
Been immortalised on paper. Watch me age gracefully.
can You smell the scent from my hair that strayed into the wind?
beyond You I see nothing
mood: slouching around in pyjamas licking sticky toffee off the teaspoon before using it to make myself some  gunpowder green tea
I like the struggles I've been surviving
all but undone
woke up with the birds
she treats objects like humans
You live in the dead of my heart
most of the night...  they'd just rest a few minutes
maybe You're the wind playing with my hair
You underestimate my gratitude
I've tasted life and I want more
seducing You with silky hips  and a smoky voice
Sadistic twist   Not a metaphor
I'm loving being precious
stud marks on Your chest  from the spikes on my collar
withering or winsome?
I'm warming  to Your volcanic passion
no such thing  as too many orgasms
they'd write about our love story  and put it in a museum
thoughts of You keep me up at night
devotion  ahead of everything else even conscience
this scar is no secret  it's a symbol  of having survived suffering
I earned the right  to serve
wear my sultriness  as a glove
You're so lucky to have You
He plays this gentleman's game.. where He touches a spot very calmly and I squirm in spasms like rum on fire
I was just hoping You would  rip everything that looks good on me
He nearly burned me with my dress on
counting on my powers of persuasion
He throws me on the bed  and suddenly I'm okay
I often suspect the clock stops turning
the little deaths  before I see You again
it takes nerve to concur with Him
He loves everything I care about
and You know  how to control it
You  give me power
she's tougher than He thought
the devilish wind is beautifully ravaging the winter jasmine
get me out of this brightness
how bad do You want to hurt me?
the slut You know is better than the Angel they all think I am
when every kiss leaves its mark
living so much in the moment  I've become less concerned about the future
the zip on Your trousers goes down and I go down with it
He understands me whole
give a heart to my simple words
a heart that lives to offer You love
I kissed a tree in memory of You
makes me smile to think how easily Your phone dictionary recognises me
caress me until it really hurts
make a mess of all my virtues
shower me  with Your naked  merciless force
melt on my tongue  ruin me for any other narcotic
a mere nibble  and I'm done for
"added a ""x"" after a ""?"" because, manipulative"
low neckline  high hopes
reward my endurance
Your fucktoy Your games
it's way too easy to make me cry  no one but You know that
half lover  half illicit lover
are we there yet?
calm me down like a bandit would
a mindfuck stretched my fantasies
yet another lonely night is looming and I can feel the wanderlust start to consume me
I'd rather have my heart broken  than break Yours
even when You left  love lingered
make it hurt  once more
evolving organically
summoned to inflame
as intimate as You writing for me
Your eyes reflect me to perfection
lift me out of my reality  and lay me into ours
bite my bubble of fabulousness
revelling in anticipation
the most intimate thing I do in His absence  is to sleep with nothing but His collar around my neck and I feel Him around all night long
"get friendly, not curious"
You are the splendour in my vulgar words
"mature, absolute, unselfish and thrilling love"
sexy beard  that bites just a little
the more promises You make  the more precious  and fragile  our love becomes
"if she's not your weakness, is it even love?"
everything about her was spot on except the place she called home
You made my dreams  worthy of life
my love will never let You go
being insanely in love  is my new normal
my soul may have completely healed
I like the way I look because He calls me sexy
I won't let the night kill me
smell my skin  and witness the beginning of a torrent
she turns into a diamond once in bed
my cleavage needs ice
this shouty cunt  give it a tap
spike my drink  You know how
You made me the weapon I am
kneeling with heels on
"from a seductress  to a little girl  whirling in a joy circle  screaming  ""fucking unbelievable!"""
hence deserving
deserving yet humble
this day serves as a milestone  and for that I love You!
slice me off  right between my legs
spank me for trying  to read Your mind
You ought to cover my skin up in Your marks
"if you're loved by the One you love, then you have the beauty no one can match"
we are what they call forever
You taste extraordinary
touch me but remember  easy is never an option
there's an intelligence behind her lack of obviousness
the loveliest truth of all is that I will be a little girl for the rest of my life
You're too far  the thought makes me starve
the intimacy of learning about each other
I choked on Him and all the pain of separation died
maybe I *want* to forget my limits
kiss back hard
You're invited in
I excite Him
heads brunettes win tails blondes lose
I don't care about redemption
give me the ache I deserve
loud ones with bad mouths  quiet ones with bad vibes   blocked
been in the right place  done the right thing
I love how much You enjoy me
"""There is something insane about a lack of doubt. Doubt, is what makes you human."" - Tilda Swinton"
I'm all tongue tied up
pick my battles for me then make me fight them
when He allows me the illusion of free will
I'm here Your move
when You think about me which part of me do Your hands feel?
take everything You love about me
I love You as a person  I crave You as an animal
most of my life's happiness comes from being Yours
it's as if my soul is intrinsically connected with Your savagery
some words here are from letters I never sent
paint me another dream
"what does ""being owned"" mean? remind me"
play with me and make Your own accessory
forsake Your right to desert me
I got drunk because I missed You I shall stay drunk until You're not far away anymore
I accept the pause
she rebels by urging Him  to teach more lessons
hold me in Your heart like it were a dungeon
arousal isn't just sexual
metaphorically
slept my way into Eden
survived the streets  got crushed in the sheets
thought I had nothing left to show  yet He's constantly discovering new parts of me
"if there's any way you can live without it, is it even love?"
go dark on me
my heart is beating for You
to die and come back as Your writing
raw not raunchy
how ingeniously You make me see good in everything that happens to me
outrageous me dangerous You
fire as a friend
You are proof that dreaming the impossible is never a bad idea
I like how You see the world
Your words make me dream
imagine never being out of my mouth
I'm Yours to the bone
ever studied a storm?
I want to watch You sweat  as You love me
current mood
I'd gather for You spring water from mountains
she looks like an overdose
gnaw away at all my reservations
keep me for good luck
being numb helps
even just a few hundred kisses will do
You  are mine
the disorderly waves in my hair  miss dragging the roughness from Your hand
poetry over music
kneeling on the cushion of Your memory
I miss You and it feels like my soul is coming undone
shove me across  the bathroom floor  again
whisper in my ear  Your best roar
knees aching thighs shaking  stomach flipping  as I brace my soul  for impact
I am in awe  of Your strength
fuck me and relieve all the exertion  from twisting my throat
knees scraping to kneel
He looks sexiest when unimpressed
if I'm smug and You can feel it grab my hair
my trembling world needs Your perfectly steady hold on it
she lights a candle to keep track of time  then puts on her thinking cap
dedicated to the deep end
found my focus after a walloping
when He allows my mind an escape
beautiful precisely because she's flawed
I'd stretch the horizon for You
no matter what time You go to bed take me along
happy in the anticipation
make her feel she's more important than something for use
there is magic to being present in the moment
let things go
what a thing is sixth sense...
some loves take you on a spiritual journey
to sum up all my emotions... I love You
"explain ""maybe"""
I'm not done lusting
every morning I wake up and fall in love
no such thing as humble hunger
balls solid as paperweights  this may not be a metaphor
the beauty of pursuit
I was never quite this grateful to be alive
I want You in all Your intensities
smother my lips with liquid silver
inexpert fingertips playing with that which belongs to Him
I miss the raw feel of our tongues chiming
when He allows my eyes  to have their say
shun all etiquette tonight
I crave that rapture
lull me into the safe haven of Your arms
getting to grips with Your absence
suck the colour from my skin
the night is drawing in why don't You?
cosy up with pillow talk
too civilised to party
the fire in her belly  is courtesy of the east
promiscuous on the dancefloor
lead me into the wild my Beastie
sometimes  just the way she does her hair will express her deepest fantasies
transparent enough to tease
He left no footprints... I'll go search anyway
Your words made it easy to find my way in the dark
the hushed beauty of stargazing together
spit like grains of paradise  planted between my thighs
He's the answer to a ruptured heart's prayer
wish You were here
shamelessly untouched
"go easy on the senses, my soul pleads"
I want to drink in Your genius
this boldness is inspired by the sunset
she's a Sadist's dream
I want to smell like a blossom that spent most of its life inside a book You wrote
luscious soft petals  polished until heady
I've been looking for You on my skin
I grow  in Your hands from sultry  to innocent
dark depths in which she raises hell
His growl has the power to soothe me
I smile now when I catch my reflection in the mirror  it's the power of Your love for me that made this possible
don't change on me...
she sparked the heart  that changed her world
two pairs of legs  braided in riotous knots creating beguiling shadows in bed
if you feel it the words will speak
on the brink of burnout  yet desperately waiting for sunrise
anticipative as the newest star in the night sky
through the alleyway and beyond
she rebels because it's downright fun
peculiarly perverse
don't mess with her  even if she looks like Cinderella
could it be that You want me forever?
reserve us a corner at the bar  never mind the cocktails
sensibly overbearing
a glint nestles in her dark brown eyes and He knows she has begun to dream again
"indulge my yearnings, Beloved"
metaphor of the day
serving You means the world  I've never worked harder on anything in my life
say it from the rooftops if you must
declare that love already
I don't smoke  but love being around people who do
You made a reality  out of my imagination
there was a time when I thought I was in love but really I was just pushing it
He says I make Him smile  I tell Him I find all my happiness in Him
invisible yet all-consuming
so thankful I don't have to explain why I favourite the words I do
I met You and fell in love with life
will you remember me tomorrow  or am I just a flimsy overnight roomie?
so many hearts floating out here  some conquerable  others insanely vulnerable
I could easily live  in this wreckage You've left me in
just the thought melts me
I'd even fucking knit for You if I knew how to
why mute  just unfollow   why BLOCK just unfollow
come to me rough and ready
her shadow refused to follow her
such fulfilling life  matched by a death that engulfed her heart in misfortunes
"fate, don't you dare interrupt  this relationship"
isn't she beautiful  in those massive lovebruises?
her instincts are very strong  but she continues to disregard them because she is very stubborn  and in love
"woke up in the middle of the night  feeling the need to clothe  fuck your metaphorical signs, universe  I don't get them"
read me all day read to me at night
my soul isn't vulnerable  because my trust in You  is far too strong to just break
I read Your words  I smile  I tilt my neck  I leer I feel a slow burn I smile some more
You're less than a thousand hours away from me
my wounds have been around for so long  You could put them on a mantelpiece
missed You  till I was out of my mind then I fell asleep
want me for my soul
sometimes the universe is mean for no reason
sentimental slut
before He sleeps...
we're a rare miracle
telling smiles are the best
I can only hope my anxieties  make me endearing
can't help but write open my heart
tell me what You want don't withhold details
I can feel Your heat
start if You promise to never finish
locked to Your words
when tears are a welcome relief
piercing glare  savage growl carnal touch feral hunger  He's an animal
I'm a dreamboat  kiss me like a sailor
she's her own enemy  when she's in need
my little mouth  around Your big toe
He's a fascinating Man who can speak for hours  without using a cliche
once you've found everything  where else do you go?
I don't get disciplined enough
looks do kill  heels are powerful
I don't miss being fearful
I have an obsession  with getting possessed
I want so desperately  to live the stories You tell
life's odd without You
fuck me till You find the love You were always looking for
some of my fantasies are an indulgence too far
sweet smelling hair just never loses its allure
no lady's dangerous if you know how to handle her
I miss Your heart on my tweets
this love of ours may last longer than You expected
censor my shyness
the fine art of obeying
such debauchery!
"step back in time a little, Beloved let's journey through a world without end"
there is no language of smell and so I devour You in silence
let me be Yours for an extraordinary one-off night
oh this lust for a punishing squeeze
I dreamed up interesting new words last night and want to tell You all about it
I breathe an unglamorous sigh of relief when You tell me how valuable I am
You are good for all that ails me
I need a treat spoil me
leaving it to chance...
she leaves His bedspread a striking hue of blush
I won't ask for anything I don't deserve
on a scale of one to ten...  about a ten
my and my larger than life illusions are best friends
sipping coffee with thick cream  while all the time admiring  the colour of passion and power
sometimes I like to be right
nothing is simple for a mistress
my fishnet tights  may take Your hands prisoner
wish You'd stop slipping away...
Blissfully
severely missing being kissed...
A log fire  a glass of wine and my bareness clothed in moonshine await You
I want to suck Your toes
the delicious concoction  of Your skin and mine
it soothes me to see  how eager You are  to love me
sated  up to my forehead
lying in bed together  naked and replete  seems like another world
Your unsaid words take me on a journey of hope
can't sleep unless she  surrenders all her needs  to His cravings
the dichotomy between yearning and breathing
He has a joy for life unlike any man I've ever met
when you read a book to the end  and don't close it.. that's love
play with me
He loves me like I'm God's gift
He calls my name better than I've ever heard before
hair like wreaths of fire  pull at Your own risk
edgy  with all her clothes on
If You want I could keep an eye on the precious cargo  inside Your pants
stunning like algae
perhaps I should handwrite to You all of my thoughts that will never feature here
she wears no make up and hopes He will love the bare-faced real deal
she is thorny once unfurled
force Yourself on my senses
desiring sexual time travel to that first time we met
humbled to the point of tears as if He pinned stars on my lap
read Your destiny in my palms
she's a late-night bloomer
I'm a different kind of naive
You are the sexiest man in the world
I'm a sex slave and it's exhausting
why would I want to overcome my addictions?
You can't look in those eyes and see that smile and not smile yourself
finishing touch...  I like the way that sounds
I love older music
a lot of her hides behind  the infinite shades of decency
I just want You to be satisfied all the time  and proud of me
dying to do more
stillness... silence...  and thoughts of You
immersed in white  she's a bird of paradise
He smells better than a bouquet of cigarettes
I lost myself in His storytelling
I know I want this forever
heaven or hell  is whatever you're thinking  in that moment
perhaps heartbreak is the eternity everyone talks about
It's comforting to believe that all I'll remember before I die is the way I was loved
who would You do for a good night's sleep?
I don't ask for a vow  just reassurance
I desire contentment
even His smile is an expression  of His hunger
I can always win a mental battle
the memory of Your soft lips resides in the fine contours on my face
in His arms  is where life's possibilities lie
my insolent heart wants to keep blooming
I am soused to my soul with Your love forgive me if some of it oozes out when I extend my little hands for more
take away all my unspent breaths
love me tougher
flutter my wings so I go like the wind but pull me in tighter because home is best
I can feel the presence of Your body  and the warmth of Your hands  I want this thought to last because this is happiness
He loves me  because He remembers  how I was  before I got scarred
the wrinkles on Your throat hold sway over me
tell me You admire the woman more than the feral monster in me
amorous encounters
tea for two  You for me
this unrelieved lust is a sign of my love too
this tyrannous bitch of a life reminds me every day how I need to live it to the fullest
planting new memories  along the comeback trail
His presence is but an ephemeral blessing  yet I live each day making strides on our journey
I've got a back that has His initial on it
If I get butterflies it's something I'll fight for
souls know no age
never stop saving me
keep all of me for Yourself
not all women are super  just so you know
unmask more of my smokiness
strike me before I scream again
I have fears and for that very reason He puts me to test
the best thing about being around Him is that I don't have to try and be a grown up
the bruises are fading and I'm cold again
miles apart  we're both wearing subliminal sensations to bed
remember me when You need someone  to see the sunset with
what You see is not the best  and not the only  I could offer
never alone  yet always on her own
I don't see the impossible anymore
I'd start over a million times  just to live again our very first moments together
transitioning into deprivation
weaving too intricate a web and will spread it over You like a shadow
life's less scary at night
stretch over me like dusk
smear me with Your fingerprints
see me through my words
He looked at me once and I could never escape
all my fears  consumed by His fury
I'd blindly follow Your instincts
I miss about You the simple things  like Your smell  and the vital things  like Your flesh
His ravenous hunger  to conquer every inch of my soul
I'll be on call  throughout the night
it's not comfort food unless  the red velvet cupcakes  look like eyes popping out at you
not just wounds  they're works of art
she would wear a rosary around her left ankle  she was a girl with slipping hopes
she somersaults along the ground  amid fragments of broken bones  but her smile is beautiful
what You see at Your feet is who I am
she's a discreet darling  but her darkness is eye-catching
I want the unholy before all else
salty girl
cunt like a trumpet
beauty that persists into winter
she is  a bundle of nerves  in His hands  some arch  while others  shoot upwards
surprised myself for being unafraid to weep
"as meaningful as it's hollow, this Twitter"
I believe every thought You're yet to word
did you know  falling in love  doesn't break bones
slap my face for being so invincible
"""Good girl.""  'not great then?'"
hungover on reminiscences
her body butter smells of bitter almonds
I heard growls brewing  when He cocooned me in His arms
some wintry nights she would put out the candle  and bury the hot wick in the melting wax
pleas written in tears  on the wall
undress and stir  embers of the fire  between my legs
nights of roughing it in an empty bed and choosing to sleep under the stars instead
I'm starting to look like something from Your imagination
all her limits are preposterous
bet I'm still underexposed  to Your darkness
I was Yours in a blink
too much intemperance  in her tasty nipples
she only smiles if she means it yet her eyes make her look sad
never let things go wrong  that's all I ask
she belongs to the One who fought hardest for a lost cause
I ought to grow old remembering every moment we shared together
I'm unable to think or speak but I'm free to succumb  and serve
"there are do's and dont's    but there's also looking out for me, always"
it's no coincidence there's awful in lawful
excuse my morality
"oh, voice from the past!"
alas  some teeming depths  have never been plumbed
let me hide behind Your ribcage
Your love  made me lovable
let's pull off a one nighter  in Your shiny black car
disregard  the dirt over me and get at me  in Your own wild way
her hair is not the only thing dark about her
sending miles of smiles Your way
sex through emotionality and then spirituality
I want to permeate Your intentions
"'I love Your smell', I say, as we lie together  ""What do I smell like?"", He smiles with eyes lightly shut  'Unconventional happiness', I say"
let's love like nobody knows how it's done
feel me splashed out all over Your mind
feel how I am Your meditation
"the thought of relying on myself is petrifying also, I love You"
won't wake up until I hear Your voice
the best part about love is.. it's a dream come true
erotic as blood and fangs
sparkling cider kind of girl
insomnia by provocation
damp to wet arousal to insistence
aren't we just so lucky to be in love?
teethmarks as love charms
I'm not a whore tonight  just a dainty peach blossom
those intimate moments  when Your words put me to bed
not once a day  but many times a day and all night long
what if feelings were never meant to be dissected
guard my vulnerable soul  with assertive masculinity
follow Your heart while I watch it lead You to me
let's become one  so nobody could tell us apart
"when it's mid-February, and it's bitterly cold outside, I am really glad that I can keep warm thinking about us"
the love drug makes her delusional
You're not here but I can sense You thinking about me
"These are extraordinary, @lovelimzy"
I'll pin Your tweet to my profile  since those words are written for me
sat in the corner of the bar  hoping to catch Your eye so I can pat the empty seat at my side in invitation
never knew I was so full of shortcomings on the manners front
soft lips that want to be caught in the rawness  of tobacco scented kisses
the thrill of being swept away into Your mind
fold into Your tongue  every dripping drizzle of honey
I can taste the mood You're in
Your embrace becomes my escape
suffocate me with threats  so I may live every moment
look how the rain robs a flower of its perfume and yet makes it blossom; our love is just like that
velvet petals clamped and crushed  till they're a perfect shade of cherry and then He sips springtime
cosmic kink amid all the loving
we're both all about falling in love
I want to collect all the things You love
strip and tease  if You please
my devotion far outweighs my lust
the undeniable beauty of exposure
I'm fully clothed  until our eyes meet
near-collision kisses  thwarted by a goodbye
I want to bathe in You
very deviant girl  but He loves her
living without You is an illusion
she's got to beg  and plead  and try her best  to get the best  of Him
freckles on His chest  like mounds of gold
You may take everything  but You'll get no resistance
unanimous gasps and growls
humbled by love  she is perfected  like a bed of sand  framed in seashells
He pours His essence down on me  and my sense of place is complete
she's an admirer of everything unique
teardrops too delicate for mercy
miss me when You watch smoke from a cigarette elegantly curl up and tortuously faint
in the afterglow of Your touch my skin vibrates with heat for hours
thoughts of being within  striking distance from You
thirsty for enlightenment
nothing matches that special feeling when I wear my collar and see myself for who I am
"yes it stings, marks and hurts but it's more hurtful when it ends"
He counts on me I count for Him it's a great dynamic
let's hide until dark
Your lust is a foreteller of love
suffocated by Your absence I retrace Your fingerprints on my body with a death defying ferocity
my demons have been a victim of alchemic transformation
challenge my perceptions
experiences that inspire
I want to sleep  so I can rush to You
"kiss around the scars or as always,  humble me  by kissing on the scars"
not my idea of darkness
I feel lost every night
watch how the surface quivers  when the deep underseas draw near
thinking about how many people I hate  no one comes to mind
it's so easy to love or hate there's no end to how much one could love or hate
hanging onto the edge just by her pouty nipples
it takes a lot of discipline to love right
read me with Your lips
look with dirtier eyes than that
there's You and then there's the universe
I may not know how it's done but it feels right
unafraid to be a little unsavoury
Your savage love feeds my vulnerability and keeps it alive
withering without Your cotton mouth on me
gratitude helps her survive
before she could sharpen she would try to shine
seasoned to serve You  anything
You hurt too much I love it too much
thoughts of You spill over  into everything I do
He sent me love  from inside my own skin
"she's a needy, greedy slut"
I only know what I want or would like to do You know what I must and what's right
decidedly perverse
now that I've fallen into Your lap say how much trouble I've invited
fortunately for me You never think I'm hurt enough
sometimes she's too naive to be nervous
come cocktail hour  she slips into a low cut fitted dress  exposing a sharp cleavage  the kind of thing it'd be nice  to be buried in
"we kissed against the door to the dark side,  it meant salvation"
she screamed her hurt out
such incredible torture  it went beyond every stretch  of her imagination
You are with me  so I know I'm living right
the kind of right I wish I was born with
I'm really into passion
Your palms  my breasts  and how a fairy tale  is just getting started
fate favours real love
impassioned kisses that put my lips on fire  and then He bites them like a slaughterer
"even the score, Beloved"
sometimes life takes you to wonderland
smiling is unraveling too
it is close to sunrise  hold my hand as I step into the light
I will play whatever twisted game You come up with
there's something therapeutic about baring myself to You
give me words that will save me a lifetime of melancholy
if all I did was fantasising  I'd go out of my mind You make it real  in flesh and spirit
blinded by sunlight  soothed by the dark
You are love
may that moment last forever  when Your hand is in mine
I'm in love with Your everything!
spilling and swapping secrets  under a clear night sky
they're mere words they can't match the feelings  they can't contain how He loves
toss this pain away unless You've given it to me
Your savagery delights me
look at the moon  and You'll know how much I miss You
I am all Yours  a thousand times over
Your words caress my heart
*catwalks to self destruction*
the freedom of having writing paper and a pen handy
being a little vandalised  can be very exciting
who'd have thought  that someone so small and unexceptional as she  would mature into a treasure
thinking back to the precise moment when I tasted You seems like it was only yesterday
He pins down a delicate butterfly  and dusts off the wildness
wiped out by a tongue  loaded with a riptide
sipping the sweat  on Your chest elegantly and then thirstily
expressing my bold personality at Your feet
my heart is swollen with calamitous curiosities and You continue fanning the flames
beauty and the Beast weird and the Wonderful
she glories in all the names He calls her
my chastity quivers on the edge    like the perfect silvery ash of His cigarette
You throb in my veins deeper than the strings of a violin
smoky mirrors  envious smoke alarm
I rely on You for inner peace
You always find new ways to possess me
I have every reason to give in to You
split wide open then clamped and cinched tight
perfume for deserving wrists  that burn from rope marks
bear down on me and pour all Your love
blindfolded  then broken
she is His  sexy little  clingy thing
my spine is still tingling  from the new memories we've made
loving You makes my jaws hurt
it costs dreams to be awake
Your words came to life for me today
bubbles of spit blooming on my blouse
keep me here
soft cheeks turned crimson as poppies
I hope You never run out of words for me
bowed in servility  till my lips touch Your toes
declare the love before whispering the filth
remembering the sweet sound  of our bodies chanting tumultuous passions
in the aftermath of Your love burns on my skin and soul last  as a forest fire
promise me an escape
tender and violent  don't feel different I take Your love right to my heart
"skin, a restrained shade of violet"
kiss me as You stroke my hair by the fistful
fuck the miles that separate us we will make love on paper
if I'm far from perfect how come I'm compatible with Him?
I'm nothing if not Yours
she's an expensive habit  occupying the better part of His time
goosebumps are how You know I am flooded with life
I feel pleasures  that are hard to find
His welcoming smile  makes her blush  as if her spirit was in the first flush of youth
tweak my every dirty want  into the drug of Your choice
she's got intrigue in her blood
return   repeatedly
A lover like a surreal dream amid nightmares
read me something from Your mind
I soared  and He loved me more
feeling loved is now a necessity
kiss me everywhere my skin breathes
excess of most things is bad except rope
unshaken affection despite unfamiliar flaws
all my dreams  and troubles  meet at Your feet
"""I must bridge the gap between adolescent glitter and mature glow. "" - Sylvia Plath"
desires led to discoveries
these longings will singe my soul
He can see the twist in my step from a distance  I can barely feel the ground as I waft towards Him
obeying You comes to me as naturally as breathing
some nights make her nostalgic about hotel rooms
Your love lingers under my skin
You mean sex to me
a brooch of red lip marks  on Your pocket square  is how I'd kiss Your heart
sometimes I don't answer the first time because I want to hear Him call my name again
lost in thoughts of You and I have the cigarette burns to prove it
not pure  and she's honest about it
You loved me  and let it grow  let it grow until  I loved myself
girlhood memories  will always make a woman smile  and cry
Your power makes me want to fight
He sucks like I have fudge on my tongue
He's promised me forever and I've got to have it
rainbows and happy endings
Here's to You
I crave fierce pleasures
blissful bedtime banter
You always seem to know  what's not right for me
I like the dark. Not sleepless nights.
longing for snugness that is only found by embracing the fire in You
sleepless without Satan
her steps led Him down to dependency
I feel as much as You do
make me crawl through Your darkness
I cling to Him and He kisses me as hard
"love, if eternal, is easy to understand"
poetess by day mermaid by night
I'll write about lust  You talk about love
tie as many knots  as there are rules
a hint of tears opens the floodgates of savagery
make permanent those fleeting moments
thinking about You and casting a connection across miles
liberate her reservations
respect her practicalities
aloof and beyond reach
body as an ocean wave
I've booked the dancefloor  join my beat tonight
the winds are raving and unruly  You must be disrobing in the bath
You made me beautiful  a lady of the woman in me  a lover of the little girl in me
all these memories we've made  and yet there aren't all that many
"old fashioned, not outdated"
put a smile on me
when will You love me?  and for how long?
lick Your lips and tie a knot in my belly
looking washed out  is part of her charm
a girl with a rebellious sense of touch
bathed in Your gaze  I feel the freshness of youth
gave all I wanted to
felt what I was waiting for
found who I was looking for
I must be a special kind of broken to warrant a salvager like Him
she's loaded with hidden fantasies
immerse me in adventures
sat in a peaceful corner among ageing wines in the cellar  she writes private poetry
there is always some poem on His lips
2 am perhaps I'd be better off blindfolded and fucked to sleep
let it go but only on Saturdays
hearts in pursuit of winners
she ravished the universe looking for love
stop envying something that isn't meant for you
people with warm hearts have cold hands
we're responsible for each other's needs
grab  aim fire
fill the forest  with piercing noises from Your cave
without warning  He took me to the sky
walking hand in hand  innocence alongside ferocity
I'm a fire breathing monster  now fuck my mouth
guilty of superbity
reckless ambitions  dangerous consequences
remind me how small I am
tired of being tender yet?
tell me patience is a bad habit
my dreams aren't as unreal anymore
to give You my all to do it to my heart's content  and go farther than I'm able to
there's just something about kneeling before You It's self assuring
call me extravagant  but last night I slept wearing just Your shirt
she fights to suffer
a girl as poised as a bar in the daytime
pull my head back  as I drink my fill
my sexuality Your opium
grab me in Your jaws before I  drop to the floor with a muted thud
the value of being a part of Your life is unquantifiable
put heart into love  else what's the point?
It's great to be allowed to be an animal
feeling Your presence  is almost a form of deepness
she's like a wounded animal  on nights without Him
physical exhaustion  mental relief
organic love one that's full of seed
pull me away Beloved  from the stiff wind of yearning
sorry. I'm not sated
reveal to me  Your persuadable side
between the belt and the flogger I prefer both
let Your hands linger in my lingerie
wherein lies my innocence?
her trunk full of letters unsent is a mix of paper old and new  while the words stay the same
love me till I run out of orgasms
tease out from me  the scent that makes You wild
guide my eager hands  for You know my body better
such a beguiling drink  can't forget the taste  can't have enough  I want to earn it again
at Your feet is a place to become  and to be
cocooned in my dreams of You
tell me these are more than just words to You
I've become poetic since You kissed me
the kind of secret you would want everyone to know
Your pleasure is what I'm after
raise the sound of my moans
be happy for me  for I'm in love with You
one day she ended up  being The One
tell me how  I may get  more involved
send love
something sexy Your way crawls
words You've said before words I've read before  yet every day  they add richness to my life
kissing to the rhythm  of the thick grey clouds floating above with no star or moon to worry us
a toy beautiful enough to use
my servility doesn't know where to stop
say no to mercy tonight
Your every dream has got my name on it
every night counts
every day matters
push the buttons real slow
I trust You with my soul
it's a passion for me to observe You
true love can be so tumultuous and passionate
fill me with aspects of Yourself
I'm so much better off in Your lap
she missed all the lessons in the art of sobriety
she looks great in the dark
always bring your own absinthe
a whiff of nostalgia and music to match
bite me I'm feeling a little delicate
foreplay is fun until I run out of breaths
You pull me  into Your arms and I feel You pulse  with rock solid tenderness
Your unbeaten aura continually overwhelms me
burn a cigarette between Your lips  as if it was a woman
inject Your touch into me so I am never alone
secure me to the night in You
love me ruin me for my sake
always better to ask permission than forgiveness
uncompromising lust  intensified to  blooming love
You can never have too much of a good girl
He's hotter than whiskey
it takes genuine patience  to love someone's flaws
tell me what You intend to make happen
He sharpens my edges  with an achingly soft  and prolonged foreplay
trussed up  for You to happily  exploit
I'm having a high passion moment
my need of You  makes me kissable
the more sound I make the tighter His hand clenches into a fist
the wind has a familiar ring to it today  I've been growled at like this before
fill me up  with Your love again and again
reach out to me at the far end of the balcony
I am set free  by the relief of Your  paranormally skilful hands
my barbarous Beloved
I could spend cheerful hours  watching Him in moments of impatience as He uses His finger for a paper knife
A beard like a silvery forest fern  spiked with velvety musk
seducing You with cues to my mystery
waiting for the day  that will bring us together  I crumble in the dark  subtly but profoundly
I'm difficult to hypnotise   or so I always believed
soft touch  full of steely intentions
I gaze longingly  at the words You wrote last
I'm  not  at all dirty and  that's not  done  at all
sleepless eyes  restless body  smouldering heart
it's past midnight  and there's a storm brewing  I'm conscious of Your absence
devouring one another  like only a Dominant and His submissive can
You give my reality meaning
captivating You quietly  but confidently
share my beliefs
His simplicity stimulates me
unfold my shame  and unleash my vulgarity
hands that cure and sometimes choke
Ouch
You and me with hands and mouths interlocked  could that be what heaven's like?
wipe with Your spit the sass from my eyes
a love story as painful as the start of life
writhing on the floor wearing a silk blouse over a leather pencil skirt she masquerades  as a damsel in distress
was that Your cane last night or did I fall on a shard of glass this morning?
He says my name and it sounds like it's being spoken out of heaven
kiss me harder swallow my void
this incessant need to be slayed by Your mouth
seal my lips with a kiss  and keep me from demanding anything
warm droplets of sweat  toppling on my eyelids
it would be insolent  to simply imagine every feeling
if I could sniff Your words  they'd smell of gold leaves that escaped into the wilderness
back from my wanderings..
Your love makes me unique
as I lie in bed  and put Your words in force  my cotton sateen bedlinen  boasts of the rich perfume of romance
"""The East is a country of the senses - warm, mysterious - like the kiss of a lover."""
the tears are an invitation to kiss
fated fadeless love
I'm longing for You wrap me in Your soul lest I burn up
my heart wants no love other than Yours
she can seduce  but it's the suffering she endures  that defines her
gosh is that what a tongue is for?
love is made in so many ways
a girl like the havoc in a rifle barrel
let's get messy
tickle me  with a surprise
He kisses her lovingly then tells her His mum likes her
every woman wants to shine a little bit
say to me  what You said  when You were high
watch over me and keep me from the wolves
does my appetite for lust appeal to the old-school sailor in You?
pull me into bed  and switch off my comfort mode
in need of a quick wrestle
when ripples of excitement  become waves of pleasure
a brush of Your hand or just one kiss  or even a lone orgasm either could set me free a thousand times over
whispers like chants  weaving a spell on me
You are the soul  of my world
Until we met I had always believed  that unless I was perfect  I would not be loved
let's try it all
glassfuls of wine  mouthfuls of kinky filth
"""how do You always know what I need?"", I asked  ""every piece has a puzzle"", was the answer"
I love being forewarned
drag the diva out of me
here comes the moon there goes my Beloved
show me how much I can take
can You see me through the haze?
"if You're still reading this, that means we're not kissing yet And that is a nightmare"
do You feel me across miles  when my fingertip stubs the bruises on my body?
different is dangerous
I sunbake on the floor  that has Your footprints
sleep with me tonight  for my dreams need mending
I'm drowning in anticipation
"poetry, because beauty merits words"
substitute Your miss you  for want you
He gives me something the whole world wants He gives me peace
"blindfolded, I come face to face  with Your darkness"
a love born to last
question my answers
watch me grow  at Your feet
living the dream  one rendezvous at a time
the day is over  the pining is about to begin
beat up my alternate reality
the further You push me the closer I get to paradise
"spear  not spare, me"
all her happiness  lies in one secret
"no such thing as too much, He said"
held so tight by that gaze
do whatever You want  do it unstoppably
take over my world
fortified by forward bends
I tried some make up  but didn't turn out like Your hands make me
He unbuckles the belt  and I bow my head
desire me  so that I may come alive
I'm a flickering candle  burning bright in the fire of Your love
hold me  and rob my soul
life's too short  more so on days that we meet
fantasies the devils find unbelievable
she seeks pain as if it's a sacred rule of love
wrap me in ribbon  hide the carpet burns
my body aches from waiting
would You like to eat my lips?
flex that love muscle for me
obsessed hence daring
lower  bit by bit until moans  overflow
I thrive  by winning  Your love
make me beautiful
all alone in here  it's just insanity I've got
sinners have this way of finding each other
craving sin?
"there's a time and place for ""everything"" I've found a place You find the time"
I turn off Your retweets and instantly believe You like my words only
lost in thoughts of Him she pinches blueberries with a fork  and tastes them wounded
"nipples twisted to such burning soreness, she presses palms on them in the shower"
I know You stir
"And now You're thinking about us and smiling, most likely"
breathe fiery kisses on me and see my soul unfold
let tonight last  till we're starving again
cut my torture-free hours
let's spoon and sleep until late spring
pierce and glimpse
maybe one day I'll look up and watch as You speak
i need ruling
sometimes I forget You can't hear me
smudges of ink on paper from every time she tried to break the silence
make me Yours before decades roll
she loves you back
"""You need to learn to let someone in, they won’t all try to break you”"
I'm only as dirty as what You seek in me
move closer  the fire's burning this way
she's one of those who keep on getting fewer
FUCK  wouldn't mean anything without U
be there where I need You
once in love wonders never cease
tell me I've reached the limit
I'm shivery Am I being thought about?
restraint inspires resourcefulness
lust that's a saga of heroin proportions
from a heart loaded with romance she rolls ambrosia around on her tongue
feed my unconscious longing for every imaginable sin
people in love make good things happen
let the steam from our bodies  obscure the rain outside
erotic as an exotic flower in a hedgerow
the compulsive urge  of doing dirty things in bad weather
erotic as the earth bearing scarlet poppies
looks elegant feels cosy    in spit stained cheeks
ruby lips  rounding the tip
put me inside Your sleeping bag
take my hand in Yours and everything will seem possible
kiss and rescue me
"give me a nod  when I say ""I wish"""
diverged into the deep-end  and found my comfort
"Him: You've always needed a love like ours Her: Only since forever, not long at all"
the gleaming sky is symbolic of the hope we share to spend a night together some time
walks like royalty  talks like a drunk whore
thoughts of You  lift my heart
the orgasms that beckon
thinking of times to come
sweltering with raw need  under my opaque tights
"forget, if You can, that I'm delicate"
come raid my happy bubble
the curative power of cosiness
It is raining and I can smell You in the air
yoga pants  messy hair bun  coffee Sunday
look into my eyes  until You see my need
the dark in mind need no guilty pleasures
desire that brings down heaven
sashaying around naked  hoping for a chance encounter with You
touch and stir
lonely as an overcast sky that thinks it has lost the moon
I wish I were being kissed
it's not a reward  if I don't choke
in tears  and not because she bleeds
You said hello and I was Yours
freedom as that of a butterfly suspended in a cave
bet Your belt is missing me
tracked and bitten   off the beaten track
bruises equate to beauty
since when did anyone praise her essence she wonders
walking by the seashore  she twists into the sand  the broken pieces  of rocks shaped like mountains
dim the lights  I can endure more pain that way
erotic as the golden elixir swaying between two mouths in love
there's a discreet and dark allure here that only Your words bear
corrupted  to rigorous perfection
shameful as a pretty little mouth with nothing inside it
swathed in shimmering silk heading straight to the bar
she likes men like her favourite hangout  rugged but soulful
blowing kisses  as she skins a pineapple  with her plum coloured fingernails
a street called nirvana
my demonic desires don't take fright when the sun comes out
envious of the sky that's draped with ribbons of thick clouds
seeing what You see  and everything is new
the stakes were well known  when I first took the leap
Your warmth glazed my heart along all its wrinkles
"I embrace with gratitude  everything that lies before, between and ahead of us"
the thirst starts in my eyes
but what of this mouth that forgets to breathe without Your lips around it?
touching You everywhere  with a deft tongue
seducing You with  my giggly charm
disarming You  by dazzling in black
A special kind of love that's  as much a destination  as a journey
You're a fantasy  my bedroom wall and I could indulge
she exits the gents'  looking supremely tasteful
the spaces between my fingers  beg to be filled
Return.
she fell for someone extraordinary
eyes like darts  and a gaze that makes my heart crackle
fresh as charcoal grey
I have scratches  from where Your hands skimmed my body
hugging You as I fall on my knees
nothing else mattress
sore is satisfying
she never bothered with hot rollers  she would just curl the ends of her hair along the curve of her breast
flick that ash into my coffee
care to throw me inside a blanket fort?
it's all about decadence
erotic as sipping champagne from Your shoe
let my shyness be taken  as an offering tonight
love is therapy
love is simple
"if you dream, dream big same with bites"
tart and sherry kind of morning
forbidden fruit my favourite kind
her soul is hungrier than her skin
I never meant to be irresistible
they do things no one understands
she's at her most beautiful  when she's thinking about Him
He saved her  from the mistakes she'd have made
"You, above all"
as sensual as pain
growl if You're peckish
sublimation is my only weapon
warm Your lips on my smile
when fantasy meets destiny
whipped for unsolicited touching
maybe we've bumped into each other
everyone heard gunfire  while all she did was walk  on the wooden floor  inside the church  wearing heels
it's so relieving to be able to trust
love that fills life with festival cheer
teach me  some yoga in private
talk to me about curses  while I blow smoke rings
enjoys pleasure but not pain and then says she has no flaws
got so intimate  He touched my soul
love that feels like running towards life with open arms
I don't fear to be loved
going insane trying to be patient
I was in the park too reading not sun bathing
I was at the club too  Just not the one dancing on the table
when life becomes a dream
let my vulnerability inspire You
He's dirtier than my dirtiest thoughts
she is not  a fussy kitten  all she wants  is to be  called a lioness
"the kind of Man who walks into a room and everyone goes, ""Oh!"""
she likes her men like her nightgown   fearless and expressive
push me into darker territory
fill in the gap between my lips
promise to love me forever
desires as a whirlwind  overcome by a downpour
I will say I love wintertime  when it's not just the wind that bites
when the present looks like the glorious future you always imagined
she indulges in a state of disgrace like it's some kind of love too
love that feels like rebirth
I will always  risk everything
"just when I'm on the edge of tears, ""I want more"", He says"
when there's kindness in the touch  it only means He will soon hurt me more than ever
kneeling before love  always only love
hold me and feel how my breathing changes
Your voice  and darkness  is all I need
ever since we met  my fantasies are dirtier  than they used to be
I hurt myself
someone hurt someone You love
what do You feel like doing tonight?
tell me I did good
would You like wet eyes or sobs?
reliving old memories is never time wasted
fulfil my longings and throw me into relief
my dark thoughts become even more powerful  when You capture them in words
I'm a distraction worth Your while
He is love  at first sight
warmth starved sun worshipper
I may not like it but I crave it
Your foot meeting my throat  is the only way I'll learn
they are vows not just words
the bondage of love
look past her youth she has a soul too
"""I shine, not burn."""
You satisfied me  when You chose me
miss you is not love you
may I have a slice of Your life?
hand-dip into my soul  through the chasm between my breasts
seducing You  with my old-school sorcery
You touch everything
she makes mistakes freely  but only next to the ones she loves
I love You and I'm afraid to know  what it is to lose
say You love  to have me
I'd rather be seductive than sexy
immoderate levels of lusting  yet she's never overtly sexy
His words raise love to art
ripe with tempest
my feelings for You  are beyond the capacity of language
she retains heat better than His fine bone china
I'm disciplined to perfection  with Your strike-anywhere touch
lust is as valuable as love
perhaps lust is an overrated luxury
agitate gently
tender flesh now wounded
talk to me of the night  You want us to spend together
the thrusts that  pierced my soul
dying to be tortured
hands that hold promises
when sex makes you miss love
there's room for You to sink
thoughts of reclining on Your palm
in those sex-saturated moments  the room smells of frangipani blossoms
gratification through revelation
moans that sound like prayers ricochetting off cliffs
arresting Your night  with carnal temptations
a night on the tiles
the clear sky twinkles tonight  as if it captured Your vibe
Your cum the most potent of cocktails
too young to know what He's thinking
wine and prey spotting
affection that makes my knees bend
more splendid than severe
my love for You is insanity on drugs
You make it easier  for me to be who I am
thank you's that look like tears
*calls self Your life*
spanks are like holidays you can never have enough
desperately need discipline
my skin senses Your nearness
drag until subdued
all manner no manipulation
hellishly powerful forewarnings rendered ever so lovingly
momentous pursuits  of dire suffering
to feel pulled together   that
limitless libido
Ferris wheels and escapism
reward me with more of You
pity those You've never loved
a full-blown feast  in a steel blue suit
You and I  in the moonlight  are the brightest spark  in the darkest night
never stop at kisses
rebelling at His expectations
I'd been getting it wrong  until You came along
she's worth her weight in wild nights
never quite alive  until she dares
erotic as the light that always finds darkness
"scars..  because love, is worth fighting for"
the moon's out to take charge
dominate me with kindness
trust me to tell You when I've digressed
liven up my wrists  with fingerprints
from blue to blush
pale inner thighs  flanked with vibrant violet hues
His utterances not words  is all it takes
*jumps up the hell wagon in search of salve for the soul*
He shuts the bedroom door  and the phony world retreats
kiss until soft and sticky
reminiscing every spare moment
let it slip to blood heat and stay there
laid in His bed and slathered with intimacy
sufficiently obsessed
You say I feel
trading cunt slaps for cigarettes
"""Love laughs at locksmiths."""
when tears are just the beginning
peeling back my cloak of comfort  as I crawl toward You
enduring through all His wild days
she's His longest surviving victim
starting with Your mouth  write Your way around my body
I've been wondering  and it's getting filthy
Your name alone  warms the cockles of my heart
immutable cravings  lurking in my mouth
I'm an inky sky  You're the first hint of sun
she's audacious like it's the law
I want to watch You read to me
adorning Your bed by arching gracefully
the moonbeams caught me red-handed
turn Your mind to me  and see how I carry it off
touch that seizes
using my tongue  and keeping You cool
not enough stripes never enough
Your soft words get me warmer than this lion's mane around my neck
memories still simmer  in frozen moments
I like when You shake my courage
even my spirit heard You slam
do more of that thing I don't like
not sure what's embarrassing anymore
rub that grated chocolate* all over my pink flesh   mud*
satiated I am anything but
vulnerable as a bird's nest on a sandy beach
will attack wolves
a lure that glows
it isn't thunder it's the sound of my wings beating against the wind as I fly
the voices in my head always make me break rules
I dared to dream a life with You
the fireflies put her to sleep
lovers versus awful normals
sometimes the smartest woman in the room is also the drunkest
tether me to Your feet
You could make me believe anything
happiness has no formula
the wind blows Your scent on me  and I forget where I am
they all seem to want our kind of love
I need what You want
a woman needs to give  to be happy
she's the perfect ending to His dinner
devoted to the sweet things in life
I love and am loved like no other
say the words I'm waiting to hear
my fantasies are tired  of just being written about
You want me  You love me  Nothing else matters
perhaps He's after the crystals  that coat her eyes
desires gone rogue
marked for days  smouldering for weeks
It's nearing dusk and You're still far away
i've tasted adventure and it's fascinating
castles in the air brooding on the skyline
If ever love deserved to be called eternal ours is it
lead me to the very edge of fatality then kiss me again
squeeze louder screams out of me
let me linger in Your bed till I'm stretched across the floor
down You go
"It's serving, not hurting"
gorging on You from afar
all her soft spots  come alive at night
thoughtfully chosen sex slave
respect her fears
come back for more and more and more
A silk scarf is the female equivalent of a Swiss Army knife
I let go of everything that held me back  I lived more
from against the tree to in the bushes to on the grass  to in the mud
the kind of Man who could be a heart throb His whole life
planning on stealing me from my sleep tonight?
"""Be, don’t seem."""
making life simpler  living by impractical fancies
she says she loves the rain  then smiles and wipes away tears
passionate about passing out
now that You love me I fear imperfections
erotic as Lolita
mental discipline is no joke
words that bear incense
Her: I hide  Him: I hunt
the urge to wander
what we need  is another lifetime  outside the confine zone
I'll choose a peak You chart the way to it
shared vices and overlapping kisses
weakened  but in a good way
Your mouth left chilli dust all over my body  leaving it burning for the calm of Your healing hands
beg You to eat my heart out
shedding tears and worries  into Your blackout palms
the eroticism of a skylight that invades private moments
too entranced to squirm
my senses appear or disappear  depending on the way You decide to touch me
desires double at night
punish the oversight
love struck at the highest level of animalism
my brown eyes are   sufficiently big to hold both our dreams
the way He sits in his whisky chair  right in front of my spread out limbs
it's hard stuff hour
the perfect spooning  before coffee
erotic as soft sand riding on the tide at dawn
peer beyond the layers
the comfort of unmissable rituals
the elegance of being on the infinity edge of yet another orgasm
forever is the work of two souls
feel how my qualms bounce off the bedroom walls
daily death by restraint
His words have a back-to-bed allure
I feel and think differently around You
shiny things need darkness to dazzle after all
she's anything but impassive
grab and twist my wayward hair  so nothing stops me caving in
I bite my tongue  and taste vulgarity
tackle this sinking feeling in my bones with Your sweet reason
my heart is filled with Your love leaving no place for irreverence
"my moods and worries, like You, are adventurous"
my desires found their way into Your hands
I've got dreams You'll love living with
do that thing that makes me happy to look at myself in the mirror
clash Your teeth into my pink lips
the balm of whispers
days were spent dreaming  and nights wide-awake
each of us is here because we broke the silence
silence always has a good vibe
I live a lifetime of summers  every moment that we're together
I cannot resist Your gorgeous  occasionally dangerous  playground
weave Your spell on me
an eruption of shouting
when You leave  I'm back to unreality
stripped bare with just a collar to my name
Your darkness brought me to light
Mindscape
when written about You every word is true
peace as You enter hope as You leave
fantasies of You  being my own
just one touch  and I go from distressed  to de-stressed
subtle  but not gentle
Your absence alarms me for I am still very fragile
forking out emotions  over a pot of Darjeeling
Only You have the power to make me wish
leech all that decency out of me
heroically sincere
I'll pin a new tweet everyday IDGAF
You can't fix something unbreakable
difficult people become easy going if loved right
I'd never tire of being compared to an Angel
soul-screaming spin dancing
overdo it till we end up in the woods
corner is key
as if biting nails will kill the craving to be with You
switch off the lights  I don't want to be safe
*purrs until immovable*
my troubles are a world away  from the dark alleys we walk through
I see my dreams  nestled in Your eyes
Your penknife  slicing through  my pencil skirt
my thigh loves Your tongue
my nipples love Your teeth
my throat loves Your belt
my wrists love Your hands
slain once cornered
reinvented once collared
wearing perfume that says I'm going places
when love is not limited to life   that
it's sexy when a speed-reader is arrested by dreamlike eyes and an angelic smile
clinch and stroke my shoulders  till my talcum-soft knees cleave the ground
never leave me mercilessly free in bed
nibble on my neck  when I stretch it and moan deeply
I bow and extend my mouth  with a humble offering of kisses  at Your feet
court my world  and feast on my nights
make me Your coffee table erotica
this ardor has become second nature
the virtue of being deserving
In love with the way You raise a smile  when I revolt
Your penetrating growl  is music to my ears
limit Yourself to me
when heat-stricken  even breathing stirs me
I want a collection of Your things
skin is just flesh  Your touch makes it feel special
TGIF
she fears death because she loves too much
it takes charisma to trust beyond question
or taking my heels off
I would never waste our valuable moments together  wiping away tears
I gently nuzzle Your jawbone in bed  and grit my teeth because I don't  have the courage to kiss Your lips
You write like You know me
find forever in me
thoughts of You have taken over all my idle moments
pierce my mouth  with dribbles from Yours
usher me back to bed
all Yours  in all my guises
pat sweet slap
nobody's fool because she's His slave
glaze my tongue with spit  sweat and cum
I'm exposure obsessed
mesmeric mouths  pulling each other  until breaths are lost
fears are beautiful when exposed
I'll stop at nothing  but Your name
loving wholly means destroying completely
unzip and jump down my throat
catch and feed
kittens like to play  lioness likes to hunt
He smells like dominance
so addicted to kinky rituals
defrocked and spanked
knees on the ground  head in the clouds
out of breath  full of heady rush
love seduced me into doing things I never thought myself capable of
very sore  but aching for more
from shush to shut up
make it demanding  I'm far from giving up
a life without a way of life  no do's no don'ts
"smudged and reeking, but I like it"
the night begins for love
these are pangs of hunger  just licks will not do
correct as I flow
my skin is burning  and not out of longing this time
He had plans for the woman who  believed in serendipity
living the dream  without compromise
there are compliments  and then there are new compliments  and a good many compliments
erotic as a custard cream in a tea bath
nothing resuscitates like cunt slaps
His hands over my body  as if on a voyage of discovery
I'd scream less if it hurt more   But You know that already   And still make me scream
the smiles I took back will keep me company
passionate kisses aren't about pressing the mouth on skin  I like to breathe Your scent through my mouth as I feel the pulse in Your throat
mysterious yet merciful
censure in whispers
and then she's a naked mess  left to dry
"""Spoon!!"""
*soothes wounded and bitten lower lip by brushing it across Your cold toes*
this crazed mouth misses tasting You
"""You know not to ask""   #turnons"
the pain makes me want to return
all it takes to realise a dream is a heavenly mouthful of You
her vocabulary adds a touch of toughness to her femininity
impact that nurtures
butterflies in my belly  fluttering like birds in chains
unveiled to perfection
pinned with the depth of meaning Your words hold
all of me belongs to the One who has absolutely everything
I didn't mean to bite
once you've breathed the air around Him it's hard to stay dispassionate
talk to me of ways and means
hardness that dazzles
grab and smash
You paint my world  shades of earth and sky
play and put to good use
nobody liked my tweet
Your calming touch  strips my mind  and peels away the inessential
strengthen Your hold  as I explore the balance between freedom and captivity
love the way You leave me undecorated
a clash of opposites  and a bewildering explosion of magic
nothing screams pleasure  like piercing pain
His endless caresses bring forth dripping beads of tears as if to border her eyes with diamonds  for being such a good girl
He sums up the magnetism of maleness
stoke my resolve  by using Your powers of reduction
You're too interwoven into my being  for me to ever feel soulless
nothing but black
the chill of Your absence  makes my eyes burn with crushingly hot tears
sighing as far as the horizon  because I miss You
she lies still in bed  her cunt weighted with anticipation
love how You leave me smelling sumptuous for hours
"place on my lips, Your smoky mouth  accented with bitter coffee"
I can't think of enjoying winter time  without Your arms keeping me warm
not just pleasing  but also necessary
on some nights there can't be  too much of a good thing inside me
her salty skin pairs perfectly with  His indecently lush gaze
warm breath  evoking cool petals
breasts clad modestly in bite marks
love happens when comfort and wilderness meet
Our love is more profound  than physical luxury
thinking about You is headily invigorating
take me back down to where I belong
new year   wobbly resolutions
Your words reflect who I am
all those cries are my love talking
Your taste has become my staple
lips that taste of raw honey
ask me if I understand   again
smother my lips so it doesn't hurt when I smile
when the dynamic is stronger than the lust  That
Your gaze casts a dusky rose  on my cheeks
mismatches are made in heaven too
my new embroidered black bra would make a nice lampshade for Your bedroom
my mum's the chicest person I know
give me a picnic of seafood and wine over pale pearls any day
she's never really alone  the sailings in the ocean keep her occupied
erotic as a slow-cooked meal
fuck me harder than You play
words she wishes she didn't read  voice she wishes spoke back
when we get closer to each other  even the skyline changes
twist me into a statement  of exuberance
I feel You but You're not satisfyingly close enough
discretion above anything
all those fantasies  aren't a dream anymore
timeless playfulness
the sex appeal of simplicity  remains underestimated
erotic as a skirt without movement
she plays with fire wearing a low cut dress  and smoking a high tar cigarette
I have a love of the elegance I see in You
determined to make it last
so delicate  she's almost invisible
to spend the whole night in the champagne bar
no sipping
no matter what the drink it has to be shots
His spit tastes like pure spring water
seducing You by going teetotal
You and I and  dirty vibes
He smiles so kindly  when I try not to look intimidated
saying Your name out loud gets me drunk
saying Your name out loud sobers me
daunting aspirations
extreme pleading
a heart like a wasted double room in an expensive hotel
emojis are litter  use more words if you must
love me and leave me  spluttering and bloody
make me a fresh promise
erotic as strawberry daiquiri red
finally had You but was let down by sunshine
she survives on cigarettes and plum tomatoes
let's disappear for nights on end
a mouth full of elaborate excuses
high on the smell of Your skin
confine my impulse
I heartily welcome  a mix of Your moods
constantly thinking of ways  to offer You something more
intense and more fulfilling than the last
every orgasm seems new and unfamiliar
the champagne 's on ice  now unbutton and turn up the heat
to taste You  till I'm drunk and sleeping on clouds
"I tell Him how His marks have stayed on my skin for weeks  ""Because you're owned young lady"", He repeats"
her aggressive beauty  provokes His calm
erotic as melted wax dripping off a cliff
Your touch commands surrender
the exceptional relief that comes from  being trapped between Your arms
the further You go   the higher I soar
the mind is a complicated territory  come live in my heart instead
penetrate my core and push me  to the very edge of wildness
a love with no back story
undressed beyond shadows  but there may still be secrets to uncover
her peace lies in the emptiness below the foundations
erotic as a winter melt
You only need to wet  the first set of my lips
close Your eyes and think about  the alluring curves of my hips and breasts
when night closes in  I feel Your heat from miles away
she finds her comfort in the extreme
Yes Sir   When everything ends with those words. That.
imperfect yet loving heart
fuck me till I collapse exhausted
claw marks on Your chest like love notes carved up a rock
betroth me in sinful pursuits
share the scenery with me
not going the conventional route  I dislike crowds
downside?  she won't impress everyone
I'm all Yours flaws included
heartbeat the sound of devastation
not just a beautiful heart an imaginative mind too that's her Man
You're a secret too precious  to be shared with anyone
to make myself  earth-shaking urgent for You
when is love not love? when it's sin-free
what could be finer than true love?
she lives healthily on sundays
she wanted to give more  than He asked for
allow me more of You
party a lot  dance a bit  or vice versa
to lose myself  and be alone with You
a touch that feels like I'm sun bathing at the edge of the ocean
sex on the beach  until we wind down to the sea
a smouldering heart like a house nestled amid black volcanic rocks
sin's a hobby  not a habit
smokes and tipples
my silly unthinking heart  it forgets to beat  if You're not around
I want a collar  chunkier than Your cigar
these swelling desires  get to me every time
I would plead for mercy  sometime around never
thoughts of You and You alone
He likes to mess with my sensitivity
I need.
orgasms are meant to be used
she's more mysterious  when You get closer
an embrace took me by storm
the kind of girl who will not look You in the eye
write love notes on my body in bath foam
the art of strangulation
pinch till I bleed
old school charm has an allure  that can't be matched
the feeling of being inexperienced  and the way it stimulates
not unafraid enough  to use the F word around You  Fuck me anyway
to have  and to hold
Your true grit helps me overcome  my burning fear of going the limit
ribbon the colour of His favourite wine wound around her wrists
I'd love to be constrained  by Your pleasure
she's the kind of book you'd want to take to a desert island
nights long  moon dazzling  love obsessive
she withers beautifully
without You  this pain wouldn't feel  as good
ugly truths poetised    in her little black book
persistently drawn  to the unhurried violence in Your eyes
get me doing great things  for Your pleasure
the beauty of unsubtle surrender  of the mist that melts off long grass
there's nothing roughness can't cure
laying my hands on You  is truly humbling
hard core sex  on soft linen
she's most herself   in those unashamedly  wanton moments
the dazzling moonlight put the cuffs on her slender wrists
love me all You want just stop for coffee
I float untethered  in Your imagination
my bed ain't tainted enough yet
no sleep  few dreams
I doubt there are better lovers in the world  than us
the velvety veil of darkness  spread by the explosive   chemistry between us
criminally hopeful
mightily hungry
all or nothing  seems reasonable
I am only really kept going by my love for You
Hello Santa  I could explain But I can't be bothered
unspoken feelings  often get inked on the skin
offbeat journeys  and unforgettable encounters
the turbulent tension  of finding the right words
fill me with shots  of Your masculinity  and put me to sleep
a soul laden  in lavish layers of toughness
tears are water as a warrior
I like my men like my bath oil  scenting my skin and calming my mind and spirit
I like my men like my hot chocolate  extra-dark and satisfying all my cravings
nearly Christmas  stockings ready  suspenders too
wary of tempting the gods
I like my men like my cheese knife  elegant and strong
I like my men like my backpack  the perfect everyday companion protecting my essentials with a simple zip closure
I like my men like my sense of style  alluring and distinctive
wherever she is  it's a party
the rippling beauty of salty sweat   on His timber textured skin
open up Your world for me
"""suffer for me"", He said and I kept orgasming"
she gasps loudest when His fingers just leave her short of the edge
reality always steals the show
"I like my men like Christmastime spirited, relaxed and a feast for the tastebuds"
I like my men like my coffee  awakening my senses with deliciousness and an unmatched depth
"I like my men like my liqueur neat, dark and leaving me longing"
Your scent is now a second skin
I like my men like my holidays  warm and spiced up
I like my men like my desires  narcotic and carnal
I like my men like my perfume  subtle and suggestive
the heart tricks the head constantly
intimate memories  stirring me subconsciously
feeling glamorous  in coated cotton panties
love me with the compassion  of a cane-maker
we are fate at its best
I'm better when I'm hushed
kiss me for every spank I took
If You lead  I will follow
You and I  this is the life
"very metaphorically speaking, the night's a friend"
skin like a tobacco factory
He is far too charming  for me to not be spellbound
can't resist  the wild scent of You
my mouth is on a feline prowl  and will leave no part of You untasted
revived by the pain
a new chapter &gt; a sequel
The mesmerising unison  of my eccentricity  and Your old-school charm
a girl like a gothic rose
choking till my eyes are full of tears  and then blind-tasting You
A bumraising evening
He looks a bit unsparing  but kisses unusually calmly
He wants to share the pleasure  and so I lick His wet fingers
talk to me about  fetishes and whims
hate when You say goodbye  love how You kiss goodbye
placed my hand on His chest as He called my name  and I fell in love with myself
I am His poem  His haiku and everything else
imperfect I may be  but He loves me dearly
the poetry of memories
unless they are immortalised by love  hearts are condemned to die
mouths and minds  that never shout
He always has the air of having overthrown all my troubles  and being open to more
perpetually single at nights
He is just  a bit too good
lovingly wrecked
the night air is warm  with tearful sentiments  and nostalgia
freshly showered  and feeling darker
all my talents  turned to pleasing You
decadent as a winter rose
delicate neck  hemmed with red silk rope
she dazzles in her rawness
I've fallen under Your spell
just like nightfall
cover me in glory
He fondles my body as if to sculpt it into something ungracious
this impassioned and painful assault on my body feels like heaven on earth
It was hearts burning with longing that brought the moon into existence
He made me a better kisser
does my utmost reverence unsettle You?
His feet make a discreet bed of roses  for my lips
Being able to read so many minds is why I enjoy Twitter
a fuck worth all my virtues
not just a bite He chewed and feasted upon the wholesomeness of my lower lip
fuck the yell out of me
the air smells of incense  that's been shaken out of our bodies as they burned with passion
He demands His pleasure she earns hers
there is an inverted sketch of my palm lines  on each hind leg of Your chair
spit-soaked end of Your cock  oiling my nipples
strangle my gasps  with Your kisses
my story  in Your words
I know I'm about to be challenged when You stroke my hair purposefully
the moment when I'm a heartbeat away from Your hands touching me  That
I feel You beyond my senses
a sheer veil of wet kisses  trailing down Your chest
hypnotic eyes crawling all over me
Love commands Love obeys
I could use some time in Your mind and some space in Your heart
thoughts of You  give me needs
God loves saints women love sinners
mine is You. What's Your power?
nothing is more sensual than pain
it ran amok  amid the sands of time  she lost her innocence  in the blink of an eye
too many wishes in her heart   so she poisoned some
words as silent screams
She shared feelings  He read words
brutal  but as love not winter
seducing You  by sobbing
*kisses Your palm as You stop me breathing*
battered and bettered
I wince  I withstand
the goodness  and realness  of pain
lips  ready for a kiss
pleas winsome as black-mesh
He even arrests   my imagination
spin me a little  on Your whim
heart-stopping  unexpected  hits of ferocity
cracked many times over  is considered broken  or did you want to see bone dust?
since I'm elegant and wild like it call me lily
within four walls  and along dead-end alleys  is where my mind roams free
the priceless thought of You  living a short walk away from me
my heart's heavy enough  to keep me warm
words &gt; flowers
tantalisingly remote  yet a possibility
with thoughts as warm as those of us let it snow
the forgotten art  of accepting simplicity
pull me out of my trappings
our love has a life far beyond  the time that we're together
the urge to worship sparks within me
shelter  and exposure  I'll take it all  I need both
*wincingly remembers nothing escapes You*
the most beautiful face of love
eyes like gems that have forgotten to sparkle
this bra won't just pop open by itself
how is it that I've come so far  when each evening spent without You is a deadlock?
"our love, so sublime and divine   my lust, so calamitous and dark"
I sometimes imagine that I'm not just imagining. That You're really here.
desire alone is not enough anymore
"""Pain is something to master, not to wallow in."" - Anaïs Nin"
to sleep after loving You
the kind of girl worth growing old with
the only thing stronger than my craving for You is my love for You
a howl in every sigh
every moment shared with You is better than the last
nude butterflies in my belly
"yes, I'll wrestle  but I expect scratches"
unlike memories  moments barely last
one can hear  oodles of love you's
delighted to be proved wrong
the months before we meet seem a lifetime
the smell of her skin  roars the hungry beast in Him into life
the warm feeling  of thinking about someone  and smiling  is much underrated
entirely
intensely
Sir loves her violently
she smells raunchy as dense mud
graciously yielding  a wealth of emotions
zero in then ruin
love isn't as much fun if you're reflective
deeper thrusts  have more meaning
unromantic yet edgy
enticing new fantasies in
I need experiences
feed me privileges
break up  the sobriety of my mind
the dark night feeds into her desire  for discovering things about herself
Your love pounced on the empty spaces in my heart
she longs to belong
"You, all to myself"
she's the sort of secret that you'll have to work hard to discover
her silk blouse sports a print of chain links around the neck
she's a tease and lure devotee
from wild play to sky watching
it all started  with Your ambrosial touch
take ownership  burn Your name on my heart
we come together perfectly
take advantage of my being desirous
let's meet and never say goodbye
Your words are timeless  I'll keep them my whole life
archive my lapses
a hug like a blizzard
eyes like evil bats
cunt like a flamethrower
a mouth like a smash hammer
unexpectedly mended
He stripped back the bare and white walls around my heart  and found it deeply smeared with fingerprints
always seems to know where it's going
causing a stir  like only a tongue can
an inquisitive furrow in His brow  summons all my confessions
my body invites Your mastery  like a blank canvas
Isle of stray
can't think about You without salivating
it'll take a lot to turn her head
she doesn't wear His love lightly
dainty and ladylike  but not on Saturdays
You loosen up the air I breathe  and the dreams I fancy
happy in the anticipation of Your love
a girl as dramatic as the moon
*wears red as a rebellion*
look at all that desire  beading between my legs
touch my skin and give it life
my skin lives in Your hands
drape Your passion on me
bite till the colour deepens
a hug that's merely an afterthought
she's far simpler than you've uncovered
love isn't as easy as sex
she plays the fool because she's shy of her emotional intelligence
"lips, a symphony of ripeness"
the last orgasm  convulsed me right out  of my comfort zone
the dirt You devoured  is just the tip of the iceberg
come at me  guns blazing
go get drunk  so I can be myself around you
why do I enjoy so much vehemence?
I've missed You hope my panties  smell convincing
know what's great?  that You think I'm normal
miles apart  they both look  at the calendar  and smile knowingly
"kisses, beloved of kittens"
"If I seem in want, I am"
amusing You with curiosities and oddities
conformity is key
He wants  exactly what He wants  when He wants it
make me pay
deep  down   will do
forgot what I was going to say
"deep down,"
get me high on testosterone
"""Unconditional love also includes the ardent desire to be abused and out of its devotion the very wish for self-annihilation finally arises"""
*catwalks through the fear jungle*
I want an edge
throw up a challenge
blindfold  so I can focus
the simplicity of laying thoughts bare
I struggle to excel  under Your watchful eye
when You like it I love it
every sassy nerve  beaten soft
blue eyes  charcoal stare
*takes a bucket shower of beer in Your bathtub*
I don't learn lessons remotely
quietly crooning
give my soul some body
and how I would sniff and kiss Your pocket square and let it flatter my neck
and how that subtly textured white shirt would add a sparkle to my nakedness
and how Your belt would swathe my thighs in a smooth chocolate hue
and how I would pair off Your cuff links with my nipples
thoughts of rolling in Your closet surrounded by the garments that touch You every day
the sharpness of Your cool tongue  swivels open the mounds on my chest
crumple to seize
hammer to soften
blow light as air kisses with Your eyes
fill my mouth  and shut out the greedy murmurs
I can't be alone in loving everything dirty
own my breaths with a razor blade cruising between my thighs
"attraction beyond the realm  of simply sensual, sexual or romantic"
dreamed about You last night  and I'm slightly frozen in time this morning
violet not red velvet
mood: black bra under a fluid white fitted blouse
I quite like how You  twist my imagination
sext
“Another hungry day passes.”
lips like dregs of wine
I feel Your mysteries  slowly taking root in my soul
spoilt
sometimes the sunset brings a dip in mood
breasts swelling like a soufflé
slender curves tucked in ropes of pearls
ready to be plunged
the irresistible lure of the deep
textured kisses
she wafts through life  crossing thresholds
You're my reason to live well
mind wide open  in a narrow corridor
You changed the landscape  of my daydreams
that deep breath that's more than  a hint of assertion
I like when You mute me
sugar Dragon kind of Man
love how You have difficulty refusing me
countless pleas  in one exhalation
natural Orator  reclusive Writer
I'll wear a smile  if You give me one
a slave to male elegance
fuck me till You're sweating like a rapist
these miles of separation  make no sense
His soft palms  like eye pillows
mood: liquorice dipped in honey
mood: a forest in spring
expose my vulgar flaws  and put me at ease
won't sleep until she's soaked
water my spirit  You know how
the sun sets and  everything melts apart
the moonlight shapes her dreams  into something beautiful
turn me on  by remaining unmoved
she closes her eyes  and enjoys reality-free alone time
chilling screams make her throat burn
He has never  had to try  too hard
"""A rose has neither a penis nor a vagina a rose on a man is a masculine rose, a rose on a woman is a feminine rose.”"
"""Nothing holds love together like shared vice or collusive perversion."""
always ready to unleash His beast
good girl  gone bad
sweet sharp pain  and then  a mind-turning orgasm
mood: cigarette smoke under a crystal clear sky
radiant innocence  that's impossible to conquer
full-on gunpowder kind of girl
Dominant  as black ink
Dial up the smoke L to R
once Your kisses leave a fervid trail  the anxiety goes very quickly
not merry until full
I know I am loved because I am written about
the tears don't run because the smile never fades
the shock of pleasure
self restraint is toxic
*meditates the night away*
addicted  to the fizz of sin
find me on the right side of dirty
"tender kisses with  ghostly hints of something  very, very male"
love and lust her twin passions
elegant but untamed
say something dangerous  then do it
Unseen gifts are the most significant
You loved me and I became sexier
everything pales before   Your feral growl
I love being a woman
read my smile
make me smell nicer  You know how
His tastes are simple His demands anything but
unorthodox is priceless
It wouldn't hurt this much if You didn't love that much
what's the point of lousy love?
yoga after gin kind of girl
impulse never hurt anyone
a dream named desire
creative destruction
the only thing like Your skin is Your skin
I skip a beat  every time You pause  to think about me
born out of a desire  to come apart
smelling You by memory
at night the pulse deepens
the love I've been looking for  hides in Your soul
Great Sexpectations
impossible is what He does best
illusion hold ups  black suspenders red lipstick
love changed all her tomorrows
love is not sex
are You happy enough to stay?
tears form between my legs as my nerves scream for a release
nocturnal pouter
wish You were here
afraid of being  of no use to You
nothing like a good wrestle  to keep a relationship in shape
be patient  while I polish You off
if only  biting the tongue  could make spoken words  unhearable
the art of showing everything  yet hiding secrets
sex and death  in reverse order
all her shackles  give way in the melt
my mind always wants to wander back to You
bathed in such warming thoughts of You that my silhouette is barely visible
the precious scent  in the air around us  whispers decadent secrets
seducing You with naked sensuality
no rules for soulmates
dreaming something a hundred times is not as good as living it once
I belong  in every corner  of Your bedroom
unzip Your body  and keep me in there
bite me again with Your eyes
unnerve me I love that
the nicest thing about being Yours is having You
sin chose us
Your dirty darling words  leave memorable marks  on my mind
so many hours  since we kissed
You remind me of who I am
what good are unshackled ankles unless I'm walking beside You?
take more of me  when the lights go off
I don't think it's possible to love someone too much
their world is a collision of animalic edge  and heart-stopping fragility
led by the leash and journeying through a new world
over-pour
whack my somnolence with Your cane then hurt and fuck me some more
it can't hurt much more  but that doesn't stop me seeking pain
my scars  make me look purposeful
not as fearful  to bruise
decadently wrapped in black lace  she's no less than a serious weapon
Sir. My favourite word.
heady with Your words  swirling in my mind
temper my morning  with the erotic darkness  of coffee
opened my eyes to the bedroom smelling like bonfire
the good things in life aren't collectible
crush and consume
merrier in the dark
I'm a lady until You make me needy
give me a firm nod there are drops starting to spill from my mouth
a metal collar that always feels warm to the touch
unravel every triviality
show me how big it is   Your home library I mean
building a rapport with unusual emotions
You and I  we've reached new levels of  darkness and warmth
become one with my skin
everything on my face  wants to play around  with the taste of You
the treasure trove of Your words  against  a never ending winter
winning You with unwavering commitment
all of her beauty  is outdone by her spirit
the reality of living a dream
fix me that perfect drink only You can
filth whispered  with a softly-spoken charm
tears like soot dewdrops
make me colourful
all my dreams  at Your fingertips
hurt a little more
His smile is a promise
a heart like a house without diversions
turn on my nights
when love at first sight is also an instant addiction
"words so curiously comforting, as if they have arms that wrap me in warmth"
You touch me and everything in the world is right
love at its best  is a slow-burning romance
dive beneath her smile
You'd be charmed by her simplicity. The girl who likes to collect black and white photographs.
stormy nights are not for the fainthearted
balmy days and sleety nights
"impulsive, but never silly"
"It's the little things, like thinking back, that make a big difference"
laced with Your essence
armed with Your love
her smile is the true reflection of His love
until not too long ago I had no roots or wings
"neither too bold, nor too tame  perhaps like scorched wood"
no worse ill than a pause
hair like dark ocean currents  snaking all over Your bare chest
the word “fuck” is way more complex than people give it credit for
she wears a smile that demands defeat
as sinful as cigarette smoke  on innocent petals
stay longer love deeper  explore further
oh...the erotic power  of His flesh
carnal bliss  with every kiss
can't survive on sunbeams alone I need Your arms around me
I should be moaning and screaming  but I am sighing and breathing
Your words are perfectly in tune  with my thoughts
the discomfort of not hurting enough
shield my heart
kiss and scour  my unpolished beauty
walking into His arms feels like being drunk and tiptoeing in my stilettos through a corridor of power
His is the kind of voice that can drug you
bruise my skin and darken my desires
talk smooth act rough
I feel naked in Your darkness
unmerciful longings and polite punishments
love at first sigh
she's a bad girl at her best
strike me with Your lightening touch
There's nothing like hearing Your voice from memory in the still night
I smile when You fuck me I cry when You fuck me
Fantasising is easy Longing is hard
"He's a man of few, but firm, words"
His skin smells of desire
captive in her own world she found an escape in His
setting new beginnings  somewhere dimly lit and old fashioned
happy memories came flooding back and beautified her with smile-provoking tears
wrestle my limits into submission
*blows You a kiss and sets fire to Your cigar*
hot spirit cold feet
He finds her insolence absurdly cute
dedicated long-distance lover
I feel lucky to be cared for
grip and tighten  whisper and kiss  then tear me down
'tis the moment to brave another night without You
a solemn facade hides a supple heart
"reward, richly"
she is always discreet about a dilemma
quivering sunlight and crimson sunsets
pain isn't my weakness
her swivelling eyes  read His mind  and she gulps
they kiss with relish she barefoot and on her toes  He besocked and firmly aground
wounds that time forgot to heal
cheered up by the strikingly stripy strokes that Your lust left on my body
I count my blessings each time You stir my heart
pleasure and pain  both gladden the heart
December
replicate my kink
He uses His eyes  a lot
a lifetime of caresses and tussles
pitiably burning for You
this wretched wantonness hurts like touching a hot radiator
one bite  that feels like  a hundred hair-fine needles kissed my lower lip
bedfellows forever
her flesh is a dead giveaway
love how there's no getting away from Your voracity
I want a love token
*sticks tongue inside Your button hole and licks Your chest*
want to be loved as if I am poor
have mercy  for safety's sake
even her confessions are works of art
she has a sensually deep hunger within
fill me and keep me  cosy
I'd promise You anything
even the perfume she wears is called opium
her mouth teetering on His chest  a smile on her colourful lips
I want more conversation  Always
the way You always take things one step further
willing to please  infinitely
"kiss so deeply, bite my soul"
"""Miss you"" doesn't quite capture it"
"""Use"" isn't a strong enough word  for what I wish You'd do to me"
sending You laid-back vibes
"""Curiosity is insubordination in its purest form."" - Vladimir Nabokov"
He blinds her with His palm  and she feels the moisture build  before a storm
my underused bed  is within Your reach
little by little  I become ever more Yours
she hadn't thought about escaping  until He strummed her wings and made her fly
a body waiting to be carved
her skin begs exploration
a delicate collar circles my neck  and radiates a heightened sense of Your ownership
those were the days when dolls used to look like little girls  rather than curvy over-glamorous provocative teens
Having faced and overcome so many fears in her complaisance  she learned to never say never
I always find You impassioned
silent longing is a shade that hovers between sunglow and midnight blue
fuck me and calm Yourself
blazing with long-remembered joys
to love You is to become young again
to love You is to be in Heaven whilst alive
to love You is to worship life
fated to crave
devoted to pleasure
obsessed with Your words
the manic desire for captivity
more heat  less light
the clatter of cracks upon leather  just before I feel its fury
You're a shinier version of my life
she's a shy girl  gag and torment if You want her to talk
teeming hearts  for twisted words
the rascality of mingling pleasure and guilt after midnight
be my signature scent
soft smile  tough girl
black symbolises romance like no other
pearly confetti  on pink petals
riding back to redemption
A woman born for love. A Man born to love her.
seriously excruciating  yet sublimely soothing
Not a narcissist. I'm *Your* submissive. Of course I'm beautiful.
amusing You with my optimistic smile
my resistance always  falls short of Your resolve
hold it together
there's a skyline of Your city on my pillow  we sleep closer than You think
ankle deep  in ripe red grape vines
"first off, one long inhalation"
tears like liquid pebbles
she's polite company until sober
call love by any name but labour
twisting in bed  like smoke from a forest fire
I close my eyes  and try to breathe You across miles
animals rule
every swish of her dress  adds flavour to autumn
uplifting pain
just to look at You is to feel  that the world is a beautiful place
strength through conceding
pin me against the wall where the sun shines
He wants to lose himself in me. I want to find myself in Him.
love for me is about loving You
craving a blindfolded meal
eyes gleaming of candlelight  mind swathed in velvety darkness
pain transforms happiness into something very valuable
the way He sticks by His No  fucking turns me on
flawed as can be  but only within four walls
these nipples aren't proud but slightly ashamed  And ready to be pegged
looking the way You do at me  I'd wish You had the decency  to be more vulgar and out of line
the kind of love that reaches out  and strums outworn chords of hope in me
You flatter me when You say I'm difficult
wish I had good reason to sleep
they all came to You broken I came to You to be broken
as much a wildcat  as she is a submissive
audacity is my favourite crime
spanks like confetti
love so powerful only screams can describe it
she starts by surrendering  her innocence
Somewhere out there is a beast  who is hungry tonight
There must be an easier way to satisfy You
I like that You can't have  enough of me
"I burn, You know"
she thrives in captivity
No pain is too severe  for those seeking everlasting pleasure
look at me and remember how hungry You are
Time is the only boundary between us
patience is a torment
To feel Your hands on me  is the only way to fly
It hurts less in the dark
punish my passion
"Please, growl"
Submission  It's more than just a word
test my limits  never my loyalty
I've loved You since before roses even existed
come live in my soul
"speaking of sex, I miss You"
Your hands were made to rip off my caution
Spank me until You have no time left
He's a gentleman  until night falls
being Yours changed me forever
do more than play
I love You the way one loves the first time
loving is messy
savage is sexy
Love that feels like teeth  sinking into my flesh
molten folds  dousing Your fingers
simmering for years  she turned to gold  when He touched her
I may be secure and stouthearted  but my peace of mind lies  in Your dependability.
Every movement has a connection with the soul. So fuck me now. Fuck me hard.
I serve You  because I love You
Not all butterflies are fortunate
She wakes up and looks out for Him. Like a butterfly seeking the spring sun after a dark winter.
Grab hair Tighten grip  Claim kiss
She's edible art
the gift of hunger  for more happiness
in bed  without You  now what?
the kind of person you can't think about without smiling
despite the forewarnings much remains a surprise
let the complexities heighten after every orgasm
fully aware of her eagerness  He begins to tell her   where not to start
*frames Your billiards table with candles*
broken and tainted  yet well loved
Savage eyes that ate me off the bed
Can't seem to restrain urges quite as well as I do my feelings
"I can feel Your thoughts flying in  and settling over me, making me tingle"
lessons in pain are anything but painful
It's a date but only if You will teach me new curse words over coffee
In worse shape than she looks
In private moments I sing Your words to myself
oscillating not vibrating
strip down and mark
she's a whisper of quiet sensualism
This suffering is becoming an obsession
It'll get tougher  if I meet His challenge  It'll be worse  if I fail it
He likes an arch
You're in it for indulgence I'm in it for inspiration
yank that hair till it caresses the ground You walked on
rein in my reason
whip-thin ice
it's the purpose of lust to improve on love
"You are a necessity rather than an indulgence, like sunshine."
*swaps bar for car park*
pull me out from  this surreal time warp I miss You  and can wait no more
my thoughts are up for a re-imagining
when beauty is matched by domesticity
consume all the unloved parts of me
the flame of the candle fluttered not my tongue
sleep can solve anything. Must get some.
razor blades and raucous applause
if it weren't for an eager body  I'd be asleep now
talk to me about the glamour of leisurely mornings in bed
God bless love affairs
wishes lie hibernating in wells  under fine layers of copper
dungeons hide treasures
drool fanatic
content with just a peck
explore the lost parts of me
A touch that leaves her sniffing her skin  long after He has left
how the wind stretches across miles  painfully unknotting barriers
"being alone is murder!, she shouts  breaking the silence  and splitting the moonlight"
wish I could crawl to You right about now
flash my stash on Your fingertips
deprivation humbles
sex should not be a luxury
tears tell better stories than smiles
bite hard and then stub the bruises
hungry bunch of hands  Yours and mine
severity is what she craves
how the darkly intense night wakes to the sound of her sultry sighs
*subtly deploys magic*
unmistakably  effortlessly insatiably Yours
He has this almost physical relationship with my dreams
that smile of His is fatal until it breaks into a broad grin
my deepest fears and deepest desires are all the same
Her appeal lies in the  calamity she invokes
feel my lips blaze a trail  of romantic echoes down Your chest
allow my elegance and Your carnality to meet
warm me up with the blanket of Your palm my legs are trembling under the dining table
"I've dropped my guard  now come, luxuriate  in the splendour of my curves"
the more You tease my mind the more I will speak Your language
imaginations fired by memories
want You more than a whore ever could
spank harder  if I'm without blame
tonight Your heaven hides under a lace-detailed half-cup plunge
It's not a party until she asks someone out.
I'd fight for pain
*transcends burning bridges*
pins and needles on my tongue  from resisting the temptation to suck
took His clothes off  got bitten in return
kiss under the mistletoe  fuck under the disco ball
she wears the collar  and sheds her inhibitions
foreplay so emotional I wept
I'm always smiling  as if You're always watching
rest Your thumb  inside my mouth
warm me up  with candle wax
plumpness in her lips  from the many kisses not yet stolen
eyes that shout out her need to be held  and stroked
making You swoon  by seducing myself
The kind of woman who never announces herself with uninhibited laughter
She sits at the piano  intriguing male fans who pretend to listen
blur the familiarity
I'm a slave to Your darkness for it lights up more than just my eyes
let my hair carry  the scent from Your pillow
the glow on my skin is Your love  that emanates quietly
plant soft kisses  on my heaving cleavage
not just promises  commitment is key
dark corners and rogue sensibilities
her silence adds fuel  to His writing fire
waiting upon  Your predatory pleasures
fantasies that mystify
Your love lures the  committed masochist in me
These days I wonder how I ever got through the nights without longing for You.
The way He touched my heart  concealed all the unsightly cracks
"I love You stern and I love how that's completely, if not easily, changeable"
tore my flesh out trying to please You
endurance until there's enjoyment
mere suffering doesn't mean the end of penance  it's only when I start to revel in it..
her exotic skin  is an antidote to a barren winter
"where hearts are concerned, size matters"
dirty sexy demands
phantom memories
rain-soaked petals  sheltering untold sweetness
make it last all night long   and then start all over at dawn
too innocent for her own good
Can a woman ever have too many desires?
stretch those boundaries  so I fit more snuggly into Your world
put me together
kisses that left imprints of hope on me
"Santa, I have been very, very good this year"
take a bit of me  home with You
be here  until after I've blinked
will do as told  plus a little extra
knowing it's love  is an art too
so bent on You  it's scary
words floating like thoughts   rampant not considered
a moment like a story in itself
so sexy when You're drunk and polite
tell me I'm more than just beautiful
these lace-waist  panties  are sure to  delight the warrior
a choking worth every death
not sure if I like it  not sure I want it to stop
no finer togetherness  than You and I making a riot in bed
sorry my tiara got caught into the ends of Your tie
can't survive until You're a breath away
"Your words so good, I want them to turn bold when I RT"
loneliness leans heavily  and peering into my depths  it settles and swells
the kind of words that make you think twice before they're ready to be spoken
whining wife  pining lover
pretty pinched princess
screams and growls  making sweet music
wrap around me so tight  an impression of my body is left in Yours
a not so silent night
thoughts dirtier than a neglected bookshelf
early night tonight  late start tomorrow
*pens a love letter You'd want to kiss*
better to have a safe word than safe sex
missing You mindlessly
naked and vulnerable  from the neck up
He talks about my impatience like it's my greatest strength
adrenaline at war
treading barefoot  on stacked demands
nothing's meaningful without bother
hurtling my devoted spirit through the strain of torment surrounding me
there's no better way of fear-fighting   than facing it like a submissive
missing that embrace inside Your hyena arms
there's a pit stop and then there's spiritual home
clitoric demise
It *is* possible to know someone too much and still love them.
Your voice does everything my hands can't.
Those with obsessions  learn the hard way
silken dreams and lunar rituals
going to bed  in black satin ribbons
Don't  give me leeway
a plain white envelope  containing nothing but rose petals
"A smile that says ""bite me anywhere"""
nothing beats a darling little good girl
break my mannerisms
"Suddenly, everyone wanted to know why her hair was unusually tousled."
I'd love to know if I got it right
He's more than perfect  She's less than ordinary
give me pain  or pleasure  but not as I know it
Much depends on how much is out of the question
belle of the ball
red for blood white for hope
take me along the secluded route  with not a speck of sun in sight
underrated because she is rustic
unfortunate because her judgements are bad
unwise because she cares too much
His kisses have the power of life
vanilla equates an adventurous soul
down under  then all over
beauty and the feast
can't withstand my wild  make me relax
let Your jewel-bright eyes adorn my bare skin
always warm  is way better than occasionally hot
would You care for some pink flesh?
"""oranges and sunshine"""
it pains to be tough
almost endlessly eruptive
disrobed  except for a pout
Best orgasms are those that make you hungrier
she is His last-night indulgence  and the first morning-after thought
feeling my throbbing pulse against the middle finger  I measure the pleasure
doing as told  except the whining
denial sucks
"I'm always within loving, if not spanking distance"
I'm falling into disuse
The potent allure  of old-fashioned courtesies
He discovered love by accident. Just as she did that first spring dress. Each had found nothing else quite like it before.
cunt like crumpled satin
stay up dancing with me or read to me till I sleep
"It's not just a hug. It's the way I feel cosseted, the romance of sitting in the hills, with the river at the bottom"
let Your devilry flow
His affection reawakens  my bygone youth
The only One she would throw open the doors to her heart for
grab my hair  take the reins
She's an emotive temptress  You will want to test Your limits for
suspend time
memories as a second skin
The thrill of satisfying You  provokes self-abandon
You ask why? Just for pleasure I say.
tears the colour of unresolved doubts
naive girl dangerous thoughts
heart like a paper lantern  delicate yet gleaming
bury love  in a lifelong friendship
Know when she doesn't need tampering with
she dresses up they stay in
*crawls over to the dark side of filth*
draw the blinds  black out my pure
my trust is here to stay now put that safe word away
twist the nipple  and fine tune the moan
fuck me like it's tonight or never
poison my prim and pretty
morning kisses stolen amid gentle greens and soft fog
His lust takes a moody turn  and my suffering is rewarded with soul-baring intense love
Scald my face  with a cum dripping candle
I suspected You'd linger
I'm the modern edge  to Your classic sophistication
selflessly thorough in His loving
All I need  is a break from  my comfort zone
Your words  match my personality
shut the bedroom door  and let our similarities end
she evolves as the day progresses
they like to talk about  a rarity like us
thoughts of You continue to distract me
I don't need to know them. Just say You have plans.
a passion for lesser known evils
*sinks into a scream*
Him: You're my weakness  Her: You're my uniqueness
invent our story
My mouth is in place  Please give a little nod
Your flesh my solace
dodge my eye all you like your heart is beating through your chest hurrying up to me
I took a step back  to feel that powerful pull again
longing in my eyes  gratitude on my lips
etch scandals across my skin  exposing every shred of my shame
Your cherished spot on me is trembling with cold
embrace my advances
Can You feel both our destinies catching up?
put those grabby hands to use already
overtly bold she is not
He stands her in front of the mirror  and the view before them is a postcard of a romantic escape
I persisted yet emerged unhurt
I know countless ways of making You proud
be my guest  this frosty winter evening
tug at the leash lead me to treasure
brushing up my scooping skills under Your watchful eye
do not excuse  whatever the mistake
handcuff me to Your feet
Love me with the combined strength  of a predator and a protector.
It's lovely how You've made my past seem small enough to be knocked off in a single blow.
happy and content in her defeat
panty sniffer  cunt buster
torn between star gazing  and  howling at the sky
keep me awake
She hangs around bookshelves  soaking the whiff of nostalgia evoked by the scent that lingers in pressed flower petals
Ruined for all others and happily so
Spraying leathery cologne  across the empty spaces in bed
Nothing but exceptional gentleness will tame her defiance
sensory chaos
*ends up having an orgasm minutes into interrogation*
few wants  simple tastes
kisses dark chocolate  and sublime confessions
She's a tough little thing  with a silky smooth body  covered in candle wax calligraphy
I need You whatever the hour
*arranges stress relief tablets in the shape of a pair of lips*   *kisses stress goodbye*
Happiness* is just a hot choc away   *insomnia
His kisses taste radical
All these hearts  will get me sunburnt in December
Obsessed with the thought of  rocking and rolling  in a dimly lit backstreet
lip smacking  jaw dropping  mouth watering  mind blowing
hold me at the core of Your fancy
*nibbles on Your tie clip*
creep in and corrupt
nearly midnight  high time to love
to lie alone in a bed for two is vulgar
sick with longing
You are the bloom in my cheeks
All my requests  that were turned down  were really wishes that were granted
Keep her while you can. Unless you want to futilely spend an eternity tempting her to return.
something borderline fatal is needed
Your love is making itself felt in the rich gleam between my legs
storytelling through fingerprints
All my cravings  at Your fingertips
force feed me the cure-all
Youthful not young
Why do dreams always paint a different sort of future?
Making a lasting impression is slow work  No wonder many fail
The secret is in the variety
The kind of intimacy that reduces you to bare bones. That.
Please don't hold back..
Nothing quite like a sweet dream one can remember vividly
New day Same addicts Different adventure
sex sans sophistication
He holds my hand with playful ease but in moments my wrists are enslaved and I go into freefall
seduction thrill destruction
I'm making the conquest easy for You tonight
stay sane enough  to love again
She's resistant by nature  Yet He gets what He wants out of her
inject some virtue into me
Love me differently to everyone else
Is it love if it takes courage to love?
Tell me to slow down
The feeling of being overpowered is a thing of beauty
You teach it well yet make it hard to be patient
impulse hankerer
Punished  because I underestimated  His ability to torture me
How did You already know what I was apologising for?
do me for me
she smiles at Him  and something swells
I make fewer errors writing to You whilst unclothed
Reading... naked
No clamps or spanks  Just put Your lips on mine if You want me to make a sound
The goosebumps give away my fragility
reinvent the feel
I didn't rebel for nothing
strike on request
charming You  with my cabaret talent
"""Ow""  - how she says ""please"" with cock in mouth"
Unspoken desires  quelled into tight lumps in my throat
I come to You with dark hair looped atop my head  my vulnerability exposed to Your love through a pale neck
rolling ever closer towards a barely contained orgasm
Invigorated by the feel of Your fingers  underneath my bra strap
take me unaltered
The private pleasure of Your derrière  and my mouth tucked away in it
To be loved  is safety enough
Is it a sin  to want to be reduced to ruins?
things she does to mimic His touch..
hear out my fantasies  and rest assured  that I'm not as innocent
The addictive allure  of a night on solid timber
He found her  He loved her  He kept her
I waited.  - epitaph
Aching  from lack of Your touch
intimacy commingled with  intent
the bitter pain of waiting for pain  is not pleasurable
cushion the burns  with Your lips
half spooning half assault
Punishable insatiability
The special intimacy between two hearts  over dinner at a shared table
savouring Your attention over a sunset cocktail
whisky passport
Beckoning
Good girl  in the bedroom   Untamed wilderness  at heart
"It's Christmastime, so let's act like it."
As the night breathes outside He looks into my eyes  under the reading light  and smiles at what they reveal
Slither between the gaps in my innocence
Make me feel brave  my mind is blurred with sensation
tender first-timer
bespoke words
Let's swap hugs
Get into bed and sail wherever You want
The kind of girl who looks up smiling and invites the downpour in her mouth
Easier to cum than I used to be
He's got the mouth of a connoisseur
Then there's the  almost but not quite  spurt
You and me Who'd have thought it?
Inspired by the way animals dream
Be my morning ritual
Loved and lauded
imagining You licking Your lips inspires me to write more
That sweet sound of silence  when we're both fully present in the moment
Full of promise
Let's get sexual
corner me  or pin me down  but on occasion I have been known to become airborne
I want to wake up in the dream I had of us last night.
What began with limitations   evolved into something life-long
bites that entice
Shake that stick
"Came back to my senses, glowing"
Starving the soul is not what morality is all about
He'd know in a flash if I've misbehaved
You're not around  yet I know I'm not alone
To devour the mouth that consumes me
When only weeping brings full release..
Fuck me till love is born
I'd release my desire and envelope You in it
Lack of coquetry is one of her charms
*routinely expects violence*
lesson learned each time  and forgotten
more than comfortable  in Your heat
*flirts with Your poetry*
flattery doesn't comfort her
stains that satisfy
can't keep the moans  out of my voice
kiss me  back to bed
rouse Yourself to my need
light a fire and put an end to all this bother
Fine silk rope draping a whore
The kind of woman who always wished the party would end.
She didn't have to look for a soulmate. Her heartbreaker found Him for her.
spread out or lift up
I am Your own little headache
His wild growls cover my piercing cries
He makes the cleverest demands
Ruination by consent  in total silence
The door clicks shut and her decision and daring disappear
A state of bliss where  the tears left me untouched
Obsessed to the point of recognising You just by Your words
"*shoutily*   ""Yes Sir!"""
censured for narcissism
My love means business
a slave of reason
filth on the bed  of a tasteful hotel room
*retaliates Your wrath with a smug smile*
I want to be loved the way I'm fucked. Unashamedly.
Scouring hands  as if in search of my soul
To You I surrender my universe
whisper sweet nothings  then using Your hands  convey the depth of their meaning
So full of emotional ecstasy
The fantasy  to find someone  who will break  all your habits
makes me nauseous to think about the things  that make You hungry
Come back for more
All in the name of servility
Chase that orgasm   Stop for nothing
Too indulgent to feel guilty
An unhurried kiss that guides my mind toward slowness
The kind of sin that makes you realise you never really loved God.
Love me for the dogged devil I inspire in You.
My cheek print  on Your windshield
About as much ladylike as the ocean when it insists on sucking the shore
put Your  personal diary wishes into action
May I call them jewels?
Unsaid words overgrown with moss
Marriages destroy friendships
At this bend  all I need  is You
Give it time  Affections don't just leap  off the shelf
praise me
Understandably  my knees are squealing with delight
few care why
A hive of hurdles between us yet You don't feel far away
Longing doesn't age gracefully
bittersweet anticipation  pleasant aftertaste
Wish love could be found  as conveniently as coffee
I am perfect. Because all His thoughts are faultless.
It took decades for them to notice the brilliance of her modesty.
Love on the house And free refills of sex
misery loves an RT
Feast on me for dessert  after everyone has left the table
What's Your excuse for being without me?
*dares to trust*
Curled up inside my blanket fort  I can smell my skin exhaling Your sins
Biting on my bottom lip  till I'm buried in the depths of fantasy
Fuck me till every yes becomes a no becomes a yes
His signature style? Optimism.
His teeth find me so kissable
A mind full of dirt influence
Your embrace  is something of a mecca
"For sex to feel fulfilling, there has to be mutual respect. Until then, love will have to hold the fort."
That colour on me wasn't from the sunbed.
The kind of woman who wishes she'd remind him of his mother. Just because she wants him to be happy.
Liquid feelings  seducing my soul
I could remain cocooned in Your bed for days
Let me love You like a native of Your tribe
What does it take  to be perfect for You?
Knead comfort in my inner thigh
A pair of supple breasts  beneath a pair of firm hands
I'd nibble on that cock till I get a drink. I mean cork. Champagne cork.
Write to me in teeth marks
She just never stops pondering
I'd rather collect desires than hearts
Stay  only if you are hungry for words  not a follow back
Twitchy and witchy  all I now need is a drink
Let Your darkness rain down on me
Purposefully twisted
God damn I love this high when our souls overlap
Show me in bed what might happen if a parachutist's chances to survive are amiss.
I'll start  You finish
use some mud  and polish my reality
she's only visible  in His spectrum
Let's stick together  till we're an illusion
Dig in deep stay hidden
Fuck me or I'll keep talking too much
She was herself. Till there was Him.
Sought a trifle Found a fortune
Falling in love  is a must
her complexities  keep Him curious
Wouldn't feel half so pretty without Your eyes on me
Sensually curvy smiles hiding below her cheekbones
You are my choicest dream come true
Sometimes a smile is nothing more than a cunning disguise
Rip up the rule book faster than I undress for You
*turns off RTs*  I need to focus on You
To get drunk on You  and have Your senses guide me
Blessed are the souls that carry the spirit of joys past in them.
Cast a spell on my mind  and a glow on my heart
There's something about a burning candlestick that calms. How the flame cuts a dash through the girth of the wick and shines bright.
For You I lay bare  every painful part of my past
He doesn't waver. Not once.
"Look, Sir no hands or teeth"
Satiation paralysis
Spanks beyond number
He loves so deeply  like there's poetry on the walls of His heart
Penetrate my skin
My undoing  courting  Your sway
Let's make our lips chime
Too wet and ripped   to care
Cherry toes on black marble  until our thighs hug  and we swim together in Your bath
I'm a word snob. Only Yours will be heeded.
Keep me forever
Those precious moments when I feel You  before I see You
I feel You
I earned my keep
Led by the heart
Almost everything has all to do with feeling
A simple daily fix  but red only
How is it that You've always got radiant smiles to spare?
Remind me of the dangers of procrastination
Reclaim that hold
Romanced by promises amidst countless candles
It's the dizzying spin of an orgasm I'm after
Lust is too tame a word for what we both want
His desires are unexpected
Ebbed and flowed like a wave  but Your memory never passed away
I touch Your collar around my neck     and bring a long day to a close
Stretch my imagination beyond limits
Beating the blues  by burning bright
Disrupt the order
Come get a little tipsy  on a sweet spread
Striking burgundy petals  languishing on a carpet of fallen leaves
Earned  Not given
No ordinary exoticism
Read me if You dare
He masks my eyes with His palm  and drapes ropes of pearls around my neck
When lying on top of her He's a restless wanderer
Bring me You  or sleep
She's the champagne that thinks it's a beer
Why so agreeable?
"""Smell of nothing stronger than soap and water"", He said before their first date"
I found spirituality through our love
She's the kind of woman who likes to hear the same music as her mother and bake her own pizza.
Caressing Your knuckles with a fingertip like they're my worry beads
She's a long-term kind of lover
Alternate realities can wait
Feel my restraint  trip off Your tongue
Hungry for pleasure moments  without the rigorous rituals
Allow me the deep pleasure  of slipping into Your dreams
Her mind is the least exposed  and most neglected part of her
Tangerine lips  weeping with gratitude  and tasting of You
Prolong the pain this Christmas
"Rebellious, maybe,  but definitely delicious"
Pacify my world a little
Your gaze lights up  every forgotten corner of my heart
her love  lures His lust  to linger
The reward  is worth the chase
I stalked a wolf and I liked it
Burst some goosebumps with that cane
I'd bite that bullet
Thought provocateur
Skin deep lust ripe to be discovered
I might surprise You  by being underdressed
I will endure every whim of Your heart
Your warmth goes beyond my skin
Your chilling bites  bring me back from the cold
Shy smile  extrovert soul
She's a subversive rose  with a compelling need to thrive in a thorny land
Love the way You hide a smile
She's like a flower pulled from the earth by its roots  That sits effortlessly glowing by His bedside
Without You to subdue me  I lack the will to fight
A silk dress with metal studs kind of girl
Fuck me like it's unacceptable  to be so polite
Hot and blue
Got no idea how much I'm loved
Can't love and not trust
Fuck me at Your worst  It's You I want  Not just the best of You
Hard as can be fuck
Submission is more than an interest to me
lie back and snap
I need You in bed  more than You need whiskey by the log fire
More fragile than You think I am
He tortures me in a way I love
Undress me until  my soul is what You see
He sees beyond  to the woman inside me
You don't have to be naked to be sexy.
*kneels at Your doorstep*
Comfort-craving painslut
Love me out of my obsession with decency
We intensify passion
As intense a colour  as You can draw out of me
Out of breaths  every time I stop to think about You
Love me despite the danger of banality
Beautiful in form strong in spirit  she defies her own fragility
Less well versed  but just as expressive
My most favourite dress  is the one You find easiest to pull off
Dreams of us lingering on the mind uplift my soul each morning
A profusion of dew laden petals  burst in bloom on Your tongue
Snuggling is the secret to happiness.
I'd keep the snowman company  if he wouldn't crackle and flame
Everywhere You touch should be bruised
Let me draw some of Your attention
Threat of loss overwhelms her
Take my heart  Give it Your love
Don't just say  Do something special too
There's room for all in the slaughterhouse.
Raised skirt  Lowered lashes
It is Your boundary-pushing love  that defines me uniquely
Let Your lingering gaze  be the finishing touch to my beauty
*swallows all the rules*
The night pales in comparison  to Your poise
Eat my reservations
Skepticism makes you hungry
I'd deify You
Coexistence is love
The romance of being drunk together
Everything You are  is love
"A sharp biting sting  Yes, I like that kind of thing"
Shimmering  and simmering
Crooked to the core
Without a compliment a day a woman is lost
Spoil me
Let's be together  at last  if not once
Sleep in my dream tonight
He even loves   my most regrettable self
I will smile  But not until Your eyes are on me
I know in my soul  I'm Yours
Let's take the long way back to reality
She's a hoarder of words  that bear wishes.
Smouldering idly  like an unloved cigar
Let me help You wrap a present by bringing my wrists and ankles together
He showed me how  the most imaginative fantasies are dreamed and lived
Temper my femininity  down to the ground
Boundless cares   hardwired across her heart.
I want to see lovebruises on my body  whenever I undress
I took Your love note and rubbed it gently  against the inside of my wrist
Waking up before the sun  leaves one cold
Unashamedly sensible  Mildly odd
Nothing if not  Irresistibly strokable
Put me on top  of Your Christmas wish list
Fuck like it's a compulsion
A woman's heart is more resilient  than most would believe
Big leap of faith  serendipitous circumstances  and here we are
Chemistry is all about contrast
I love everything Your eyes imply.
The colour of her cheeks  evokes warmth and hope
The night is her veil
Blow my blues away
Bonfire of delusions and instincts
Return..
He strokes my bottom  as someone would the tail of an exotic animal
*speaks without permission*
Censure me  with Your shirt off
Forget coffee  Would You like to stay forever?
Amidst pleasures of Sadism  I found my place in the universe
Beautiful weakling
If love is a crime  lock me up
*kisses You again*
Bet You thought I died  from that punishment
Not heroism  it's her basic nature
You and I  love and lust  on shuffle
Each whisper  in treble
RT me  Lose a follower
When it comes to mercy  hold back
Get me up  the steep learning curve faster
Got an awful lot of shame to lose
A keepsake saved my day
This reality is true to my dreams.
We fit together like a dream
It only takes one thought to lift my spirits: You can't unlove me.
Life's well lived when one's well loved
Let my calves  grace Your shoulders
I'd never give up the struggle.
Seek my fears out.
Accursed with words worth misremembering
Come meet my longing.
Old-fashioned girls are in vogue.
Sipping pink champagne  and prising You away from the crowd with bewitching eyes
Dress my lips with Your kiss
She will wow You with the signature style  of fresh flowers in her hair
A million sluts claiming Your words  as their personal therapy
Scribbling solemn wishes  on a tough tree-bark
The passion for letting things go..
An empty cage is a beautiful sight  for it celebrates liberation
Love the way You stroke my play-worn body
The moon's too dim for such a beautiful night
She loves book fairs and trolling for decor inspiration
Obsessed with symbolism
Together  let's escape  the long reach  of a bitter winter
"The power of the word ""Mine"""
Years on and it still catches me by surprise  when You call me Yours
Perhaps she has a smile that's too precious to wear everyday.
Not just a collar  it's her chain of hope
She's hard to resist after dark.
He is what every woman wants a Man to be.
"I've had dreams and fantasies in my time, but I've never experienced anything so surreal as Your touch."
You seem to have the kind of voice I lost a long time ago.
Your soul  my inspiration
Bend me  to Your will however many bites it takes
My scars were meant to heal. You found me.
Your cane on the base of my foot feels like I'm tip toeing on barbed wire.
You must feel worn out from being thought of so much.
She suffers to be beautiful.
Love me now. We can talk about forever later.
Her curiosities reflect her simplicity
She's vulnerable because she always gets fallen in love with.
My freedom  begins with You
Read to me  between my lips
Your presence  is orgasm enough
Kiss Spin Repeat
My hair grazing Your ear My lips on Your cheek My pearl pendant rippling Your drink
Let me inhale Your kisses  before You make me choke.
He writes the kind of poetry that makes me trust words.
The pain edges towards pleasure as I do the unthinkable for You.
Come find me  lain undisturbed  like a vintage doll ready to be enjoyed
Wish he'd have put the kettle on  instead of just leaving his number.
Discipline the hell out of me.
She's not just pretty words.
A riot of little black knots  patterned on my purple tights
Always a privilege  not a right #sixwords
Treat or treat?
Did You feel my tongue  coil?
You say thin ice  I say thick skin
I accessorise  to try Your patience.
Wish our worlds collided more frequently.
Fuck me till my sins  are buried in the wall.
The kind of place where there's only You who can hear me scream.
Ruin what's Yours.
Bruises are just  the beginning
Left my perfume on Him took His heart with me
My heart feels like I've never seen the ocean before.
I'm right for You.  You write for me.
*pleads romantically*
A slut for keeps.
Lock up her mind first.
Does darkness have a limit?
I want to reach the limits of Your darkness
You can't imagine my love. It's infinite.
Stripped of all purity
You decide  which dream becomes reality
Fuck me like You're  creating/destroying  evil
Take me  further than fear
Sir knows best.
I'm a slave to Your pleasures
Making each other happy  is what being soulmates is all about.
The thought of You  wanting to ravish me comforts me
His eyes wait to see  the glory of her desperate need  to please Him
Pooled at Your feet oscillating with arousal melting like sand embracing the sea
Growl at the slightest provocation
He wasn't made for loving just once  or being loved by just one.
Beautiful love  dangerously expressed
Peaceful to give in. Sinful to give up.
My mind's a wreck. But my heart is blooming.
Am I to earn it every time?
Getting accustomed to believing in the beauty of life.
There's a sensual touch of toughness  in Your armour-like embrace.
Look into my eyes and You will know that I really need a drink.
Accepting pain is the easy part. The admiration I command in Your mind is beyond overwhelming.
Blindfold me I'm in need of escapism
Quivering lips at clipping edge  aching for Your merciful touch
Didn't hush Got gagged
Peg marks like a string  of poppies  around my nipples
Kiss by kiss  time ran out
Every time I see You You're smiling at me.
Moonshine where You are Sleeplessness where I am
To walk hand in hand  with the One whom I bow to is a privilege.
Bedeck me with a crescent of teeth marks  below my lower lip.
Without further ado  I hop onto Your lap
Little girl in big knots
Beads of Your sweat  dripping down and floating across my closed eyelids.
I writhe and roll around  lusciously on Your tongue.
Deliver me some evil or I'll raise hell.
"Don't know much about drugs except that pain is one, and I am addicted to it."
"Strange how I used to find it peaceful to dream about the uncertain. I still dream, but it's believable."
Atrocious moments  of feeling empty  without Your touch
Our love lingers endlessly  through lust-saturated moments.
Mesmerising murmurs  filtering through Your palm  pressing over my mouth.
Those warnings You gently whispered awakened my senses.
Ten kisses  of submissive proportions  One for each of His toes
Gratification through suffering
I dream as much as I should.
Love that smile I see  when He catches me thinking something naughty.
Placing dribblesome kisses on Your belt while I choke on the ball gag.
Bruise is the new black.
"She endures without a whimper, so not to miss hearing Him say ""I fucking love you"" under His breath.  That's how violently she loves Him."
Moments so surreal  I forgot about the pain.
Spasms in my throat  Your groans in my ears
Say You know it hurts  and then overdo it.
Love. Let's make it.
I will cling to You  like summer underwear.
No one can ever tire of being told how much they're loved.
All You need to do to make me moan is to tap lightly and invite me to bed.
Love at first bite.
We are  my happy story.
Fuck me till it hurts  Love me till I'm complete
A down to earth Man taught her how to fly.
"How I love that You call my excess, moderation."
There's still time  for You to buy me a last drink.
Corrupt me in the moonlight.
The moon tonight belongs to the era of sex appeal.
Your words  make me ache  and seethe with arousal.
Sitting at the end of the bar sending You my love.
"So drunk on one another, they forgot who put whom to bed at night."
The kind of touch that brands the soul.
"Every night, He shows her things she didn't know about love."
He loves to hear her talk by squeezing her.
Fingers like date pits. Sticky and suckable.
"Tonight, skip the foreplay."
You and me  in a place where  the night never ends.
You live in  my thoughts my heart   my secrets
Your pleasure is everything I love about pain.
She dresses for seduction and undresses for love.
I crave the tenderness  that lies in the hands that crush me.
You are my once in a lifetime.
I want a spanking. You decide what for.
She's a mystery He nailed down  with one look.
Plant a few kisses  in my cleavage.
My dreams have a face.
Love doesn't know  the meaning of enough.
Let the heat of Your passion  ruin my sanity.
I think about the times I spent without You in my life Then smile and remind myself that I deserved more. I deserved You.
From upon my knees  to over Your lap.
Strip search me  to find the heart You claim I've stolen.
A spank is what love sounds like.
Addicted to arousal
I'm His favourite book. The one He takes to bed.
I am homesick for Your arms.
He steals kisses from my mouth  while they're still only sighs.
My heart blooms until my breasts swell.
The wait is over. The want goes on.
I want to smell of You.
I use my days  to make myself pretty for You.
I like my coffee strong. And my Man wrong.
I think of You  and love smiles through everything.
Why dream when you can live it?
It's intimidating when the challenge seems simple enough. Because it means He is thinking a new kind of evil.
Are we ready to go to bed yet?
Pleasure without pain  just won't do.
Tug at my leash and usher me over the threshold.
Use my tears to wet my lips.
Fate does not have the power to alter memories. They will always remain absolute.
Unbuckle and herald the start of the evening.
Orgasm as perfect as a sonnet.
It's lovely how we chortle in sync.
Salty hot tears tempered with  the sticky honey sweetness  of Your lips.
She is an indulgence to take one's time over.
What You see is just a fraction  of what You'll get.
I'd love for You to read my diary.
Welts thicker than my skin.
"""Shhh"" Hundreds of butterflies  sedated with that one word You say."
No teeth  Only mouth
Pinned with  a crown of kisses.
Watching You enjoy finger slivers of me.
I see another world when the candle is out.
Tell me how many throbs You hear on the way down.
"Mornings are a slow poison Evenings, the antidote"
You are my escape  from everything conventional.
It may be autumn now  but my spirit is passing through a field in summer.
I could kill every emotion  except the desire to hold You just once more.
Inspired by dragons
I'm in need  for some serious comfort.
Because You always listen I've learned to talk without arguing with myself.
"Him: ""Start to count.""  Me: ""Down from?"""
I can't crawl trussed!
That scream  was a desperate cry for more.
Pulsations for kisses  because my mouth is taped shut.
Intimate conversations by the roaring fireplace  is how I want to spend all my winter evenings.
No tricks  Just treats
His smile subtly takes control.
I'd kneel by the edge of Your bed all night  if such a thing were permitted.
"Dedicate a whole day to me, the morning after."
The lasting charm  of trenched autumn leaves  silent and beautifully fallen into ruin.
His resolute touch  versus my unwaning naivety
I celebrate life  in the way that You love me.
Never the same punishment twice  is why I'm so inclined to err.
Hold my hand and lead the way from the dance floor to Your doorstep.
"The way You changed my world, I only see happiness in my future."
The whole concept of relieving pain is overrated.
Soaking wet eyes  Not a trace of pain
What joy to have my longing murdered.
"signs off letter as ""young one"""
I'd smoke Your sex appeal.
Do something tonight  so I wake up overdressed.
Fantasising in the dark and growing warm.
Lure me to destruction.
Add me to Your collection of drugs.
All my words bear wishes.
Against all impossible odds I got You.
*mimics Your growl and giggles*
Lights go off Need strikes
Having enjoyable company can be intoxicating.
You are my most sublime blessing.
Autumn so beautiful  words fail me
What is love if not us?
"Blindfolded, handcuffed and gagged  yet her flesh is full of scope for expression."
I want the perfect  depth of darkness to live in.
You make it easy to see that ways to renew hope are never far behind.
"Little sleep, so many dreams."
Doublespeak is the new war.
Evil loves innocence.
Everyone's a whore. We just sell different parts of ourselves.
There will never be enough I love yous.
My mind  and words  keep returning to You.
Love's a lot like brandy. Good for the heart.
Anytime is erotica time.
Extraordinarily devoted  Hopelessly delirious
Whip the dirt out.
Sinning feels perfectly human.
Hair and lips  being pulled  in different directions.
Safer to endure than scream.
To be gripped  between warmth  and intensity.
I want Your skin.
Bedbound  through hell's way.
Prepared for the evil that awaits me.
Nighttime is a trap.
The magical reality  of living a fantasy.
Ready for Your lesson.
All I had to do was beg.
I'd suffer for the privilege  of living dangerously.
Armed with bruises ready to fly.
You created what I always needed.
All my fantasies are contained within Yours.
I yearn for the comfort of darkness.
*nuzzles Your footprint*
"Every time I open my pretty eyes*, I want to find You there.  *thighs"
Such an aura of decadence  it's as if the Devil invented her.
Still my old self only tamer.
Easy to misunderstand Tough to love
The kind of fragility  that survives against all odds.
For the price of a Kindle I could get myself such pretty bookmarks.
A craving has barged uninvited and could get out of hand.
Kitten loves You.
Nibble away at my restraint.
Tumultuous passions  softened by the pillow.
Barely warm...
A goodbye kiss  harder to forget than heartbreak.
Holding Your gaze  tempts me away from mischief.
This bracingly sinful desire  to touch You all over is not the kind easily assuaged.
An anticipated letter full of unexpected caresses
Dedicated to nuances.
A firm hand holding mine  and sweetly quieting my demons.
Tickled by Your love abundantly flowing down my neck.
Kneeling before You calms my tendency to worry.
Around You  I'm a blossom that blooms  from dawn to dusk.
Night-blooming breasts  beating like a heart  inside Your mouth.
Pursuing gratification  not perfection.
Kisses like stormy seas of emotion.
Impulse makes incredible things happen.
Woo my senses
Often mistaken for being perfect.
I've hardened my resolve  to soften Your will.
You wouldn't see my vulnerability  if I didn't want it to encourage You.
Your words  fulfil my strong need for stability.
*lets go of routine*
I love how Your embrace instils a sensation of freedom.
She revels in defying  the definition of innocence.
Two sets of lips  fighting over a pellet of ice.
*obeys unfussily*
The kind of girl who grew up wanting to be friends with a monster.
I can't remember a time  You weren't in my dreams.
My heart's on a holiday.
"Every time You want to compliment my beauty, tell me I'm a great mum."
'Tis the season  that evokes memories.
Early-morning moans leaping in the air.
Poetic yet simple
Imperfect  yet unique
Tired of creeping in I want to stay grounded.
Conjuring a million and one fantasies  to the sound of spinning vinyl.
Hug me tighter. I'm yearning for summer.
"We are both in a beautiful space, surrounded by intense love and true to our best selves. The cherry on the cake is lust."
She adds to His natural charm.
It all started with an evening stroll.
My decadence  reveals Your darkness.
I'll touch You while I can  and love You forever.
Alluring even when He's silent.
He is Irish.  She is the whiskey.
Some moans were saved up kisses.
You're always with me right over here  behind these goosebumps
*rolls eyes suggestively*
I love Him when He spoils me. And He spoils me all the time.
Love me enough to keep me confined.
Sighing in the dark  Quivering like a fledgling raring to flee.
Lips trembling to welcome Your love.
*clasps You to my breast*
One last scoop of His tongue and she plunged off the edge  like a cache of drugs driven back into the sea.
Stars were made to burn.
Church bells for an alarm clock. Just a passing perversive thought.
She lived in the hope that someone would come and blur the line between morality and scandal.
Crumbling like a wild flower  drooping in the summer heat.
In a blink of an eye  I am throat-sore.
Eden
Warrior by day  Slave by night
*seduces You into staying in*
Let's do nighttime things in the dawn's clear light.
The air I breathe around You is an instant antidote to the chaos I live through.
You left me longing for one more kiss. You always do.
How about I listen without looking?
Your love allows my boundaries  to change.
Breath worn  Sex weary
"Sadly, I'm not here to make you laugh."
Consider Yourself wished for.
"In short, hardcore soul overhaul."
He is certitude  at its absolute best.
You're drawn to me   and I feel beautiful than I ever thought possible.
"She wears a prideful smile and walks elegantly in a cocktail gown, wondering if they can hear the rasp of wood splinters scraping her knees."
Love is not fragile. Trust is. #sixwords
His kiss left me with a mouthful of wine.
The kind of reality that makes you wonder if it's all a dream.
Fuck me till no screams escape.
Her mind is the Devil's tool.
I came here to hide. You unveiled me.
No truer love than the one that believes in miracles.
*begs again*
Rest Your eyes  while I dream enough for both of us.
The sombre grey skies  are beginning to cause a stir among lovers  to huddle round the fire.
Big decisions  are rarely difficult.
Promises gone brittle.
He's more than the sum  of my dreams.
Few relationships stay true to the past.
I'd watch Your back in the mirrored ceiling.
Make me feel  a little more subversive.
A smile is the first weapon  in the armoury of seduction.
Artfully arranged limbs  exposing scars worn with panache.
The clock is conspiring against me. A hunger for You sets in just in time for midnight.
Hearts that inspire affection  by always loving regardless.
Less expressive yet no less beautiful.
"Soaked and sloshed, right into Your lap."
Anticipation that quickens the pulse  is foreplay.
I often talk about You to myself.
Safeword invalidated
When love is an unforeseeable ending to a romance. That.
Pursuits of innocence  in little wet panties.
Everything's fair in the war of love.
Delicate but kinky
Ruined to perfection  Slain with passion
Autumn smells as good as a cold damp cellar.
He's got the natural gifts  of a treasure hunter.
Love determines fate.
Spoil me with a free refill. #sixwords
My bravery  to Your challenge.
Enticed to return
I love how varied our perversions are.
To have a place of strength to rest my head on. Bliss.
Let's dance* like everyone's watching.   *fuck
As the sun rises  she fights to keep under His shade.
The genius of the best enchantment  is often simplicity.
I am now humiliated to the point where I must have more of You.
I'd have gone the distance but the ocean got in the way.
One last tearing pull
A reward hard-won and all the more precious for it.
The beautiful silence  of being deeply humbled.
I light candles around the room  but the bed still doesn't feel as inviting.
Scratches Bruises Pools of tears Ripped tights  And a deep sense of accomplishment.
Punishingly hot caresses
I love You for bringing me back to life.
I am  one of His poems.
Delight me by making it hurt.
Trust like ours  doesn't die.
Wrap me in Your arms   and soothe the windburn.
"To wit, to woo"
Provoking You by adjusting my lipstick  in the surface of Your belt buckle.
The constant pleasure of being loved in an uncertain world.
His bare feet  impactful and marble
Trust You never to forsake  the power to protect.
All my worshipful kisses long to live  in the graceful curve of Your palm.
With my head between my knees  I spy You leaping out at me.
I'd be totally pleased  with learning the hard way.
He was kind enough to kiss her She seemed simply lost
I'm so in love with  Your vibrant old-world manner.
Ruler-straight scratches on my back as if to reclaim the deviant in me.
Roughly embraced  just as I start to crumble.
The best opportunities tend to arise when you least expect them.
A bounty heaven within four walls.
You are the dream in my eyes  when they overlook the sea.
Being Your slut is the elitist I'll ever be.
Her fragility may hold a powerful allure  but the sporting spirit is a lot more sought after.
He takes pride in her strength that    few have ever seen.
The fingerprints on the mirror  remind me of the rigours I survived.
What could be more exciting  than to experiment continually?
Nights will be spent  savouring the subtleties with which You shower love on me.
Love makes a gentleman of any man.
Smother me in Your sweat.
I'm losing my mind. It must be love.
Bright eyes  Dark secrets
Heart of a submissive  Soul of a warrior
Lost myself  to find myself
His passion for the exceptional  keeps me on my toes.
Scribble sweet nothings on my soul with a carving knife.
Desirable  not acquirable
Rinsed down with calm  by a simple memory of You.
The kind of past  that is ever present.
It's hard to imagine now  but we were strangers once.
Surrounded and spellbound
Sometimes He's too old to take her seriously. And that's exceptionally pleasing.
You.   Nothing else comes close.
Pocketful of temptation
Colour me intense  and heighten my beauty.
Take over  when I  break down   #sixwords
And now when I look in the mirror  I recognise a familiar image.
His ownership of me is constant  not mutable.
It is because of our love that the lust has a meaningful taste.
The sweet smell of power.
Can't make sense of anything  but it's not scary.
More sexual healing awaits me in the room He has filled with flickering candles.
Feeling giddy with a concoction  of happiness and satiety.
To show You my love  from under the table
Usher me into the shower I'm ready to get dirty
I feel reassuringly calm when You  cup my head in Your large hands.
Make me feel extraordinary  in extraordinary places.
Nothing if not persuasive
Lead me across a dirt track  and push me into the grass wall
Drips of wax  washing the need out of my skin.
Uncomfortable  yet relaxing
Deepen the level  of intensity.
Propped against the wall like an artwork  waiting for His finishing touch.
*tucks Your jacket under my chin*
Without You  I would have no story.
A broken girl  trying to live in a broken world.
Sex appeal lies in the character not just the face.
I've learned not to fight it but to love it
The night is both  an ending and a beginning.
Ouch is the language I speak the best.
I taste the love  more than the humiliation
Seated with a cocktail  seems a long way back to reality
The present sparkles.
Dancing in the rain  to the sound of old school jazz
Be my luxury  on a desert island
Making a whole new life from patches of love earned.
Ankle weights  to keep me grounded
Tempted  to go off course
He's a Dominance doyen.
He's got a stash of vices  but is all about understatement
A heart like a house  that wasn't made for living in.
Not every chance discovery  is a soulmate
I draped the furniture with lingerie  And invited Him on the floor.
She's got a penchant  for provocation.
"New ways to be debased,  if nothing else."
Swaddle me  in the thick blanket  of Your gaze  for as long  as You want.
Endless possibilities  limited only by imagination
Linger in me for longer
"Unless there's a frame of delusions, the heart can't shatter."
Loved so intensely He left me hooked Literally.
She will embrace the art of simplicity and then strike You with it.
"Running my fingertip over the creases on Your knuckles Relishing this moment of gently touching Your hand As I lie beside You, smiling"
"Eye-protein, not eye-candy."
I'm not afraid  to fall or grow sink or swim live or die.
A soul so full of pride  it wants to be seen.
Too much of a good thing  is even better.
Sore and disorientated yet undeterred
Your goodnight kisses  have become part of my face.
Let's spend a night  camping under the stars.
You are the very best of me.
Carve me a reality  better than the imagined world  of Alice in wonderland.
I crave connection  not just touch.
Allow me  the privilege of  experiencing Your love  singularly.
A fuck so good  it left me refreshingly free of arrogance.
Sometimes believing is all I have.
Life happens  at the edge of night.
Innocence is more powerful than evil.
One of life's most valuable lessons  has been to learn to take No for an answer.
What's the night for if not to love?
He doesn't miss much. He bites everywhere.
In an ideal world I'd have You.  In this world I need You more than anyone.
All wrong things done the right way
What's He to me? Life.
Open those arms I'm coming for You.
Endurance
So far apart yet we think and act as one.
I might surprise You and suffer forever.
You're as responsible  for my anomalies as I am.
Shake a leg  against my derriere.
Kisses You back twice
Fix me a cheap drink One that hits harder
Missing You
Souls awaken behind closed doors
Called forth to fulfill a wish.
Sway my dreams so forcefully  they end up scattered over my reality.
She's a rebel without a cause The kind you just can't leave alone.
Once strangers  Now God's chosen ones. #sixwords
In anticipation  of forever.
The love lies in the curse.
The cure lies in the pain.
The aches have settled  Memories of the violence remain.
I'd rather see a blizzard of black snow  than feel Your hand being lifted off my throat.
To slavery!
Isn't it breathtaking how I stumbled into the heart of Your darkness?
The illusion of reality versus  the reality of dreams.
No greater loss than being unable  to grow old together.
My idea of heaven is a place  where You ruin me and don't feel sorry when I pass out.
Waiting  not praying
*lusts upon Your brutality*
Moans that sound like they're coming from a lost soul.
Don't like that thing You do But I love You So I'm gonna let ya!
Makes me smile to think how we both draw disparate pleasures from my unfamiliarity with sexual deviance.
I found Your pleasure contagious  and let the pain of slavery   get the better of me.
My luminous eyes  take their gleam from Your sated smile.
I pity the hearts  that aren't wired to Yours.
Kiss me so my mind can take a rest.
Dominating me with delicate kisses.
Fierce pleasures  in a simple touch.
In Your absence  perfume keeps me company.
Come say a friendly hello in the dark.
Bruises  the colour of blackcurrants  that taste like salted caramel.
Fantasies are like lost letters  that did not not reach and cannot be returned.
Talk to me  all night long in breaths.
As natural as unprincipled sex.
Small joys they come my way  once in a while.
Dreams sometimes stalk reality.
"The best title for a woman is ""Little girl""."
Little did I know  that my body is  good for something  other than suffering.
Thoughts of You don't just occur at night.
You put the cause  in my acquiescence.
If it wasn't for thunder  who would fall in love with the sky?
Appealing as pleasure  Intense as pain
To be fired upon with Your mouth  as I submerge beneath You.
Trembling at the sound  of my own silence.
"""I love to lose myself for a good while."" - Friedrich Nietzsche"
Nocturnal daydreamer
There's a thrill to  bordering on the indelicate.
Deprive me  of the ordinary.
Your absence  bears death.
Love that caused  an obsession with the heavens.
"""How do I cope without you because such as you happens almost never."" - Anne Sexton"
Tighten Your grip  Dent my sensitivity
Spit and purify.
Skinny dip into my  imaginative pool of wild fantasies.
Degraded to the point of feeling like a million dollars.
My growth needs to be Your focus.
The brooch on my chest reframes the teeth marks on my breast.
Give me a generous dose  of opposition.
Gasping a mile a minute.
Orgasming beyond  the auditory threshold.
Thriving   not just fleeting  emotions
Soul cleansing  filthy fuck
With You I see the inner me.
One is glad  to be of service.
Real morality lies in  following one's own heart.
Do I look barely hurt  with just numb breasts?
The sweet confusion of losing  all boundaries and all time.
Make a determination  of Your want of me.
To live for all eternity  as something desirable.
Those wild screams were just  a victory celebration of my love life.
To vanish forever  in Your heart.
There's a time for slaving and there's a time for sighing. Tonight is the latter.
"""Louder.""  'You, Sir!'"
Spill a little something  down my throat.
If nobody sees it You didn't hurt me enough.
Your love My privilege
High tea is the new nightcap.
I need Your words  to ward off the silent night.
My fingers are ink-stained yet the page is blank like a clean slate.
Penning protestations of loneliness  And flinging balls of paper in the loft.
There is no knowing when the need might spring into life.
I'll bend Your forbearance  to my unrelenting struggle.
I have a terrible weakness for slow communication and enjoy the anticipation of a response.
I wonder what a letter I would receive from You would say.
Why do we write letters?
As evocative as faded ink on aged paper.
As persuasive as a handwritten letter.
As dainty  as she is tough.
Love like a firefighter Sleep like a winner
I'll save my vulnerability  for the end.
I'd dress in a gown for You on the coolest of wintry days.
You found in me a Goddess who hadn't been worshipped for even one day.
Surviving is not relevant. Living is. And You make me feel alive.
Seducing You with storm-defying eyes.
Give me something I haven't felt before.
An urgent kiss  at first blush
Your mind all over me.
Two hours with You in bed is all it takes to get to the moon.
Hush me so I can't hear  my own thoughts.
A fuck like a soul injection.
Provoking You  with a playful grin and dashes of rebellion.
From a new height in irreverence  she emerges beautiful as distressed silk.
With a single touch  He makes a rose shine.
"Among the many joys of a handwritten letter, are Your claw marks on my back."
You may feel it beating against the base of Your foot but we both know where my heart lies.
Look me in the eye  for I wish to know my future.
His word  is the voice of God And it often gets  too dangerous.
We were always connected. One spark one day worked its magic.
Shut the door Leap for me
Can't sleep because I hear growls in the dark.
Each limit  is to be challenged  Each fear questioned.
Love chose to unite us.
Stop me fussing  right this moment.
It is too painful  and my breathing has changed  But I want to move past Your limit  that's what's beautiful.
You remind me of a scandal.
There are secrets in every corner of my heart. Yet I am pure of intention.
On the edge of tears  Yet I feel there's nothing to fear.
I heard my spirit  speaking of You.
I'll do my very best  not to scream.
It's Your breath I listen for  so that I may sleep.
She is led by love.
Finger licking dirty
I trust this love  will keep growing.
Our bond  is not confined  to the physical.
He holds my world on His shoulders so I could take the weight off my feet.
The joys of flying high
Whatever my needs  You have them covered.
Don't get me roses. I want these.
He's immune to any manipulation.
Honoured  if not addicted  to be brought down.
I've accepted I'm never actually in control. Therein lies my happiness.
Weary with satiation yet full of monster cravings.
There is no person I can't become for You.
Desperate measures
Desperate times
She has a choice. And she chooses to struggle.
Take it all Give it all
Leaning towards  and crashing into  solace.
Humbled by unknown pleasures.
Achy and sore  Scalp included
Such intensity  And no time to linger..
Love hurts. And how.
This fervent perseverance  will be my destruction.
The way Your tongue soothes my lips  circling along the swell  from the ball gag in my mouth.
This lioness  ain't no kitten.
Adrenal rush of debasement.
Breasts for snack.
A prayer is best said *before* the sin is committed.
My body quivers with feral passion until it's firmly subjugated and overarched by Yours.
Dreams  wrapped in hope will never decay.
Impulses as far from purity as I could possibly imagine.
The least experienced one  can be the most improved.
The future belongs to those  who know where they belong.
Awoken by fear.
One night  Countless moans
Lost all my innocence  in a war-like love act.
I'll never be adult enough  to not be owned.
Pain is a drug.
Mad about You like a freaking gold digger.
Impregnate my mouth.
How do You define forcefully?
Sophisticated yet fun.
Everyone likes everything He writes.
I stand a chance  of a reward  when I'm kneeling.
Part slut Part Angel All Yours
Use Your tongue  to wipe my tears.
You really shouldn't catch me delighting at the blessed sight  of You in repose after an orgasm.
Love how You mess with my appearance.
Risk taking suits You so much.
Kiss me once  So I know what glory tastes like.
To love is forever.
I would never disrespect You by locking the bathroom door.
How romantically His mouth tears open my pussy-bow blouse.
Dying to be immortalised as *Yours*. #sixwords
You are my first glimpse of pure evil.
An intimate relationship with a family feel is a bliss known to few sluts.
Let's overcome my fears together.
Pain heals. Glory lasts forever.
Contact sport is my favourite kind.
Touch me right where it hurts.   #sixwords
Winning You has made me  respect myself more.
Memories and longings come alive  in my bed every single night.
I like insistent torment but  my goodness  gracious!
My heart is full.
Your way is hard. Let's do this Your way.
Work all day Work it all night.
Dead set on suffering  like the wind that blows  toward the storm.
*falls into place*
Reach out to take my hand And I'll risk the dark for You.
"Something important, inside of me, glows when it beats. What is happiness to You?"
I'll never tire of pursuing dreams of You.
She appears sadder  while holding a martini.
What I long for  lives in me.
I got sunken cheeks  And I need Your magic.
She: Don't forget me.  He: I won't remember anything else.
What do You mean by yet? #sixwords
Omit needless silences.
Gathering all the words You've said  and writing myself a love note.
Absolute power that He exerts absolutely.
Weary from all this yearning.
She's beautiful when she's patient.
I am insane.  And You are my insanity.
"""The sphere of Woman"" ~ C. Bowman"
Feed my suffering Make it last
The kind of protected  that only a Sadist can make her feel.
Night falls  Love begins
The luxury of suffering intensely  and feeling myself  being born anew.
Keep at it  till I sound like  I'm starting to enjoy it.
Don't You just love the sound of Your own voice?
I blush when I see  You hearing all my thoughts.
She blows shimmery white bubbles in the bath  And He howls like a wolf who's just seen the moon.
Not just a kiss You blew happiness my way.
Rock me on Your foot like a princess.
You're tougher than my collar.
May I have 69 words with You?
I'll play a song  that'll make You want to kiss me.
I'm a torture magnet.
Write me a truth  that will live forever.
Too fragile to be held responsible.
Tell me a secret. It better be evil.
You are my journey home.
Do everything imaginable  and we can then talk  about boundaries.
What if I open my eyes and You're not there?
Let me win  just this once.  #sixwords
My heart dreams of love My soul dreams of You
*cries a yes*
Do the nasty  in the dark.
Let's fall madly  in bed.
Hold that thought  of me You just had.
Like a wilting lily  I dare You to love me.
Can You see in my eyes  that I want wrecking and ruining?
"Uncertain, yet promising."
There is room for much tonight  But no room for patience
Never mind the words  Even Your accent sounds villainous.
Fluttering lashes  to pretend I didn't cry.
A craving that never  should have begun.
The misfortunes of  resisting temptation.
When I gasp and wince  He can hear the yearning in my voice.
"Same planet, different spot  What a blunder of destiny"
Love it when my lipstick stains  the arches of Your foot.
Expose me to Your love.
It's nice to not have to pretend  to feel naked.
Pursue my emptiness.
Pry me apart.
I remain whimsically amused  by all the ways You can do  the same thing.
When I start to heave give me a hand.
"The day I found the courage to be myself,  I also fell in love."
Because He's worth fighting for.
To hell with the awful normals.
I broke the rules. Because someone has to say no.
I want to be Your sweetheart.
Happiness through heavy medication.
This need to suffer has seared into my soul and would not let me be.
He's gracious enough  to accept my profuse affection.
Complacent  yet bowing and begging  for more.
A heart like a pain-haunted house.
Moans like thunderous chants  catching the beat of eternal bliss.
Your footprints guide my way.
Winging through the dim clouds I found where rainbows hide.
Dreams of You know no end
I imagine You breathing next to me in the silence of the dawn.
Dipping in  and out  of need.
Sex with God you can't beat that.
Bonded by  infinite darkness.
"There's no such thing as ""too much love""."
She's not as sexy with her face clean.
Nothing that Your kiss can't fix. #sixwords
She's laid back  but not scared to stand out.
Real adventure has no limits.
Covering up is sometimes sexier than baring all.
Impact so stunning it took my breath away.
Help me crease the sheets.
She's delicate and small  despite the pitch black suede.
You are  my own.
I'm the woman You made me
It's the first day of Autumn How's that for striptease?
Recovery by devotion.
There was a time when all this happiness didn't exist. And here I am today. Full of pep in my mind and euphoria in my underbelly.
There's nothing minor about His fleeting desire to kiss me again.
"If You collect beautiful things, look this way."
No more deciding which road to take. Lead the way and I shall follow.
"The gracefulness says  be a Gentleman but the subtle sparkle in the eyes says ""fuck me!"""
Bluish purple is  my skin's favourite colour.
"""I love Your work"" I say to Him, as I turn over my shoulder, and look at my bare back in the mirror."
She's polished  but not perfect.
All is fair in love  and Your bed.
Your needs  above my own.
I'd rather fight with You than make love with anyone else.
You're worth every moan.
You are  that force around me.   #sixwords
Her red lips  cut a gash through His wolfish smile.
Nude statues are the nicest people. *And*  you can fondle them.
I am broke.  Cock broke.
Words harsher than death.
There's a skeleton in every closet.
"I'm in love  with Your winning habit of saying ""Nice try"""
Crushed like a wild pearl  and put in its place.
*hiccups* Holy heathen!
Love is  the morning  and  the evening  star.
"""I fear I will be ripped open and found unsightly."" - Anne Sexton"
"You, my heart's desire  I live well because of You."
You love me too much  to make me suffer
"When You've got nothing to lose,  make me Yours."
Our love  will always exist.
"Remember the feel of my lips against Yours, for it *was* real."
Atleast You can imagine loving me. #sixwords
Someday is a dirty word. Not the kind I like.
"""We all need a touch of magic"", He says, and showers on me, enough love to nurture my soul."
Memories of You have inscribed a spell upon my soul. To the point of sensual frenzy.
Body held  Senses heightened
"""No"" far less than before  ""Yes"" much more"
Love doesn't get  much more beautiful  than Us.
Those she loves  she'll love them forever.
No words are a waste of ink.
I wasn't aware I was so courageous  until I started to truly feel it.
The only thing that separates us is experience.
Love is still king But sin is catching on.
He spells out all my weaknesses  then tells me those are the reasons  why He loves me.
Let me show You  my secret wooing moves.
"Anything lost can be found again, except for an opportunity wasted."
Hide inside my life.
Purposefully roaming through the woods looking for the right bed of leaves on which to fuck.
The sultry sound of Your voice  dwells in my subconscious.
I'll fight You with my scent.
She loves the days  when she's not a princess.
Watch me as I bundle myself up like a little freebie.
Whispers so dirty my ears went numb.
There's nobody I'd rather be than me because *You* chose me.
A lot goes on inside  the candy coated heart of darkness.
When you're in love with a Sadist you shouldn't wear mascara.
The soul is not where it lives  but where it loves.
Fuck once sore.
It is my blood and tears  that make Your torture credible.
A mind clouded by sobriety  left her body curiously underfucked.
As lucky in love as a snow year Christmas.
The night season  always arouses irresistible longing.
Break the ice  Begin the vice
Loose limbs  Enslaved heart
Even His goodbyes leave me feeling whole.
What I really need is a starry sky.
The rich warmth  of my body beneath Yours.
Your boundless sway over my mind drives away my sorrows and cares.
Nip sin in the bud.
Thousands of spoonfuls of silver  on His tongue.
Loving You is worth everything to me.
I listen to the room breathing  But don't feel safe enough. I miss You.
"You looked at me And I knew, that You knew, who I was."
Some hearts beat  only to be struck by lightning.
I've been discovering things that startle me.
There's no time limit stop whenever You want.
Love wasn't born out of comfort.
Your eyes put handcuffs on me.
Like Sir Like slave  Like heaven
Lust doesn't corrupt love.
She likes to break habits. That's what He loves her for.
"Takes courage to dream the impossible. I did, and here we are."
The most innocent thing about Him  is me.
Common eccentricities lead to love.
Can we lose some of the tenderness?
I dream to survive.
Passion often destroys perfection.
A starburst would look perfect on You.
Always thinking about what's next.
Press me against the wall and nail that lustful vibe.
Welcoming a new day  with dew on my fingers.
It took her years to fall in love at first sight.
Your hands  My depths
I'll do whatever You think is right.
Beauty  before You.
Blowing smoke bubbles  as if to send signals.
Most things she loves fade away. #sixwords
It's getting dangerous to be hungry.
Proudly kneeling Boldly crawling  Shamelessly begging
To my long list of unearthly fantasies I've now added Your recital of poetry at bedtime.
Half the pain Double the pleasure
Minor attitude  Major penalty
I like the way You say 'No'.
Two  against the  world.
I will eat Your perversions  and gain Your depth and richness.
A voice  that knees bow to.
"Tranquil as a statue  until an Angel came up to Him and said ""Hello!"""
Tower above  my morality.
What's a ladies' Man without a woman?
Ever since You made me walk up the alley I dislike using the front door.
Two pairs of eyes sharing  a mischievous kiss
Hurt me Heal me
Do it all Go too far Right to the end
Coated  with layers  of dirt.
The dream I had came true.
Tough love  is just the thing  for slut skin.
Bathe me in sticky semen so I smell sumptuous for hours.
Watched over and loved morning and night.
Your permanent smile  continues to distract me.
You continue  to set us apart.
Nothing to aim for but Your satisfaction.
Uninhibitedly passionate  Yet gloriously sophisticated
Soft moans  that float up repeatedly.
The scent of testosterone  is hard to ignore.
In the dead of the night  I feel You unimaginably close.
This connection  is phenomenal. There's no other word for it.
I get most of what's needed  in the first orgasm.
Reality proof present
I'll need more hits to break. #sixwords
Nothing's as fulfilling as You.
Hopes never rot. Or die. They are almost always killed.
No calm after the storm kind of love.
She is a whore for the Man of her dreams.
Hurl Yourself down on me.
It hurt big time but  I came around  eventually.
Everything is a sport. Even sex. #sixwords
"Without sin, forgiveness has no grace."
Love the sinner  because she loves You.
I love the smell of night in the morning.
A kiss and more  For a kiss.
They are all starting to think You exist.
Fuck being polite.
The dark is inescapable And how.
Love me beyond my experience  or imagination of it.
We kissed in the moonlight and the stars filled with fire.
He welcomed me to a world where the unexpected and the unbelievable meet.
Could You hear my sighs with the wind?
"If I'm not in my body, where am I?"
I yearn for that heavenly scent.
"Youth is inside, a light that stays on until late."
"Taken or not, she's worth it. #sixwords"
Make that total deprivation last.
"Bare Your sins. Yes, I'd bear all Your sins."
That's my soul You hear crackling with violent excess.
I loved the pain I felt. #sixwords
Give some feeling. Put some pain into it.
*hides Your privates between my legs*
Fuck me For Love's sake
Your poems on tape for a lullaby.
"When you get too close to something you shouldn't, you get magical powers."
Being Yours rules!
Do You hear chains when I walk?
Ever kissed a talking flower goodnight?
You are my anchor  and also the One who can toss me around.
"Soften the impact, with wet kisses. #sixwords"
Why wonder constantly where the relationship is heading. There's nothing wrong with going nowhere.
Space can't stop love.
Distant hearts  can love as much as  the colliding ones.
I am loved.
"In a world without law and duty, would You be with me?"
Torment is just another type of kindness.
I want to know that there's more to life and I can't know that without You being a part of mine.
"Leave with me, I'll go anywhere.   #sixwords"
Who knows if life is greater than death. But love is more than either.
"Your love, I can no longer  live without it."
"There's a burning in me, I feel on fire."
Not never  Only Not yet
You are what I need.  You And nothing more.
Tell me You understand.
Life is very precious even right now when I'm dying to be with You.
Deep inside me as if unearthing lost treasures.
That nano-second look of dismay before they adorn their brightest smile and wave each other goodbye.
I need more warmth  than I can feel.
Show me God.
To be severely punished  and intimately loved for all eternity.
It is Your love that makes my fears surface And only Your love that has the power to shatter them.
Too happy to write.
"You've got me so far. I can't keep my legs together, even with lights on."
Those mellow nights when we make it to the bed.
I'd love for an opportunity to knock on my door. And by opportunity I mean a pit bull.
I have no barriers around my heart.
It's simple. There are no rules. #sixwords
127 And counting
He's mine  Not yours
She bends for love alone
*Greets You in the morning with reverse prayer hands.*
"But first, there has to be tight binding."
"I have Your heart with me. Now take all You want from me, heartlessly."
"If I knew I had less than a minute to live, I'd kiss You again."
"What do You mean, ""too young""?   #sixwords"
Could I face You next time You kiss me?
Let Your depths wash over me.
There's a tension settling in my thighs. You must be thinking up rope patterns.
I don't know my own strength. I never will.
Put Your hands where they belong.
The deliciously perplexing  act of holding still.
"Whatever You have seen, You don't need to tell me. I'm just happy that You stayed."
When You tire of kissing my lips I'll just bury my head in Your chest.
I dare things demons wouldn't.
Your eyes put me in a carnal crouch.
Weary of waiting  to get drunk on Your love.
I made my own reality And it's better than any wise dream I've ever had.
Don't go until you've got some.
*Kneels under a cluster of mistletoes.*
Our love reinforces the age old ritual  of a rose sacrificed  for the beauty of wine.
His eyes radiate passion ever so subtly.
Admired and desired  albeit temporarily.
Around the undeserving she's a flower with no scent.
The fascinating paradox of the woman who dares to be vulnerable.
Evoked by dirt and poetry.
"An unfinished handwritten note full of words never spoken, if left too long, can smell of gunpowder after a desert rain."
His words are as fascinating as the woman who inspires Him.
A single whisper can proclaim unambiguously  who's in charge.
The compelling allure of a fantasy.
The fiery red glow of a hopeful heart.
Exalted by a touch of salt
The intensity we share  pulls me to You from the core of my being.
Lay a tongue on me so that telling me all Your secrets  becomes much less indiscreet.
Breasts so supple  as if rubbed with beeswax.
Skin tingling with a desire  to be brought to life.
Walk that leaves a mesmerising trail.
Lips laced with eroticism.
Eyes full of sexual revolution.
You are so many dreams away.
Seeing how much I crave  the pain and torture why am I afraid to die?
You are  all around me  But I want You in.
The toughest choices are best made with the heart.
She's like a snowflake that the wind blows right onto Your palm.
A girl so enigmatic  you could walk past her  and still not sense  the air she breathes.
This need of You  is all my grace  reduced to the obvious.
He doesn't let me win and knows enough ways to make me lose more slowly.
The powerful and intimate connection  between old school originality and the intriguing jumble of mysteries waiting to be unfolded.
Twinkling eyes  full of dark secrets  creating a night sky.
Just so You know  the reveal  will not  be swift.
The depths aren't hidden anymore. Attempt immersion.
The kind of happiness no one else can replicate.
The way You pull moments from my life and make them less ordinary.
Make a weekend of the dinner date.
To wake up in Your bed  with ocean views in every direction.
The horizon is always the same  and yet ever-changing.
A soul lost like a book that's now out of print.
You helped me reconnect with holy rituals.
Consistent bonding  even though the details change slowly.
Your touch makes my body bloom from orchids of the North to tulips of the South.
I got all the makings for a dark night.
The kind of love where His mouth isn't always kind to my skin.
As companionable as Frida and Diego.
A heart softened by elegance of the mind.
"Tend to me and make me flourish  as You would flowers, in early spring."
Make me  an indulgence  You would  never forgo.
Don't get me roses. They look too perfect.
They were total strangers  until fate triggered a spark.
Some words I read. Others I feel.
I expect it always to tickle. And it does.
Fuck me like I'm all You got.
Perfection isn't everything  yet everything is just perfect.
Let's see who stops hugging first.
Dissatisfied until after I've been overpowered.
As absurd as a hopeful romantic.
"Dancing and cavorting in my mind   as I lie still, in Your arms."
Lick the sun off my flushed cheeks.
You have such a sexy voice. And I use that word very selectively.
You put order  in this soul.
"""In other words, No you can't.""  ""Not in other words. Those are the perfect ones."""
She's the luckiest girl in the room. With clenched hair.
I do to myself what I think You would.
"And when You're not here, the things I know You're going to do when You come in, seduce me."
Bare breasts  glistening with  red wine spit.
Did You see  the cum stringing  around my head  like a tiara?
Even the night is overrated.
Kill my patience already.
Even among the special  He's special.
Evil fears Him.
"If I could, I would. Often. #sixwords"
I see Your simply irresistible  and raise You my desperate.
Deliciously dirty mistress.
Remote sensing You isn't enough  to put me to sleep. I want to feel You deeper.
Lower that bar but only literally.
Total submission starts with a simple kiss.
There's nothing more to my soul  than meets Your hands on my body.
I am incapable  of being without You.
The greatest superpower is love.
My needs have never been more plentiful than now.
Dark and decadent  as black shadows.
To find someone who collects desires too.
Dig in the dirt.
To love or not to love is an easy decision.
The bliss  that is  a filth filled mind.
Such unmatched  sense of wellbeing  within the private world  of the bedroom.
To look and feel beautiful; this intimate relationship between the inside and out; to feel my soul rejoicing and know that it's happy.
Your presence fills the moments with calm.
To challenge orthodoxy  and dream a little more.
To think unreasonably  and dare the impossible.
You were always on my bucket list.
Too pure to know how dirty You are.
How far would You go to love me as much as I do You?
What do You feel like doing tonight?
The lucky one  cums first.
Fuck like the fire is scorching  And I'll scream like help isn't coming.
Too many Angels around  Yet I'm not sure God knows about this place.
Falling in love is easy. That's why it's so dangerous.
Mirrors don't have eyes  Look into one and say it all.
Think like a Master too.
Hide secrets if you must but every once a while  feel the sun on your face.
My flight begins  in Your arms.
Stay in  and hunt.
To survive  despite looking back.
The might of the night  against the right of the mind.
The kind of love  that's still a little tentative.
Grow fangs  then call on me.
A happy ending  is beside the point.
"Soaring away  as I lie in bed, thinking of You."
I love the look in His eyes  when I'm bold enough to look into them.
Committed to keep suffering.
"Around, up and over all the obstacles."
The only dignified way  to completely satisfy Him is to crawl on a leash.
Seeking sensation  bordering on fanatic
Loved till she is reduced to pure animal instinct  as she suffers for Him.
"Us, nothing else."
Hold tighter. The night has started to die down.
Never too soon  to think about  overcoming the impossible.
There's a lot left to explore. Just a few layers down.
Coffee Cigarettes  And Sia
To be cared for until it's spring again.
You can either be in love or into survival.
That moment when pain is close and pleasure is closer.
I knew  right then all that I had  been missing.
Mercy is a harsh penalty.
Words that touch Voice that invites
Your love  is the beacon for  the compelling direction my life is taking.
I close my eyes and feel Your voice sinking into me. A voice I would give up all my words for.
Young Yet classic
"I'm in a ladylike mood tonight Loosen the silk tie, not the leather belt."
The enduring appeal  of being held captive and loved.
Sated with love  Yet hungry for more.
So many ways to love  Just one to kneel.
I woke up drunk today. It's You I must have dreamed of again.
When she gets up to leave heads turn.
Love black  Hate playing safe
The cave of my heart belongs to You.
Such an Angel when she's not being dirty.
Won't crumble to dust if handled correctly.
Colour drenched body on a bed of white.
Hope well Have well
"My hobby, stuffing things."
She's worth her beauty  when she sinks to the bottom.
"Loosen that corset  and fix me a drink, bartender."
One marvel  for every  ordinary life.  #sixwords
Too young to win  Not fight.
Living for a dream  that refuses to die.
I try to imagine  the journeys Your hands will make.
I am whatever You want me to be.
Sunbaked skin   Moonbathed eyes
*wins over Your imagination*
Let our passion seal my fate.
There's something undeniably dreamy about Australia.
If I could just  sit at Your feet.
My superpower? Self forgiveness.
No pouting. I want to look fierce.
The things I do for love.
Lust is red  Love is violet
Loving You with the conviction  of a slave.
A beautiful journey  with no crossroads
How about  giving me  exclusive rights to serve You?
The language of love is a beautiful prayer.
Make those butterflies dance.
Love bites  like He's engraving medals  for my being so brave.
Enter into me like Satan
Sex on the beach  Love on the run
I become conservative when I'm drunk.
A night like hell at its hottest.
"Leaning in the doorway, a whirlwind spins as He overpowers me."
"As long as I'm loved, I'm alive."
Waiting for someone  not something.
Nakedness is simplicity.
No such thing  as being overprotected with love.
Life isn't always fair And that's why I'm not bound to this bed I'm laid in.
Permit me to steal a kiss?
Sleep gets us together. Because then I dream of You and You're with me.
Life says love is vital.
Spank until I've no fight left.
"All that was, persists."
If mercy had a colour..
Nothing ridiculous about a pretty girl making demands.
"If bites make you giggle, he's doing it wrong."
Turn my thoughts into actions.
The art of valuing moments before they become memories.
He won her for the last dance.
Every love gives you enough time to die for it.
"I don't admire those who are attracted by feigned shyness; if she's really full of butterflies, it's her most beautiful smile you will see."
I am  His world's  dirty secret.
We're more or less family.
Stop seeing  how hard I'm trying.
Trust runs deep.
She finally broke.
More than a rose. She's love's own flower.
Tickle me pink the dusky kind.
Tingling with excitement  under a cloud canopy.
I love winning  I hate rat races
Catch her young  Watch her grow
Somber gratitude
"Night falls, the force awakens."
Ever wonder what it smells like  when I burn in need?
No rest for the wicked
"""Coffee first"", He says  as I'm taught to be patient."
"""Those are poisonous"", I whisper coyly  as He bites into a nipple."
Her cries take flight  and she forgets she's in pain.
I'm going to love myself. You're welcome to partake.
"""I'm losing you"", I say to myself  as You take charge."
Rock climbing
I'm a lionhearted woman Courage is my creed.
We just stumbled into love.
Living far beyond my years  and loving it.
Fill me with every emotion You've ever known.
To wallow in passion  the whole blessed night.
Crime in a kiss.
"You, me and my need the eternal triangle."
Not the type of woman  who would interest everybody.
As responsible as bottoms up.
Daily detox and Nightly therapy
He is able She is willing
A face noone expects to be capable of being read.
Settle into me.
The slave is no longer suffering.
"If a woman is romantic, they say she's crazy."
First the moon goes down on her then she warms herself in the sun.
"If this is love, I'd love to see the violence."
Nod  and summon  so I can have  a meltdown.

Break that gasp halfway  with a kiss.
Start  and finish  with something simple. #sixwords

Cover my stretch marks with bruises.
I'll settle for hard.
I choose  not to escape.
What You tell me frightens me.  What You don't tell me frightens me more.
I'll do no less  than give my all.
I'm a cornered fox.
Everlasting temptation  as that of  warm vanilla sugar.
Hurt!
Kiss!

Lessons before dawn.
Need destroys.
No guilty  except maybe in thought. #sixwords

My innocence  has come full circle.
An embrace that feels  like a zen escape.

Loving words from You are like a flurry  of precious gems.
Fuelled with the desire  to get more personal.
Linger  for a last dance  or a drink.

Your grip  My flesh
Waves of pleasure  swimming in the dusk.
Nothing seems to go right on days that don't start with Your breath on my neck.

Temptation is bliss.
I need to taste You like a creeping vine on a tall tree.

He lets some passion go untamed. And that keeps me needing Him evermore.
All that's left is a knock on my bedroom door.

"When it's too late to obey,  things get tempestuous."
Perhaps screams are good for potency.

Steal more than just my heart. #sixwords
I smell lust.
These goosebumps won't let my skin mask its need of You.
In me He sees what He wants.

"Perplexed by the ghost of Your absence, I lie safely shrouded in a cloak of memories.  #soulhoot"
Sticky with dreams  of a stern You and a tearful me.
Think of me  like this
Does submitting to a man make him a better lover?
Perhaps destiny will catch up with us.
Fuck me like You never loved me.
I mean  to matter
I mean  to stay
You are so tender it hurts.
There's nothing stronger  than the heart of a submissive.
Kneeling wins hearts.
A bite so hard  it's got to be the last one  or so I thought.
My need  is my downfall.
I misbehave  because I'm stronger than You think.
Blow me a kiss  and then bite
Tears were just a disguise. I was enjoying the pain.
"""You dance secretly inside my heart, where no one else can see."" - Rumi"

One faint whisper from You and how it ignites a revolution within me.

I don't think God meant for me  to not be Your wife.
Your marks on my body  are my chastity belt.
How much longer do I have to withstand nothing?
"In the beginning, it's always dark. #sixwords"
I saw You nod so I crawled my way  into Your world.
Drunk on torturous love.

Woman.  Every Man needs one.
Lying next to You was the last time I loved myself.

His fingers know my body  from the inside out.
You were always a dream waiting to happen.
Show me love  before I self destruct.
"If the stars had a voice,  ours is the story they'd boast about."

"If You really have to go,  leave me alive."
The heat beneath His feet warms my heart.
I am grateful for how You shut down my mind.
Soon after You look into my eyes  my knees are undeniably drawn to the floor.
You are  the everlasting moment  I'd been waiting for.

Lonesome for You
I wrote You a poem in my dream.
It all began with a twitch in His palm.
"As I nearly pass out, He whispers, ""I haven't even started with you yet."""
"To have a hunger and not feed it, is a sin."
"The very first time You loved me, I went home a Woman."
Wasting my nights away until the day we meet again

Wish You'd run out of mercy. #sixwords

The way He tends to mellow down  as we embrace on a moonlit deck.
Charm You? I could make You swell with lust.
I adore His asking for more. #sixwords
I'm a difficult girl to feed. #sixwords
Can't keep my mind off Your touch.
I'll rebel if You're the cause. #sixwords
Dying's a lot like being in love. You can't imagine it until its right on top of you.

Kiss me when I dream about You tonight.
"I need You. I know, I'm sorry."
The night air is just right  for dreaming about You again

I found my happiness in defeat.
I'm smiling now Thinking about nothing in particular  but everything in general about us.
"Through the power of His written word,  He looks at me in the eye and promises me the world."
I press a fingertip and wince  as I feel the extent of Your unbounded hunger  in the slender bones around my neck.
There's a spring in my step  thanks to the ache in my limbs.
She's a prisoner of love masquerading as a sex slave.
Break the rules. Not the law. #sixwords

He's the gift that keeps on giving.
The things He does for love.  (Me)

You touched me very near the heart.
Sweltering with the heat of urgent longing.
I will play with myself and show You how to be less human when You love me.
I can't hear my moans  above the roar of Your growl.

"The nearer You come to me, the closer I get to the edge"
Show me the other side of safe.
To live the dream as long as I don't bleed
A punishment more painful than love. That.
A thousand apologies for swallowing without permission.
Ruin me before I self destruct.
Love me whether I am fit to love. Love me whether I am able to love. Even is there is no such thing as love. Love me.
They couldn't need each other more.
Destiny favours the defiant ones.
"Out of the cradle, endlessly rocking..."
Do what You like with my mind.
Burned the bridge that could've taken me home.   #VerseReversal
It is this need of You that sustains me now.
Mastered the art of laughter through tears.  Like a fucking Saint.
Drunker on You than usual.
Love? He's made of it.
Living on the edge of emotions.
Struggling to overcome this heat of desire.
Desires too vital to resist.
Hickeys would be a good therapy tonight.
"More than the drug, what really kills you is looking for it."
Absence never tasted so bitter until now.
All of me.  All at once.  All for You.
"There's a limit to waiting, You know.   And I've reached mine."
You're the best.  Meet Your match.   #sixwords
What better way of getting rich than holding all of Your attention?
Take me where I want to go.
Why be good?
Embrace my chaos. It's all I ask of You.
I'm a nasty habit to get into. You've been warned.
Love till You destroy me.
Your memory saves the day yet again.
Never too young to learn  the way You want me to love You.
Gentle whispers adorned with a string of dirty words and I'm all Yours.
Hell bent to love something Heaven sent.
Kiss me again. A little less gracefully.
Subjugate me in the name of love. I want to soar to heady heights.
My skin is parched without Your touch.
All night I kneel and beg for more.
"Like a magician, He makes love grow in me."
"Knowing I damage easily, I live in hope."
Why must the night end?
One person always loves more. That's what makes it so difficult.
"Love is complicated. And that's good. Because if it's too simple you've got no reason to try, and if you've got no reason to try you don't."
"I'll turn into a wolf too,  and take my share of You."
Daytime reasoning doesn't apply at night.
Wars you fight versus wars you walk away from.
"Don't blame your determination,  I was irresistible."
It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.
Let's spend the night chasing the storm.
He knows what my heart wants.
Write love notes on my body through Your eyes.
Give me the luxury of Your love and I will manage without the necessities of life.
It's the corrupt ones who need love the most.
"You take everything,  and I'm never empty."
Don't let me wake from this dream.
"There are no saints. I've seen the way You undress me, yank my hair and leave bruises."
Till luck do us part
Make me worthy  to receive Your affection
The measure of love is  what one is willing to give up for it.
Bruised and tearful  she rests her head on His chest  grateful for the elation that comes with it
Armour-like touch
Twisted. And how.
"Lend me Your touch,  I don't want yet another sleepless night"
To drive into the opium den that is Your arms
To cross Your mind  for an eternity
I would give my soul  to be who You want
Eyes that cut through my walls  and see me for who I am
Destiny led me to You. Your love led me home.
Yell at me in private
Fingers digging for fire
Scrawl MINE across my back  with ink from my mascara laden tears
Subtweets that reassure
I'd rather be tortured  than admired by You while naked.   #soulhoot
Untamed passion is no delicate matter.
My aspirations far exceed my talents. Let me love You anyway.
Do You have any explaination to why I only ever dream about You?
I would never let my screams interrupt You when You're punishing me.
I don't want to settle down. I want to fly. #TenWordJournal
Kneeling before You  is the only luxury I have ever been able to afford.
"If you're hooked, you're mine"
"The way You fire up my imagination, fill my body with the same passion"
"The way You touch my heart so gently, my body wants to feel the same"
Everyone else will always be second best.
"I've lain my heart open, won't You come in?"
Love how You make me feel so powerful  and then wear me down
Hold me closer  and You're no longer safe
You can't teach me  to not want You
"Without desire, there is no going forward"
"Heart before reason, that's what being powerful means to me."
"He makes love, ever so artfully"
My body wants Your soft lips  to bestow savage kisses on it.
So many ways to love without ever saying anything
This burden of separation  is too much to bear
"Even though I love darkness, my heart shines for You every night"
Say You'll never tire of my face.
"Sometimes I miss You so much, I fear for my sanity"
Strip me of all my shame  till my naked soul finds Yours
To etch raw passion into Your skin till every fibre of Your being  calls out my name
Swirling surf of tears  smeared over my face but the taste of Your lips won't be washed away
Dreams tempting me back from reality.
I'm best loved as I am.
Some memories age beautifully.
You always knew what was inside of me.
"When it comes to me, You're the best part."
"Alive for an eternity, living for a few brief moments"
Feelings unspoken are unforgettable.
Your torment was rather brief.
You just get better and better  by staying as You are.
I wonder whether my love-inspired fire is warm enough.
Love that feels like a safe haven  from the dawn creeping in to burn you up.
"If it's real,  then it's worth fighting for."
Goodbye innocence  Hello You
You are everything  all at once
"The kind of Love you fight for, that you always put first.   That makes you want to be good and do better.   That."
Let's get ourselves together  and give meaning to the night.  #TenWordJournal
How do I go about seducing an army of one?
My heart blazes with longing.
I'd give You the keys to all my doors.
Your lips  upon my chest  and my heart is pry open
Sometimes it's just words  that work wonders on wounds.
This pleasure isn't painful enough.
"If I were any more innocent,  we'd never get anywhere."
Born to belong  Built to be destroyed
Found my place  in His universe
All that pleasure just another moan away
"Winds promising flight, making spirits soar"
A heart that glows like a solar fire
Romantic yet intoxicating
Could I atone for my sins with hallucinations?
Darkness always loves me back.
My inner demons want to  serve the God in You.
"When I think I've got nothing left to lose, He strips another layer off my mind."
Purest hearts find perfect love. It's that simple.
You and I  when paired  intensity abounds
"Sunset beams caressing the sky,  as if searching for angels."
How does it feel to be Perfect?
Deeds.   Not just words.
Hopeful romantic
Make angry love to me. I want it no other way.
How do you hold onto someone who won't stay?
"When I freeze as I see You, kiss me and breathe life back into me."
Feast on my love
"You can't suppress feelings of the heart,  or the spirit in flesh."
I see Your unimaginable challenge and raise You my unexpected win
To hold on to sanity too tight is insane.
"Those arms embrace all my moods,  somber to sunny."
I'm not immune to Your understated faultlessness.
Effortlessly buildable
No calm after the storm. Not yet.
You can only feel jinxed if you believe in luck.
My inner sense trusts You.
Never had she felt as a Goddess like this.
Say nice things and I promise not to look surprised.
Dreams you were born to fulfil versus fantasies that just occur to you.
They love alike. They must be soulmates.
Wonder how many dreams lie scattered in stardust.
She's the evening star  that's never far away She shines first she shines brightest and she shines longest.  #soulhoot
Beautiful minds dream alike.
"For a Sadist, He soothes bloody well."
Storify my dreams
Ruin me till I barely feel human.
"You're so special,  the words 'Be Mine' come to mind."
I fought my heart and the heart won
"You're a gentleman, too bad I'm not a lady."
The Man every man wants to be.
Undying fascination for spiritual protection
"Decadent, dirty rose"
Unimaginable pain Undeniable pleasure
Living the daydream  after the sun sets
"Happiness creeped into me so quietly, I only noticed it when I was flying  rushing headlong across the moonbeams.   #orgasm"
How do You know everything I wish You did?
Delusions of being under a spell
Her soul belongs to any one that can find it.
His words work their way into her soul.
Far too eternal  to ever end
"“Although I may try to describe Love, When I experience it, I am speechless.” — Rumi"
Read me poetry
Too vulnerable not to tempt You  into possessing me
He loves harder than He fucks.
Not mad enough to admit  she's mad about Him.
You have the power.   And I have the will to challenge it.
Distant love is a killer.
Subtle smokiness  of pleasurable moans  lingering in my mouth
JO🍷
Memories of You are a true feast for my heart
May I kiss you the way I would  indulge in whisky dark chocolate truffles?
Never felt stronger  than when You tested my resolve.
Dreaming it over and over  is not as good as living it once.
"Grab me with both hands, love me for keeps."
Hope is my weapon of choice.
Place gentle bites on my lips and taste my love in every drop of blood You draw.  #soulhoot
Me and You Sin and tonic  #sixwords
He finds just the right words  to nurture my soul.
Your tongue is good for my skin.
Not a trace of pain. I feel rather guilty.
"Love now, dream later"
There's no fun in knowing what hit you.
Orgasmic awakening
Love heals the burns love caused.
Your pleasure  My happiness
There's nothing more wonderful  than having You all to myself.
"I want to be Your girl,  that's what I want for Christmas."
Throw me a kiss
Is it showing that I'm thinking of You?
The darkness in me couldn't stay out of Your light.
Nostalgia can make you thirsty.
A heart's a breathtakingly heavy burden.
Something that can't be taken away. Is that too much to ask?
Having a choice is no longer an option.
Love is one thing. Lust is a whole different animal.
His memories hide with me under my skin as I dance the night away  to the rhythm of His breathing.  #soulhoot
decency versus desire
"Of all the worlds, You walked into mine."
Twisted reality  Naive dreams
Obsessed by Your distinctiveness.
Work me a miracle.
As surreal as sunlight dancing on the sea.
Kiss me while You reprimand.
Do the darndest things.
Ready to endure  Your desired extremes.
His luminous smile  always has a hint of savage charm.  #TenWordJournal
"Lashings of mercy, for a change"
Lust knows no boundaries...
Upholding the rules by the day.  Breaking them by night.   #TenWordJournal
A clock that could count down to the moment you meet your soul mate.
"Soapy foam under my fingernails,  among other things that make me miss You."
I want to rush  into the peace of Your arms.
Kisses like a second language
Fear and love shall meet tonight.
Sex. On loop.
I'm tired of being without You.
I tempted the devil  and the devil accepted
It's only clouds she ever sees  Yet goes on loving God.   #soulhoot
"There are flames that burn in me, eager to pursue and seduce You."
You've always been  my secret longing.
Torture me with kisses
He's a cocktail of simplicity and legendary grace.
Memories of Him linger as she stretches  across the bed trying to fill the gap
It takes practice and skill to live without regret.
The best part of Love is losing all sense of reality.
I gather up each sound you left behind  and stretch them on the bed.
Devout
"If you're going to try, go all the way."
It's Love I'm after
Beware the electrified fence with pit bulls around my heart.
I breathe You and become high.  #sixwords
Last chance. Your place or mine?   #sixwords
Cursed with self awareness.
No one counts so much as You.
The damnable misery of knowing exactly what you want.
I'm dying. How are You?
"By all means, ruin me."
As naughty as a black lace silk robe.
The scent of a burning wick  mingled with that of calfskin harness  lifting the mood in the bridal suite.
We'll blow the world back together with incredible fury as we drain the storm of our love.
Dreams of You last beyond dawn.
Wasting smokes on moments gone by.
My lips are full and generous without lipstick.
The swollen lips of my lust bleed for You.
The way the sea leaves. Without warning.
"If you love me and you know it, spank me."
"If only I could borrow some moments  from those who have known you forever,  I'd have more than this wreckage of scattered ashes.  #soulhoot"
It's an absolute sin to not rebel.
Tears as sedative as rain.

Memories worth more  than the pictures in her mind.
Feelings worth more  than the words that express them.
The wench wants to be a princess.
My spirit is uplifted  by everything Your darkness holds.
In quest of lost words  that will win Him back
"The way Your words touch me running deep, unveiling my darkness."
She's earthy but wants to be noticed.
More comfortable confused.
I want a deeper way in.
She's easier loved than forgotten.
And at last nothing comes between her  and the woman she wanted to be.
Nothing is too much  for her pleasure-hungry body
Memories that taste like ashes
Eyes closed  Mind open  Heart soaring   #sixwords
Flying blindly into the abyss.
Your lips on mine and everything seems fully realised.

Stain my skin with Your tongue till You taste the sin in my blood
