Blessed Are the Sick / Leading the Rats Lyrics
Havohej another me born to serve
To plague and moan
So many years my seed condemned
No free to soar!

Will is yours? So creator
No intent could shadow
My disease ... Ever lusting pain

World of sickness
Blessed are we to taste life of sin

My touch is inhumane
Nocturnal beast inside
Is void of light
And empty shall remain

World of sickness
Blessed are we to taste life of sinEmbed
