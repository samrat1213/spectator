The carbon air is stale
Foul winds swept through the iron trees
As the earth gasps for air
Inhale the exhaust
Hollow the pines
We are not the predators
We are the suicide

Sheep among the sheep
A world of fucking cowards overrun with grief
We're all just sheep among the sheep
Staring down the barrel of a gun in disbelief

Eden laid to waste
In the dust and rubble
Of a tragic race

Scarred upon the lung
Take the gauze to the infected wound
And smother the mouths of the young
Stillborn in a polluted womb

Oh lord of the worm
Return us to the soil
Let the boxes of bones decompose
Into the swill
Black as oil

Hurling towards the black hole
Twisted by the gravity
Withered by the sun
Shattered by depravity

Civilized disaster
Polluted by the ignorant
Human scum rotting in shit
Human scum rotting in shit

Sheep among the sheep
A world of fucking cowards overrun with grief
We're all just sheep among the sheep
Staring down the barrel of a gun in disbelief

Immoral monarch eyes as mirrors
The mask of refuge will deteriorate
Empires built on reckless consumption
Now gaze upon the cancerous face

Oh lord of the worm
Return us to the soil
Let the boxes of bones decompose
Into the swill
Black as oil

Humanity shall suffer its absolute genocide
We are nothing more than a casualty of a failed existence
