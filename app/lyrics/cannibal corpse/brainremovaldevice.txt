Heads removed of their faces lay by my feet
Chopped and hacked their bodies detached
Eyes and teeth are violently smashed
Gruesome acts

I'm having strong urges to extract the brains
Overwhelmed with demented thoughts
Could it be that I committed these
Gruesome acts

Death is all I ever know
Gore is what I need to help satisfy me
Brains are all I ever crave
Can't deny my hatred for society
Blood so sweet upon my lips
Live a life of moribund abnormalcy
Born with only half a head
Can't deny my hatred for intelligence

The brain removal device

Drained again through the mouth the blackest blood flows
Save it for another day
Savor the vile abundance of
Gruesome acts

Dead is like being alive
Stench of rotting death becomes irrelevant
Heads affixed to a machine
Peel the skin from random skulls exposing bone
Cracked open with vice like force
Spray my face with human slop, carnal spatter
Slave to my repulsive goal
To regain control beyond what's in my mind

The brain removal device

Shredded brain tissue is mine
Succulent flavor is pure
Evil is personified
Dominance

Brutal conclusion foreseen
Envisioned so long ago
The slaughtered were unaware

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Contraption for hollowing heads
Is forcing me to realize
Cerebral obsession within is my reality

<i>[Solo: Pat O'Brien]</i>

Death is all I ever know
Gore is what I need to help satisfy me
Brains are all I ever crave
Can't deny my hatred for society
Blood so sweet upon my lips
Live a life of moribund abnormalcy
Slave to my repulsive goal
To regain control beyond what's in my mind

The brain removal device
