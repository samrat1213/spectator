Rope to neck
I'll take your fucking breath
(Nothing left)
Watch you fight
It makes me feel alive
Consume your life
I breathe as you just die
(Say goodbye)
Dead inside
It makes me feel alive

My mind is not mine
It belongs to dark divine
Relax into the pain
Self-inflicting medicine
I drive myself insane
With thoughts I can't explain
I will become your pain
Close your eyes and go away

I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill

Rope to neck
I'll take your fucking breath
(Nothing left)
Watch you fight
It makes me feel alive
Consume your life
I breathe as you just die
(Say goodbye)
Dead inside
It makes me feel alive

My thoughts are not my thoughts
I'll make the voices stop
Right from the mouth of hell
I'll keep you in this cell
I was made into the beast
Beelzebub he summons me
Face your fears and you can feel
I feed on souls that I steal

I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill

Rope to neck
I'll take your fucking breath
(Nothing left)
Watch you fight
It makes me feel alive
Consume your life
I breathe as you just die
(Say goodbye)
Dead inside
It makes me feel alive

I need to steal your life
It makes me feel alive

I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
I need to kill to feel alive
