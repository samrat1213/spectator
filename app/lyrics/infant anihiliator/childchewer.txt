The cattle of the shepherd shall mourn

There is no death for me to fear for Christ, my Lord, hath died
There is no curse in this my pain for His beliefs were crucified

The sun sets
The blood delivered
The Earth will drown in a crimson river

The world; the flesh; the lust; the Devil; in league intend thy ruin
And every breath leads on to death and works thy soul's undoing

Down in the Lake of Hell, await the endless condemnation
To sleep is sure destruction and a fiery indignation

The sun sets
The blood delivered
The Earth will drown in a crimson river

I am of death that dieth never
I am the gulf that burns forever

"O come to Christ for pardon
"From sin and Satan
"Sever and sink into the Flames to dwell amidst the lost forever."

Forever
