[Exodus and Baloff]

Smell of death lurks around the place
Human need, unholy race
See the bloody pile of bones
The night is filled with hellish moans
It's been around for oh so long
At dawn of time they sang their song
The need to eat the human flesh
The strength it gives to pass the test

[Chorus]
Feel the power
Of your unholy death
Feeding-frenzy
Human-flesh
To live

[first lead fill- Gary]
[second lead fill- Rick]

Ther is no law, it's time to fight
A brutal hunt every night
Life grows through hounds of flesh
A stronger soul from another death
Hidden back, yet deep within
Jungle's there, it's always been
Hunt at night to stalk their prey
Kill and eat it before it's day
[Chorus]
Feel the power
Of your unholy death
Feeding-frenzy
Human-flesh
To live

[solo- Gary]
[solo- Rick]

Dead bodies lie where they fed
Half eaten carcass stained red
Hunting parties come to call
Leaving nothing, they take it all
There's no need to change their ways
Blood and money, it always pays
Don't disturb their solitude
Or the next victim will be you!

[repeat Chorus]
[solo- Rick]
