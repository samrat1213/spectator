Suddenly all of humanity's past accomplishments and vanities
Individuals and families
Human bureaucracies
Lost in the calamity
Those who thought this was a fallacy
And those who knew the end was coming

The universe, it always finds a way to purge
The sustainably inappropriate numbers that once surged
Death always wins, his molten torch forever burns
And to the ashes and the ground we are returned
Life exists to infuriate, berate, and subjogate
The hapless mortals shit-birthed on a human-altered planet Earth

Apocalypse
Sudden death of a metropolis
We fucking needed this

The universe, it always finds a way to purge
The sustainably inappropriate numbers that once surged
Death always wins, his molten torch forever burns
And to the ashes and the ground we are returned
Life exists to infuriate, berate, and subjogate
The hapless mortals shit-birthed on a human-altered planet Earth

Fuck the future
Fuck all mankind
