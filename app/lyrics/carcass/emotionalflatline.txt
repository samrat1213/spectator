An emotional void, a cold empty shell
Embittered husk, a heart of darkness
Trace weak pulse, vascular eclipse
Numbed and sapped, emotional paralysis

Flatline, grievious bodily heart
Flatlined, sensitivity bypassed

No tears to cry
Stone cold emotional flatline

Emotional flatline
No tears to cry

With indifference touched of emotion drained
Cold bloody minded, caressing disdain
Pulsating life, only rhythmic dead beats
Terminal cardiac ridden with disease

Flatline...no tears to cry
The hard line...stone cold emotionless flatline

No time to cry
Stone cold emotional flatline

Emotional flatline
No time to cry
No tears to cry
