Eyes tied tight forever
Mouth wired shut forever
Body parts dissever. You will see no more
Never....

Lowered into the ground
You will never hear another sound
In your coffin you are bound. Underground
Forever

To the earth you're now enslaved, to the creatures long depraved
Flesh has now turned to grey, as the larve gnaw away
As you rot in your smallish tomb, insects care not how you met your doom
In your casket eternally lie. Many were pleased to see you die

Fester
In the
Crypt where
You lie

Victims
Pass by
They watched
You die

Flesh melts off your frame. Infamous was your name
Years passed since you moved on
Nothing left but carry on
Festering in the crypt
