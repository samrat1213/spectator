Centuries wasted
Wallowing in our defecation.

An entity overwatches silent yet in disgust,
Evoking a thirst for destruction!

Destruction.

A divine intervention is underway,
To cleanse our burden of mistakes.

Clouds transform into a mammoth storm as the skies blacken with ash.
Downpours of sulfur nauseate and fill your chest.

Overwhelming showers of flames eat through the flesh.
Screaming like suffocated swine this is our punishment.

Only few remain, for he's unsympathetic within his campaign.
Screaming like suffocated swine this is our punishment.

Remnants of scalded skin permeate an unpleasant stench serving
As reminder his hands are only temporarily cleansed.

Casualties are taken to stimulate change!
