Loyalty (Prod. T.U.M BEATS) LyricsVerse 1:
Bitch I'm determined and ready
I'm moving that heavyweight
Keeping that Gat super steady
I’m ready, you sweaty
You threw up like Eminem, momma's spaghetti
Got plenty of bars, rip all these verses
The purpose, I do this
Help me get through this depression
In session, a studio session
In heaven
Supplying that gas
Seven eleven
Progression, I’m making, I’ll only get better
Whatever, You haters
Serve yo ass like a waiter
And chomp yo ass, alligator
Only stay hot, like the name they equator
Grind on yo bitch, you should call me a skater
A chaser
Chasing my dream forever
Never give up that's no matter the weather
It’s raining, or snowing, push through all the pressure
I’m showing, the world, that i'm gon get the cheddar
Chorus:
Ya we making all these plays, like a quarterback
Put myself in this position, ain't no running back
On the hustle, on the grind, to secure the bag
Loyalty, we with the squad, wave yo fucking flag
Get this shit right out the mud, like I'm Kevin Gates
Always working on myself, lifting heavy weights
Keep my mental super focused, bitch I meditate
I’m smoking cookie, sipping lean, i'm bout to levitate
Verse 2:
I had to grind from the gutter, and get it my homie, I do it for cheese
Homie believe all the things that I've seen
She down on her knees
Suck me to sleep
16 and dumb, I go dumb in the party, she naughty, we popping them xannies and molly
Dreaming bout coupes and Ferrari's, Bugatti, I’m sorry, not sorry, I called up the plug for some gas
O-G and cookies we smoking on
Raw Tray, what we rolling on
Backwoods, Spend my 20's on
Backwoods, What we smoking on
I’m blowing that smoke, I might blind the view
Look out lil boy, we might come for you
Ya...
Let me switch it up...
Ya...

Fuck my demons
I kill em with this raw flow
Eyes closed
Watch them all fall, like dominos
Honestly, I just proceed in life cautiously
Feeling nauseously, when fakes in my area
Remember dawg, I may forgive but never forget
Very Select with the people in life that I wanna inject
People in life who I wanna protect

This shit is killing me
Mentally, soul, and physically
Critically, wickedly
Shaping the pain to infinity
I’ma believer
I’m Smoking reefer with the reaper
Cheating death, until there is nothing left of me
Feeding off energy
That this new sound is just giving me
Feeling me
All on my mind is the grind to stay focused
I notice you snakes so my grass I keep mowing!
Chorus:
Ya we making all these plays, like a quarterback
Put myself in this position, ain't no running back
On the hustle, on the grind, to secure the bag
Loyalty, we with the squad, wave yo fucking flag
Get this shit right out the mud, like I'm Kevin Gates
Always working on myself, lifting heavy weights
Keep my mental super focused, bitch I meditate
I’m smoking cookie, sipping lean, i'm bout to levitate
