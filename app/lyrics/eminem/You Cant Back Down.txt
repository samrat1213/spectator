â€‹bozos ðŸ¤¡ Lyrics
Goonn
It didn't work at all
Most of them are bozos
They- they knew how to manage, butâ€…theyâ€…didn't know howâ€…to do anything
And, so, wha- ifâ€…you're a great person, why do you want to work in something you can't learn anything from?
Ooh

Don't try to , it just means you don't know shit
Bozos made me can't breathe, fuck, you're a 
Bozo like smokin'  shit, you're a crackhead
Bozos talking shit 'bout me, you just wanna notice (Fuck)

Bitch gonna put this name, that's your password
They making fun of me, I go to their house and plant C4 (Bomb has been planted)
Do we got men to the ceiling
It's still time for you, you don't have no feeling

I don't know you, you don't know me
What are you supposed to be? You're weird, I don't know these
Killing fuckers in the highschool, so 
Killing bozos in combat, yeah, in my wall (Fatality)
(Yuh) You talkin' down on me, if you talk down again
2504, Joey know the name
Talking shit on Twitter, won't pull up, you lame
These lowboys ain't on shit, we are not the same
GoonnCity, yeah we goin' global
How you talkin' down on 20, bitch I'm going postal (Woah)
I don't even want the girl 'cause she a local yuh
She told me, "Pull up, you so ugh you so noble," yuh

I got your bitch on me
She said that she  oh my God
Can't wait to  get to 
 why you lacking, you love him
Fucking  portrait
You're not one of us, you're on your own, if it just happened
I say when you  it's just a fight, bro
I'm so sorry that you couldn't walk because you fought, though
And I cover in my clothes
 tryna take a photo
Hands all in my cargo

Fuck
Caught your pussy ass lacking
Ten toes, you're the body that I'm tracking
God made me so I could send you back to heaven
Killing everyone like my name Rose Aaron
 2504 
I got razor over 
I was calling all his main
I don't even know your name
And I'm alone in my coffin
Not no more
Hop in a shiny Benz
Smoking gas, you always win
Bozo bozo bozo, you don't like me
My life a motherfuh' movie, feel like Spike Lee
You  all these bands, that's so lightly
We smokin' crack, yeah,  nightly

I-I-I-I- I've been chasing the trail right around my bag
I've been at it for years, why would I go mad?
I've been fighting the brain, 
Findin' something to hate, lookin' at my 
And now they look at me and think that I'm pathetic
It's nothing new to me, it's just what I expected
I-I- I didn't bother 'cause I knew they wouldn't get it
If I was fake they wouldn't know that I was selling

A- All these, all these, all these noises will make me sick
(G- G- G- G-G-G- G-G-Goonn)
Oh you heard of SoFaygo before, yeah, everybody fucking did
Bet you want a fucking sticker, how about a round of applause?
I'ma smoke you down like a swisher 'round my head, you bitch on
Oh my God, you goin' in for my bro 21 20 10
You gon' pay for all your sins
I'm not finished with what you began
Bringing a crowbar to the streets, if you wanna test me you better win
It's GoonnCity and you can't get in
And you gon' pay for all your sins
Yuh, yuh, yuh
You took your L, now you mad
(I can't fall in sex for a taste)
And now wish you , as you fucking up the shit
I said I don't want you, so fuck the system, uh
I won't fuck for you, I'm not in love
(I can't relax,  miss now, I won't talk to em now, p-pull their face out there, wish you were 2504)

Aye, I'm with Twenty, I'm with 2504
I'm  bag on me for show
 guns in the city  popped a bitch
I would never be caught dead with a broke bitch, uh
I just left that bitch on read, I'm with Joey rockin' red
Finally just  red, and I'm geekin' off the meds
Got some likes, my bitch it's dead, I don't care about what you said
(I don't care what you said)

All your bullshit is too old
Shout out the  and we shout my bros
I gotta chick and we see on my clothes
You are the one who was talking shit for a reason I cannot disclose
I can't fuck with bozos
I  flash like a photo
Don't talk down if you can't back it up 'cause you're still in my shadow
T-Taking a flight to L.A
I'ma hop on the function 
But the  is seen around me, around me
You tellin' me that is your face
You fuckin' with me, what a shame
I don't care if they hate me, so hate me

Bro, what's up?
I'm smokin' on your pack right now and I 
Tryna play me like a bozo now I'm a star, I'm goin' up
Got some nigga mad, they typin' it up
Guess I'm two-faced, that's one  face
Fuck, guys, I'm  base
I'm cleaning with this bozo's face
I'm  clippers, ain't no fade
I'm stuck in lockdown, in yo 
I'm gon' chase you ass all day
Still young, my bitches gettin' paid
Still young, my bitches gettin' paid (Perfect)

Closed case, caught you looking both ways
You look like a dummy, you look like a birdbrain
Bitch you think you're funny
Put you in a dark place
You talk to me funny see your body as the smoke fades
You're a bozo, I can tell it from your photos
We pump you full of holes like the ozone
I swear I can't be hit like a high note
At your funeral, RIP bozo

One, two, three, four, five
She put my  on high
Like one, two, three, four, five
 back it up  (Ooh, ooh)
And when I pull that knife
Yuh, okay, o- okay
I'm just playin' (Damn)
I know that they wanna play me
I ain't playing no games
If you can't save yourself, don't save me
They just know that
And they think that they better than me
They think that they so great
If you hard to settle then  get you like a , yeah

Ooh, looks like  talking heat, but he a loser in real life
Smoking on that nigga, will you go if you find me
Bitch, you think I buy a 
You were here, but you were not
Me and 20 in the mall, if we see you, kick your bones
Bitch, your mama OnlyFans made me horny
When you  me  just like sprinkle 
Shaved pussy got me thinking about Rias Gremory
 go in her phone  she can't  Plan B

Playing , playing , all your fucking tasks
Twenty 
 I know they would be 
 on the parking, not 

Bitch gonna put this name, that's your password
Then make fun of me, I go to your house and plant C4 (Bomb has been planted)
Do we got men to the ceiling
It's still time for you, you don't have no feeling

It's not fair, I feel like glaive 
If you walk like acting sus
Then you better hide your pocket
Then I make you give me your wallet
I'm finna take your profits
Kill you with the lights off
'Cause I am impostor
I vented, took your bitch again
I was actin' very sus but she still fuck with me (Amogus)
I was actin' very sus but she don't fuck with you
Bitches on me 'cause I am so sussy, yuh (Oh)

I'm a bozo on the mic
GoonnCity, can't get in unless you fight
And we got choppas spraying and bullets let 'em fly
We here, there's nothing right
Bitch you know that we outside
If we can't take his money, bet that we gon' take his life
Yeah, we gon' do 

Twenty hit my line, he like a bozo in my sights
Time to make him fear his life
I let a bullet scratch his head like there was lice
I left him hanging onto life
I watched him bleed out in 
How you say you hardly talk shit on the live?
 someone's  body in the well
I leave him drownin', wish him well
He gon' need it where he going,  hell
Twenty hit my line, he like a bozo in my sights
Time to make him fear his life
I let a bullet scratch his head like there was lice
Twenty hit my line, he like a bozo in my sights
Time to make him fear his life
I let a bullet scratch his head like there was lice (There was lice)

I'm imposter like Among Us
Pussy why you acting so damn sus, sus
He said he in clan so I was like "Ku Klux?"
I got my magic I reeze 'em like Lucas
She said I'm cute wanna show me her boobas
Felt unsafe so I got me a shoota
She want me to sit on her gonna be a face mask
That pussy so short I put 'em in day care
Stop right there you cannot stand here
Why you venting to me?
I'm rapping like Eminem from 8 Mile
Bitch choked on my dick like Eminem from 8 Mile (Yeah)

How you talkin' shit, you ain't notice
That's a lot of shit, I don't care, I'm still rolling
Stop begging for help, but I don't care what you owe him
Stop begging for help, but it lasted, what you wanted
Yeah shoutout 25, it's a mic
It is not a must, it's a might
Like it's '87 get bite, woah
I'm looking for you
Yeah, what did I do? Like I'm doxia I hop out the roof
Fuck yeah, that was chillin for me or for you

Wherever I am I'm taking your Glocky, you take this pussy, like push in and fuck off
I got razor over my back, we going up the ladder  and that's such 
She wanna  on the top of the tower, now I can't, ready 
Touch the money, I feel like seamus
You just talking shit, fuck your friends, fuck your thoughts
And the thing is that I been cruisin', I really care 'bout the law
Most of you bitches  some main
Could we show his shit, well, you know that's a close case (Congratulations, you won!)

I heard you talkin'  on like  dying

Spin around., got  and shot
Smell like cologne, you know it's Chanel
Why you think that this 
Yeah you bozo yeah you smell
I got my money I spend it well
This bad bitch gave me 
And when I play that, hold it you little

D-Don't talk too much
Got a new  bitch don't touch
Brand new  like Cap'n Crunch
I'ma eat your legs for lunch
Boy you  like  filet
I'm finna make you fade away
I'm cruisin' wit yo' bae
Might just move out to LA

Smoking on these pussy boys like they some fucking 
And I'ma pop that ni**a  turn you into Jell-O
And I'm not your friend, lil' bro, I'm not your fucking fellow
I'm bouta melt you down like you're a fucking marshmallow

Leave your body set to rot
You can't afford what I bought
You my son, bitch I taught you
Shot you,  and I caught you
Spit it out, I chew you
Then I'm like "Who are you?"
Bitch you are a bozo, got these wrists, I'm wearing bozos
You were in your  clothes

Money like the lotto
