Overwhelmed
Overrun
Oversaturated
Overpopulated

Imagine the earth as a corpse
That commited adultery
Sustenance for its lifeforms
But turned its back on humanity

A giant flood of homo sapiens
Of every race and creed
Upon the surface - billions of ovum
By the gallons - germinate the seed

Germinate. Cultivate. Ejaculate.
Populate. Much too late. Suffocate.

Testosteronal tidal wave disperses the estrogen
As billions of sperm cells come alive on your skin
Slithering
Squirming
Exfoliating
Uprooting bacteria still alive in the pores
Embedded memories
Humans masturbating

...to no end!
Cover the world
Continue to duplicate
Multiplay and integrate
And eventually dominate
Whilst everything disintegrates
Gradually decimated
We only pretend to play dead

We come alive
We see what we want
We take it and leave
Bio-pirates on a sea of disease

Beat them, spay them, kill them
They have no right to go on
-punishment in ejaculate, humiliation immaculate
bleed them, heat them, eat them
excrete them, delete them
whatever you please, destroy it and leave

To no end 
Procreation infinitus
Hope and future diminishes

To no end 
Bastards and brainstems and reproduction
A butter knife away from becoming a twat

A giant flood of homo sapiens
Of every race and creed
Upon the surface... billions of ovum
A practiced art of breeding feces

Germinate
Cultivate
Impregnate
Populate
Saturate
Procreate
Dominate
Ejaculate to suffocate

Overwhelming
Overrunning
Oversaturation
Overpopulation

Passive ecological terrorists
Lingering
Lurking
And finally usurping

A slow global suicide just by being alive
We are all rapists and molesters in the end.
