Welcome To Hell LyricsCaught within my evil spell
Now it's time to burn in hell
You were fooled on return
You're just a doll for him to burn
See the reaper in his eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Brain washed with sin and death
Time to burn - my evil wrath
Welcome To Hell...
Bring the children down to burn
Once you fall - no return
Sin takes you by surprise
On this backwards hellbound ride
Gates of hell drawing near
Satan loves the taste of fear
Quenching all with black desire
Burn your souls in furnace fire
Welcome To Hell...
Evil spell of the dead
Messengers of your death
Falling endless in your tomb
Locked within infernal doom
See the reaper in my eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
Baking soul within your screams
Welcome To Hell...Embed
