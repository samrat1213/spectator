A sharpend sense of supreme evil
Triggered in the mind
A gruesome transformation of the body
And the soul
A dreaded life of worthlessness
Now has a new meaning
Wreak havoc like a vile wretch
Possessed until the end

Anger
Released
Torture
Returning

Sadistic embodiment
Sadistic embodiment

Spreading the corruption
Flowing is destruction
To obliterate all that is good this world

A sharpened knife to butcher people
Sitting in the hand
For gruesome transformations of
The body and the soul
There dreaded lives of worthlessness
Will have a new meaning
Wreak havoc on a vile wretch
Dissected until dead

Anger
Released
Torture
Returning

Sadistic embodiment
Sadistic embodiment

Spreading the corruption
Flowing is destruction
To obliterate all that is good in this world

You were in the way

The mutilation leads to death
Existence now irrelevant
Never will be in the way again

The mutilation leads to death
Existence now irrelevant
Never will be in the way again

Vicious
Anger
Released
Torture
Returning

Sadistic embodiment
