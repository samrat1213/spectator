In life, you're moving forward
But sometimes for the worse
Always keep a step ahead
Never in reverse
The cards are stacked against you
In everything you do
But you try to get out alive
When you don't have a clue

You always feel the tension
Breathing at your back
To be the best that you can be
To be on the attack
Kicking down the wall
And kicking your face in
Means I'm moving forward
My new life can begin

Forward march in your face
Taking back, taking place
Before you die, living fast
Take a chance, hauling ass

Never, no never, no never
Move in reverse
Here I am, I'm moving straight
Fuckin' forward, and I'm taking all
The steps to blow on right past you
I'm never gonna back down to you
And all your people who think that
You're the best, no one can
Beat you, well I've got
Some news for you, you motherfucker
There's a new man in town who isn't
Any sucker, so if you don't back
Down I'll put my bat to an
Angry motherfucker such as you

Now I'm going to wipe out
All those who say they're first
I'll be the first in line
My attitudes the worst

Because I am so spoiled
And never second best
I will leave you in the dust
And lay your ass to rest
So never underestimate
The mind of evil thoughts

I will bring you down
Spit you out before I'm caught
Because I have the power
And the upper hand
Everybody in the way
Will know that I'm the man
Forward march in your face
Taking back, taking place
Before you die, living fast
Take a chance, hauling ass

Never, no never, no never
