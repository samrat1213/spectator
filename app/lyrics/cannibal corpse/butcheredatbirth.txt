Birth is always painful
Decaying in the womb
Trapped within this body
A bleeding human tomb

Gutted bitch lies dead
Emptied of the child
Chewing on the cords
Its life line to this world
Afterbirth is flowing
The stench is overwhelming
My body, growing stronger
My pain turns to torture
Severing its bloodline
A butchered infant carcass

Meat from the unborn
The freshest kills
Chopped up children
Bathing in blood

Contorted and festering I rot in disgust
Re-generation of my body
Mother ripped apart
Smashing in her face
My knife cutting holes
Fucking her remains

Esophagus carved out
Crushing cartilage
Bile oozing from
Punctures in your liver

Ripping meat within
Chewing on intestine
Bladder spurting urine
Sight of defecation
Now grow infection
The child ripped to shreds
Drinking its excretions
Zombification

Ejaculation over mutilation
On the mother's body hacked into pieces

The sludges from my cock give her life once again
Sewing the remains of the child deep within her
Reborn through evil
My torture known throughout Hell
Heed to his calling
The demons await my next kill

Carnage is my fetish
Body cavities scraped of guts
Brains seeping from cracks
As my axe continues to hack
