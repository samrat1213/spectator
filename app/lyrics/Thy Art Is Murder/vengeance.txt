There is murder with purpose!
The desire to pull the throats
From the perverse.
Vindicated HATE!
The innocence taken
Is repaid with the blood
Of all those forsaken.

Hung from the oak.
Upside down.
He will fall to you quicker.
He is with you now.

The children never sleep.
Eyes forever awake.
Hiding secrets,
Pain and mistakes!
Hell is in their home.
Light has left their heart.
Innocence is shattered,
Souls torn apart!

I hear their cries
About the wolves in disguise,
So I'll cut out their empty hearts
And tear out their eyes!

Preying on the weak!
I'll kill your fucking breed!
Taking back the lives
Of the children that you beat!

VIOLENCE!
CAN!
BE RIGHTEOUS!
AND
VENGEANCE!
CAN!
BE PURE!
Hands designed to nurture,
Now used for torture!
THE ONLY CURE IS MURDER!
THE ONLY CURE IS MURDER!

Hung from the oak
Upside down!
He will fall to you quicker.
He is with you now!
