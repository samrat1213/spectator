Universal Funeral LyricsThe night is near, a night of Hunger
This is a funeral for the unkown
Bleak as winter, dead as the Moon
The presence of Evil lies in the air
The power of satan is everywhere
The gates to Hell are open
Hell is here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Condemned to Hell, Hell on earth
Satanic pride, Black Bestial visions
Universal Death, Total Evil
Destruction and doom
Universal Funeral.....
Heaven fall, eternal flame
Morbid lust, embrace Death - Death
I eat the flesh, I burn the skin
The ultimate pleasures of Hell
The darkest desires unleashed
Heaven fall, eternal flame
Morbid lust, embrace Death - Death
("A universal requiem, Hell is here.....")Embed
