[Verse 1]
Brainwashed into madness
Your children are killers without fear
Manipulate and dominate
Stealing their lives for your hate
Twisted perverted minds
Think as we do or you die
Demagogue, fanatical tyrant
A false prophet seething with lies

[Pre-Chorus]
I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

[Chorus]
Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

[Verse 2]
Propagation of violence
Your one god a disease upon man
Execution, crucifixion
The answer for those not in your plan
The penalty for contempt against your god
Is death and nothing else
Ignorant infidels
Are subhuman and will all burn in hell
[Pre-Chorus]
I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds

[Chorus]
Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god

[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Lee]

[Verse 3]
Smite the perverts and the obstinate
Praising the death of the free
United States of Islam
That's what you would like it to be
Violate the unbelievers
Praising crimes against man
Human rights mean nothing
Doctrine of death a scourge upon man

[Pre-Chorus]
I you fear, seeing through your lies
You I fear, raping of innocent minds
[Chorus]
Follow us blindly or die like a dog
Blood mixed with sand for this holy war
Your saviors a killer, you die for Allah
You are all children of a worthless god
