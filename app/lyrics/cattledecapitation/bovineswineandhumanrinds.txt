Deep in the butchery
Spurs a concoction of human innards
Sauteed and boiled with poultry and swine
The stench is unbearable
Twitching, severed, lifeless
To be ground into filler
Grade D yet edible
Innocent you lie-the stench wont die!
In bloody piles of swine-my god, the stench!
Blistered and cauterized-stench of burnt flesh!
Of bovine and swine-and sapien rinds
Intestines and fatty tissue swept aside, theres more
In line to die
