Time distortion, each change of events embedded to my anatomy
Observing the pure nascency of countless organic lifeforms
Foreseeing the future of this terrain
A fertile, luscious Earth now that its inhabitants have been erased

Mistaking me as a product of the divine
This is not your fault, you are not to judge
Time is the core necessity
Constant creation and massive destruction, with my manipulation here
Constant creation and massive destruction, with my manipulation here

Time distortion, each change of events embedded to my anatomy
Observing the pure nascency of countless organic lifeforms
Foreseeing the future of this terrain
A fertile, luscious Earth now that its inhabitants have been erased

Incubation process, growing humans outside of the womb
De-attached from humanity
Obscured through the growing process
This is how this world came to be

Show homage to my immemorial essence, and give in to my supreme existence
This is now the end of days
Witness the cold, empty, distant view of a disaster that flourished a new species
Witness the cold, empty, distant view of a disaster that flourished a new species

Shred the flesh of the opposers so that their blood may rain down upon me
I want to taste every bit of indecency to thee

Mistaking me as a product of the divine
This is not your fault, you are not to judge
Time is the core necessity
Constant creation and massive destruction, with my manipulation here
Constant creation and massive destruction, with my manipulation here

Time distortion, each change of events embedded to my anatomy
Observing the pure nascency of countless organic lifeforms
Foreseeing the future of this terrain
A fertile, luscious Earth now that its inhabitants have been erased

Incubation process, growing humans outside of the womb
De-attached from humanity
Obscured through the growing process
This is how this world came to be
