And I will continue to move forward,
Crushing everything.
Diamond crusher and I am the hammer.

You're worthless, not me.
Living a lie that only I can see.
You're worthless to me.
Saying that you are something you will never be.

The time is now to prove your worth.
Show the world, the world for what it's worth.

If you're reckless and free,
Speak up, sing this with me,
With me, with me;
We're all fucking free!
If you're reckless and free,
Speak up, sing this with me;
We're free, we're free,
You can't fucking stop me.

And as the world keeps moving forward,
Distorting everything.
Dream smasher.
Look to the sky and scream with me;
Fuck this place, we are free.

Your diamonds will crumble beneath my feet.
Your beliefs in God, they prove that you are weak.
And still symbolizing strength for your life choices make me sick .
I am the diamond crusher,
I am the dream smasher.

If you're reckless and free,
Speak up, sing this with me,
With me, with me;
We're all fucking free!
If you're reckless, and free,
Speak up, sing this with me;
We're free, we're free,
You can't fucking stop me.

You can't fucking stop me,
I'm relentless, you're free.
You can't fucking stop me.

I'm the diamond crusher, dream smasher.
I'm the diamond crusher, dream smasher.

You can't fucking stop me.
You can't fucking stop me.
You can't fucking stop me.
You can't fucking stop me.
You can't fucking stop me.
You can't fucking stop me.
