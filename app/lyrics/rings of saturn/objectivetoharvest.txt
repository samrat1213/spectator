Accept the serum, let it take effect
Close your eyes this will all end soon
We're here to instigate the cataclysm
With the soul objective to harvest
Defiling Earth with catastrophe
Initiating our lethal foray
Purging the existence of all species encountered

Our tactics, elaborate. Our mindset, relentless.
Spawned in this realm to demand it as our new dynasty
We will no leave until the deed is done

Our true form finally revealed
Panic ensues accept us as your new overlords
Anxiously awaiting we ingest human life forces and imitate their form

Loved ones transformed by bacterium
Faces mutating, flesh diffusing
We will suck this planet fucking dry
Devastation at its finest
Exhausting Earth's resources, watching it disintegrate behind us
Exhausting Earth's resources, watching is disintegrate behind us
