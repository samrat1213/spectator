Increasingly civilians contract the infection at an alarming rate, flooding nearest cities in a rampage to satisfy their now instinctive thirst, depopulating the human race.

A manhunt is upon us by a selective few appointed under governmental regulation,
To track and exterminate the infected in an effort to resolve their disastrous situation.

Possessing endless amounts of weaponry, authorities unleash their personal army of hired mercenaries,
Paid to wage war against an ongoing adversary.

Upon first sight of the infected, they fall victimized to gunfire.
In an emotionless disposal of life, this has become another inhumane display of execution.

Remnants of exploded skulls and floating grey matter, hundreds of bullet-filled bodies litter the streets.
The pavement's soaked red as a result of bloodshed,
Another town's left in ruin by the war against infection.
